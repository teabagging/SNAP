When I started the book, I planned to read the entire series. I was so completely let down that I don't know if I'll ever read Asimov again. Foundation simply failed to ignite any spark in my imagination. The characters are poorly developed, largely because of the huge leaps in time throughout the book. In addition, the inability of a person writing sci-fi -- which by its nature looks to the future -- to envision any role for women in that future is deplorable. I thought Asimov's work trite, boring, and completely lacking in the sort of foresight that makes books by authors like William Gibson and Tad Williams so amazingly captivating.

I was amazed not only by the sheer brillance and ingenuity of the ideas contained within it, not only by the grandiose size of the subject matter, but mostly by the writing, which I regarded as absolutely horrid. The plot is clunky, the conversations roll off the tongue like sandpaper covered in peanut butter, and the descriptions could have been written better by some obscure species of mosquito.

And Hari Seldon dies before we get to know and like him. Dull, mostly pointless conversations between people you don't know as the story jumps quickly over time ruin this book. And how lazy of Asimov to not develop his ideas. At one point he gets out of this by having a character watch a movie that we can't see which describes something that would have been interesting and clever had it been developed.I guess I'll finish the series because I've heard the other books are better.

Isaac uses this story to present his theories on how science and religion influence our society.

I found the characters to be flat and one dimensional. The story uses unrealistic plot devices. Yes I understand that it's science fiction, but I find it strains credulity to think that the characters were able to invent a religion worlds-spanning religion in 30 years. It also didn't seem very likely that a 12,000-year-old empire would so quickly crumble into the stone age (I'm exaggerating slightly). I realize that this book was written in 1951 but the high tech stuff in the story was hardly high tech back then, much less in an empire spanned the galaxy.Bottom line: not an especially great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting storyline","review":"I'm not a fan of sci-fiction, but really enjoyed it.

Since I read this epic book in eighth grade it has stuck with me due to the relation of structural decay and rebirth in a future universe that mirrors our own rather perochial existance. The serendipity and foresight combining thought and action to build a better future for mankind in the Milky Way galaxy will leave the experienced, educated readers feeling they have witnessed the true future of our reality.

Not sure ...","review":"I found the politics of this novel interesting enough to disregard the dated scientific references. Seldon and his science was fascinating to behold, and the plot was masterful. What concerned me was (dare I say it?) the fairly amateurish use of dialogue tags and the fact that each character seemed pretty much to speak with the same voice. Asimov wrote this as one of those authors who are at pains not to repeat 'he said'. So it must be a new tag each time, no matter how ridiculous, often paired with an adverb that makes you cringe: ('spluttered angrily', 'cried sternly', 'mumbled grumpily', so on.) Sad this very basic trick of writing lets down passages of vivid description and intriguing plot.Also, some things seemed implausible to me, such as: how was the foundation, which exported its technology across the galaxy, able to keep its technology secret?Nonetheless, this is a series every sci-fi fan has to read - its attributes outweigh its faults by a fair margin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not A Great Book By Any Means, But Well Written","review":"Political space tales aren't really my thing, but I must say that, politics aside, I was astonished that Asimov was so young when he wrote this. Few writers can write such good prose before middle-age. The story itself is rather mundane for a true sci-fi enthusiast. You'll not find any great discoveries by astronaut explorers or the like, but what it does do, it does well. His treatment of religion is silly though, and like most atheist writers, it's not very well thought out. I've not read anything else by him, but one hopes his later novels were better developed in that area. The mystical hints that run through nearly all of Arthur C Clarke's stories are the most intriguing thing about them. Asimov would have done well to have studied them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bor-ring!","review":"I couldn't wait to read the first of the Foundation novels, having got such great reviews, and having heard that it's been such an inspiration to so many other sci-fi authors. But I could barely finish it. The book is flat-out boring. There is no action, choosing rather to focus mostly on matters of political intrigue. If you like watching CSPAN, then you'll love this book.There is also no continuity of storyline or characters. The book constantly jumps ahead in time right about the time you've wrapped your head around the current characters and plot.It's like a set of boring short stories, loosely stitched together with an single underlying theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"what masterpiece?","review":"This seems like awfully shoddy science fiction to me. The old complaint about thin characterization isn't even the worst of it, nor are the crazy anachronisms [rampant cigar smoking, newspapers and casual misogyny]. But so much of this plot develops in the form of uninteresting local political maneuvers between slightly AynRandized heroes and buffooning villians, with no sense of place or grandeur whatsoever.The timeline of the novel is suddenly too breif after introducing the vast concept of a 40,000 year swing through history, and neither the future society Asimov has envisioned nor the apparant brilliance of the plan at the heart of this series are ever portrayed convincingly.

It's not only extremely difficult to predict the major trends, but to have his character predict such minor details as well is absurd.

Must you blame Mr. Asimov for \\"inaccuracy\\" in a time where much more mainstream sources felt that by 1980 we'd all be zipping around in flying bubble cars? Obviously you missed the point here. The Foundation series is about our own humanity, not about where we will be technologically in the year 15000. No, I can't prove that there could actually be a Mule, but why waste your time trying to? The Mule is probably one of the best literary constructs to grace the world of science fiction, one that isn't decked out in gadgets and laser beams. There's something to be said about a writer that can make a sci-fi villian without resorting to hi-tech hijinks. You didn't like the Mule? Well tough luck and go back to reading your Star Trek novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I really liked this book,especially the fact [SLIGHT SPIOLER] That you get to see different people's perspectives at different periods of time.

This lets Asimov flesh out the stories more, adding detail and plot intricacies. The first story, The Big and The Little, is not one of the series' strongest. However, the second story, The Mule, is the masterpiece of the series. It tells of a muntant, The Mule, who falls outside the scope of Hari Seldon's psychohistory as one supremely powerful individual. The story is told in almost detective story fashion similar to the first two Robot novels. It's quite as suspenseful and involving as Asimov at his best and one of his utmost classics. There's quite a lot of plot tangling and twists, and the ending is a shocker. It's not quite a cliffhanger but will definitely make you want to read the next book, which is great also. The whole series comes highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going deeper","review":"I read this book after coming blind to the foundation books - I've never read Asimov in a novel before. I've noted how Asimov, when writing the books, was very much a part of his time. When a character doesn't smoke, it is a character trait to point out where everyone else smokes by course. Also, sexism is taken for granted, and when a female character assumes to be treated with equal rights it is a place for comment. I had hoped that we would have found better ways to get high and allowed more equality that far into the future, but I suppose smoke 'em if you got 'em.Anyways, I like this book better than the previous one because there are characters that you can root for and unexpected jerks in the plot-line and a more linear narrative based on the fact that a lot of the exposition is out of the way from the first book. I now cannot wait for the finale of the original series and debate weather to read the other three ancillary books that Asimov wrote later."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Zenith of Asimov!","review":"I highly recommend the time to read \\"Foundation\\"...it just may convince you to continue on with the rest of the series. I believe it was the forerunner and main idea behind the concept of a galactic empire as has been expanded on by Star Wars and Star Trek. If you would like to see the genesis of the idea behind those phenomena then you'll very much be rewarded by reading the Foundation series...besides, anything by Asimov is worth its weight in gold and this is the zenith of his space operatic writings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading can seldom be this much fun!","review":"Foundation is a great book to read. The Foundation trilogy is a great series to read. That being said, there are little elements within the story that date some of the points of reference Asimov ascribes to his characters, but it's actually charming to read the references to 'atomics', etc. Asimov is a master at story-telling, and this series certainly helped to cement his reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused about \\"classic\\" status","review":"Just writing this to provide moral support for anyone who reads this book and is thoroughly underwhelmed.Asimov's prose is clean but his tone seems uneven in this installment, as opposed to the tighter first book.The book is essentially two disconnected adventures... not very appealing.There's a female character in the second adventure that's quite problematic; she's dull, and Asimov spends a lot of time and effort on the fact that she's (gasp) not male.Finally, this series feels very dated, in terms of language, attitudes, and even vision of the future. \\"Nuclear\\" is the buzzword; everything's like the '50s, but nuclear-powered.I liked Foundation but Foundation & Empire tends to wander away from the idea of the Foundation as the main character, and instead can't seem to decide whether to focus on galactic-level events or protagonists.

Later in his career Asimov fixed these problems *somewhat*, but at this point he was very young and they are present in full force. The unfortunate truth is that this book simply doesn't deserve the praise heaped upon it; it's some kind of herd mentality that leads to so many people venerating Foundation.

Asimov's Robot series was better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahead Of His Time.","review":"The foundation is setup to secretly monitor mankind through its darkest hours. It reminded me a little of Orwell's 1984. In placing humans away from the central government on a planet with few resources. They are forced to develop quickly. This is a novel more about political machinations than about action. The contradictions in human nature are here to analyze. The characters use guile, spirit, & cunning to survive. Some 80% of the book is dialogue & the character development is a bit shallow. Nonetheless, Mr. Asimov portrays the future in poignant & diverse ways. The predicted conflict makes the story of galactic history entertaining, especially since this was written in 1951. Some 7 years before Sputnik was launched. The author deserves praise for his imagination that was well ahead of his time."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS ONE IS GREAT BUT DEPENDS UPON YOUR TASTE","review":"I personally enjoyed ever word of this particular work. Many other reviewers have gone into the plot, etc. so I will not do so here to any depth. This is one of those works of SiFi that will appeal to certain taste, while others may find it not to their liking. There is a great deal of politics (almost Pre WWI European) involved in the story line. As the story covers (all books included) over one thousand years, there are many, many characters to track and keep track of. This is indeed a series of short stories, all linked. I personally enjoy this sort of thing but can see where some might not. That being said, it, the book, can certainly be regarded as a classic in this particular genre and certainly should be read by any student of such. You certainly cannot fault the author's story telling ability and imagination. I enjoyed this one a lot and do highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very well writen, exciting book about a possible future of","review":"This book, the first in a series, is all about the origination of the Foundation, an orginization based on the idea to shorten the period of decay of the galactic Empire. Everyone who likes Prelude to Foundation MUST read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for any Age","review":"I certainly do not sound quite as intellectual as other people who have reviewed this novel. All I have to say is that I found this book extremely interesting and thrilling. When my teacher recommended this book to me, I was skeptical, however, Foundation turned out to be one of the best books I ever read and I can't wait to read the other ones. Psychohistory and Hari Seldon rock! Whoever doesn't read this book is missing out on one of the best ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good lead-in, but the series gets better","review":"(If Amazon allowed fractional reviews, I would have given 3.5) While I enjoyed \\"Foundation\\" and found some of the concepts intriguing, it seems that Asimov had a lot of maturing to do as a writer at this point. The characters don't seem to really reach me the way they should, but one has to bear in mind that this book is actually a collection of shorter stories published in serial format, and the writer could not be bothered too much with deep character development. I still reccomend this book, in part because it leads into the rest of the series, which tends to improve stylistically as the books advance. However overrated \\"Foundation\\" may be, it firmly holds ground simply because it is so integral to the foundation trilogy and subsequent additions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Future and Past of the Human Civilization: a Epic Story","review":"Before \\"Foundation\\" i'd read somes short-storys from Asimov, so i become insterested in his style. And what can i say now about this book? Really is a excelent piece of scifiction: Asimov united 4 independent stories in a book with lifely descriptions, a strong main-story and credibles characters in incredibles situations,...the result is just epic. So, with this book we become in eyewitness on the monumental development and fall of the human civilization... becoming it in a surrounding journey trought our future and past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent unless you are looking for Star Wars","review":"This book is a highly cereberal study of history. I you want a lot of action look somewhere else. (I suggest David Drake or S.M. Sterling) If you want something to ponder this is the book. Asimov's ideas have been borrowed by other works so some of it will not seem new. The science is somewhat dated (nucleur light bulbs and economical transmutation). This book does give an excellent veiw of the forces of history. If you want to understand what causes nations to fall read this book. Just don't expect Star Wars style entertaiment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good novel, but the other books in the series are better.","review":"Foundation is a good book, but is only a must read because the 2 books, Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth, are must-reads. It's a shame that few lists of his books include Foundation and Earth, but if you like science fiction, that is the best novel ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this book","review":"Get this book! One thing that may help is that the farsighted hero, Hari Seldon, sets up a plan that supposedly needs no individuals to make it work, forces of humanity and all that, but the stories repeatedly show the importance of individuals. If you know this ahead of time, you will appreciate each story even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent stepping stone to world of SF!","review":"Folks, till foundation happened to me, I had for some inexplicable reasons never got introduced to world of science fiction (SF).(unless you call hitchhikers guide to galaxy as one) Based on influence of the die hard coterie of Asimov's fans, I decided to start my journey with Foundation...........and I have really found it cool stuff............worth reading and excellent investment of time..........since it rejuvenates you with fascinating ideas and terrific narrative. Looking forward to picking up the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"I hadn't read this since I was a teenager.

I've probably read it a dozen times by now. The plot is extremely good. The outcomes of every event (since the group leaves Trantor) are surprising, the way the main heroes solve the problems are exciting and satisfying (to me at least). The good amount of dialogues keeps the book from becoming boring and overly descriptive.Asimov's imagination is as yet unsurpassed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Science Fiction Masterpiece","review":"Besides his Robot stories and novels, Foundation stands as oneof the greatest science fiction novel written by the late IsaacAsimov.By mixing properly the future, humanity and the sociopoliticaldevelopment of our race on a galactic span using the decline ofthe Roman Empire as a base, Asimov tells us a story of one man'sstruggle and the product of its stubborness in following stories.This book is a must for anyone, genre fan or not, I guaranteeyou will read it more than once in your lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the finest sci fi series of all time","review":"In reviewing the book Foundation I am recommending that you read all of the Foundation books by Asimov. Just get started and read them all. Even though each book can be read individually, do yourself a favor and read them in order. I won't be reviewing any other books in the series. I want you to do the whole series.One of the most interesting ideas that Asimov gives us is the ultimate form of self defense. No, it isn't karate or jiu jitsu, boxing or wrestling. It's touching the other person's mind.There are enough circles within circles, things that aren't what they seem to be, surprises that put the theories into a cocked hat, to keep you on your toes.Don't deprive yourself of the best sci fi series ever written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book by Asimov (fiction)","review":"I have read almost all of Asimov's fiction, and this book is by far one of the best.

The first book was required reading for a college SciFi literature course and I liked it so much I read the other two. They were my introduction to Isaac Asimov. Grand in its sweep, Foundation explores societal disintegration and renaissance. The trilogy is dated; Asimov wrote it before the computer revolution. However, it still holds up amazingly well.Asimov was regarded as one of the greatest explainers of everything. He richly deserved the accolade. For someone who hasn't read him before, Foundation is a wonderful introduction. You'll read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foundation and the complete series","review":"Couldn't put any of the books in this series down.

First two I read about ten years ago, when my English hasn't been that matured, so after reading the book in original, I immediately found a copy in my native language. Now I decided to read the whole saga and of course started from the very beginning.Just as addictive as before. And with fair certainty I can say that this is the saga that has inspired George Lucas or whoever he took his ideas from. And yet it all started with \\"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\\"..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psycohistory","review":"When you foretell the decline of a galactic empire, you don't make many friends. But Seldon manages to keep what he finds low key and sets into motion a series of events that will lessen, not stop, the ravages that are to come.A great sci-fi classic. One of the best from an all time master of the genre. When I was younger I tried to track down every book he ever wrote. Think I got all the Tales from the Black Widows, but am not sure.Any lover of Sci-fi will find this not only exciting, but intelectually stimimulating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true Science Fiction Master!","review":"As well as a trilogy that is as far-reaching as it is set in a far-distant time with characters and galactic backdrop unrivaled by any other book. Definitely one of the great science-fiction classics just like \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\", \\"Childhood's End\\", along with modern-day cyberpunk like \\"Neuromancer\\", \\"Count Zero\\", \\"Prey\\", \\"Cryptonomicon\\", \\"Snow Crash\\", \\"Darkeye: Cyber-Hunter\\", etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foundation is a good read for all readers especially scfi fans","review":"Foundation is not easy to read since most of it is politics in the Foundation Universe. It follows the plot very closely but still keeps the scifi element with things like space travel and intergalactic empires.When I read it I found the religious aspect interesting. The main characters were either scholars, politicians, or interstellar traders, and there were a lot of cloak & dagger type situations. Something I found interesting was that women didn't really play any roles until the last part of the book. It's kinda funny to see this Emerald City (Terminus) in the middle of these warring kingdoms who think they have the upper hand. The use of nuclear power as the ultimate source of energy is a important aspect in the book. If you like lots lots of action, then this book isn't for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Asimov read !!!!!!","review":"I can't say enough about this book, weather you like SF or not this book is a MUST READ!!! It's more about people/civilizations/political systems than SF but either way I highly recommend it.As for SF it is simply the best SF book ever written!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my style","review":"The book covers several generations, so with each generation you have to re-learn all the characters.

I didn't read the whole series because of this -- it was obnoxious."},{"rating":"1","title":"first but not the best","review":"No judgement againt asimov as a sci fi innovator, but i did not find the story telling to be very enthralling and felt almost no emotional connection to the series of characters introduced over large jumps in time.The method for introducing new twists or skipping decades by introducing fake abreviated \\"encyclopedia galactica\\" entries was awkward and rough."},{"rating":"1","title":"letdown after the first book","review":"I realize I'm in the minority compared to the other reviews but I don't feel this book is even close to being half as good as the first foundation book.

As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, the writing style is of a very poor quality indeed. It is not only very dull and dry, but it is also totally lacking in any kind of style or art. The dialogue is simply dreadful, the character development is nonexistent, and the story is pointless and not at all well structured. The fact that this alleged \\"novel\\" is really a collection of short stories is readily apparent, as there is no cohesion and very poor correlation between sections. This is not memorable writing in any way and it has no redeeming qualities as a work of literature. In fact, the only time I should ever like to mention it again is as an example of poor writing, atrocious story-telling, and science-fiction that is totally wanting for any kind of inspiration. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Example of What is \\"Classically\\" Wrong with SciFi.","review":"I only recently read this so called masterpiece.

No characters, no science, no mystery (who couln't figure out the identitiy of the Mule?). In addition the story is basically one of the collapse of the Roman Empire. It probably could have been rewritten replacing historical language instead of spacefare and it would not have mattered in the slightest. The only science fictional element was Psychohistory which is not developed at all due to the nature of the plot. If this is a classic, I shall stick to more obscure and worthwhile reads.

My advice to any jazz fan is to BUY IT! There's not a better example of original West Coast Cool out there. The arrangements are interesting and varied... the section and solo work fabulous. My only (tiny) objection is that I wish there were a few jazz Standards included. But that aside, it's still a wonderful addition to anyone's collection and a MUST HAVE if you're into WCJ.

But it is just a waist of time to watch this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drawn out","review":"After reading the reviews I was excited to watch this film. I found the plot to be very drawn out, predictable, and somewhat dull. I would recommend watching this if you have 2 hours of your life that you don't mind squandering and don't care if you come away from that wasted time with nothing to show for it. Enjoy the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good acting but plot is stupid and it is not in any sense likable.","review":"I usually like Nicolas Cages' work. He's a fine actor. However, his acting just couldn't save this rather stupid 2009 film in which he is cast as a drug addicted detective in post-Katrina New Orleans. No doubt he has a complicated life. His girlfriend is a prostitute, his father is a recovering alcoholic and his father's wife likes to drink a whole lot of beer. His world is one of drug addiction and corruption and there's not a single character that is in any sense likable. To top this all off, it is so boring that I fell asleep. Definitely not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooooring","review":"Alright, this movie is boring. I watched it hoping that it would get better and it didn't.

The drug use and plot line was, at times, absurd. I wish I hadn't wasted my $ renting this b/c it just wasn't worth it. The director's failed attempts at being \\"artsy\\" with the alligator, iguanas and the like was obvious and remedial and any action to be David LynchY was lost on practically anyone except perhaps the director.As you may surmise, this won't be one in my permanent library."},{"rating":"1","title":"trying hard but fail to impress","review":"If you want to watch this, the better option is to rent it. It has nothing to do with the original. It stands on its own. Between the coke-takings and the iguanas and the alligators, there's not enough punch to make this film emerges as a great film to be bought and re-watch again in my book. There were a lot of potentials, but the director takes the easy way out with an already thin plot. Nicholas Cage was ok, too bad Fairuza Balk had only 2 scenes. Eva Mendes and Val Kilmer's talents were wasted. Just everage to such a promising start of a might-be-an-awesome film. Just ok, but not memorable at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it a zero if it would let me","review":"Total trash, not worth the dvd it's written on.

Say whatever the other reviewers want, but I hated this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drowning at midnight","review":"I enjoyed this. Get to see N Cage in a role where he can wallow in his manic phase shtick...a wonderful diversion from typical film normalacy. He starts off living in a nightmare, and somehow dives deeper and deeper into an overwhelming whirlpool of desperation and threat. It all takes place in New Orleans, a city where dissipation is a career. During the lowest part of Cage's crash dive, Herzog includes some bizarre shots of alligators and iguanas. Disconcerting, but an interesting visual evocative of his mindset at the moment. This film is a mesmerizing ride to hell, with Cage as the perfect conductor. There is a light at the end of all this, preventing this film from existing only as a compleat downer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"It's just an awful movie. It's not quite as bad as 'Eye of The Beholder' starring Ewan McGregor, but pretty close. Awful acting by Kilmer, Mendez, and Cage.

Save yourself a couple of hours of your life and watch paint dry or something along those lines and you'll be better off for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Bad","review":"Begs comparisons to Keitel's original and fails on every level. It never creates sympathy for the gritty immoral world this cardboard cutout inhabits. It's easily Cage's worst performance and the all time worst use of music in a drama ever.

I just could not watch any more. Cage runs around in a badly cut suit, his head turned at an angle as if he can't hear the director, and there is no discernible plot or purpose. We don't notice Cage's bad acting the way we did in Wicker Man, because all the rest of the actors are so bad Cage does not stand out. One good thing about the movie is, Cage plays a coke addict. The bad thing about it is, he didn't OD and give us all a break.We can give this one a pass, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad Movie","review":"Till now I've never seen a bad Nicolas Cage movie, this would be the first.

I found the music to be refreshing and beautiful and, despite what other reviews have said, found the musicians to be quite talented. It's a good CD to relax to, have a dinner party to, et cetera.

It's so bad I was compelled to log onto this website just to see if I could get my money back. I see the quartet doesn't even have a name -- I can understand why. It's advertised as just \\"The String Quartet Tribute to R.E.M.\\" and it lists the players. Maybe someone else could do better, but I doubt it, as the arrangements are bad too.

On previous 2 Unlimited tracks Ray & Anita wrote most lyrics and sung well. On \\"Wanna Get Up\\" vocals are written by other producers. Struggling to make the song good, on many European charts it never made it into the top five. The single includes three remixes, the \\"SASH! Extended Edit\\" is the best remix, and song, which give the single the two of five stars. It is better than the original version.

Originally a mid-season replacement, Three's Company became such a bona fide (and can you believe?) controversial show that ABC ordered up a full second season.

The landlord, Mr. Roper, won't allow a man to live with two women. The solution? Tell him Jack pitches for the other team. The show is heavy on farce (A light dramatic work in which highly improbable plot situations, exaggerated characters, and often slapstick elements are used for humorous effect) and John Ritter's Jack is the highlight with his physical comedy. The show went on to last eight years and inspired two spin-offs: \\"The Ropers\\" and \\"Three's a Crowd.\\" There is a reason this show has lasted so long on syndication.

The on-going joke that the landlord thinks that Jack is gay. In the first three seasons, the landlords are an older couple named The Ropers.

Saw this and looked like a good idea.These are really three separate tatami mats, each about 11\\" wide by about 6' in length, joined by a blue canvas strip that runs the full length (top to bottom). It is colorful and handy, folding up in to object about the size of a large book with handles.Problem I ran into was that the strip joining two of the panels ripped apart first time I took it to the beach, rendering it useless for its intended purpose. Perhaps mine was just a bad sample but at $10 a throw, I will be asking for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not of good quality!","review":"In the picture it seems bright, cool, So I ordered!

That said, picture quality is fab. I use mine mostly for scenics, not talking heads, so a music track takes care of the noise. Interface with my Mac is on a kindergarten level.

I went on-line and found that this is common with this camera for some reason. I was able to prevent major problems by removing the tape after each use, but that no longer works. Now I cannot record or watch any tape without it forcing me to remove the cassette. I was very fond of this camera until it stopped working. I am very disappointed that I will now have to buy a new camcorder (a local repairman estimated over $200 to fix it).

Loaded with all the features you could ever want: plenty of optical zoom, digital stabilizer, very compact size, reasonable warranty, and good looks too.BUT...this camera has a VERY annoying buzzing/humming sound to it. I called Canon and they said it's \\"normal for that unit.\\" Excuse me?Maybe for some people, the buzz is not annoying. But compared to my cheap, old 8mm, this is much, much noisier.

I had the camera just over two years when this happened. Luckily I purchased an extended warranty at Best Buy. Best Buy sent the camera to Canon for repair. Canon would not repair it because it would be too expensive so, Best Buy gave me a new camera.

I have been using it quite regularly. then all of a sudden I cannot load new or old mini DV cassettes. The moment I load a cassette, a message flashes on the screen 'REMOVE TAPE' and beeping sound is generated together with a flashing 'EJECT' message. Next step, I ship this to the Canon Factory service in NJ. They replied with an estimate of $160(on top of the $654 I pad for this!!).Also most importantly when I shipped from the Fedex office in Boston, the Fedex person made a remark that she has been seeing quite a number of the Canon camcorders going to NJ for repairs.To sum, I think this is a racket Canon has devised to rip off customers.So beware when you buy a Canon camcorder, ask the retailer about the tape loading mechanism, and if they have any maintenance plans that will repair it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera","review":"This is a very easy to use camera with excellent video.

The still pictures are good for the internet but are not good enough quality to use as a regular camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not good enough","review":"This camcorder is good enough for me except for one thing: if you are going to need a light or external microphone you should get the ZR50MC because of its advanced accessory shoe. The lights and microphones that I can find are designed for the advanced accessory shoe. The built-in microphone is too sensitive to use in many cases because it even picks up the sound when I tap the handle of my tripod lightly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remove the cassetter problem...again","review":"As with others, this was a great camera until the remove cassette problem appeared 8 months ago.

Gainsbourg can't sing a lick. She makes people like Britney Spears, Jessical Simpson & Janet Jackson sound like Beverly Sills or Marilyn Horne. The producers must recognize this too, because her voice is mixed very low on most of the tracks. On top of not being able to sing, she doesn't compose and doesn't play an instrument. So why is there a CD bearing her name? You got me. Maybe cashing in on daddy's renown? The botton line is don't waste your money.

It's like a tribute to bad... BAD... 80's music. Not to bash on the people who actually like this CD but if you listen to Counterfeit first and then go to this one... you will be very dissapointed.

Mambo fans will actually enoy it, as well as the Andean flute/guitar instrumental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mean Guns Doesn't Mean Any Good","review":"This film is a travesty of the action-adventure genre. First off, the plot is illogical and absurd even if it might be a policeman's dream: all the major criminals around congregate at a prison and kill each other in one enormous shootout. That essentially is the plot of the movie.Adding to the \\"fun\\" is excruciating, repetitive dialogue where the major characters attempt to bare their souls. At the end of these long-winded discourses, one fervently wishes these characters to be brutally killed for being so insufferably boring and pretentious.Oh yes, how can one forget the equally irratating mambo-inflected film score which blares loudly. and repetitively, over the soundtrack?

This isn't a great film, it isn't even really a good film, but it can be entertaining if you like violence and mambo.The story behind the movie is weak at best and the cast (consisting mostly of Ice-T and Christopher Lambert) really doesn't do much to improve the film. There are some interesting action moments, all to the beat of Mambo music.If you can find it for a cheap price I'd suggest it, but I wouldn't pay any more than a couple of bucks for this film. Of course if you're a diehard Christopher Lambert fan or if you really love Mambo and Violence, this might be something you want to invest in."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very strange and bad movie","review":"Albert Pyun has his own way of making films. He is responsible for \\"Omega Doom\\" and \\"Crazy Six\\", two movies that in spite of having quite different plots, possess in common the peculiar and curious way with which the director accomplishes his works. \\"Mean Guns\\" follows the Pyun's formula: many shootings and closes in slow motion,different and weird camera moviments, strange characters and a poor script. In this film, Lambert is a murderer who,along with other criminals, is trapped inside a prison and he needs to survive before his chances drain. Pyun substitutes idea and good-sense for excellent action scenes, that remind plenty of John Woo and Sam Peckinpah's best efforts. Unhappily, that is not enough to maintain the interest for this bad film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely UNREVISED AND OUTDATED!","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I have found shop set up for effecient layout and dust collection to be the most important aspects of my woodworking. I am always looking for new and innovative ways to be as effecient and effective in these areas. I could find no difference in this book and the earlier version it replaces. Even the photos are same outdated photos that appear to be taken in the late 70's used in the 2001 release. Please, Taunton, don't insult your readers by continuing to regurgitate the same information with a shiny new label in an attempt to sell more books. Please strive to produce new and relevant photos and information. Your books and magazines are already some of the most expensive, it would be nice if the quality matched."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK if you have an unlimited budget and dream","review":"Lots of great ideas for those with unlimited budgets. Many of the suggestions are not within the economic means for those thinking about setting up a shop; although the author includes many photo's for the \\"Dream\\" shop. Most references to tools include equipment that costs $1,000's (or more!). Lot's of fluff from the author and plentiful color photos of shop layouts, tools, and equipment that the average \\"Joe\\" would spend decades purchasing. Not too much \\"practical\\" information about \\"The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop\\". Definately a dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lovely book, but short on specifics.","review":"This is a beautiful book and terrific fun for a woodworker to read for enjoyment, but it's short on specific solutions. Attempting to be all things to all woodworkers, it is of little value to anyone--except to spark the imagination. The best part of the book are the beautiful photos that peek inside the workshops of great artisans around the country. But if you seek step-by-step advice, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and informative","review":"This is a very clear, thorough, well-written book. It details many aspects of setting up a small wood shop, from layout to electrical work to insulation and soundproofing. The author also talks about what tools to select and suggests a priority order for people who cannot get all they want at once. It is an excellent source of information for anyone from hobbyists to beginning professionals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packed with info","review":"I was looking for a book about the shop space itself, and this was right on the money. There one chapter on general tools that one would need, but that's it. The rest is dedicated to preparing a space for a woodshop. There is a lot of attention paid to outbuilding-type 'dream' shops most of us will never have, but electricity, surface treatment, storage, etc. are all still applicable. Every chapter is a reference itself. The table of contents is clear and makes it easy to find what you may be interested in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful eye candy...","review":"Yep, there are a lot of \\"dream shops\\" in this book. But ton's of ideas for those of us that are \\"monitarilly challenged\\". I found a lot of good ideas for storage and space utilization from the pictures and text. Admittedly the most of the shop layouts will not work for me, but I can sure use bits and pieces. I didn't buy this book, got it at the library, but I believe I will buy it just as a reference for ideas. Recommend it highly for just this reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Fairly poor. Lots of photos of badly set up shops, and ego-stroking of the shop owners, but no guidance on how to lay out a shop well."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak advice","review":"The best thing I found in this book is the picture on the cover. Well, actually the uncropped version in chapter 5. Beyond that, I found everything else to be non-practical from a design perspective. A photo of a filthy dust collector area when discussing the advantages of central collection or electrical wiring that would never pass inspection is typical. I'd rather see plan views of real shops that work with reasons for the decisions made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly Sanders Best","review":"It took a while to get into this cd. Though I often admire Bill Laswell, sessions that he produces are often terribly uneven (except Sharrock's Ask the Ages where he basically lets the music do the talking). The title track starts with an \\"ambient\\" percussion section that makes you want to say \\"laswell is a genius.\\" This is followed by an \\"afro-pop\\" song/rap that makes you want to say \\"why does Laswell have to mess with everything.\\" The problem today is, everybody thinks you have to fill up a whole CD with music. Try programing this disc without the \\"smooth jazz\\" Midnight in berkely and the title track and I believe you will find this could have been Pharoah's best album and it still clocks in at about 50 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This is a great CD.

I mean, this man has played with Coltrane and obviously he didn't get it. Dont buy this cd, its popular music in its worst sense. Instead you should buy a record with John Coltrane. In his latet period he is in to the same themes as Sanders but shows that this doesnt necessarily lead to kitsch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"I was highly disappointed with this cd. Perhaps I expected more of the Kharma era Sanders or any of his early 70's releases. Anyhow I've always experienced Sanders as somewhat of a self indulgent artist even on his best records and in fact some of his best playing really is on other peoples records so in some ways I'm not all that shocked at the medocrity of this cd. The music is bland, overwrought and trite somewhat similiar to any of the faceless and equally uninspired New Age releases that you might stumble upon. This cd should be avoided and if you want to here some more current Sanders check out Sonny Sharrocks album \\"Ask The Ages\\" that features Sanders without the pretension and self importance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"I have always had trouble finding the perfect toner for my skin type. I have oily skin but it is also extremely sensitve to burning and tingly toners that contain alcohol in the ingredients. I have tried a lot of toners, and this is truly one of the best ones I have ever used IMO. It is very gentle and does not produce a burning or tingly sensation after application.

Why, you ask?

I have already imported Alice In Wonderland and Iron Man 2 from Amazon.com because the locals tried to force me to buy a DVD. So when the UK Amazon offers Mad Max and Escape From New York without force-fed DVDs, guess who is getting my money?DVD is dead. Face up to it.

The camera work is outstanding the way they follow the motorcycle in one scene is really a rush just watching it. It opens up with action and gives you just enough to make it a really good movie.One of the MANY reasons I love this movie is the hero. I watch a lot of kungfu, and this type of storyline for mel is kungfu at it's finest. He really reminded me of a guy like Jimmy Wang Yu or even one of my favorites Chen Kwan Tai(baddie from crippled avengers). Mel plays the role just as good as any of them and maybe better.The commentary is also listenable and a pretty good making of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mad Max to the Max! Well, almost.","review":"What can I say. This movie ROCKS BIG! It is full of fighting, bad words, threats, cool heroes, evil villains, and everything else that makes an action movie good. Like guns, bladed weapons and determination. It follows a man who means to stop criminals and terrorists in similar ways to the Punisher. It has cool quotes and good graphics for a 70's movie, and I liked it a lot so I am looking forward to the sequels, Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome. If you like bang em up movies with morals, see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cult classic...","review":"There is no doubt that this is a cult classic, and there is plenty of reason for it to stay that way. Overall, it was predictable and somewhat lacking in screen presence. I can't really put my finger on what it is that makes the film worth the purchase, but I will admit that it is an interesting example of Australian movie making in the 70's.The story line is somewhat disturbed and there are significant reasons to not allow children to watch this, and really, there is little reason for me to suggest that anyone not completely bored with other avenues of moviemaking watch it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LIKE TURTLES","review":"I LIKE TURTLES.

Mad Max managed to make a virtue of its modest budget, with some startling, influential stunt work and array of weird and surreal characters. Mel Gibson is perfect in the role of the idealistic young cop who feels that he is slowly becoming dehumanised by the brutality he is embroiled with on a daily basis. He quits the force and takes off with his family to try and escape from the madness and decay that is nearing fever pitch. However when his family are killed by a gang of marauding bikers, Max becomes the very thing he was trying to avoid, a broken, monoslylabic, avenging angel in souped up pursuit car. Very much a character in the vain of Clint Eastwood's man with no name from the spaghetti westerns, Max is a brooding, intense man with a capacity for terrible violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - badly dubbed dvd","review":"Prospective purchasers should note that this dvd is the dubbed version where American actors replace the Australian actors on the soundtrack. I understand that the decision to overdub the part was done when the movie was first released in the US (an Australian friend recalled his shock at the dubbing when he saw it in a US cinema at the time) but I would have thought that the studio could have dug up the original Australian version and released that instead. Because of this irritating and pointless feature of an otherwise fine movie (the best of the Mad Max series), I can only rate the dvd 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Special Edition has arrived - BUY IT NOW!","review":"This review refers to the new Special Edition DVD that has just been released.Both widescreen and full screen versions are included, but more importantly, the original Australian dialogue has finally been restored. The difference between that and the clunky, awkward American-dubbed audio most of us are familiar with is like night and day (and if you want to find out for yourself, both are included on the disc, so feel free to compare).Rounding out the package is a making-of featurette, several trailers, and a \\"pop-up video\\" style subtitles-option which presents various minutea about the film and its locations while you watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mad Max (Special Edition)","review":"I won't go into a review of the movie itself as there are many on here already.

For those of you looking for it, yes, this has the original Australian audio. It also happensto have the English dubbed version, just so you can remember what it was like being little and watching this on TV for the first time. Plenty ofextras and great quality, this made for an excellent 'guys night'.One thing I never really figured out about these movies... Mad Max doesn't really seem especially... mad.

For some absurd reason those who put out this DVD decided to dub the original \\"Australian\\" into American English. What an insult. Really, how dumb do they think we are?2. Interesting that while in the popular imagination the Mad Max paradigm has come to mean post-Apocalyptic chaos, in this first one, the world is more or less as normal as the Apocalypse hasn't occurred yet.3.

After a pursuit of Max's ends in a fiery crash, killing the pursued (a biker named Nightrider), he is targeted by motor-terrorists for the death of their fellow gang member. When Max goes on a vacation trip with his wife and their infant son, they are attacked by the malicious, vengeful mob, leaving Max a childless widower hungry for his own violent revenge--and that's exactly what he gets.

It's an unintelligible, incoherent, impenitrable story that makes absoloutley no sense and goes from nowhere to nothing. Each scene seems to have nothing to do with the one before or after it.

Gangs of bikers and kamikaze lunatics roam the long stretches of road that populate the stretch of land known as the Austrailian outback. Mel Gibson soars as the tough futuristic cop Mad Max in this extreme action thriller that started it all. Amazing non-computerized stunts make this movie a treat to watch over and over again. After his wife is brutally murdered by an evil group of bikers, Max sets out on a crazed revenge, earning his heading \\"Mad\\".

It seems stupid that we can only get Mad Max 2 and 3 on DVD in Australia and not Mad Max 1 (which is only available on Video). So, because of this I bought Mad Max 1 (The U.S Version DVD) through Amazon which has the American voices dubbed over the original sound track (which I didn't know at the time). Me being Australian and having watched the original, I found the U.S version very disappointing.

I think the dubbing and the orchestrated soundtrack actually ADDS to the 'alien' feel of the movie. We are watching cultural shock where ANYTHING goes, and it keeps you on edge throughout the movie.

But the seeking revenge part is just about 4 or 5 scenes towards the end of the movie!

He changes into four animals and he turns invisible by Merlin, Warts tutor. The adventures he goes on are amazing. He goes to a giants castle and goes to Morgan le Fay's castle to rescue Friar Tuck. Coming out they had to fight big bird-lion things. The book had no real conflicts.I don't really like reading, but this book is interesting. If you like fantasies then you would like this book.

I might have given T.H. White a little more credit had this been entirely his creation, but he didn't make up the story; it's an Arthurian Legend (obviously).

Then-- ONE DAY -- it hits you, the genius behind the songs, the hidden melodies, the amazing musicianship?That was my experience with this album. It took 2 years of (very) sporadic listenings to suddenly be hit in the head with just how flat-out AMAZING this album is. A few songs are easy and accessible (ie. \\"Captain Easychord\\"), while others may take a few listens to *really* appreciate--- but it's worth the effort. (as a comparison, I found \\"Margerine Eclipse\\" very easy to get-into, while it took a while for \\"Dots & Loops\\" and \\"Cobra & Phases\\" to really sink-in).Very highly recommended, once it hits you, it will stay with you and grow-stronger with repeat-listens."},{"rating":"2","title":"A complex, multi-layered masterpiece","review":"Unlike Dots and Loops, Sound Dust doesn't reach out and grab you at first.

I really like Martin Short, but didn't think he was very funny in this. It was a little corny. I also thought that it was going to be more of a musical, but there was very little singing, so I was disappointed in that. I also didn't like the moral behind the plot, of the wish itself--getting the little girls dad the role in the play--by using any means to sabbotage the character who had the role. I don't think that's a good message for kids, even if the methods used are done by fairy godmothers. I know a lot of shows do that, like Bruce Almighty, but in even that show, in the end he gave the newscaster's job back to the character that he stole it from.

Quite dissapointing.You do get to see Martin Short in a most unusual role, and I'd consider this a must-see for any admirer of his antics. Robert Pastorelli (the crazed painter from Murphy Brown) plays a rather lackluster role. Kathleen Turner pulled off the typical \\"Evil Witch\\" role a little too well. Mara Wilson seemed to do a better job in \\"Matilda,\\" but she was good in this film nontheless.I happened to get the Italian version of this film (alternately titled \\"Un Semplice Desiderio\\") and I will add that watching this movie with Italian audio on adds a little to it.

Also, his fight for the rights of the persecuted is eloquently portrayed in the period just before the French Revolution.

ANYWAY, this CD is great fun to listen to imo, whether you like/know who Kenneth Copeland is or not. Jazzy takes on favorite Christmas songs like 'Go Tell It On The Mountain' and 'Away In A Manger' make their debut here, and they're great fun to listen to.

How bad is it? Some say that the CIA used it to torture hardened terrorist suspects in Guantanamo. It had them babbling like babies in minutes.

Every song on Closer to the Truth is a powerful emotion. There is no bad song on this cd. The albulm starts off with Dreaming which sets the listener into a daydreaming mood and goes straight into a remeniscing melody (Old Things). A light-hearted skeptical shortly follows (Dangerous). You will be humming the chorus all day after that song. Alberta Postcard will paint you a picture and make you want to visit Canada while There You Go will bring you back to the mortality of life. The icing on the cake is the finale (The Sun the Moon and Stars). This is their best song on the CD and will bring you to tears. It took Trout 10 years to match the quality of Truth is Stranger Than Fishing, but Closer to the Truth matches it and then surpasses it in their best Adult albulm to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive","review":"38.39 is a ridiculous price for 12 red bull. especially considering they cost 2.09 in a store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless and just Awesome!","review":"I love Felt! great band and I have all of their recordings.

Unfortunately, this quickly becomes mixed up with maundering about certain ancient \\"cities of the red night\\" and a very great deal of homosexual imagery and fantasy.

A strong, unique voice that is still imitated decades later.Unfortunately for those of us living in the twenty-FIRST century, it's about as relevant as fins on cars.

There are few people I have encountered that are as dedicated to a cause as Randy seems to be. His devotion and tenacity are to be commended. He is doing such a great service to the city of St. Louis. There are a lot of us out there that would've never even realized there was such a stray problem in this country. I am so glad to have read this book and to be more informed on the conditions these dogs have to live in. It has been said over and over about this book, but the prevailing message is that one man can make a difference and seeing that proven in Randy's case is a great motivator for the rest of us. For anyone who loves dogs and/or loves inspiring stories, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!","review":"Enter one very unlikely hero who is trying to call national attention to the scourge. Randy Grim was young, hip, but crippled by panic attacks and phobias (of public places, parties, elevators, driving). After rescuing his first street dog, Bonnie, he couldn't look away. \\"How can I?\\" he asks. \\"Each one says, \`Don't leave me here.'\\" And so the man who must pop Xanax to walk through an airport refuses to leave a starving, terror-stricken German Shepherd on a dark, icy and stormy East St. Louis street, even when an threatening tenement resident has him on the business end of a gun.Journalist Melinda Roth puts a human, and animal, face on an ignored tragedy playing out in our cities. She gives us beautifully wrought, but too few, scenes of redemption."},{"rating":"2","title":"truly beautiful","review":"Marie Curie's youngest daughter Eve has given us a gift by writing this biography of her mother. Eve manages to let us into her mother's private world while inspiring our full respect of her privacy.

It is a book which should be read by all - especially aspiring scientists. Marie Curie was the first woman to receive a Ph.D. in France, the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize and the first person to receive two Nobel prizes. The work she accomplished under the most difficult situations for a scientist is truly inspiring. When asked why she and her husband, Pierre Curie did not patent the procedure for extraction and purification of radium, something which would have made them very wealthy, she said \\"No, It would be contrary to the scientific spirit.\\" How refreshing, since in today's world the first thought of scientists is patenting their discoveries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for Young Women","review":"Excellent work by a woman writer who is also the daughter of Madam Curie.

Or better yet, while you're at work. More Eno-esque than Eno himself! This collection brings together the very best elements of Eno's Ambient Music work into clear, crystaline jems of structure. Each piece has a strict internal logic. Progressions and patterns grow organically, following the rules of nature - they feel like branches and leaves growing from a stem. Primarily synthesizers and lush vocal samples combine then dissipate into silence, as indeed they must. The pieces are rhythmic, with deceptively simple, yet haunting melodies. These guys have been producing some of the best Ambient music since the mid 90s.

The pieces were locked together so firmly that the puzzle was very difficult to get apart. The edges had visible splinters, and over the course of a few days, the tray warped to the point that it doesn't sit flat on a table. The edges of the image on the pieces began to fray immediately as the puzzle was taken apart. To make the puzzle usable, I had to spend 15 minutes sanding the interlocking edges, placing a slight bevel on the bottom of each piece. I then rubbed a white crayon on each edge surface. This made the puzzle easy to work for my 2 year old grand daughter. On the plus side, the image is bright and colorful, and the puzzle is simple enough for a toddler to work.

Instead, they take songs which were simple tracks written in the earlier years and try to combine elements from Beatles albums spanning their entire career. The result can best be described as an atrocious mix of taking songs that you may have found on \\"Please Please Me\\", and remixing them to fit the style of \\"Revolver\\" or \\"Sgt Peppers\\".

The story itself is good but ultimately doesn't really interest me and I'm not a fan of Madonna or Antonio Whats-his-name, and Latin American politics isn't the most fascinating setting for a story, but dammit...this is just a good soundtrack and rarely is a story ever told so well with such a diverse array of music.

The switch in cast (it was originally sung by the mistress Evita was throwing out - who disappears from view in this album) completely loses the pathos and point of the song and does a great dis-service to the whole piece.Buy the 1976 concept album first with Paul Jones (possibly the most under-rated Peron) and Julie Covington (singing a really hard-nosed ladder-climbing Evita) to hear how this should sound on audio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evita soundtrack","review":"I was impressed with speed of delivery, condition of product & quality of packaging for the product.The soundtrack itself is wonderful as I saw the original movie when it came out and feel Madonna & Antonio deserved a better review than they got for their performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy another version.

Madonna is the best Evita out there! Compared to Patti LuPone and Julie Covington she is the only one who can actually sing!

After listening to this cd, I am glad they did cut out certain lyrics and replaced them. Some of the lyrics from the old Evitas are too direct. Jonathan Pryce may not be the best singer on this cd, but at least his voice doesn't make you cover your ears every time he comes on. He fits the part very well if you knew anything about the real Evita and Juan Peron. Jimmy Nail is also a good singer, although unfortunately he is only in 3 tracks.

Live and learn..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used it once before it broke","review":"I bought this for my 9 year old to sleep on. We used it the first time and everything was fine. Pulled it out a month later and it has a slow leak somewhere that I can't find to repair. Basically a waste of $35. I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I ordered this bed for a visit by my 4 year old granddaughter. We had to add air to the bed every morning. I had this experience with another brand, but hoped this one would be better. Definitely NOT worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"SEVERAL LEAK VERY SOON","review":"The price is great. The bed looks good. I have ordered several over the last few years. I've only had 2 last 6 months or longer_ The most recent one I ordered had a leak so I returned it for a replacement. The replacement started to leak 32 days after receiving---2 days after the return policy. All I can say is if you need it- order 2; because it's likely 1 will start leaking pretty soon. Unless you only use it occassionally. I use mine every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great buy!","review":"I love this air mattress! Very easy to set up and put away and very comfy to sleep on. I have slept on other air mattresses before and this is by far the best one I have ever slept on. The soft top makes it so you don't feel like you're sticking to it, but I put a blanket over it anyway for extra comfort. I have been recommending this one to all of my friends, I'm very happy with it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold air","review":"I bought this air mattress to use while my new bed was being shipped from back east, the bed lost air every night and I woke up almost on the floor.

So, being we are out of the 30 day return time frame, we are just out.If you buy this, good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product","review":"Using this air bed was a nightmare to my husband. It is not firm and loses air easily. It lost half of the air in 30 minutes. When my husband got up from this bed in the morning, he was almost on the floor. He slept as a curve during the night, which really hurt his waist, which affect his movement. Definitely will return to Amazon today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not hold air. I have to return it!","review":"This looked like a good produce and inflated easily, but would not hold the air.

There will be a restocking charge, which is rediculous because they can't sell a defective product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Garbage","review":"Dear potential sucker,My first airbed by intex sprung a leak in about a week, so I obtained a refund. I bought this model next, and it lasted almost twice as long!I am now on my third. I should have learned my lesson, but my current intex airbed has been around for about one year, and currently has 9, count 'em, NINE leaks. Everytime I patch one, another springs.Intex also makes inflateable boats. They must get sued for a lot of drownings. No wonder they have no email contact. If you buy ANY intex airbed, you are buying utter garbage.Sincerely,SidWa State"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a horrible bed","review":"I bought this bed at the end of May so that I would have an air mattress available if a guest were to stay. I first took it out of the box it was shipped in more than a month after it arrived and set it up the day before my guest was to arrive. It sat in an unoccupied room for one night- no one slept on it at all and lost substantial amounts of air. A serious amount air leaked out- it was visibly noticeable. I cannot imagine how much air would have leaked had a person slept on it. This is a horrible product. It was past the 30 day refund from Amazon and after being on hold for over 20 minutes waiting to speak to an Intex rep, I gave up. You are seriously throwing your money away if you purchase this item. It was never slept on- period- and is unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seams Came Apart After 5th Use","review":"I bought this to sleep on while I moved it to my new place and used it about 6 times before the seams on top came apart. I never realized how important the seams were until that dreary night when at 3am they started to come apart. I turned to my side and another came apart. I turned to my other side and the rest came apart (I weigh 120 lbs if it matters)which turned the bed into one giant ball. Since the seams are gone there is no shape and if you lay on it the air is distributed to the opposite of your weight...I ended up in a hammock type pose. I let some air out in hopes it would bring the top down but nope, instead I sunk further.I called the manufacturer, emailed Amazon for the contact info to be sure, emailed the manufacturer again and finally got a response. Although some models come with a 90 day warranty, this one did not so I was SOL.Never again. Buy yourself a cheap mattress instead, at least it won't break and the comfort will be about the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable item; will not last past 6 months.","review":"So I've had this product since July 2011, and it is now in the trash. The seams do not hold up and 2 have released, creating giant 'bubbles' in the mattress rendering it unusable. I paid nearly $50 for this back then, and only used it 3 or 4 times. Very disappointed in the poor quality of this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"All of mine have not lasted long.","review":"A comfortable bed for the money. But I've had 7 or 8 of these, and they ALWAYS fail in one of two ways:1) An external seam will break, usually near the head area. To fix it, use a good size piece of Gorilla Tape (forget the enclosed repair kit) and press down very hard around the leak so no air can get out. No need to deflate or remove flock from the area, but you have to press down carefully and firmly.2) An internal seam will pop (usually in the middle) and create a huge bubble in the center. No way to fix that, unless you want to use pillows or folded blankets to level out the low areas.That's my advice. I'm still looking for a good, sturdy alternate model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not inflate RETURNED","review":"I've bought several air beds from various manufacturers. I bought one identical to this one 1 1/2 years ago. It was comfortable but lost air after 3 months. I justified this as the user may have not taken care. However, I now believe its the brand. This one would not inflate at all. I will not buy this brand again. I've had great life from a better brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible beds","review":"I ordered these beds because my grandkids were sleeping on the floor and couldnt afford real beds and in less than 2 months both beds have popped. They didnt jump on them they just lost air seemed like the seams were the problem. 1 bed was replaced but the other remains not replaced. I would never buy these type of beds ever again or this brand. They were not cheap and I cant afford to replace them again. So now they are back to sleeping on the floor again. I heard they were good or I would not have ordered them. I am terribly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not completely deflate","review":"I ordered 3 of these. They are sturdy, comfortable, and stay inflated. The electric motor in each easily and quickly inflates and (almost) deflates them. The height also makes them feel more like a real bed.However, if you want to completely deflate them for storage, that can be a real trick. I could never deflate any of them completely, so in frustration I cut one open to see what the problem is. A design flaw allows an internal plastic flap to cover the deflation port when they are almost empty. The more you try to vacuum or squeeze out air, the tighter the flap seals the port, sealing in the last bit of air.Now I know, and there's nothing I can do about it, but I feel better after attacking one with scissors..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I bought this for my four year old he in between beds and wanted something temp since we are planning to move to another state and didn't want to by a bed we would have to move so decided to by this. within a week had a first hole patch everything fine two week later another leak think it coming from where the motor is..we had a queen size on from same brand it that happen to that one as well. The one without the built in motor never had an issue with which is what we are using now. I also don't like the top it not comfortable with the humps."},{"rating":"2","title":"convenient twin airbed","review":"First airbed I received had a leak, sent it back and got the next one within 4 days.

No reason for leakage as it has been used only for small individuals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made and great value!","review":"We had guests that used it last weekend. They said it felt like a real bed. I was so suprised on how quickly it inflated and deflated. The cord hides away in a handy compartment. It keeps its air pressure. No need to carry around a separate pump. Our dog wanted to adopt it as her own bed. The dog jumped on it and tested it toughness. It passed with flying colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Bed","review":"I've owned 2 beds for over 2 years now and both beds have held up extremely well considering the amount of constant use they've had. One of beds I actually sleep on daily (more comfortable than my regular bed). I had it over 2 years before one of the inner baffels gave way a few weeks ago. I immediatly ordered another bed without hesitation. Very comfortable and super easy to use, with the built in pump, it's a snap to set up and deflate. Love this bed!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst airbed ever - Don't buy","review":"If I could give a 0 star I would.So I bought this airbed while I had a friend visiting so she could use my bed. It seemed to work just fine the first night. However the second time I inflated this bed and slept on it, I got the worst night of sleep ever. During the night, the air slowly came out of the bed (I have checked all over for leaks or holes but could not find anything). I woke up several times to a half inflated bed and then had to re-inflate the bed again only to wake up an hour later to the same condition. Needless to say, I am extremely unhappy with the product.

I guess I am just hard on blowup beds.I was using it every day as a regular bed, perhaps it would be better if used for visitors only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to setup and comfortable","review":"I got this for guests to use in our small spare room. Inflating it was quick and easy since it has a built-in pump: you plug it in, turn it on and switch off when it's inflated enough for you. The only drawback is that the pump is really noisy - about the same as a loud vacuum cleaner - so you probably want to inflate the mattress before the rest of the household goes to bed.I had one guest a week, two weeks in a row, sleeping on it for several nights. Both found it comfortable and slept well on it. The extra height makes it feel more like a regular bed and less like you're camping out on someone's floor.Like all air mattresses, the air sucks heat from the body so the sleeper can get really cold; I've found the best way around this is to place a blanket or comforter on the mattress before you put the sheets on - this bottom blanket will insulate the person from the cold air.So far it's been great and I have no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this bed! carry it anywhere!","review":"I was little apprehensive before buying an airbed thinking how it would be. But this turned out real nice one. It doesn't need you to call U-haul when you move out. It doesn't require much space to carry it with you anywhere you go. Its also really easy to inflate with the electronic pump and even easier to deflate naturally. After you get used to the \\"airbed\\", it feels like a normal bed. It offers a great option for people who don't want a hassle of carrying mattress and other accessories along with the trouble of carrying them.It also doesn't require you to carry your pillow. The top surface is velvet like thing that is so soft, you could do w/o a bed sheet also.go for it, if you need one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I received this air mattress and was very impressed at first. It's only been a couple of months with sporadic use by an average size/weight person and it's now unuseable. Two of the seams along the top of the mattress have now \\"popped\\" so that the top of the mattress is 1/2 big bulge and 1/2 normal. There's no reason this should've happened. When only 1 seam popped it was still ok, but with 2 gone we have to throw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to keep sheets and mattress pads on.","review":"Everyone who slept on this mattress, ended up with a jumble of bedding after a few tosses and turns.

We already have a Queen-size air mattress but have space limitations so this was a perfect fit in more ways than one. As always, the customer service with Amazon was wonderful and they got it to me in time, and now I sleep on this air mattress more than my real bed! It is comfortable and actually helps when my back is acting up and it is the only place that I am able to find relief. So thank you for a great product, and I highly recommend it to anyone. The air stays in and it is easy to inflate and deflate. The price is also great as well.

My brother actually preferred the feel of it after a couple of nights (got slightly softer due to minimal air loss). The only issue I had was not being able to get 100% of the air out of it during deflation. We used the motor to remove most of the air, but towards the end it couldn't force the rest out. I tried pressure, but it seems as if the release has to be a certain angle to let the air escape. It still folded up and fit in the bag (barely).

My son would then have to turn the air pump on (during the night) in order to have be able to have a comfortable night of sleep. Generally speaking I think all air mattresses do the same thing, as I then purchased one from the local K-mart, which is also going back tomorrow for the same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"I so wanted to love this item","review":"Was very comfortable when I inflated it, but had deflated twice before the night was over. Boasts features like beds twice the price -- the internal 120 AC pump is handy (especially since it deflates so fast) but it is noisy,and who wants to interrupt their sleep twice a night to reinflate the bed? Not me, that's for sure.

I bought it in hope that I could have one extra bedding when required. I used it on first night for myself and after 3-4 it deflated, annoyingly i filled the air back in night and went to sleep. In morning i was awake again because it has deflated. I thought i am doing something wrong, read the manual and searched online, found nothing. Next night it was the same story.

It is for our 8 year old daughter who has joint pain due to a genetic disorder. Her doctor recommends an air bed to relieve the pressure on her joints caused by a \\"traditional\\" mattress. The first 2 months it worked great. She was sleeping better and woke up in less pain. The next few months we had to pump it up every other day, but she still was in less pain. Now today, April 11th 2009, just 7 months later she can't even sleep on it. Within 3 hours the bed is almost completely flat.

The price is pretty affordable, and it actually looks like a normal bed. At the beginning it leaked a bit, but after that (I really don't know why) it was ok. It is pretty comfortable. The built-in pump works very good and very convenient in use. The only two things are that I don't like in this matress are that one side of this matress is higher by 2-3 mm than another. And when you sleep on it you feel like there is a small angle. I mean the matress is not 100% horizontal. Another thing that peaces me off is the noise that comes from the matress when you move or somehow turn over.

It worked well. Plugged it in and it only took a couple min to inflate. My problem with this bed is not so much how well it works inflating but what a hard time i had deflating it this morning. I was so frustrated trying to get all the air out that i finally just wrapped it up. With even a little air still in it, it makes it so hard to roll up tightly and put away. It just looks bulky. I have tried aerobeds in the past and i love that their beds have a release valve, this one uses the a small hole built in with the pump. The release valve work much better, and I decided to go with this because it was affordable and i couldn't find aerobeds in twin size. I am definitely gonna see if i can get a return on this... i just hope i can fit it back in the box it came in."},{"rating":"1","title":"misgivings","review":"The bed needs air refilling more often than I thought it would- every 3 days at the most. So much so that if I didn't pump it, the bed would all be like a water bed with \\"jelly-like\\" feeling. To lessen this effect I situated it in a corner of the room against the walls. Further more, what surprised me was the round water condensation on the bed sheet just underneath my (head) pillow in the morning. But what confuses me is that in the evening the bed feels cold (or the air inside feels cold).What I like about it though is that the pump works real fast in inflating- although it is loud for an evening activity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bed @ Great Price...","review":"I purchased this airbed because I wanted to sleep in the same room as my newborn. Yes, I'm one of those paranoid new moms. This bed goes above and beyond. I wanted to buy the AeroBed first because I'm one of those people who hates to buy cheaper items because they usually break or whatever. I'm pretty much a sucker for the theory that expensive = quality. However, I went with my gut and decided to try this airbed having never heard of the company before. Listen to your gut! It inflates in 3 minutes and deflates in about 3 minutes. If you want it to be more firm & allow the air to settle in better, you should leave it in there for about 7-10min. Not a big deal at all. Go do something in another room while you're inflating it. This thing can also handle a lot of weight. When I'm sleeping on the airbed, my husband comes in the room to tell me he wants to sleep in this bed too because it's so comfy. Great Buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not 80in in length","review":"I ordered it because I have a 6ft 8in relative who spends time with me.

This one had pretty good reviews and it was taller when inflated and would be easier to get on and off it. I did like the airbed and it was comfortable. We used it less than 5 times over the last 4 months and it deflated slightly last time I used it. I should have investigated further at that time but just deflated it until next use. I used it this weekend and had to pump it up again in the middle of the night and I think my time for warranty is over with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for its value","review":"I bought the bed with the idea of using it during one week while my father was visiting. It fulfilled its purpose perfectly. It's comfortable, it inflates and deflates very quickly and it's pretty high. There are two reasons why I am not giving it a 5-star score: a) I used sheets and still, when I woke up, my back was sweating. I guess that it is a problem with all these beds that are made of plastic, but... that is a drawback. b) I haven't been able to fold it and fit it in the bag again, it's almost impossible.Anyway, overall, it's a great deal for its price. I would absolutely recommend it and the problems I pointed out are probably a problem in all air beds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Comfortable","review":"The bed is nice and soft and double thick. The auto pump is easy to use and works pretty well with new batteries. The vacuum drain does ok but when down to the base have to help it by rolling it at the end. Folding it isn't to hard and package size isn't to big so easy to store. Bed lines fit ok on it but get good one so they squeeze tight so they hang on. But for the money is a great buy I shopped around a lot target, walmart, dicks, Meijer, sears, kmart, ect. So very good buy if you want one for camping or a guest bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good!!","review":"I like this product.

The seams deformed about 6 months after use began and bulges formed that eventually made the product unusable. Don't purchase for long term use.

The pumps work relatively quickly and quietly, and allow for good firmness in the mattress. They also held air well and needed little additions over 2 weeks' time.Our only drawback was that the air doesn't provide insulation from cooler ambient air.

I've gotta wait and see if any major leaks occur in the future.Here's the reason for the missing star. It never becomes flat or very saggy, but needs air top up daily for sure. Especially since I'm using this also as a couch to sit, sometimes I need to inflate it for a couple of minutes before going to sleep to get the firmness I want. Of course it is absolutely not as comfortable as a box spring mattress on a frame, but I can assure that this is definitely worth the bucks if the need is an inexpensive temp bed for everyday use.By the way, this very same model costs $89 in Walmart when I checked, hope now it is not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Comfortable - Convenient Build in pump","review":"Used while camping for a week and was delighted by the level of comfort and the ease of inflating with the built in pump!

To its credit, the product did last just fine through those seven nights.

The \\"Brown Album\\" or their 2nd album is highlighted here in story and song. The interviews are well worth the price of admission. The Brown Album has always surfaced as one of the top 10 favorites of many other music artists. Watching Garth Hudson at the keyboard; or Levon Helm explain his drum technique; or sitting at the recording console and listening to the harmonies with producer John Simon, is a look inside of a group that changed the sound of North American music in the late 60's to mid 70's. This was probably their best effort of them all and to have it chronicled here is great. I have both the VHS & DVD versions.

It is not truly waterproof as it stopped working after its first try in the bathtub/shower. The next day it was dead, and water kept leaking from it. So now it's dead.It is very big, way too big to be really comfortable and it is hard to insert. It is not flexible or pliable, so it is not adjustable to people's bodies or preferences!

It was a bit uncomfortable, and I didn't love the bumps on the back (that you can't see in the picture or in the description), and the \\"head\\" of it has quite an edge.When you take it out of the package, it has an overwhelming smell of plastic, so it probably contains those carcinogens that everyone is talking about.The exterior piece is VERY powerful and would be great if it was on another toy. The tickler is also fairly rigid and difficult to place exactly.I wouldn't recommend it because I think you can do better.

When it arrived and my wife opened the package only to find that the item I ordered had a much larger cirmcurference, the one she had before was about 5 inches or so. She decided to try to use it because of the fact that there is not a return policy. When she attempted to use the item it did not work, she tried replacing the batteries and that only made the rabbit portion come on.

I took it out of my drawer, after all the washing, to show it to my boyfriend and while i was still a good four feet away he said, \\"Ewww, what's that smell.\\" I found it to be WAY too large, too, and I've had kids.

The worst part of all...the head of the shaft doesn't turn. It barely moves, so how am I supposed to feel anything? It is loud, and has a machine sound because of the \\"floating beads\\" which do absolutely nothing. Look into something else...this Rabbit is a piece of junk.

Ive used it in the shower now twice and i have had no problems at all. like other people have stated it does have a new rubber smell to it but its very faint to begin with and will fade off you really cant smell it unless its right up by your face. as far as width though... wet or lubricated Ive had a hard time getting it in. there's been times where i just gave up and didn't even bother because it hurt but once its in its actually very pleasurable. deff. not a toy for people who are inexperienced that's for sure. all in all great product and especially for the price I'm very pleased. : )!!! ill probably buy more here very soon lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"To Infinity and beyond!!!","review":"This is a good lil machine for the price :) I got it for me (especially), but my boyfriend loves to use it on me too.

This is my first vibrator/toy ever and I don't think I will be buying any more. Maybe its just me but vibrations do little to nothing for me and the fact that this toys rabbit ears are way too long doesn't help. After playing with it for awhile and just being left frustrated I managed to get a weak orgasm not worth anywhere near the 30 dollars i paid for this!

However, when it arrived it was larger than advertised (length and circumference). It was actually to large and caused some discomfort. It has a very hard plasltic like feeling which did not help with insertion. It seems to be well built if you are looking for the terminator of vibrators!! If you have had a few kids and need something bigger and harded, this is for you! For us it was a waste of the money spent as we will not be using it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality Toy","review":"This is great, wife loves it. We've actually had 3 of them. Wore out the first 2 over the course of about a year each. This has never failed to please her.The only issue we have noticed with them, is the rubber seems to react with other rubber types and \\"melt\\". We have had it happen with all 3 of them. So if you keep your toys together (touching) like we do, you may want to keep this one in it's packaging so it doesn't get an impression of another toy melted into it.It does tend to get louder the more you use it or the older it gets. At first it was very quite, but now we have to keep a hold on the rabbit to stop the noise from being overly loud (Especially if the kids are home).Again, all the cons happen over time. We will probably keep on of these as long as we can continue to buy them. It's just really good at what it does even if it doesn't last forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Weak/Gentle","review":"Received as a gift from my wishlist, I added it because of all the positive reviews and because it was waterproof (also the clear design looked cool), but quite honestly this is weaker than my cheapy $8 vibrator from a local shop. I have not tried it in water so I can't comment on that. It is also too stiff (rather than being too big), but mostly my issue is the very weak vibration, especially lacking in the area that should be stimulated most. The rotation also did nothing for me. With a name like Jackrabbit, I was expecting a lot more oomph. Don't bother with this product if your preference is not gentle...

Clearly they do not know how to treat customers or sell working products. the product not only broke but it, like other consumers said, smelled like something awful.

It is made with quality materials. There was the usual strong odor that tends to come along with new toys. But once soaped up nicely it seems much better. I feel lube is nessecary as a companion with this toy. Which can be a downfall at times. But the fact that it operates very smooth And quiet makes up for this.

I was really disappointed in this product however. It's awkward to handle, using it and trying to use the buttons at the same time takes away from the focus on the sensations. The beads are far from pleasure enhancing, they felt awkward and sometimes pinch a bit if you change the direction during use. They are also bulky and and uncomfortable. The plastic is smooth on the outside which isn't necessarily a bad thing but I personally prefer some texture, it's also really thin where the beads are, which I suppose is to allow sensation but considering I didn't like the way the beads felt... I would've preferred thicker plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"California Exotics jack rabbit","review":"Piece of crap.

This product is far too rigid and thick. With the beads and other material in the center, it does not bend at all, and it's painful to try to use. There are also rigid bumps around the too-large tip (which is 1.5 inches wide, 5 inches around) that make it even more painful to insert. I've used the similar - but far more realistic - Doc Johnson product (beads and rabbit, but none of those bumps, and a more natural tip and girth) and hoped it was the same thing, but it isn't. On the upside, it's as quiet as the Doc Johnson product - and it'll be even more quiet, unused, in my nightstand. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I never actually got to use this product, when it arrived the bottom of the battery pack thingy was missing and when I attempted contacted the California Exotics customer service via both email and phone call I never received a response."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"Little different then I was expecting but really good quality and exactly as advertised, fast deliver an great service, thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"The ears on the rabbit are sharp and the first time I used it I felt like it cut me after wards.

Until now, she had not cared for any toy we have used. We ended up buying the Jack Rabbit because so many of our friends recommended it. We chose to try it first in the jacuzzi...it only took about 90 seconds. The next morning, we tried it in bed with the same results. My wife is now a huge fan of the bunny ears! I highly recommend this item. But it now!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst ever","review":"This is one of the worst one i ever bought. The price is kind of high so i expected it to have some use. There is no vibrating motion beside the rabbit head. Since this product can not be return, I used it once and went righ in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome once you find your rhythym!","review":"I bought this because I was tired of wearing myself out in other ways (haha). I am pretty much a nontoy user, but when I saw what all this thing could do and for the price, I was hooked! It came on time in very discreet packaging (Thank you Lord!). A regular Amazon Box and a black bag on the inside, completely sealed. I don't live alone and was worried someone else would open it.I wasn't expecting it to be so HUGE. I took it slow, and was able to use it after a little coaxing. A little painful, but eventually I found my rhythym and it was AMAZING. Controls are easy to reach and the spinning feature is heavenly!So, it takes getting used to if you are inexperienced, but it's definitely worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reviews are so off--terrible!","review":"I had high hopes for this product after the Rabbit Habit's beads froze the first time I used it. I thought the way the beads were set in this product would be better and it was, BUT...the material is so stiff that the action of the bunny ears actually HURT my clit! None of the softness and thus realistic tongue like action of the Rabbit Habit. That's really the point, isn't it? It just poked me, along with the hard little nose, which also hurt. Cheap, but a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm","review":"For me, this is pretty much a sure thing. Sometimes I use the rotating beads. Sometimes I don't. It just depends on my mood. The rabbit vibration is stronger when the beads are turned off. The size of the item is pretty long/thick and I do prefer this size to some of the other items I have. My current favorite item. Haven't tested to see if it's waterproof ... too worried that it'll stop working and then I'll be SOL."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"The picture shows several items when you select the purple one and has \\"alternate views\\" showing these items. And the kicker is that its 10$ more than the other colors, so it seems like its a package deal, but I only got the one purple vibe. I totally would have gotten the clear one for less money if I knew that was the case because who cares what color it is really. I, for one, am about function over fashion. FALSE ADVERTISING!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not waterproof!","review":"This thing is awful! The first time I used it water it filled up with water and shorted out. I've dried it, replaced the batteries and it still won't work. I only used it 2 times.

It was a replacement of one vibe I had and it was just the plane old plane old, but this thing blows it out of the water literally. Its fun by myself and with my husband. I just really have nothing bad to say, other then the fact it takes me now about 30 sec. But I'm not sure if that's a bad thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another disappointed customer","review":"Add me to the list of folks who received a vibrator-shaped paperweight instead of an actual vibrator. I tried two sets of batteries just to make sure, but it was dead. Also, as others have mentioned, the toxic plastic smell was over-powering, so I was a little bit glad it didn't work or I might have been tempted to try it and I may never have gotten that smell out of me. :o)Amazon, understandably, doesn't allow returns on vibrators, but the paperwork for a refund was done in under an hour and I should get it in a few days, so at least that part was easily done."},{"rating":"1","title":"jams","review":"LOVE the size--no complaints there. Rabbit ears hit in just the right spot. But, the beads on mine jammed up after a single use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh.","review":"It's way too big for me. I bought it several months ago, and have used it maybe 3 times. It's uncomfortable. Also, the picture is MISLEADING! Inspecting it closer now, I see the little nubby on the pink jack rabbit, but it says nothing about there being several rows of hard, plastic nubbies near the head of the toy. Sad I wasted my money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty large","review":"Not made for the delicate sized person or in smaller areas of exploration.

Tried to contact the seller but could not. As per amazon's return policy this is a non-returnable item. Which makes sense. Unless it is sold in a non-working condition. Was very displeased I could not speak directly with the seller and that amazon was of no help. Had to go through the manufacture to have the product replaced which is still a work in progress.

It does what its supposed to and has worked out OK for the shower, but I'd like to find something similar (but a little longer) for the shower.I also find the head to be a little too stiff, it should be made of something just a little softer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken","review":"I received this product in the mail yesterday, Put in the batteries and the rotating beads do not work.

It was shipped very discreetly from Amazon directly, but it didn't work. I put in fresh batteries and it wouldn't turn on. I even tested the batteries, they were good, but this rabbit wasn't. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't take returns on this type of personal product. I simple won't buy anything made by California Exotics again. I'll try one of the other brands next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works really well right up until it doesn't","review":"It was a little big for me, but it worked really well until about two weeks ago. And then it just died. Mind you, this is two months after I bought it. I switched the batteries, made sure the ones I put in were working, but I suppose the motor died. I never even used it in water. I don't know about most people, but for $30, you'd think you'd get more than two months out of a vibrator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I don't know why this has such good reviews. I purchased it because of the reviews but it's since gone in the trash. It has an awful smell that won't go away. Like a burned plastic smell. It is WAY too big. The rotating beads do nothing for me. Even if you put your hand on the shaft, you have to squeeze to feel the rotation. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO WAY!","review":"This product worked for 4-5 times and the rotation stopped working. Batteries run out or lose power after 3-4 uses.

Unfortunately, both me and my guests were extremely disappointed by boring commentary mixed in with partial sound tracks..... A book would have been more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU DON'T GET TO SEE OR HEAR THE SONGS","review":"This DVD contains discussions of the songs on Fleetwood Mac's Rumours Album, but not the songs themselves. They tell you about the song, how it was produced, what was going on and then they don't play it. If you are lucky they show about a 10 second video clip. It would not have cost the powers-to-be a dime to show a video of each song after it was discussed. In my opinion this \\"Album\\" is a tribute to arrogance. I will be sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading.","review":"Clearly, the producers of this DVD meant to mislead. The cover of the DVD shows the original album cover suggesting that it is a visual equivalent of the album. Please read the cover carefully. It is a quickly put together documentary of the times surrounding the making of the album. Too much time is taken up showning closeups of the of photographic stills that are already on the original album cover and liners.Much time is spent describing the breakup of the relationships.Some of the new performances of the classic songs are again, quickly put together and doesn't provide additional insights.Hastily produced DVD with a misleading cover to cash in on unsuspecting fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars","review":"Rumours is one of my all-time favorite albums, so I was dying to see this video. The one on the making of Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon was a real treat, so I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, it is just them saying over and over again that it was difficult being trapped in a small studio together, while they were breaking up. The only thing I did not already know, that I got from this video, is that Mick Fleetwood seems like a pretty nice guy, but the other three are self-absorbed jerks. Listen to the album again and again, but I recommend not wasting your time on this pointless and thoroughly uninteresting video."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Box of Chocolates\\"","review":"I'm really upset with myself for not more closely reading the reviews that said there wasn't music, just talking about the songs.

INSTEAD, ALL I SEE ARE THE RECORDING TECHNICIANS EXPLAINING HOW THEY MIXED THE VARIOUS SONGS, WHICH, BRINGS ME TO MY MAIN BEEF...ONLY BITS AND PIECES OF THE SONGS ARE PLAYED. NONE OF THE SONGS WERE PLAYED IN THEIR ENTIRETY. ALSO, THE INTERVIEWS WITH THE BAND MEMBERS SEEMED TO FOCUS ON WHO HAD AN AFFAIR WITH WHOM AND WHY THE AFFAIR ENDED. WHO CARES?

Each song is quickly interrupted with current interviews of band members talking mostly of their failed romantic relationships during the recording of Rumours. This should be labeled a documentary, not a music video. The band members do talk about the music, and there are nice clips shot at Sausalito, California's Record Plant showing how particular tracks were mixed.

I am sending this album back to Amazon. Stay away if you are looking for music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rumours DVD","review":"The Rumours DVD is a retrospective documentary made 21 years after its release. Nothing more and nothing less. It's appeal will primarily benefit those interested in the way the tracks were laid down, the underlying emotions that led to the creation of the individual songs, and hearing bits and pieces of the tracks with the other instruments removed. It's important to remember that no filming occurred in the Record Plant (their recording studio) during the sessions. The film footage that did exist was all post production concert footage; sound quality that is poor by present video based audio standards.With that said, those interested in learning how one of the most emotionally charged albums in Rocks history was created will find the DVD very gratifying. Those looking for film footage of the songs being played in their entirety will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed after watching \\"The Dance\\"","review":"Having seen \\"The Dance\\" before, I was totally disappointed. I was expecting at least the full songs from the CD, but it has only interviews with the band and commentaries. Also the picture quality on my dvd (I bought Region 2) was just bad quality. Not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just a nice to OK documentary","review":"It's disappointing to say the least. I'm not sure what Suzzette Phillips is talking about in her review, but on my version the classic album rumors isn't on my dvd. (And nowhere on the disc or packaging does it say the album is contained on the disc. Possibly, there are two versions? Anyway, 75 minutes of interviews about each song, and vintage footage each lasting about 15 to 30 seconds. Nothing new is on here that you haven't seen on any other documentary. It would be great if they played the vintage live selections in their entirety."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining but could have been better","review":"If the archival video footage of the songs had been shown in their entirety, I would rate this DVD a 10+. That stuff is out there, these clips are teasers. In fact, I own some old FM concert VHS tapes which I purchased when new (Tusk documentary, Mirage tour, etc). I look at the vaults on The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac cd and wonder why not DVD? Frustrating, they would look and sound great. Still, I never saw the Rumours photo session footage which is included on this DVD and that was an unexpected treat even if it was too short. I knew at the time of Rumours release that there was a lot of turmoil going on in the band but had no idea to what extent until I watched these interviews. All's well now apparently since they have a new cd due out in April. I sure will miss Christine, though. I recommend this DVD to any old diehard Fleetwood Mac fans who crave anything from those good old days and also to the new ones so that you can learn about their history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful!","review":"I loved this video! Having bought multiple copies of the album, cassette, and finally CD (which doesn't wear out!), it should be obvious that I'm ecstatic about the music.

This CD, however, has not aged well. In 1992 when this was released I tolerated it because there weren't many techno artists or CDs out there. Now I see that this CD is simply tiresome, crass garbage. Samples of Annie Lennox and Kate Bush are overused and abused and the only reason this drivel was played on the radio or in any club.

Unsentimental descriptions of their everyday joys and frustrations are counter-pointed by the dramatic upheaval of major earthquakes.

The graphs are done with colored Xs which make it difficult to distinguish between similar colors, and to imagine what the finished product will look like. The colors are not given in Anchor or DMC format, but in other numbers that you then have to look up the DMC or Anchor numbers in the back. Finally there are very few designs for each category. For example, there are only about four or five small pages of Christmas designs. Christmas is a very large subject to design from. Did they run out of ideas? Rather than this book, buy the Better Homes and Gardens 2000 Cross Stitch Designs.

Self-promotion is hard to pull off, and for me the author did not successfully pull it off. Reading this book was similar to being on the receiving end of a self-absorbed bore's monologue at a cocktail party, absent the cocktails and the party.The book is less about Claude Harmon, Sr. and more about Butch Harmon, Jr. and how he \\"got his life together.\\" From cover to cover it rings with false modesty, and rationalization of a self-righteous, bullying bravado.My brand new copy did not find its place on the bookshelf with Bobby Jones, Dave Pelz, Jack Nicklaus, and many others. Rather, it has been donated to the recycle bin because we do not want it in our house for any youngster to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"I enjoyed this book tremendously!

Kenny who in my opinion apart from Claire Chennault was one of the greatest air generals of World War II.The only reason why I gave it four stars was because there were a few things that General Kenny did not talk about a few things about Bong. I read the book Jungle Ace about Gerald Johnson and discover that Bong had lost three wingmen in three months and Bong swore that he would never fly with a wingman again. In the book, 49th Fighter Group by William Hess, I found out that Bong's aircraft was hit a few times in a number of engagements by the Japanese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you think....","review":"This item is not what you think it is.

I read it while there for three months on a study abroad program and loved it. If I had never been there or had no knowledge of the history of the city, the novel wouldn't have been as interesting. It is hard to believe that it was written in the 19th century and not during the renaissance as an eye witness account. Elliot's knowledege of Florentine history and her use of real historical characters in the text is amazing. The story starts off very slow at first but then sucks you in. It seems to keep getting more and more dramatic and then concludes with a very satisfying ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"everything you expect from George Eliot","review":"Romola was engrossing and, of course, very well-written.

Backed here by June Christy's regular orchestra, only shows how bad a singer Page is in comparison to the gifted Miss Christy. Miss Page doesn't have the syncopation, rhythm, or phrasing to attempt a project like this. Doris Day, Roseamry Clooney, and Tony Bennett are pop singers who can easily make the cross-over from pop to jazz, but talentless hacks like Patti Page, Teresa Brewer, and Johnny Mathis only make fools of them selves when trying.

The Epson prints are clear, crisp and realistic. The HP prints (even at 2400dpi) are grainy and fuzzy.Not to mention that ever since I installed the printer (using USB) my floppy disk drive has been grinding every few minutes.

They were overly loud and I hadn't paid $350.00 to see them. And now after seeing clips of Barbra's European Tour shows, I feel robbed. The concert she did in Europe is the one I was hoping for.

Her 2006 tour and subsequent 2007 European tour are sell out sensations. This CD captures part of her performance which is quite powerful. The stage presence alone is numbing, the vocals are rich, deep and so moving. The pairing with Il Divo is fantastic, they have brilliant voices, but are eclipsed by the legend. This is a must have for everyone, especially those who weren't able to see her in concert.

The \\"legs\\" don't even lock in place, they just sit in groves so the minute you place the weight on it they collapse over and over. If you manage to get it to stand the minute your child touches it it will fall over. Otherwise it would have been a wonderful toy. It looks like the show and the body is sturdy and well put together.

Difficult to put together (and I have assembled my share of kid's toys), it will not stay together at all. It is challenging (at best) to get the figures in the elevator, and none of the figures with capes will fit - they tend to get stuck halfway up. The elevator also requires the child to turn a little wheel to get it to go up - too difficult for little ones. It requires a degree in engineering to get the little plane to fold up inside the watchtower - very poor and frustrating design. The noises are also weak as are the features (i.e. the trip wire, rockets, the plane). Just a complete waste of money - it is only a couple of weeks old, and it is headed to the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This toy was not that difficult to put together, but we have to put it back together each time my son plays with it.

(ours completely stopped working in 2 days); The guns on the top keep falling off!; The whole thing just falls apart. No, this item is for the collector and I think Mattel KNEW that. They figured the few that were opened and did not work offset all the ones that would remain MIB or NRFB for collectors.This item is just like Mattel's HOT WHEELS JUNKIE SETS. Another sore point with parents. Hot Wheels cars are fine, but those sets that Mattel makes NEVER work as promised. And what's with the instructions that have little to no writing on them??!

The rocketship theme looked very cool and rugged in the pictures. However, when my son got it it - it turned out to be nothing but a frustrating, unplayable toy. It falls down constantly because of poor design: the legs can't support the weight of the whole rocket when touching it), the elevator doesn' work (gets jammed all the way up) and it didn't even come with any character figures -these are sold separately!

The Javlin 7 ship is also a nice piece for the Justice League collection. Imagine my disappointment over the Watchtower. While cool to look at, this toy is for display purposes only! As others have noted, it's shaky and falls apart with the slightest touch. What were the designers thinking when they created such flimsy legs for this heavy toy to be supported on? Also, the doors fly open quite easily. This toy will sit on my shelf with all the figures displayed on it.

Doesn't anyone proofread this stuff?Spoiler alert: As far as the book itself, I found the characters to be flat and two-dimensional. Maggie is drinking in a bar at 9 months of pregnancy? Candice despises her neighbor Ed until she has nobody else left in her life, then she's sleeping with him? Roxanne is a homewrecker who gets the home in the end? I dunno, it was really hard for me to want any of these women to succeed. It was like AbFab but without the humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rare Find - Wonderful!","review":"I've been searching for a book that really makes me laugh, characters I can relate and enjoy and a story that keeps me interested beyond the first 30 pages. Well, I found it! \\"Cocktails for Three\\" by English author Madeleine Wickham had me completely enchanted. I found the three main characters (Maggie - the pregnant one on maternity leave / Roxanne - the dating a married man one / Candice - the trusting and will do anything for a person in need one) all well rounded and hilarious.\\"Cocktails\\" goes beyond your basic \\"friends forever\\" novel and dives into real life problems and the effects those decisions have on you and those around you.I found this book really unique and sparkling with touches of really dark and edgy comedy. A great find! I hope others will discover this secret of mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Disappointing","review":"I loved all of Sophie Kinsella's books. This book is definitely not as good as the Shopaholic Series. The characters aren't really well-defined, the plot meanders at the end. You can avoid this book and not miss much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it so much I returned it","review":"I am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella and normally love her books under the name of Madeline Wickham, too. This book, however, drove me nuts! I only made it about 1/4 of the way through before I returned it to the store - luckily I hadn't cracked the spine, and they took it back and refunded my money. This book is so terrible that I couldn't even make it past the first 1/4 of it - the characters were horrible, shallow people, and the plot is so see-through. Clearly, this book is one of Sophie's earlier works - the \\"plot\\" is terrible. Don't waste your money - don't take a chance in case you crack the spine - you won't be able to return it! Spend your money on one of Sophie Kinsella's novels instead - \\"Remember Me\\" is hysterical and a great, easy read. \\"Cocktails for 3\\" is painful trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good chick lit!","review":"This was a very good, fun light read.

The general theme of the book smells of Sex in the City, but for me that was an okay thing to go into as I loved the show (and plan to read the book). So I had some good hopes going into the book. I also was excited because so far I have enjoyed the Shopaholic series, and this is the same Author, different name.Sadly the book did not live up to my hopes. While I love Sophie Kinsella but under the name Madeline Wickham she just falls flat. The book is not nearly as funny as the shopaholic series, and there just seems to be something else missing as well. The women in this book come off as just plain shallow to me. Where while our lovely Shopaholic has issues, she also shows she can be a good human. I just don't see that in Three Cocktails, so in my humble opinion this is a big pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eby dead! 12/27/02","review":"Contrary to Dr. Eby's claim, Jesus did NOT return in his (Eby's) lifetime.

He leads up to this miraculous event by recounting his life experiences, a bit of biography.

I bought this book and quickly read it, and was deeply inspired.HOWEVER, I DO remember Dr. Eby quite confidently claim to say that Jesus told him that he would not die before Jesus returned. I remember how it struck me just like the promise that Simeon had about not dying before seeing the Messiah (which he did, when Jesus was presented in the Temple shortly after his birth.)This was not an isolated claim; he made it several times, including shortly before his death in 2002. On the basis of this FALSE claim (unless you believe that Jesus lied to him), I cannot recommend this book, no matter how \\"inspiring\\" it might be. Dr. Eby was a fraud, pure and simple, and a false prophet. To say otherwise is not to respect the facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor condition BUT? Good read!","review":"I saw D.

But his story of life after death changed my life. He falls off a balcony and splits his head open.

Later God lets him relive the fall to be able to tell others about the experience. A few years later while visiting the Holy Land. He enters the Tomb of Lazarus and everything goes dark. God speaks to him and tells him that he showed him a glimpse of heaven, now he will show him a glimpse of hell. His story is amazing! I saw him on a television show telling his story in 1979. I then went out and bought his book. It gave me the desire to start reading my Bible. Which is the greatest book of all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolutely uplifting book -- an incredible story","review":"One of the better books that I've read over the past year. Dr. Eby provides a biographical review of the miracles that God has performed in his life, beginning with his birth in the pre-depression era through the 1980's. I heard about this book on the radio and it was described as Dr. Eby's trip to heaven after his clinical death due to an accident. What I found was a wonderful collection of stories about how God worked miracles throughout his entire life, including an amazing story of his brief trip to heaven (he describes it in great detail -- I can't wait!) and a brief trip to hell (enough of a description to scare the salvation right into a non-believer). Dr. Eby is a great story teller and the book is very easy to read and enjoy. A very uplifting and \\"feel good\\" book. A great book to read to kids too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Play on Earth!","review":"I was required to read this play for my ninth grade honors English class. I was expecting it to be a good read, but I found it to be an excellent read! Shakespeare is a true genius. His witty puns and his enthralling details kept me grabbing onto every word. I am a true romantic at heart, and this was a very touching play. The character development and the ironic plot twists are also a very nice touch. If you have never read Shakespeare before, read this and you will be hooked on him forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Fantasy with MORALS","review":"I loved this book, because it teaches people why not to have enemies due to consequences. Judging people like saying someone is a dork, jock, etc. could be murderous like in the book they killed themselves. It is realistic but fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Shakespeare","review":"The language wraps you up and transports you to a time and land like no other. It's full of love, hate, brutality, and loyalty. All these emotions get tangled up and mixed together. That lends itself to an amazing set of circumstances. There is no greater love story than Juliet and her fair Romeo. All other love stories are measured against this one and you will get lost in this classics story. It's a true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"as advertised","review":"It was the product my daughter needed for school.

While the story of two lovers may seem romantic to some people, the use of spaceships and alien robots was very unneccesairy.

It's the Shakespearean equivalent of \\"Party of Five\\" and the Spice Girls.The only saving grace of this \\"play\\" (why not call it a \\"B-play?\\") is the beautiful soliloquy by Mercutio about Queen Mab.The rest is absolute garbage.Read a real play. \\"Hamlet,\\" although dreadfully overplayed, is a fine work. So is \\"Caesar.\\"And forget Shakespeare. There are other fine Elizabethan writers who have been forced to exist in the \\"Bard's\\" shadow.

None of the reviews I looked at are actually for the e-version of this book. They were written for a variety of paper versions of the book, good, bad, and ugly. Some are about a specific used book purchased, others are about the play itself (love it/hate it). None of them help determine the value of this specific e-version of the play.Bottom line, I refuse to pay $4.99 for a version that I can't get any information about. How does it look on the page?

The paper quality is terrible for annotating: Mechanical pencil lead gets caught on the fibers, and any ink but ballpoint pens spreads out.3. Very few terms are annotated in the book, so you'll need to keep your own glossary inside the front cover because there's very little space to annotate.4.

It makes it difficult to follow the story because Shakespeare plays with words and even invented some expressions.We like a few characters like Mercutio, because of his sexual jokes and language. Another character that we enjoyed was The Nurse, because of her fun-loving personality. The dirty sexual humor was very unexpected and, very funny.We found strange that the prohibited love of Romeo and Juliet was not because one family was in a poor social position, but because the two families fight for their own power. We also liked its end, when Romeo and Juliet died. It's surprising because we all expect a happy end with Romeo and Juliet's marriage.In conclusion, we found the story very interesting and surprising."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Work","review":"Romeo and Juliet is the first Shakespearean play I have read. I thought it was very good. It didn't have a complicated plot like other Shakespearean plays allegedly have. The language, of course, is great. I would also recommend buying this edition of the book if any, because old and archaic words and phrases are translated on every other page (this is a huge help). Shakespeare offers some good comic relief (watch for several double entendres) throughout the play which moderated the level of lament. This play shows the chaos that can result when people let their emotions overcome reason, and also what can result when you only look short term and move with so much \\"haste\\". After finishing the play, I realized that there were indeed only a couple of totally reasonable characters, but I'll leave that to you.

Unfortunately, Mr. Bagehot and Mr. Bernstein's text is the former. The book does an outstanding job of promoting the importance of a strong central banking system and the importance of strict credit control when combating financial crises. However, it does so amidst extremely repetitive and somewhat painful language. The authors provide outstanding quantitative and anecdotal evidence supporting their case, but they do so in such a way that makes the book a true labor to read.This book would be very beneficial to anyone doing research on, or working for some kind of central banking organization.

When they get to the site they discover something they never could have imagined. There really is not much to say about this movie. The best way to explain it is that this is a Scy/Fy channel version of \\"Predators\\". It is only missing the effects, action, cool bad guys and acting, other then that it is a lot like \\"Predators\\".

The underskirt is sewn onto some black fabric that can be tucked up around the waist, but it doesn't stay there (and it makes your waist look bunchy).The laces are cute but are a pain to tighten to get the outfit to mold to my body (reference, I bought an x-small since I'm 5'4\\", weigh 104 lbs). Also, this outfit is extremely hard to take off, which makes a romantic night in rather difficult. Plus, I didn't want to have to put in bra cups to give me some curves up top.

One Second is the pinnacle of their work and is one of my all-time favorite albums ever.Even though this album is getting on in years, the sounds and rhythyms remains timeless...both dark and tenebrous as well as hypnotic and majestic. \\"Santiago\\" finds (and keeps) the groove of all grooves, \\"Moon On Ice\\" drips with atmosphere, and \\"Call It Love\\" sports an excellent guitar hook. Even the repeat track \\"Oh Yeah\\" (previously on Stella), fits in with the entire composition.This album is sheer genius and belongs in any music lover's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The album divine","review":"This album is the best of Yello's earliest albums.

Si Senor The Hairy Grill being the masterpiece of the bunch with an organ biuldup to an amazing crescendo of screaming guitars (or is it just screaming?). Dr. Van Steiner, Goldrush, the latin~tinged La Habanera, and to a lesser extent, Oh Yeah, are all fine, and incredibly inventive tunes. Shirley Bassey is great in the Rhythm Devine, but the rest is a tad blah. Still worth it for all the greatness, and was a must buy for me as I used to have it in the 80's and really missed it. Jamming out to Si Senor was worth it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"One second, Forever","review":"Great tunes dripping with latin up beat melodies and smooth syncopation.

I tore out a few of the best pictures and threw the rest of the book away. I had the 1962 version, so I can't speak for any other editions. It explains in the book that the picture sequences documenting the development of movement were of babies born very early, as early as the 6th week. I don't believe they were aborted on purpose or anything, but I couldn't stand to see how they were being touched with a hair to see how they move... that seems cruel to me.

It was short (92 pages of large text),with no color pictures and just didn't seem like that helpful of a book for a first time mother.

Only when Logan breaks out of the domed city and into the natural world does Goldsmith allow the full orchestra to come in, warming up the music just as Logan's worldview expands.

Their view of the cause of homosexuality is out of mainstream thought, and it implies that something wrong happened. The main reason for need for any counseling would be if homosexuality is causing adjustment or self-acceptance problems. This is not what the author's have in mind. Following the author's advice fails to honor your childs true nature, and certainly would be detrimental to the development of his/her self esteem."},{"rating":"2","title":"FORGET PAGE 144","review":"I have read this book and it offers excellent advise for parents. Several reviewers here have pointed out the authors \\"outdated\\" views on homosexuality - this is their opinion.

The book was originally written in the 70s and it shows!In today's world where 70% of women work outside the home I found these depictions off-putting. I mean, wow, when I was a kid (and i'm 45) my mom worked outside the home.The greatest ding against the book though, is it's offensive depiction of homosexuality as a condition worthy of 'immediate psychological attention'.

Inevitably there is bias and self indulgent perspectives conveyed here; the writing is relatively average as well though it flows smoothly & does compel one to turn the page, even with droopy eyelids.

She is also from that same electroclash scene as Chicks on Speed and Tiga.\`I Com' is her second album and is more club-friendly then her previous outing. The beats are more in your face and her sense of irony is stronger, with track 2 \`Requiem for a Hit' in particular standing out.

I've put it on my list of Weber books worth waiting for."},{"rating":"2","title":"the nay-sayers are nuts","review":"I've been reading SF for just over 65 years. My SF library runs to 1800 volumes. While Empire From the Ashes may have been one of Weber's early works, it simply sparkles with imagination. If you don't enjoy it, find another genre to read. He has grown greatly in the conversations between characters (in Safehold, they are amazingly good), but they are just fine in the Dahak trio. I have recently finished reading Asamov's Foundation pentology (including the Robot inclusions) and six of Heinlein's best. Neither of them can touch Weber's attention to detail, and INTELLIGENT conversations between characters who are at the top of Safehold's heirarchy and therefore intelligent. The monologues are so good they can bring an unexpected lump in the throat. If all you want is car-chase type reading, you may skip pages, but if you want a brilliant read from a great SF writer, Weber is your guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk about Twists and turns...","review":"It was a pretty good Sci Fi book. When taken as a series, there are some great twists and turns. I liked the bio-enhancements that the characters get. The concept is very interesting to think about. There is a theory on how the human race came to earth, as well as a war going on in space unknown to those on earth. I think that any Sci Fi fan will enjoy reading this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an enjoyable read.","review":"One of the Best Books for an introduction to Sci/fi writing.

(Like other readers, my paperback versions no longer have covers, and even this hardback is getting beaten up)The only disappointing part is that he isn't still writing in this universe.I asked him about it when I saw him at a convention in Denver a few years ago, and he said that this universe was pretty tied up at a good stopping point, and that he has so many other projects that he is less likely to go back to it.

Great concepts throughout, makes me want to get out the telescope and look at the moon again and say \\"what if\\".Weber's style reminds me of WEB Griffin or Beowulf - each chapter peeking in on an hour in the action, spread over months or years, villains or heros dispatched with alacrity and gore. This could have been a framework for a whole series of books in the hands of another author, perhaps delving deeper into the characters and the worlds.

Although Doresse is a Christian proponent with a thinly veiled hostility to Gnostic tradition, he provides a wealth of reference material and, like Kurt Rudolph, indicates a possible interaction with Gnostic beliefs and Paganism--particularly in Alexandria, the motherland of Gnostic Paganism.

Cutting off the hair is not easy. As any black woman can tell you, its hard being a slave to the hair. You know the horror stories, of the pressing comb, perms, and hours at the hair salon, but it seems your hair can dictate your self worth. This was happening with Venus. It was fun to read the reactions of others to her new look, new attitude. I found this book to be very interesting. THe characters were funny, interesting and someone you know you already know. It was also encouraging to watch Venus come to terms with herself, her life and her relationships. This was a very interesting read. One I highly recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just hair","review":"The author is smart. If you name a book, \\"Nappily Ever After\\" you're gonna trick hair conscious women (which is practically every woman) into reading your novel. But is it really about hair?The basis is about hair but the message the author is trying to convey is about finding who you are and being comfortable with that. The author is a very good writer and storyteller. She took a very basic idea and made it into a very entertaining story with a lesson. A lot of people can't do that very well. It's just a simple lesson that most women can relate too. Nothing deep or philosophical (we have Octavia Butler for that) but a lesson about being comfortable with who you are.I give it 4 stars: It's a nice story.... good airplane read, poolside read, whatever. I just don't care for the characters that much. Kandi and Clint are really mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept my interest","review":"\\"Nappily\\" was entertaining!. However, the characters of Venus and Khandi worked my nerves. Both were shallow and had agendas. A lot of time was spent on Venus and her \\"finding herself\\" which is what we need to do from time to time, but so much time was devoted to this. We were privy to the main characters' thoughts which was an insight into each of them.The book's opening left you \\"hanging\\". I surprised by the ending.

The title is very misleading and to me doesn't even really match with the storyline. I got the impression that maybe as she was finishing the book she got tired and kind didn't really put forth an effort to give the book a meaningful ending. I was very disappointed with the ending and thought it could have been much better. The rest of the storyline jumped around and the plot just didn't make a lot of sense at times - what one thing had to do with another wasn't clear. Like I said, the book touched on a lot of good issues, but provided no good resolution for the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"a very poor attempt!!","review":"This book is basically a bunch of recycled self help ideas tossed at the AA woman under the guise of a catchy title. I didn't make it half way and had to throw it down vowing not to crack the cover of that mess again. That book was rambling and was boring about the same old crap. Man problems, looks, and nothing about real feelings. It's just not my type of book. If you have just gotten out of a bad relationship like this one, then this book is for you. But for those who are not, move on down the cyber shelf!!I heard about this book on different AA hair discussion boards.

She had finely textured hair, for goodness sakes! She was even compared to Jada Pinkett by one of her close friends! The title was a ..., and I felt cheated as I read the book.

At times I felt there was something else that needed to be said to complete the story. Maybe for me, the author should have started with some background, instead of when the character cut off her hair, and then after she cut her hair she should have made her proud and not afraid of what others had to say about her, this should have been about her feelings and only about her feelings about her hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought provoking","review":"I read this book for the second time, this time with my bookclub and I have to up my rating, one whole star. Talking about this book in a group with women who have experienced the same feelings as Venus and Kandi was an enlightening experience. I can see where the author was going with the faulty ending. I can respect her choice for giving Clint to the other woman. Sometimes life happens that way and isn't truth stranger than fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and kinda true!!!","review":"This book had a lot of truth to it. A lot of us women take our issues to our hair, and it is not an ethnic thing. Tyson Edwards, the egocentric character, had it pinned just right. However, I was a little miffed that Venus Johnston, who had it going on in every other respect, had to feel that she needed to do something drastic to bring distinction to herself. I really don't think cutting her hair was going to have much of an impact like she thought it would. I understood her plight with Clint Fairchild, but rushing him wasn't going to make it happen any better or sooner. The character I really felt sorry for was Kandi, she was in a no good triangle with one man and then got involved as the rebound with another. She was the one that should have cut her hair off. Trisha Thomas did a dynamite job with bringing this to full circle for us and showing that a woman doesn't have to rely on her vanity to make it in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book!","review":"This book was breath taking. Trisha did an outstanding job in writing this story. I enjoyed reading this book. Although I read this book 3 months ago, I still can remember how everything took place in the end. I recommend this book to all my friends, loved ones, and family members. It is definitely something to keep on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"NItty Gritty-This book gets to it...","review":"Nappy... this book gets down to the nitty gritty. Venus and Kandi are so real. I could see myself in both characters. I think many black women are like Venus, independent, take charge, and wish or have tried (as I have) cutting their hair off. Kandi, on the other hand, is what we have to at least appear to be to black men so that we are considered attractive- long hair, sexy, somewhat dependent, emotionally needy, and not intimidating. If you want to read a book that is not only pleasurable to read, but infused with a realistic look at the lives of young black women then I think you will enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute! Light reading but a lot of fun.","review":"For those not familiar with black America this is a great introduction--especially into the whole hair issue. (You cannot understand a black woman if you don't understand black hair and all its issues). If you are already clued in, then this is a great little vignette on a set of topics that can loom quite large in the lives of many black American women--hair, skin colour, and the quest for a decent man.I enjoyed this book a lot. I read it in one sitting, way into the wee hours of the morning, because I couldn't put it down. I since lent it to my sister who got a message of self-empowerment out of it. She then lent it to a friend who loved it, and it is now in the hands of a friend of hers!That said, this is not capital L Literature, but it is fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me glued.","review":"Nappily Ever Afer was an outstanding book. I couldn't put the book down for two day's straight. Khandi reminded me of a lot of black women I know, beatiful but very insecure about them selves. I was very glad to see Venius found herself at the end. I couldn't understand for the love of me why a woman would want to force a man to marry her the way she did. I guess I learned a thing a two about the way women think when reading Venus' thoughts.

He is one of those verbal terrorists who continues to blame America and Israel for his own disastrous failures and the inability of the Arab and Muslim world to get past the 15th century. The chapters on America and Israel's Genocidal activities are filled with such ridiculous points that any 9 year old could refute them.If you would like to read a pathetic comedy, this is the right book. However, it is more of a waste of good trees. Mahmood is just another leftist professor who continues to criticize and abuse the hand that feeds him, America. He is no different than the troubled child who abuses his wonderful parents, and his silly book proves it.Irwin N.

Additionally, the author would have you believe that the terriorism that exists today is the fault of the U.S and the protestants that make the U.S. their home. It would seem that the author alines himself with Osama Bin Laden and those who wish to control the middle east. It's hard for me to imagine that this man is a professor at Columbia University.

I must say I was disappointed. The idea behind the book is interesting. But Reynolds' writing is pedestrian at best. The pacing is terrible. The characterizations are thin. The book drags for hundreds of pages, then falls apart in the last 50.

I rarely bother to write good reviews, because every book gets so many of them. In this case, however, I have to make an exception. For any fan of hard science fiction, \\"Pushing Ice\\" is AWESOME! It's got everything: realistic characters, solid physics and astronomy, believable near-future society (circa 2050), glimpses of far future society (circa 20,000 A.D.), some REALLY far future, aliens which are somewhat comprehensible, aliens which are completely beyond comprehension, rivalry, broken friendships, betrayal, marooning in space (on multiple levels), struggle for survival, etc. Even asteroid mining and that perennial \\"stranded in space\\" trick - using electric motors as generators :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Characters","review":"I really enjoy the science in science fiction, and believable characters. I have watched the movie Aliens many times and I have always wondered why you would pick really stupid people to go into space. Is there going to be a shortage of smart people in the future?

The action starts out slowly enough as the crew begin their journey but it builds speed with a nice deliberate pace. The scope and depth of the book accelerate inevitably and irresistibly along with the central characters themselves. One of my favorite aspects of the book is that it is paced very much like climbing a mountain. Just when you reach what appears to be the peak, you realize there is even more to come, beyond what you had previously imagined.The physical description of the effects of close-to-light travel is also quite enjoyable and is one of the features one would expect from Reynolds, as a former scientist and a noted hard-sci-fi writer. I tend to have a soft spot for stories that follow human civilization through a rapidly accelerating future history, in particular those that explore technological singularity or singularity-like events, and this one satisfies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressive","review":"This is the best scifi novel I have read for a while, goes above and beyond the author's revelation space series. It has real characters, good description of spaceflight in the next few decades, a mystery which really shocked me when revealed (didn't see that coming), plus big ideas and revalations about intelligent life in the universe. Everything fits together perfectly, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space Opera it isn't...it's better than that","review":"I've read Century Rain before this and thought that it was a rather average experience.Pushing Ice however had me absolutely hooked. Like other reviewers, I'll grant to have seen better character interaction elsewhere, but as alvays with good SF, it's really all about the setting and the plotline, and as a first encounter novel this ranks among the best.If you've enjoyed Peter Hamilton - the current master of Space Opera - but found him a bit long-winded and liked Arthur C. Clarke, but found him a bit too nerdy, you might give this one a try.It's been a while since I've had a reading experience that really made me loose myself to the story, but \\"Pushing Ice\\" did the trick. And then in one volume....IMO, there's too much crap in the space opera genre. Insofar this can be considered space opera - which I really don't think it is - this is definately a gold nugget."},{"rating":"2","title":"By a true scientist!","review":"An exciting science fiction novel that pushes the limits of scientific imagination. Mr. Reynolds has a Phd in Astronomy and worked for The European Space Agency for 13 years. Now, he is a full time science fiction writer. This novel explores behavior of humans when presented with arduous undertakings and reveals our darkest fears and how we try to cope with them in our unique way. In a science fiction frame, Reynolds tries to state that what is wired in us is not pure evil or pure goodness but a mix of them both. How much of each component you have in you will determine your course of actions and makes who you are. Because I'm a total geek, I loved it. Give it try and you might love it too. @shakirbahzad"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Read","review":"Best SciFi book I've read in some time.

If you collect these radios you will certainly want to have a copy but don't expect to get lots of technical detail or a price guide.

Some of my favorite paintings are fitted onto a page with 3 others making them a little difficult to see the extreme detail. While others get their own page but in my humble opinion didn't deserve it. While reading or just skimming through the paintings its awesome all the way through. The book is in chronological order so you can see his progress throughout his life.

Yes, they are very big and take up a big space in the cupboard. The handles are terrible because there isn't really a handle on them. Yes, the rubber footing keeps them in place- when you can keep the rubber gasket to stay on. But if you want to hang on to the bowl like to mix up a pie crust, I have other bowls with a great big handle that's so much easier to grab and hand on to while working the dough. And if you want to use a hand mixer with 2 beaters in these bowls, forget it, they're too curved at the bottom. My other set of mixing bowls have a flatter bottom so I can use the hand mixer. There's just too much wrong with these bowls to get much use out of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"White Plastic Kitchen Bowl Set is amazing!","review":"I truly love cooking with these bowls.

I was hesitant because I thought it was a bit pricy. But I didn't want to disappoint my son so I bought it. True, the look on his face was worth the money the toy was not. It took a really long time to put the thing together and it has to lean up against a wall to stand. When he uses any of the supposedly \\"cool\\" features another piece falls off.

I am very disappointed and do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun if you can get it to stand up for any lenght of time","review":"This again is Mattel proving to me that someone is not playing with the toys after they are made. Horrible construction, directions are a nightmare (no words at all and very hard to follow) and they put the flimsy paper piece on the bottom and the \\"cave\\" components on the top. This not only makes no sense (don't they know batman went down into the cave to get to the computers and all) but it makes the product very top heavy. They actually recommend you glue it to your walls. No toy should be sold that is 42 inches tall and have to be glued to the walls!! All they have to do at Mattel is hire someone with a young child or let a child play with a set and they would have seen it could have been switched around (heavy stuff on bottom) and it would work better.

They already had all the Batman and sidekicks action figures to go with it so it worked out perfect. My sons still play with it every day. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catastrophe Cave!","review":"The advetising on the box caught my attention so I bought this playset for my son's birthday. It was a complete waste of money! The toy design is terrible! The batcave falls over when played with. The elevator doesn't function properly either.

If you want your child to have a Happy Birthday or Merry Christmas go with something other than this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poorly engineered","review":"Where were the engineers for this toy, is what I'd like to know. What a great idea it is, but it just doesn't hold up to play. Now, I suppose if you're willing to bolt it into your basement wall, then it would hold up to some strong playtime. However, it is almost completely incapable of withstanding any play whatsoever without collapsing onto the floor. I highly recommend you read all the other reviews on this toy prior to purchase. Definitely needs to go back to the drawing board - ours went back to the store! What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BOTHER","review":"This is toy so frustrating. Very hard to put together and even harder to get the working parts to work without the entire thing falling apart!

It is too tall to stand on its own and comes with something to adhere it to the wall! Dont waste your time and money on this horrible product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, But Falls Apart","review":"I bought this toy for my son's fourth birthday in September. I did not have problems putting the toy together and initially my son loved it. He and his friends played for hours and hours. The arms and ropes, etc. led to a lot of imaginative play. However, in my opinion the design is flawed and the quality of the toy, in general is very poor. The elevator never worked properly because, after awhile, the height of the toy causes it to sag one way or another and the elevator would get stuck. Also, the elevator was not big enough or offitted to hold the Batman figures, so when my son would put a figure in the elevator, it inevitably would fall over and jam the elevator. We've already thrown the toy out, a few months later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batcave - get in touch with mattel","review":"Like most of the other reviews here I bought the Batcave for my four year old and it was a disaster.

However I got in touch with Mattel and on the second attempt (they didn't respond first time or didn't get my e-mail) they phoned to offer me a choice of replacement toys.

(I glued together last years modle of the car, the 'wings' always fell off!) the cave is very top heavy, with a flimsy support & backing. If you don't have a permanent wall space to stick this toy on to it will fall as soon as you walk away!

I SPENT 2 HRS ON X-MAS EVE PUTTING TOGETHER THIS CAVE. MY SON HAS IT STUCK IN A CORNER. HE HAS MORE FUN LINING UP HIS ACTION FIGURES ON THE COUCH AND USING HIS IMIGINATION THAN THIS TOY.

First thing, it's a real bear to set up, and then when you do set it up it is really clumsy and pieces fall off very easily. The boys still had fun playing with it, even when the elevator constantly got jammed. They would have enjoyed it even more if they actually included at LEAST ONE character figure in the darn set. OOOPs, we did not notice until he opened the gift that the action figures used for the set were sold separately. All in all, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"a monumental waste of money","review":"I bought this batcave for the grandson for Christmas because the older model was no longer available.

And I didn't realize until I read the other reviews that there is an elevator. Ours has never worked.

Don't buy this toy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing","review":"We bought this for my 4 year old son for Christmas and I am very sorry we spent our money on it. Putting it together was not fun, but the real disappointment came when it was done and you see what it is. I think it is unrealistic to think that most people will want to or ever allow this toy to be STUCK to the wall with an adhesive (it says not to leave it stuck there for long periods of time - you must remove it from the wall after playing with it - which means this flimsy piece of plastic is now laying on the floor). After playing with it for 10 minutes, the elevator gets stuck. The top keeps falling off, everytime I turn around my son is whining that this came apart or that came apart.

It comes with adhesive but I don't want to risk damaging our walls. It is very top-heavy (the 3-level batcave is help up by a couple light-weight plastic tubes)and, though the idea of all the parts snapping in place is nice, I actually had to glue one part in place so it wouldn't fall in the floor. Speaking of pieces, there are a million of them! The directions could be written better also. I read the other reviews here after my son had his heart set on this toy and wish I could have talked him out of this one.

The print is too small, the words and thoughts are redundant and the small paperback has the look and feel of a self-published work, which it is.The range of interviewees is tiny compared with the breadth of Brooks' life and all the interviews sound the same.

The case study told the story of COL Erickson who took the initiative to sink a German Cruiser amid the cowardice of the politicians and the inadequate preparations to maintain Norway's neutrality; a story I never read before this book. I would recommend reading the second case study before the first case study discussing the GEN Haig in the First World War.

Also the software it comes bundled with (Scansoft Paperport) is horrible, i have 2 gbs of Ram and it ran as if i had 128 mb. the TWAIN compatibility is awful, and it isnt compatible with any third party software. I wish there was something good I could write about this scanner, Aftr 2 weeks I got fed up, returned the scanner and bought an HP. People please do not hurt yourself by buying this awful piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this scanner","review":"I was very excited to buy this scanner and was pleased with its size and weight. However, if you have a Vista operating system, like I do, IT WILL NOT WORK!

If you have an older computer and an older operating system this product might work for you. But as for me it was a waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget The Hype!

Just forget all that junk, and LISTEN TO THE RECORD! YES! LISTEN! This band should have been BIG! It's sad that they only gained a cult following. There are so many fine elements on this record. Who cares about ths stinking singles charts? Who said good music had to be POPULAR? This is just a great LP. It has stood the test of time, and made it to CD.

How fortunate that I inadvertently saved this little gem for a rainy day. Listening to it is like discovering Ellington and Ella anew. Except with the added appreciation of a fan.

This was the first, and the fifth, and the last Clavell novel that I have read (yes, I read it three times). Clavell even coproduced an excellent movie adaptation in the late 60's (though filmed purposely in black and white) which captured the entire mood of the book. The reason that this book works so well is that Clavell himself lived the story. The character of Peter Marlowe is based on Clavell himself, and it shows.This book is a brutal, depressing display of humanity at its basest. Not for the light hearted, but a must for anyone interested in WWII or in Asia."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful tale!","review":"This is a magnificent book. It details the horrors of war and the inhumane conditions POWs were forced to face, but it also is a carefully crafted tale of friendship, and how people can thrive in the most unlikely places. I disagree with the reviewer who thinks it is a depressing book - it is a novel of the human spirit, with a dash of good old capitalism thrown in for good measure.Again, it is a wonderful book. It will stay with you for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for those looking for an uplifting read.","review":"I'll be honest, this is a depressing book. But it is about a depressing subject. This is a semi-autobiographical look at the author's internment in one of the Japanese's POW camps, Changi. It is a statement on the ingenuity and cunning of mankind, but also of its brutality. If you're looking for a quick, solid read, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more action oriented than other Clavell work.","review":"Great! Reminded me of The great escape only without the escape. Very moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clavell has done it again. His style expands into the 1900s","review":"This is another fabulous work by James Clavell, a stand-out in his collection. Even though the book was set in a prison camp, all I thought about was that I wanted to be 'The King'. A rivetting story of life and death, friendship and betrayal. Shorter than his other works, but equally valuable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A significant change from Noble House Saga","review":"A very good read, this novel is more \\"complex\\" in the character development then Tai Pan or Noble House. But the plot centers on an anti-hero, and shows the darker side of capitalism. A sharp break from the heroic figures of industry that I personally loved in Tai Pain and Noble House. After finishing the book you may be a little upset and wondering \\"what the point was the novel trying to get across?\\" I honestly don't know, the ending leaves you trying to figure things out on your own. But that's the beauty of the book at the same time as its biggest fault. This is a book you appreciate more and more after finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that profound after all","review":"I had read this book over 30 years ago as a teenager and thought it would be interesting to see how I reacted to it now. It's a fun and easy read, I'll admit that. But I can see why I liked it more as a 14-year-old; the book seems to have been written by a 14-year-old. And the \\"moral dilemmas\\" are of the kind you probably dealt with when you first learned what a \\"moral dilemma\\" is.And although the copy I read was a paperback from the early 1980's that was in its umpteenth printing, it had a surprising number of typos and major grammatical errors. I guess even back then no one took the book too seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"After Shogun one would expect much better. Compared with Shogun, King Rat is rather 2D. The plot is not as engrossing. I think readers will have a difficult time getting into the story. The ending is somewhat predictable (what do YOU think happens to all the prisoners?)and there are many things that are never explained (who is the informant that knew about the radio? ). On the whole an entertaining book, but it moves slowly and doesnt go anywhere (how exciting can life in a prison be anyway? :P )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a book for 8 to 12 year olds","review":"I really enjoyed the first 100 pages of King Rat and expected good things from the remaining chapters. But the novel goes downhill as the reader is forced to learn more about Peter Marlowe, a character I suspect we're supposed to admire for his complexity. The dialogue between prisoners is forced and the sub-plots are only of marginal interest. I found myself skimming the final third of the novel, as concentrating on it was much too painful.With a 4 and 1/2 star rating, a prospective reader would think they were buying \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\". Same goes for all of the books on Amazon that suffer from 'grade inflation'. With every novel commanding 4 or more stars, what's left to differentiate the great novels?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it.","review":"I'd heard such good things about this book, and couldn't wait to read it. Unfortunately, I found it really slow. I read the paperback version, and to be honest, I couldn't bring myself to finish the book.

From the beginning until the end, King Rat never ceases to surprise and evoke the dark humor concurrent withthe grim reality of terrible circumstances. I remember seeing this book in countless rucks during Viet Nam, read and re-read, taped together, dog eared and in heavily stressed condition then, passed along."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unforgettable journey!","review":"In my honest opinion, this was one of the best books I have ever read. Its unique setting, plot, and characters make for an unforgettable read. The emotional roller coaster that King Rat takes you through is phenomenal. One minute, you could feel dire hatred toward the King because of his treatment of his fellow POWs. The next, you could be laughing hysterically due to the idea of Colonel Smedly-Taylor paying top dollar for rat legs. After that, you would be feeling sorrow and pity toward the King. No book I have read before has left such a lasting impression on me. After I was finished, I almost wished I were just beginning it so I could experience the ride all over again. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a thoughtful, impacting story. James Clavell will forever hold a fond place in my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book and Series","review":"Great Book and Series. This was the 3rd time through the Series.

I enjoyed it so much"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is the 4th Clavell book I've read, I was more than a little disappointed. I've read them in order so far, Shogun and Tai-pan for me were breathtaking, long books which I sped through. Gai-jin was more of a chore, with not much of ending. I found King Rat dull, I think the story wasn't too interesting. Other customers have commented on how harsh the prison was - too be honest, I thought it would've been worse. The King had none of the charisma of the heroes in the other books, and I found myself not really caring whether or not either him or Marlowe made it. Although a lot was made of their inner feelings, this made me feel that they were both just shallow people."},{"rating":"1","title":"below par","review":"after reading all of clavell's books, i was looking forward to King Rat. It made me uneasy. I was left with a very disatisfied feeling. Who rated this book so high? were they relatives?I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick, interesting, and accurate","review":"This is different from the \\"Asian Saga\\" books. Still, it is just as excellent. Moreover, it is short and to the point.

So, the child has to count the objects in the space of the number and then find the corresponding number. Notice in the picture that they are not even the same color. So if your child does not recognize numbers yet then this puzzle will not work. I know the manufacturer recommends 24 month age but my son is doing other 24 month puzzles already. I'm sure it will be challenging in a few months as he approaches 2 years of age and/or he learns to count. The 6 and the 9 are similar but not interchangeble.update: I stand corrected! My almost 18 month is doing this puzzle and loves it. I do not give enough credit to the clever little brains. He can see the shape and match the shape to the puzzle piece. Amazing.

Many of the facts are incorrect, as the editor supplies the corrected facts in the footnotes on nearly every page of the text. And the music discussions have the spirit of \\"What a powerful melody! However, I believe the third note of the 14th measure of Etude 12 op. 10 should be an F sharp, though it's written differently in some scores.\\" What a snore.

If that's been your experience too, this book could be an excellent solution to your problem. It gives a highly readable thorough introduction without overwhelming you with details.

It also includes colorful illustrations that giulds the reader through.This book includes sections such as: \\"Mother Earth and Her Children\\", \\"The Gods and Foddesses of Mount Olypus\\", \\"Zuez and the Creation of Mankind\\", and \\"Triumnphs of the Gods\\". It has such stories as: Prometheus and His Gift to Man, Pandora, Echo, Medusa, Jason, Odysseus, and much more.A personal favorite of mine is the story of Jason. One man fell for the love of a youthful princess, and tempted to leave his wife, Medea. Medea spent much of her money and prepared a feast for Jason. The revenge was sweet.... I can't tell you the rest. Buy this book, its far too interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book - a good introduction to Greek mythology","review":"I purchased this book for my 9 year old son as a companion book to several astronomy and constellation guides he requested for his birthday. He completely devoured it in three days - the illustrations are bold and the stories are dramatic/gruesome enough to capture his interest (without being too horrible or nightmare-inducing). We are finding that knowing a bit about the legends behind the constellations makes stargazing that much more enjoyable. I would recommend this book for boys and girls 8-10 years old, although I admit I enjoyed reading it, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Children like this book","review":"My children (ages 5-10) love this book. I have also read from this book to hospitalized teenagers; when I read Oedipus I finished the story and heard a chorus of \\"read it again!\\"I noticed that some of the reviews posted here say that this book is unsuitable for children, but I wonder if the reviewers actually tried reading the book to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A early favorite","review":"Greek Gods and Heroes is one of the better books on mythology for children out thare, with great pictures and easy to understand stories that people of all ages can enjoy.

It is a must have for any fan of the greek gods and the myths about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect and Misleading","review":"Attention! Sheldon's views of Jefferson's thought to not reflect on Jefferson's! I could not believe what I was reading when I opened up this book. I hought that Sheldon had at least a relatively firm grasp on Jefferson's thought after reading his book \\"The Political Philosophy of Thomas Jefferson,\\" I was sorely disappointed. It appears that Sheldon may understand what he thought, but is not able to translate it to the events of today. It is a shame that Sheldon failed in his effort, because such a work as this, properly done, would be wonderful to see. If you truly interested in what Jefferson would think about current events today, let me sum it up for you. He would be outraged and saddened to see what happened to the once great nation that he helped to found. He would be enraged at the tyrannical activities of our government. As for his political leanings, he would most certainly be a radical libertarian."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR QUALITY","review":"THESE CLIPPERS FELL APART WITHEN TWO WEEKS.I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH POORLY MADE CLIPPERS.DO NOT BUY.THE PART HOLDING IT ALL TOGETHER FELL OUT WHILE USEING IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed !","review":"As a huge fan of the group, I was disappointed with this item.

It works so well that when I wanted to replace an aging scanner for another office machine, I simply bought it again. I am running Win XP (paid extra not to get VISTA when I bought new machines) and find this scanner, combined with PaperPort 11, works beautifully. I do not use the \\"single touch\\" software that comes with it, having long since learned to use PaperPort for all scanning, so I cannot comment on its functionality. The machine itself does everything it saws, without error."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Frustrating Piece of Office Equipment","review":"I have had the displeasure of working with this machine for over 4 years.

I spent two weeks trying to troubleshoot to find out whether the problem was on my end. Then, because I missed the return deadline, they would not take the scanner back. They would not agree to pay the costs to me to ship the scanner back to them. Now, I have wasted $250 on a worthless piece of junk sold to me by these crooks. Don't ever buy anything from these creeps."},{"rating":"1","title":"DocuMate 510 is Horrible","review":"This scanner is absolutely terrible. I have a small home business and I want to go paperless. If you are in the middle of a scan job, say you are on the 30th page already, and something is wrong, there is no recovery feature so you have to start from scratch. In fact, tech support says you will get constant errors if you scan more than 20 pages at a time, yet the document feeder is supposed to hold 50 pages (?). You can scan and then merge multiple scans to become one, but that is not the point. The point is that out of 900 pages of scanning, i got about two dozen errors which requires me to shut off the machine, close the scanning program and start all over again. I returned the product and got another documate 510 because tech support said it must be faulty, but the second is exactly the same. This scanner is nothing but a pain in the rear. I am shipping the second one back in the morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALL images are titled left","review":"I have tried several permutations and combinations with this scanner. Here are some of the observations:1) Image resolution is too bad for the file size it produces. I used an EPSON scanner before, and could get a much better B&W; and color resolutions for a much shorter file size2) All the images are titled towards one side. So, if you are scanning photographs, this is not the right scanner. A part of the picture will always need to be cut out if you try to straighten it up!3) When trying to get a reasonable B&W; resolution (300 dpi), scan speed is not as great as advertised.Overall, I don't think this scanner is worth its price."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK - don't waste your money or time!","review":"My company bought this scanner about a year and a half ago. We have 10 - 15 people who use it intermittently. It does not see heavy use. From the beginning we've had trouble with it jamming and feeding multiple pages. The cover to open it is very hard to snap open, and it won't recover from a jam without us turning off the scanner and rebooting the computer. I discovered that if I change the automatic document feeder pad assembly every 3 months or so, which I should not have to do, it helps the jamming and misfeed issue. Recently I went to order these pads, which were $20.00 apiece, and I couldn't find them on Xerox's website. When I called them they said this item was no longer being sold individually, but in a kit with cleaning solution and 2 pads. So what would have cost $40.00 - bad enough - now costs $100.00 !! As if we haven't spent enough money and frustration on this thing. I am going to do my best to get rid of this thing and buy one that works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worked well, but now driver issues","review":"This scanner worked fine for me for a year, and now with later windows 2000 service patches, it has what appears to be USB problems. I've tried the latest driver available on several machines, and if they have windows 2000 with the newest patches, it will only work once or twice, then there is a driver error. I can do the normal windows recovery technicques of uninstalling & reinstalling, rebooting, trying different USB ports, etc. but short of re-imaging the machine, it won't recover. I am using this scanner with Adobe Acrobat 6 Pro with the latest service patches. I've researched and not found a new driver for this device for quite some time. Going to try to hack on a visioneer driver after reading some of the other reviews here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great, but not bad","review":"Firstly, it is incredibly important that you DO NOT use the bundled software for this scanner. The program is confusing and terribly disorganized. I have had several issues with using OmniPage, Readris, and Microsoft Scanning software bundled with Windows. While image quality is good, especially considering the speed of the ADF, the ADF gets jammed during almost every scan with these programs.I strongly recommend that if you have purchased this scanner, use Adobe Acrobat 6 or later. I am using 6.0 Professional and it works like a charm. The file size is extremely manageable (300K for 15 pages) and is quite readable.If you have not purchased this scanner, DON'T. While I don't have any recommendations for other models or brands, I will suggest strongly that you avoid this one. It has been quite an experience, causing me to use Kinko's and similar because I couldn't get this scanner to work. Since using Acrobat, most issues have been mitigated to a tolerable level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good scanner - poor software","review":"Don't buy this scanner, if you want to use the ADF to scan multiple pages into one document. The \\"SCANDIRECT\\" software that ships with this product WILL NOT scan multiple pages into one document. When you feed 5 pages into the ADF (automatic document feeder) thinking you'll get one document with 5 pages ---WRONG.. you get 5 documents with one page each.Just UPGRADE your paperport software for a minimum of $100, and then you can use the scanner as it was designed. When I called to complain to XEROX about this, I was told that they had \\"mated\\" this scanner and the software (Version 9) before the ADF was added as part of the base scanner. Seemed pretty crappy to me. IT GOING BACK to the store tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks jams all the time","review":"Jams with 2 pages jams with 10 pages. I basically have to sit here and babysit the scanner the whole time. I could scan my documents faster one page at a time on a regular scanner.

Paperport causes more problems with the computers I have it installed on than any other product I know of. If you have anything greater than Adobe Acrobat 5 installed, you can't use Acrobat to scan in software. Stay away from the Documate line of scanners!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst scanner ever","review":"I bought this scanner to scan approximately 100,000 pages of literature and it is just horrible.

I looked up the ipod, the dell jukebox, and the samsung napster player. I chose this one because from what I read, it was the best deal for the money. Another reason I got it is because you can put WMA files on it. That takes up half the space of MP3's. That's important because I have a lot of music. The software is great. you can sort your music by artist, title, album, or genre, and you can play music based on those categories. transfering is easy, the software makes everythig pretty easy. even the battery life is great- it advertises 14 hours, it's actually a little less but still good. only 1 problem, no accessories...yet. I hope it's because it's new and they are not out yet, but being without a remote is hard. They player's interface itself is also very easy to use. can't complain and I recommend it over all the other players, just hope that remote will come out soon. GET IT, IT'S WOTH EVERY PENNY!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"My Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB only worked for 6 months. I no longer have any sound and the battery doesn't charge. When I called customer service I was given the excuse that it wasn't supposed to be used in the gym. As you all know it is marketed to fulfill your portable music needs. If you can't use it in the gym then it is not truly portable. I know many people who use their ipods in the gym and have had no problems for years. This product has fallen far below my expectations. It is not worth the $300, not to mention the fact that it only has a 90 day warranty. Can you trust a product that is only guaranteed to work for 3 months? No."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a little while, but....","review":"Sure, this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an iPod. But with a low price, comes lower quality. Our special friends at Creative gave this thing good sound quality, great features, long battery life, and an unbeatable price. The catch is it's built like a piece of crap. It lasted about 1 1/2 weeks. I didn't abuse it, I charged it every day, but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out. I tried re-setting it, I tried just about every pair of headphones in my house (10 pairs), and nothing worked. So I contacted customer service at Creative, but they said, \\"If the product seems broken, we cannot help,\\" or something to that effect. Wow. Don't get me wrong, the thing was like heaven for about a week. If you want a quality mp3 player, splurge on an ipod. If you really need to save, buy this thing on Amazon, they eventually gave me a full refund. I bought myself an RCA mp3-cd player, and I'm happy with that until a cheap, worthwhile mp3 player coomes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"**Great player, but but for newbies**","review":"I personally like the control that the Zen Xtra gives you in organizing and classifying your music. It also creates playlists on the go for you (combining tracks by the same Artist, the same album, or same genre) for easy playback retrieval.The software that it comes with, Creative MediaSource, is great also, however may be a little complicated for new computer users. It lets you edit all track information (Artist, genre, album, track #) regardless of what ID3 tags were used when recording.Also do I need to remind you of the removable battery. Poor iPod users have to shell out almost $100 to get their battery serviced/replaced when its dead. Also you can store, data files, video files, etc. on the Zen Xtra (it's a portable hard drive also)The only negative is the buttons on the case are oddly positioned.Overall I don't recommend this item for newbies. But if you want great control and organization over your MP3s, this is definitely the player for you!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zen","review":"I have been using my zen xtra for 3 months now and i am very pleased with it. I can drag and drop songs with the nomad explorer. I can listen to it for 15hrs at a time before it needs a recharge and it holds my whole collection of cds.There are however a few cons to this product.The plastic clip that comes on the carring case snaped so I replaced it with a nylon strap I sewed onto the back of the case and havn't had a problem since.There are two things that could really improve this product, a line out and a fm transmiter to use to play in cars that have only a cd player.This is an awsome mp3 player and well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Unit","review":"I've already dropped it, (unit was off) and it's fine. It's a little larger than I expected, so is more of a pocket unit than an armband or clip-on. The creative software is not too good - I did some searching and found some recommendations for Notmad Explorer - which does truly rock as accessory software for the Nomad. It will copy over playlists from most other media players without a hitch- which was problematic with the Creative application.

Because of this I have never had a reason to buy an Ipod. And to be honest for music I would rather use this. Only reason that I own anything like an Ipod is that its my Iphone.

I highly recommend NotMad Explorer from http://www.redchairsoftware.com as a replacement for the poor Creative software.

I think Creative needs to have a picture of the software in the quick guide so people know which window is which.I love the ability to organize and listen to music using several options: genre, artist, etc.. It transfers very quickly (using a 2.0 USB hook-up) and sounds great. I'm just beginning to play with it so I'm looking forward to finding out everything I can about it.

But don't take my word for it! Have a listen, and experience how in each piece Lewis wasn't just recreating old stand-bys, he was striving to make them an expression of his own experience of Christmas, and that's the thrill.

If you are seriously considering the photogravure process as one you would like to explore, I recommend starting with solar plates rather than copper. It is much less complicated and toxic.

RMT has been shown to generate mostly false images: images that feel like real memories, but which are of events that never happened. It is also important to realize that Multiple Personality Disorder has now been rejected by almost all therapists. This book feeds into the victim culture of the 1980s and 1990s. It is thus dangerous to victims of recovered memory therapy and will probably delay their recovery. There are many books available that contain a realistic assessment of ritual abuse: K. Letcham & E.

I recommend it to anyone that has been in a similiar situation and hope that it can help then understand what they have been through, and maybe help them resolve their past.The only down side to the book is that I would have liked to read more. There are only 97 pages of actual poetry, and the author's own words, which I found to be very profound. Maybe the author's next book will be longer.

This DVD is horrible! The picture and sound quality sucks. The picture is grainy and the sound is off. I could have made a better DVD in my backyard with my small camera. It is over-priced and they could have fit so much more in one DVD. I am so dissapointed that Hoopnotica would put out such a low quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap!","review":"I haven't been able to watch this much because the DVD won't play in my normal (otherwise functioning) DVD player. It will play on my computer's DVD player, but without sound. The DVD will play fine on my laptop, but that's not a screen that's very conducive to practicing in front of. The DVD does play on my friend's DVD player for some reason. Also, I bought volumes 1 and 2 and both are so short, it seems obvious that they could have put all of the lessons on one DVD. I guess they knew they could make more money by making us buy both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good instruction","review":"As mentioned in other reviews the actual quality of the video's visuals is not so great but I didn't find that in any way a problem as the content was great. All the basic moves are covered and broken down in a helpful way and each includes several tips for why you may not be getting a specific move and what to try to correct it.I got the video for the trick instruction but also really enjoyed the work out section. Will definitely be trying some of the higher level videos next."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book about finding yourself","review":"Wonderful book that I discovered in junior high. Several years later I bought a copy and this novel has become one of a treasured few I read again every year. The central character (indeed, practically the only character for most of the book) grows so much during her experience that you remember her life changes long after you put down the book. As always, great fast-moving, realistic storytelling from Harry Mazer."},{"rating":"1","title":"An enormous disappointment","review":"As a fan of both Costello and Frisell, I was pleased to see this record come out - it's been a long tradition in jazz to play around with pop songs, and I thought it was an exceptional idea to choose them from this great Costello/Bacharach album.The result is terrible, however. Yeah, everyone is playing the notes very nicely, but these are merely rote and exceedingly pallid, mainly instrumental verions of the originals, which on the first album are full of much more passion and spontaneity. There is no imagination or inspiration here, no sense of even an attempt to make the music their own. It seems inexplicable that no one involved in this project could hear how dull and lifeless it was. And on a personal level, Billy Drewes is a taste I perhaps will never acquire. Don't waste your money, this is an awful record."},{"rating":"1","title":"all-round disappointment","review":"I'm a big fan of Costello, a big fan of Bacharach, and through Deep Dead Blue, became a fan of Frisell. This combination seemed too good to be true, and actually, I was so looking forward to hearing it as one piece that I saved listening to it until I had a long car journey.Sadly, the Sweetest Punch is much less than the sum of the parts.I understand that Bill recorded it without hearing Elvis & Burt's finished album. I wish he'd waited and used it as inspiration, as The Sweetest Punch is neither sweet nor punchy. Instead it is passionless, routine and flat. Moreover it's just dull if you compare it to the rich, elegant, touching soundscapes of Painted From Memory.I am surprised that as someone with so much creative control over his output, Elvis didn't take Bill aside and suggest re-mixing or re-recording or simply not releasing.Sad really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it just me....or....","review":"Is it just me...or is there something strange about the sound of this album, as though the musicians are all slightly out of tune or it's being played on a tape recorder that's going a little bit below the usual speed? This effect is particularly noticeable on \\"TOLEDO\\".I loved \\"Painted From Memory\\"- I think the songs are fantastic. These versions don't detract from them, but, with a couple of exceptions (e.g \\"Painted from Memory\\", sung by Cassandra Wilson) they don't add much to the original album either. I had hoped that this CD would be more jazzy and improvisational. After all Bacharach and Costello have provided some great chords for jazz musos to play around with. Instead the instrumentation is dull and the arrangements unadventurous. Particularly bad is \\"God Give Me Strength\\", which on all other recordings is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"only 1 in the bag","review":">:I assumed that the 3 items in the picture was what I was buying, not 1, what am gonna do with one?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My wife loves it","review":"My wife thoroughly enjoyed this DVD, saved me from the fact I did not get her tickets to the concert!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extermely dissapointed","review":"I like Tina very much.

Thought the concert should have won a Cable ACE award it was so good. Couldn't wait to see the DVD version and when I heard the first vocals come out I couldn't believe that they had overdubbed new vocals over the originals.

Don't waste your money if you've seen the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Cryin' Shame ....","review":"I love Tina. Her music is the epitome of energizing soul-rock. We looked forward to this DTS version of her concert. We put it in, sat back, and after 5 minutes into the concert I was becoming agitated at what should be a great show. The music was great, but after 30 minutes I was going nuts. Then it dawned on me: the camera work is absolutely the worst. It's horrible. It detracts from the concert. It never stops moving. It never stops fading in & out. It jumps from one angle to another. It changes every few seconds and it never stops for the whole concert. A bunch of high school kids could have done better. I hope we can find another Tina concert worth buying but the Amsterdam concert was a waste of our money.

The characters are not really that absorbing, and I feel that the narrator has much more to say about the experience of kayaking or canoeing the Northwest Coast from Sitka to Oregon than the fiction format allows him to. The description of the sea and land is really amazing and makes it absolutely worth reading. However, I have a bit of sympathy for the reviewer who said it was boring because the plot is not as gripping as a summary would suggest (4 men escape from Novo-Arkhangelsk, now Sitka, in order to eventually return to Sweden). It is a man against nature story, but I suppose I found the nature part much more interesting than the men.A non-fiction reflection retracing this journey interwoven with the author's own thoughts probably would have been much more gripping.Still, it is worth reading nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Page Turner","review":"Ivan Doag has captured my attention.

The descriptions would have been better if the author had not tried to use big words which made the voice of the book seem pretentious. I read it for a book club and had a hard time getting through it. The sad thing is that the story itself was interesting as were the characters. It was just an awkward book to read. It definitely was not a page turner.

The rhythm of the book captures the frustration of its characters and makes it part of your life. I felt I was on the sea paddling for seemingly forever.

This is a MUST READER for understanding the Pacific Northwest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild Alaskan adventure","review":"Based on a true incident, this tale of the escape of indentured workers from a fish packing plant in Alaska in the 1800s is hair-raising adventure. Doig's descriptions of the trials the men face in the unforgiving wilderness are masterful and vivid. There's humor here too. At first, the syntax was challenging, but Doig succeeds in giving the narrative a Scandinavian and historical flavor through the language. This boat takes some startling turns, so hang on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pile of Junk - Save your money!","review":"The first one I received the SD card slot lock did not work.

Nothing to restock at Discount Jungle, send the piece of junk back to Sandisk!!!Save some headaches and buy something different!

It occationally corrupts the tracks when it crashes. The screen is average. Getting podcsts to show up as podcasts has been frustrating. Forget about video podcasts.

My intent was to use it primarily on plane flights. Suddenly and for no reason, I was unable to easily insert the earphones into the player. With a little effort, I was finally able to insert the earphone, but could not get any sound.I contacted Sandisk and was very disappointed with their response. The player has a 1-year warranty but it's very apparent that Sandisk is attempting to discourage replacing defective products by making purchasers jump through hoops to test the product and prove it is defective rather than immediately fixing or replacing it. If the player won't work as advertised, why should I be inconvenienced as a result.In addition, a senior service person was supposed to contact me about the problem, but has not done so. I would never purchase a Sandisk product in the future -- too difficult to deal with if there's a warranty problem !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sansa View 8 GB","review":"This item is one of the worse I have seen in the Sansa family. I have had all the Sansa E200 series mp3 players and those froze at times when viewing video. Good sound when you use better headphones. The only thing that is good about this mp3 player is the large view screen. The conversion software always freezes after the video file has been converted meaning that you have to Ctrl<Alt<Delete to shut down the program. As a 'techie', I recommend that you don't buy this item. Oh! one more thing! Do not order via the free shipping that Amazon offers. It's just 'standard' meaning you could have you item delivered to you way past the scheduled mailing time or not at all.

About half the time, though, it gets stuck on rewind and the only thing I can do is turn it off, none of the other functions (like play or stop) work.Newer problem: it's supposed to skip to the next track when you hit the fast forward button twice. It did that in the beginning, now it usually doesn't, same thing with trying to go to a previous track.Either I got a lemon or this device is poor quality.

I then have to deauthorize device and computer, re-authorize, re-format, restore factory settings, to get it to work.

My computer doesn't even recognize it anymore. When I first plugged it in this evening the screen did come up to play music, but when I tried to, it said that the player was empty. I haven't tried contacting SanDisk. I think I will just cut my losses and write them off.

The ear phones are too big for my years and the device is not easy to use. You will need to use a software to convert your videos to be compatible with this device. The only good thing is that you don't need any software to load songs in to this player, however, the folders that you have on your hard disk will not appear on the player. This is what I don't like. I would like to have a player which will let me create my own music folders and not create the default ones.

There is no hard reset button like I have seen on other players (namely Cowon brand players) so it could not simply be reset.I decided to return the product for a refund because it did not seem worth the trouble of waiting for a new (or repaired) player.

The downside it that the screen has a somewhat greasy look. This doesn't show very much during movies but it is a bit annoying. The screen scratches very easily so I would reccomend a case. When watching a movie, sometimes the whole thing freezes up and you have to turn it off and back on again. This is not horrible but it does get on your nerves after a while.

I bought it primarly for the purpose of using a speaker system with it so I can listen to music in my office instead of depending on the radio. The earphoes included were not the best, so I did purchase another pair for improved comfort. I have loaded a video and some photos on it as well as music.

The problem isn't the card (I've tried several), it IS the Player. The disappointing machine just fails to recognize that it even has a card slot. The expansion card slot is meaningless. And what with an appalling 90-DAY WARRANTY, you can see Sansa has little faith in their own products. It is really to be looked at as disposable. Get it really, REALLY cheap, or get something else. The rest of the machine operates fine and it pretty reasonably intuitive. But....but, the expansion card issue is a massive, strange failure.

I was lured by the lower price tag and as a group exercise instructor I needed something to lug all my music around on. I didn't want to lose my ipod (which I LOVE) so I got this instead.Well I've gone through two of them. You name the problem and I've had it. It has stopped working in the middle of a class I'm teaching, I've gotten the white screen of death, the display crapped out and for some reason it just stopped connecting to my computer. If I could give this zero stars I would. It will break if you look at it sideways.Sansa is replacing this for me, for the second time, but I'm going to buy another ipod instead because I just can't rely on this thing at all.

When I picked it up I found it was dead. I charged it again, called Sansa about the issue and they agreed it was a bad battery after diagnosing the problem. They also told me the battery is not replaceable and after warranty you throw these units away. Now I need to deal with Buy.com to see if they will give me my money back or replace the unit hopefully with a e200 series. The e200 series has inexpensive replaceable batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great player, bad job with the refurbish","review":"We bought this player for my mother, as I have the same one and love it. But, this player had problems from the get go, being a refurbished model. Sansa support was good, but their fix for the problem only lasted a matter of hours. We eventually had to return it, which was a fast and painless process with Amazon.The player, when it works correctly is great. I can't even begin to fill mine up with songs, videos and recordings. The FM recorder is great for lectures, conventions and other occasions. The sound quality is amazing. I also love that, unlike the e200 series you can format and also erase songs directly on the player without using your computer. It also conveniently has a spot for audiobooks and podcasts. Also to note that you can download shows and movies from amazon to play on this player.It was tough giving a star rating as this particular player was broken, but knowing from experience that they can make wonderful mp3 players."},{"rating":"2","title":"go with the view","review":"I was upgrading from a Sandisk Sansa e280 4GB unit.

I use the Sansa View to listen to 1-hour mp3 recordings from a class I'm taking. If I pause the recording in the middle and resume later in the day (after the Sansa has powered down), the recording NEVER starts where I left it!!!!! The most frustrating thing is that I've reported this problem to SanDisk over 6 months ago and it is never addressed, even though my problem was acknowledged by their tech support.To further complicated things, the fast forward does not accelerate, so when I need to get back to the 30th minute of the recording, I have to hold down the fast-forward button for about five minutes. I also reported this problem over 6 months ago with the same result -- acknowledged by tech support but never addressed.With the amount of firmware updates they've made, this is clearly a product being beta tested on the customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little mp3","review":"I've had this mp3 player for a few months now and really like it. It's very lightweight, easy to use (I saw from the reviews here to format it before attempting to add music - that's the only thing that would've been unclear from the instructions), good sound quality. The battery really does last a long time if all you're doing is listening to music, which is mainly what I do. I'm very satisfied with my non-conformist (ie non-ipod) mp3 player!

I'm very disappointed to have waited for my order to be filled and now must wait again for a replacement. I'm more than a month into my purchase and I have nothing to show for it but a paid bill.Amazon has not stepped up at all, either. The order was filled by a vendor whom I've never heard of before.

The biggest problem that I have is that it does not play the songs correctly any more. I can hear the music and sometimes the back round singing but not the main singing. This started out as a periodic problem as I was running but now is almost all the time.I am very disappointed in this player."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I hate it","review":"I had high expectations for this player. I have the Sandisk m240 and m250 and they have amazing sound quality so I thought, being from Sandisk, it would follow suit. It didn't. Very disappointed with the sound quality. It even breaks up. And forget about organizing you music and videos. You can't create folders on your own. Have to use Windows Media Player. And I still haven't figured out how to make video playlists. WMP won't accept mp4 files in the Video playlist. Plus, when scrolling through your library, the scroll wheel only goes forward so, if you want to play a song that begins with \\"Y\\" and don't what to start from \\"A\\" and scroll through 8GB WORTH OF SONGS all the way down to \\"Y\\" but want to scroll up from \\"Z\\" to \\"Y\\", you can't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the money","review":"I purchased this mp3 player for my daughter who really likes it.

Not much information on how to install Videos, photos or Album Art. But should be able to figure it out from the internet.

After having to return my first view due to battery problems the second one I got has worked great. It has been reliable (so far) and it's a breeze to load w/my music, photos and short home videos. The sound is fine with a little tweaking and creating my own equalizer setting. The screen rotates to landscape to show videos so you get the widescreen view, albeit on a very small screen.

However, I still use the Sansa View for the gym because it's light weight ( I also have the arm case that goes with it for working out).

It freezes up when I try and skip a song, I have to try and turn the damn thing off before I can even go to the main menu after I've used it for about a half hour. The battery life is great, really, but it's just not worth it when it's playing and it goes to the next song, but the screen says it's one minute into the last song previous it was playing.

The commentary from the show's hosts and the various musicians is still enjoyable and enlightening, as on the first collection, and this whole volume is almost made worthwhile simply for the stunning clip of the sublime Judee Sill sitting at the piano and painfully/beautifully singing her majestic ballad. And Jools Holland is a lot of laughs, both when talking about the Squeeze clip that is included and in the clip itself.

Most of them were seriously lacking in the flavor department. The fact that most of them are very poor, nutrition-wise, also concerned me a lot. She seems beholden to too many ingredients that are high in fat and sodium, as well as chemicals and preservatives. I mean, why use artificial coffee creamer in an eggnog recipe?

That may defeat the purpose of the cookbook, BUT, the recipes are what stand out, and any can me made with fresh or pre-packaged items.They are good, everyday family meals.

Open with a Raspberry Sake, move to a Crabby Bisque of condensed crab bisque enhanced with heavy cream and crabmeat, then use the slow cooker to produce Chinese Braised Short Ribs or Southern Pulled Pork - or top it off with Cinnamon Buns made from frozen white bread dough enhanced with spices, sugar, and butter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a practical book","review":"This oversized book does not lie flat unless you are using a recipe from the center pages.

This woman adds fat, additives, and perservatives when there is not need at all. For example, she adds mayonnaise to store bought salad dressing, basically for no reason. But most of all, she is advocating that packaged foods are the way to go. That is simply not good. The human body is meant meant to take in the amounts of chemicals that are contained in her recipes.

Maybe Lee can put together a show about how to make mixed drinks - alcoholic and non-alcoholic - because she seems to know all about them).To think she follows Ina Garten (who can actually cook) Monday-Thursday, is indicative of the fact that The Food Network doesn't have a whole lot of requirements as to who gets a show on their channel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help for the holidays","review":"With the holidays coming, I knew I would have even less time and even more to do than usual so when I saw this book I knew it was just what I needed.

Not only do we get a first hand account of the trial, but he also explains much of the legal process in very clear and understandable terminology. I am now a fan of his work and will be reading everything I can of his."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheer madness, meticulously documented","review":"Yes, all the reviews are correct: This is an excellent writer detailing some of the most gruesome killings of all time. It is the fastest 650 pages you will ever read, I gaurantee it.One note: This book might also be called \\"Vincent Bugliosi: The Man Who Brought Down Charles Manson And Lived to Tell About It.\\" That is to say, Bugliosi is evidently proud (rightfully so) of his accomplishment as the lead prosecutor on the case. And he pretty much makes mincemeat out the intellect of the LAPD and the defense attorneys involved. But like any good prosecutor (and Bugliosi is most certainly that) he has quite a bit of evidence to back his charges of ineptitude. If I were Kanarek, or a Tate detective, I'd be pretty embarrassed knowing this book is an all-time bestseller.But who are we kidding, this is the definitive book on Tate-Labianca. A truly fantastic read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The weirdest plot ever and it's all true.","review":"I remember last year around Halloween I read an article about the best books to read for Halloween. Even the article's author conseded that this was a strange choice (it's not fiction) but had a good point. The first 10 pages of this book are truly terrifying and I guarantee you will be affected. It is also very hard because you can't help but feel desperate for the victims because terror was a part of what these killers meant to put into their last moments of life. And as most who know about this case it was one of the most horrible crime scenes to ever be discovered."},{"rating":"2","title":"the most exciting book i've ever read. i loved it!!!!!!","review":"I thought this book was magnificent. The way Vincent Bugliosi described everything in such depth. I found some of it to be dragging in the beginning, but am I glad I didn't give up on this one. The chilling reality is what got to me the most."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Will Scare The Hell Out Of You","review":"Vincent Bugliosi isn't kidding when he writes on the very first page \\"The Story You Are About To Read Will Scare The Hell Out Of You\\". Bugliosi somehow finds a way into the sick and distorted mind of Charles Manson, as he was the prosecutor during Manson's trial. He remembers small details from long ago, never moving over to another topic. \\"Helter Skelter\\" is a great albeit terrifying book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"This is the wonderfully engaging tale of how Bugliosi successfully prosecuted the Manson Family for the August 1969 murders. However, if you wish to learn a lot about the backgrounds of the \\"family\\" members, this is not the book for you. This book is from a law-enforcement point of view. If you pick up this book hoping to learn about Manson and his philosophy, you'll be disappointed. However, if you want to know how the players were implicated and prosecuted, there's no better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Scary and Fascinating","review":"Charles Manson is part of the American conscience, so I was of course aware of who he was when I began the story. My mom had told me that it was so scary when she tried to read it in college that she ran down the hall and threw the book in the bathroom trash! So I wasn't exactly sure what to expect.Bugliosi is a very good writer and exceptionally detail-oriented. The story begins with a bit of background on Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski and introducing the reader to the other people that were killed in the house that night. He also briefly covers the LaBiancas, the lesser known victims of that murderous spree. Once the crimes are committed, the story becomes more and more fascinating as the key players and their motives are introduced. It all seemed senseless before and it still seems senseless after reading Bugliosi's exhaustive account. Any true crime fan should definitely give this a read, the ultimate in true crime writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real reason behind the murders was to free Bobby Beausoeil.","review":"Helter Skelter motive is a little far out. Real reason for murder was a copycat of Beausoeil's murder of Gary Hinman."},{"rating":"1","title":"kindle edition warning ...no pictures","review":"what permissive issues could ban all photos...a crock to scam full price from Kindle users. Buy a used ppb edition for 35 cents...far more gratifying. Dont let them get away with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helter Skelter","review":"I was 16 years old the summer of 1969 and remember it vividly. I didn't read Helter skelter until I was 22, when it first came out and learned for the first time many of the detail, and the book truly stays in your mind. That is what most of the other reviews say that it haunts you for many years and you actually feel that you are there on that hot summer night, Sharon and Jay talking in the bedroom and a strange woman walks in and orders them to the living room. How terrifying could it have been for Sharon watching Jay die in front of her and Frykowski and Folger fighting for their lives knowing very well her unborn child and her couldn't defend themselves. Bugliosi wrote with such compassion for the victims and we can truly thank him that these people are behind bars now. Watching Charles Manson talk on television shows how unremorseful he is and will always be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"I had no idea the Manson family was so much more widespread than the one murder everyone hears about. Mr. Bugliosi does a great job presenting the history and breaking down the various individuals involved. A really riveting and informative read. Would definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The plague that this book has caused.","review":"Have any of you not read the Manson File? It is obvious that you cannot control people with LSD, and it is obvious in the fact that Manson did not kill anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad the book is completely fiction...","review":"The fact of the matter is this book is total fiction, the elaborate work of Vincent Bugliosi's imagination due to due his ignorant and superstitious \\"ideology\\".He needed to give \\"evil\\" a face... and Manson was convenient.\\"Helter Skelter\\" has made Bugliosi wealthy beyond belief.I guess whatever sells a book, right? Charles Manson, a human being... was simply collateral damage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated, Innacurate, Self-agrandizing: Watch the Movie","review":"I realize that this is the first book a person will come to when searching on MANSON. However, you should really just skip it and watch the Made-for-TV movie which cut out all of Bugliosi's egotisical grandstanding and actually did a much better job of revealing what it was like to be in that circus of a court-room. The film also accurately depicts how much Bugliosi relied on the statements of tripped out Family members who did not participate in the killings in order to construct his \\"Helter Skelter\\" theory of the Crime. Do yourself a favor and buy CHARLIE'S FAMILY by Jim Vanbebber available here at Amazon.com in addition to this book. The two will show you the opposite ends of the theoretical spectrum on the Manson case."},{"rating":"1","title":"the classic pulp novel is still selling fast","review":"Bugliosi's ghost writer for this one crafted a skillful tale of the heroic prosecutor deciphering the real motive of the murders, despite the incompetence of the police department. You should know that practically everyone who studies the Manson case in detail regards this book as a work of fiction, the same way they regard Bugliosi's ridiculous made-up motive of \\"trying to start a race war\\". There is some info here that is hard to get elsewhere, but otherwise this is simply an attempt to sensationalize and make money. There are far better books you can read on the Manson case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helter Smelter","review":"Vincent understands nothing about the intricate inner workings of the mind of Charles Manson. He totally misses the point. It would be nice if The Beatles were mystical figures from The Bible, and possesed god like powers to influence The Family towards committing any unpleasantness. Doesn't Vincent know that Charlie only listens to the music of Bing Crosby?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous slasher porn","review":"In this decade of fear, the drama of the Manson family murders is making a comeback. Unfortunately, it's still the same self-aggrandizing slasher-porn that it was in 1974. In amongst pages upon pages of case minutiae (this overlong monster weighs in at 713 pages), Bugliosi alternates between gratuitous gore and telling us what a great prosecutor he is. I used to blame OJ and Court TV for turning the judicial system into mass entertainment, but apparently Bugliosi mastered this dubious art years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helter Skelter: The DA's own fabrication","review":"This story is not the true story of the murders, but the concoction of VB. The whole Helter Skelter theory was in his mind and in his mind only-he saw ahead to the book deal and movie. Of all the seat's in the court room, over 98% were taken by media. He played into their hands by making up this totally outrageous story (prompted by a liar Sadie and turn coat,get me outta my legal mess Danny DeCarlo). This is fiction. And by the way, Charlie wasn't even present at any of the murder scenes, nor did he order any murders, so why is he in prison? Because he received an unfair trial at the hands of VB. This book is NOT recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blood Fest 1969","review":"The chilling story as told by detective Bugliosi will scare and shock you to your utmost. There is an eerie sense all about you that keeps you wondering how such diabolocal people could exist in this world. In all its gorey details and brutally honest depiction of the Manson \\"Family\\" Bugliosi does not shield the reader from the horrrid acts committed. He is forthright in his personal fellings toward the murders and his perception of the Manson \\"Family\\" including their theology that \\"Helter Skelter\\", the final war between the balcks and the whites, is the most outrageous in all of history, which made everything in connection to the murders just as strange."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This is a great book so far. I am a little farther than halfway into it and it is great. Although the writing is a little choppy at times, it is definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Through the eyes of Bugliosi","review":"This book truly lives up to what Vincent Bugliosi says on the first page of his book \\"Helter Skelter-The True Story Of The Manson Murders\\"-- \\"This story you are about to read will scare the hell out of you.\\" This is not only the best true crime book ever written, but it is the ONLY true crime story ever written. Mr. Bugliosi is truly a judicial genius, and should be highly commended not only for putting Charles Manson, Susuan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, Leslie Van Houten, and Charles Watson behind bars forever so they can never harm another living soul again, but for writing this fantastic but bone-chilling book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly horrific","review":"I've always been fascinated by the Manson family story...not in a sick and twisted way, but just the fact that one man had the power to control all of these people and could manipulate them to brutally murder completely innocent people for him for no reason. This book had so many details that I wasn't even aware of, and it made me feel like I was with the investigators and lawyers all the way from the discovery of the bodies through the trials. I would recommend it for anyone that is interested in this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!","review":"Helter Skelter was the absolute best true crime book I have ever read. From the very beginning, the book captures you into the lives of the murderers, victims, and prosecutors. It does a remarkable job at building the story line so that you are not overwhelmed with information, but are still well informed with details and specifics. I also loved that the book went into the past of Charles Manson and the \\"family\\". Over all this was an EXCELLENT book, and it was very hard to put down!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Helter Skelter\\": the Kindle edition review","review":"All of the good things said about \\"Helter Skelter\\" is true of the Kindle edition. What's more the Kindle edition has hyperlinked footnotes that actually work and take you instantly to Bugliosi's notes. But the trade-off is that with the Kindle edition THERE ARE NO PICTURES because of licensing issues. The print edition has lots of pictures, but many of the crime-scene photo's are censored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind Blower!","review":"This book is absolutely riveting! It seems that only a couple of books a year can hold my attention like this one - which is a shame. I always have a sense of loss after reading a great book.

If you like fascinating stories where reality is stranger than fiction, this is THE book you should read. Top notch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True crime written well","review":"This book was a fast and intense page turner. It was scary and interesting since watching and reading the case in the news.

I read the book to see what the Charles Manson hype was all about. There was some interesting moments, but most people in this generation would not be impressed with someone like Manson. It is surprising that he was able to hold the power over those people like he did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version of this book is NOT coimplete","review":"Amazon won't tell you, and you will learn only after you pay for this Kindle title: it has no illustrations or photos and has regrouped the footnotes to the point of making them worthless. A very disappointing result for a fine book with great crime history relevance. This title should NOT be purchased for Kindle if you are expecting to receive an honest copy of the complete book! I will not trust other Kindle titles because unless you own a print copy of a Kindle title you will never know what was omitted, removed or edited to fit an obviously limted format."},{"rating":"2","title":"great and insghtful","review":"well written and informative.

I recommend this book to anyone and it is well worth the money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Witty!","review":"I purchased this thinking it would be a very dry read. I was very pleasantly surprised at, not only how well-written, but how witty this book truly is! I even laughed out loud at some of Bugliosi's comments, which is astonishing considering the murderous content of the book.It really speaks for itself that after three decades, this book is still a literary staple!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bugliosi Brings Out Manson's True Darkness","review":"Helter Skelter is one of those books that leave you in dismay because you can't believe the logic in the Tate-LaBianca murders.

I would strongly recomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"DAWN'S REVIEW OF HELTER SKELTER","review":"Helter Skelter is a very interesting book. Almost every page keeps you on the seat of your chair. It doesn't have a slow moment in it. It has details after details in which you really enjoy. The feeling of it being all real and true kept me reading this book Just think a person like that is still out there, waiting to be released. If that doesn't scare you then I don't know what will. The reality of this book is so increadible that you think it is all made up,but it is all so true. It is certainly a page turner, but I have to warn you, it will scare the hell out of you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Accurate, but somewhat mysterious","review":"I Thought that the Book Helter Skelter, was very informative as well as vivid in telling about the true Manson crimes.It was a great description of the various people and deaths of the people there in Los Angeles, Cali. This book also is a great account of the death of the actress, Sharon Tate. This is a great book to help you find out more about the Manson crimes, the many deaths, and the use of the HELTER SKELTER to posses the murders."},{"rating":"2","title":"What else can I say? The definitive telling of the Manson murders.","review":"\\"Helter Skelter\\" is the first and only book I have ever read regarding Charles Manson and his followers, and after having finished it, I can't imagine ever needing to read another. Bugliosi goes over the Tate/LaBianca crimes in minute detail, and even covers earlier murders committed by Manson and the family that most people might not know about. Even though the basic details of the story and the outcome of the trials are already known, Bugliosi's telling is enthralling and at times I had difficulty in putting the book down. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Life Horror Story","review":"This book is not for everyone. It is extremely scary and disturbing. At the same time, it is a fascinating look at the police work and prosecution that brought the murderous Manson Family to justice. The book is hard to put down; the in depth discussion on presenting a criminal case in court and developing evidence to support the case is outstanding. The main complaint is that the book is a few hundred pages too long. The author seems a little too self-promoting, but then again he did get a prosecution on one of the biggest murders in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the story itself, not the writing","review":"This book is endlessly fascinating because the Manson story is endlessly fascinating and because Bugliosi (the prosecutor) and Curt Gentry (the real writer) manage to avoid sensationalism. But it's really a pedestrian work, eminently readable, but nowhere near the level of Capote (In Cold Blood) or Mailer (The Executioner's Song)."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ MULTIPLE TIMES! EXCELLENT!","review":"This is the best true-crime book ever written, imho. I actually read this in high school in the 1970s and did a book report on it for one of my history classes (got an \\"A\\"). It seemed like none of the other kids had ever heard of Manson or his \\"family\\". I read this book so many times the cover was in pieces. If you want to read a scary, gory, and TRUE book that will scare you, don't bother with any of the other books out there. Read this one. It will give you chills to realize how much control one man can have over other people. Of course, since the time of the Tate/LaBianca murders, we have been desensitized because of the Jim Jones, David Koresh, and other cults... But Manson's directives started them all. Very well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad book","review":"it is literally a step by step account of the investigation of the whole Manson murders. I have never been more bored with a book in my entire life."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the true story of the Manson Murders!!!","review":"This book is well written and highly detailed but it cannot be farther from the truth. Mr. Bugliosi's \\"Helter Skelter's\\" theory is just laugh out funny, plainly ridiculous. This is Bugliosi's story, not Charlie's. The biggest mistake you can make is buy bugliosi's story of the events and believe Charlie as the mastermind of the killings. But I won't lie, I couldn't put this book down. It would've been great if it were true, but it's not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece of cool jazz, funk and classical music","review":"I just love this album. I have owned the original album since 1979 and when my eyes fell on the CD in one of our local shops about seven years ago now, I didn't have to think twice and bought it straight away. I still love to listen to it once every so often. The recording quality is just superb, especially on the acoustic recordings! A jazzfunk masterpiece, with a great rythm section (Andy Newmark and Ralph MacDonald), funky bass (Gary King), Bob James on keyboards and the cool and sophisticated flute of the man himself. Huberts interpretations of Ravel's 'Forlane' and Tchaikovsky's 'Romeo and Juliet' are just awsome. Played with tremendous virtuosity, perfect timing and outstanding deliverance! If you are in to jazz and funk but you love your classical music too, you are going to be hooked, I know I am!"},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely dull","review":"I will admit, I had to read this for class, but I couldn't have been more bored. It just follows our little monk to be in his going crazy.But lets face it, if you are even looking at this book here, you are either really interested in this type of novel, or have to read it for school/business/other required reading"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book","review":"This is a good book, but it does have some issues.If you happen to be looking at the Hardcover Import from 1994, there is an introduction from Donald Keene. In this introduction he pretty much gives all of the story away, including the final sentence of the book, and all the main events from the book. Luckily I caught on to this quickly and skipped most of the introduction, and read it after the story. This has happened in other books Ive read and I am unable to find a reason why these kinds of introductions are put at the beginning of the book.On a final note, the book can get slow and your eyes may start wander when the main character goes off on his long talks about his feelings and philosophical things, but if you can get past this, points will pop up in the book that keep you interested until the end. I recommend reading the book, and I will buy more books from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ballads.","review":"Very nice playing, especially on the ballads like \\"I Got it Bad...\\" \\"Your Love Has Faded\\" and \\"Day Dream.\\" Hodges' solos on these tracks are achingly pretty and Strayhorn's arrangements are elegant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liver Cleanse Supplement","review":"Did not use as my G.I.

A good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long and boring read","review":"This book is too long and the story too convoluted to be enjoyable. I mean, I appreciate the efforts of the author (thus the 2 stars) to document the historical context and to give details to make it more believable, but this is way too much. I had to force myself and jumped many pages to go on in the reading. The characters were unpleasant too. I don't understand where the romantic shade of Reynaud is, when he forces Elise to take every step in their relationship. He doesn't allow her any choice in a misinterpreted attempt to free her from her restraints against the men (more than justified, I'd say). Elise, on the other hand, resents his savage behavior, but never fails to focus only on the \\"gentleness and thoughtfulness\\" of Reynaud. Finally, she realizes, against all the evidences, that he is not an overbearing man, but a kind, lovable person. No, I definitely didn't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible","review":"This set was so complicated that we are returning it. My 8 year old cannot figure it out nor can any of the adults who have tried. The instructions are incomplete. I really wanted to like this but it is so complex and the instructions are so poorly presented that we are sending it back - it just was not any fun and actually became really frustrating and chore-like to try to complete the first design.

Otherwise there are 5 other sample structures wwhich have no building instructions and that is it.I put this completely in the category of good idea but bad reality. It is a pity, really, since it would take the manufacturer little work to produce a variety of projects with real instructions.

He's an experienced builder, having put together many lego creations and k'nex kits with little or no help from a grownup. He couldn't assemble the tanks. The green collars that are used to connect tank sections are very tight (to keep water in, I suppose), and he just didn't have the coordination or strength to push them together. I was able with much, much effort, to get two sections of a tank connected, but I couldn't even get the top on.I called the help number and left a message. So far, no response.The girders are also not very well designed and come apart with a little jostling.I wish I'd never bought it. My son really, really wants to see it work and so far we've spent many hours to no avail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Older kids like it...","review":"...like me! Well, I like that my teenage son is having fun. All the other reviewers seem to have 10 year old sons. This really looks like you could make a good simulation of an industrial plant. But not with the manual they give you. They give you pictures of what an ice cream factory or a plastics plant might look like--but no explanation at all why they are set up that way, or what is doing what. Too bad; there is a lot of untapped potential here.It was fun to see the same old girders like the girder and panel set I had decades ago. Except now the girders are black instead of red. The plastic seems less brittle than I remember, so there is less danger of the little pins breaking off.If your son or daughter has any inclination of going into chemical engineering, this is just the thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent rollator/walker","review":"This is a very good rollator.

The only reason I bought it was because I was desperate for more puzzles and it was the only one available at the store I was in. First of all, it costs $4.99 which to me, is way too much money when you can get a Kappa book for $1.99 which has better puzzles. Another thing that bugs me about this book is that some of the answer keys in the back don't match the corresponding puzzles. When I get to the difficult/Very Challenging ones in the back, sometimes I need a little help! But unfortunately, this book has quite a few errors in the answer section so when I've hit a dead end, it's over.I would recommend Kappa books from your local supermarket.

Books should be FUN to read, this one is a chore. I have tried three different times to pick it up, but have failed miserably. My last attempt died after less than a chapter. One of the other reviewers used the word \\"Execrable,\\" if he hadn't, I would have.I haunt my local Half Price Books and snap up anything by my list of favorite authors that appears on their shelves. Eric Flint is on that list. He has done some very nice collaborative work, so I looked forward to reading FtM. OOPS! WRONG BOOK! I am not ready to give up on Flint, so I will blame his partner for the miserable writing. I don't think I will read any more of Roach's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass On This One","review":"For those of you who enjoyed THE PHILISOPHICAL STRANGLER stand by for some severe disappointment. This sequel/prequel to TPS just doesn't measure up. FORWARD THE MAGE is for the most part dreadfully boring. While some of the story line sparks a little interest, primarily the relationship between Benvenuti and Gwendolyn, the rest is pretty dull stuff. The extremely long ramblings of the wizard Zulkeh are especially trying. The frequent attempts at humor are forced and not particularly funny, kind of like a drunk at a party who thinks he's hilarious but isn't. It makes you almost embarrassed to read it.Well no need to spend a lot of time on this dog. Read THE PHILISOPHICAL STRANGLER, it is funny and worth the effort. You won't miss much except a little of the background which really isn't needed to begin with. If you REALLY feel you must read MAGE then check it out of your local library, but don't turn it in late, it's not worth the fine!This book is NOT RECOMMENDED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All foam - no beer","review":"I usually like Flint and have read everything he published. This is the biggest single book and by far the worst. The book is supposed to be a comedic fantasy. Maybe it is. If you are looking for a book where everything is supposed to be funny and nothing is to be taken seriously, maybe this is your book, but I pitched it after 66 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"put it down after a few chapters","review":"Well I'm not sure if Eric Flint has had a siezure of some sort or whether the execrable dialogue belongs to Richard Roach. It _might_ be an attempt at humour however it merely succeeds in being tiresome. The book also assaults you with trite banalities such as having gravity discovered by someone called 'oldgram' (new-ton .. get it). As a general rule anyone who resorts to witless-isms like this can't have much to say. Had to put it down. Maybe I'll finish it when I'm desperate for reading material and I've finished all the adds in the paper. Pity really, I _like_ Eric Flint's other work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too wordy....","review":"I got this book cuz I enjoyed the Philisopical strangler book. I found this book entirely too wordy.

I've had it for over six months and used it for radio, TV, DVD movies, Internet video (full-screen HD) and general computing. With 2GB of RAM and Vista Ultimate, it actually runs really well. My keyboard isn't as bad as what was written about, here, but it is not the kind of keyboard you would use for more than surfing, anyway. And, it will take any USB keyboard or keyboard/mouse, wireless, or otherwise. I'd recommend using a wired LAN instead of its weak wireless. And, it can seem like it's running hot, but that hasn't turned out to be a problem.

His idea seems rather weak to me as ignores human (mainly male) nature. We have had thousands of years of war, sexism and the exclusion of various \\"outsider\\" groups (based on caste, race, tribe, income, etc.) Even studies of chimpanzees, humans closest relatives, have shown certain \\"outsider\\" males are physically abused by the \\"alpha males\\" of the group. Look at the primary source texts and warlike art of civilizations from the Aztec to the Sumerians and you will see intolerance is a problem of the y-chromosome, not social conditioning from one particular society. Matriarchy might be the only real answer to the world's problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Found it Irritating","review":"Though the book had some good plot points, I found the overall tone offensive. Mr. Hogan is apparently an atheist or agnostic, and believes in evolution. In his book he consistently bashes religion, making anyone who is religious appear to be either a fanatic or inclined towards greed and other base emotions. None of the protagonists ever mentions God or His place in the universe.I also found his arguments for Chironian society riddled with flaws. The most glaring - that Chironians place no value on stable family relationships, have no sense of commitment to a spouse, and there is never any jealousy or contention among family members or society in general. Just because the original Chironians came from computer programs and were raised by robots does not eliminate human's genetic leaning toward violence and confrontation.I read another of Mr. Hogan's books recently and found the same anti-God bias. I will not be wasting my money on any more of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yesteryear","review":"I have read this book several times since it was first published and find it enjoyable each time I read it. The chacarters he builds in this book are great. It's a book to read when you wish to lay back and dream about how good \\"US\\" humans are .......and how fanatical some of \\"US\\" can be. If you enjoy Mr. Hogans books you will greatly enjoy this good story. I have read all of Mr. Hogan's books and enjoy them all. I can't wait to see where his next story will take me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Science Fiction","review":"I read books for \\"escapism\\" and for the pleasure of reading.

I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book could have been good.","review":"The book starts out well, but the author's explanation of social evolution contradicts the biological evolution Hogan likewise promotes in this book. This story could have been good other than the author's scientific and semi-moralistic inserts. At some points I had the feeling that he was trying to rationalize his own beliefs by authoring them in the book almost separate from the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to read again and again","review":"A few years ago I bought a second hand copy of this book. During this time I must have read it at least once a year. I like it that much.It is a book about what humanity could aspire to become if we can put away the mistakes of the past and present.The arguments I've read that this is a unrealistic fantasy.... this is a book of fiction that portraits the thought and maybe the wishes of the author. You can agree with them or not.This is one of the few books that I would recommend to a beginning SF reader. It is not too difficult and a pleasure to read, and unlike many other books you are not left with a feeling of light depression because every main character died or had some other terrible fate happen to them.If you are interested in other works of Mr. Hogan I would recommend 'The Giant Novels' and 'The Genesis Machine'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy.

You get to see Gould in real time, talking at length about the music that meant everything to him -- not just Bach and Schoenberg, but Richard Strauss. Mahler, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, and Beethoven, among others. These are complete programs, so you get to marvel not only at the transcendent performances but at the ease with which Gould enters into, say, a Bach fugue, whether for a few measures or for the entire piece, and then reemerges to deliver some extraordinary insight in a mannered but impeccable spoken prose...

Wow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty entertaining","review":"Bought this on a Lightning Deal, and have enjoyed it so far.

Every one! It didn't seem to matter if they were small or larger -- or even larger than the ear piece.

Instead, notice that the Jawbone comes with two round earbuds that appear to be identical. Tear the rubber shroud off one of them to expose the round plastic piece inside of it. Take this plastic piece and lock it onto the Jawbone (read user's manual). The Eargels will slip over this piece and hold quite firmly to the headset. Notice also that the Eargels have a square notch on the inside. Point the notch toward the back of the Jawbone. This will align the piece properly with the ear.The Eargels allow the Jawbone to be securely held in the ear without the annoyingly difficult earloop, but cause a little discomfort in my ear because I have to use the larger pieces. With the earloop, I can use the smallest piece and the Eargels are very comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I need two sizes!","review":"I love these eargels.

You can remove the rubber piece and press these over the part that it was attached to and they will stay, but they do come out with a little tug. A fine line of rubber cement will fix that though, and it peels off if necessary. But the great thing is that they will hold the Jabra in your ear without the ear loop. And that's huge, especially for someone like me with really weird shaped ears that nothing else [except an over the head headset] seemed to work. All in all worth the cost easily.

Even the classic scene involving Argos the dog was ommitted from this modern creation.

The motion picture depiction of Homer's work is a lame collection of attempted action scenes that does nothing to keep the watcher entertained throughout this movie. The human characters along with those mythical creatures they encounter respond to events without using common sense that anyone with half a brain would use.

It was made to be acceptable to the US TV market, but I suspect the production team was European.To my knowledge, there has yet to be a good film/TV adaptation of the Odyssey.

The casting was brilliant: Armand Asante is all that one could wish in an Odysseus -- engaging, passionate, mature, heroic in every dimension. Isabella Rosellini and Greta Saachi are perfect in their roles as Athena and Penelope, respectively. Telemachus is a classical adolescent only child, and Antichea, Odysseus's mother, dominates each of her scenes.

Personally, I thought the re-telling to be convincing, I liked the way they kept the story moving (it IS trying to cover 20 years) and found the special effects \\"good enough.\\" My kids have worn out the VHS tape and I'm buying a DVD because we enjoy the movie.Lastly, just a pet peeve for other reviewers who complained that Telemachus' double spear throw defied physics...HELLLO!!! last I checked, three headed monsters defied biology!..and that whole Hermes flying thing, totally bogus eh? People..this would be a FANTASY with GODS and GODDESSES, not the new BBC special \\"Walking with Odysseus!\\" Sheesh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I saw this movie for first time having missed it when it first aired. I thought the special effects were amazing and my favorite sequence was the cyclops. The scene where the ship goes over the edge was very amazing, after that the story just seemed to grind to a halt. Much to long and boring after the first hour and a half. But well worth the rental if you like special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book; terrible movie","review":"if you have read and liked the book, or know anything about the story, this movie would certainly want to make you want to kill yourself. odysseus is portraid as rugged, stupid barbarian who is nothing like the hero Homer described him as. the special effects aren't too uplifting either, although it was a pretty low budget film. all of the events in the movie are nothing like in the book; it was as thought the writer's had never even read it!!! bad acting, cheesy special effects, and a completely inaccurate plot make Hallmark's version of the odyssey one of the worst movies to ever come out of a classic novel. in conclusion, i'd rather go to Hades than watch this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Homer's enchanting tale","review":"Homer's enchanting tale is brought to life in \\"The Odyssey.\\"I, a student, first saw this movie while studying Ancient Greece with my class. On the first day of Ancient Greece, my teacher popped the video in the VCR and made us take catagorized notes.Since it was our first day we had no idea about Greece's history, gods and goddesses, heroes or political science.However, the Odyssey told my class and I a great deal about Greece.One of the reasons why I reccommend this movie, is your (or your child, for that matter) don't know too much on Ancient Greece, you put the movie in the VCR, and 2 hours done with the credits rolling, you will know so much about Ancient Greece.It occured to me that in this movie The Odyssey about Odysseus leaving Ithaca for the Trojan war and fight the curse of Poseidon, underneath it all there is the political science and the goddesses and gods history and way of life and the scenery.Over all this is an amazing movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the classroom","review":"This video is great to use as a resource for teaching The Odyssey. The students find the video entertaining and helpful. However, the movie does not exactly follow the original Odyssey. Of course, the directors took some creative liberty on certain scenes. On the whole, the movie does a great job in giving students an account of the journey of Odysseus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I loved this movie! The special effects were great and Armand Assante did a great job acting the part of Odysseus. My daughter even sat down and watched it with me, which doesn't happen very often.

However, I DO show selected scenes (out of sequence because the movie is out of sequence) just because my students think it's fun. WHEN will a GOOD version be made??? I had such hopes for Troy, and meh....My students' favorite part is the inexplicable arm action of the guard who announces \\"Tele-machos of Ithaka!\\" Scenery WILL be chewed - even the usually OK Greta Scacci comes off rather poorly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hallmark Entertainment needs to join us in the 21st Century","review":"It is extremely sad that Hallmark Entertainment has not realized that hard of hearing and deaf people need closed captioning to understand the product they are marketing.

First of all, there's Poseidon. This CG bill shut is an outrage to humanity. His rolling waveface accompanied by Assanti's pitiful attempt to weep provides an outstanding performance which may (being optimistic) top the emotion found in a dramatic episode of Mr. Rogers. I am certain that if poor old (really old) Homer were given a second life to live in this century, he would probably waste it by inflicting himself with chimera. With all due respect, though none is due, this film is pathetic. That's all I have to say.

Personally i think the only ppl this movie does good too are druggies and wanna-be drop outs who dont want to read the book or buy the cliff notes so they watch the movie. its absolutley horrible. Mr. Noteboom is a very bright and brillant honors teacher in Washington state. I must say i agree with every honor student's last year review of this book.

When I heard a mini-series of the Odyssey was being created I was anxious for two reasons; I was dying to see it and was terrified of how badly it was going to be butchered. This was a delightful surprise.To my amazement the writers took some minor literary license with the story but all in all it worked. What is even better...it was a lot of fun to watch. I would recommend that anyone thinking about buying this do so... but also buy the book. Turn your brain off watch the movie, engage the brain again and read the original story. Either way you are promised a good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of date, but good","review":"_Heroes of Civilization_ is Cottler and Jaffe's attempt to give brief biographical sketches of some of the most important scientists of the last few centuries.

Appropriate for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ONLY translation of Schure's play...","review":"**This is the only book that Schure's masterful drama is given in an English translation.**This book is so rare, and I mean so rare that I had to go to a small town called Dornach in Switzerland to find it!!!And of course, it is out-of-print, and so unknown that it will probably never be re-printed again in history....not to say even performed, unless a Schure enthusiast like myself undertakes a task like that!This is the play that the philosopher Rudolf Steiner took as the model to his own 4 Mystery Dramas. Schure (who was friends with the composer Richard Wagner) was one of Steiner's greatest admirers, and vice versa, and interestingly enough Schure was the one to introduce Steiner to his future wife Marie von Sivers!This play by Schure is really a monument to all ancient Drama and heralds in the new Dramatic form taken up by Rudolf Steiner.

Of course, the cover makes a great prank at cocktail parties. Place it under someone's drink and it will look like the beverage has been spilled.Winston's book is not only disorganized, but pretentious. He writes about the mind as if he has the authority of a philosopher of mind, when, in fact, he's just a programmer.

The end of the book should have been put at the first so we could know Ben Holladay before we learned all about the difficulties of getting the people and the mail to the western cities.

The new version with Patrick Stewart had it's moments, but Peck as Father Maple looked like he was in a daze and didn't know where he was (or who he was) Peck's performance was rather disturbing. The actor who played Quee-Queg in this newer version was more like a cartoon. The actor in the 1950's version was far more convincing.Patrick Stewart wasn't a bad choice for Ahab, but to me it was more like Stewart PLAYING AHAB v.s. BEING THE CHARACTER. I kept expecting him to shout \\"ENGAGE\\" rather than \\"THERE SHE BLOWS\\".For students of the book, the original 1950 version was closer to the text. This new version had far too many added bits for the purist. If you enjoy remakes, (I don't know why) then go for it. If you are a stickler for detail, pass it"},{"rating":"1","title":"1956 beats 1998 by several nautical miles","review":"So disappointing! How could a movie made 40 years later be so much worse than the original? Patrick Stewart was great as Ahab but that's where the compliments end.

Yes, that does make me a freak of nature.One of my favorite characters is Ahab's harpooner/attendant demon Fedellah who was completely ignored in the John Huston/Ray Bradbury movie version, but, alas and alack, this Fedellah not only does not have a great white mane worn like a turban on his \\"Persian\\" head in this movie but he is a bald Asian with a Fu Man Chu mustache.I know. Picky, picky, picky. And Flask has a pipe not Stubb. Alas. Still, it has fairly wonderful production values and if you don't have a Fedellah fetish, you'll probably like this one. Queequeg rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, an excellent movie.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Not having read Melville's book, this movie gave me much more of an understanding of Ahab and his tortured soul than the Gregory Peck version. Excellent acting by Stewart and the rest of the cast. My only complaint is with Moby Dick himself - the rubber whale used in the scenes is not very convincing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly entertaining","review":"I guess I'm in the minority, but I enjoyed this production quite a bit and highly recommend it. Patrick Stewart makes a terrific Captain Ahab, seething with a personal obsession with the white whale, and the rest of the cast is quite good, too. The film is faithful to the book and the production values are excellent. Highly entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pitiful excuse for a movie","review":"If you want to see a movie of Moby Dick, see the John Huston directed version, with screenplay by Ray Bradbury. This pitiful excuse for a movie was made by people who had no knowledge of New England, whaling, whales, or Herman Melville's epic novel. The grand poetry, the vivid imagery, the theological symbolism which fill \\"Moby Dick\\" are all missing in this shell of a film. Even Stewart's performance is a disappointment--Khan in Star Trek II does a better job of spouting Ahab's venom than Stewart's anemic portrayal.The additions to the story are meaningless (Chinese harpooners, Queequeg's \\"BLAH!\\" noises,Ahab's family)...and the omissions are puzzling (Elijah).And the rubber whale--who is unscarred, unmarked by corkscrew harpoons, ungrizzled, unbarnacled, with no flight of gulls--well, he looks like a rubber whale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moby Dick","review":"Movie was great but the sub-titles were \\"off\\" and distracting (but hilarious at times!)

This made-for-TV adaptation makes me wonder if the screenwriters and director even read the original book. Not only is the character of Queegueg depicted incorrectly as a Mauri of New Zealand (in reality Melville based the character on the Nuku-Hivans), but he is treated as a buffoonish and stereotypical \\"savage\\" which is completely at odds with the dignified character that Melville created. Additionally, the filmmakers dreamt up a bizarre scene where the Pequod is stranded in the ice of the Antarctic! They must have been reading Mary Shelly's Frankenstien at the time. Patrick Stewart's performance as Ahab however, is wonderful, but that's the only redeeming feature of this overblown mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Round Perditions Flames","review":"I though this was a great film mainly because of the acting, Patrick Stewart, best known as Captain Picard from Star Trek the Next Generation, fits the Character of Ahab perfectly.

As a matter of fact, there are a lot of books and even good books treating this topic, but T.L. Hill has been able to introduce it in a simple and comprehensive way. In particular, I found particularly interesting his manner to treat the liquid state and the distribution functions (Part III). The last part is devoted to quantum statistics, it is an introduction but is well written and for a young student will be enlightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice companion to McQuarrie's text","review":"I thought this was a terriable book by itself, but makes for a nice companion when reading through McQuarrie's book.

One can usually find the answers (or at least some hints) within this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"No better place to start with Stat Mech","review":"If you are intrested with studing statistical mechanics then start here. Hill starts from the defintions and postulates of thermodynamics and then moves into applications and problems. You will need to understand Diff EQ for this book.The first chapter took me a week to read and work out the math but then I red the rest in 4 weeks. It is a hard start because Hill develops your background before starting with applications of the theory. I really began to grasp the subject after reading this book. Ohter books will not lay the mathout as well as Hill does. It is a hard read because Hill is so thorough, but the rewasd is well worth the struggle. It is a great introduction and I suggest all of Hill's Stat mech book.

She apparently did no research at all. Amnesia of the type she describes here does not exist. Thus, the underlying premise of this book unbelievable, even infuriating, to anyone with the most basic knowledge of brain injury. In addition to this, Monk's investigative skills are virtually nonexistent. His interviews with informants and suspects are fragmentary and incomplete. Suspense is not built, action is nearly absent, and the eventual solution is anticlimactic. Laden with turgid prose, this book is absolutely dreadful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Having heard the author speak on the radio, her works praised highly by the host, I decided to start with the first of the Monk series. Unfortunately, I found the main character thoroughly unsympathetic and unlikable. The story was slow as molasses with bits and pieces of useless information thrown in to fatten the book. Also, I don't know the clinical features of amnesia, but it seemed that Monk's memory loss was selective and inconsistent. The ending was highly anti-climactic and the fate of the characters in question never revealed. I was very much looking forward to reading her books, but was sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"This was the first Anne Perry book I have read, but it will be the last.

Over the course of this book, he returns to his job as a policeman, hoping that work will help him regain his memory as well as his detecting skills. What's fascinating is that not all he discovers about his life before the accident is flattering--including the fact that he may very well have been responsible for a serious crime. Over the course of Perry's new series--this book being the debut--Monk's past will at various times haunt, delight, and maybe even endanger him, and the people who come to be his allies don't always like him, but their loyalties to one another shine through. As with the Pitt mysteries, Anne Perry's trademark detail and eye-opening descriptions of what Victorian life was really like make this an entertaining way to read away a winter afternoon"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the slowest and most non-action, action movie ever.","review":"To start off, this movie lacks any direction, also there is no build up of excitment, no rising interest, and little or no action till the very end.

For me, the movie feels like a Columbo epidose (the dramatic music) but the film is average, showing few plot, fight scenes or action. The biggest action scene is an explosion of a small wooden boat and a chase scene with cars going as fast as 25 mph!

Could have done with more DVD features for a region code free DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems every time Van Damme plays a bad guy he does his mute method acting","review":"Black Eagle was released a few months after Van Damme became a star with Bloodsport.

It is a part of flea control and should not be expected to be the one answer for every flea. Pets need to have flea medicine/baths as well as continuous vacuuming of the house since fleas can live on pet hair. A flea cycle is 21 days-using this product in a combination with proper flea control is the best way to get the maximum performance. Spray where pet sleeps, all carpets, furniture, area rugs, and fabrics where fleas can lay eggs. Keep it up once a week or more for the first 3 weeks to break the flea cycle while applying flea medication to your pets. Humans can carry fleas into the house as well as pets. The trick is to stay on top of the flea cycle so it doesn't become out of hand. If it is allowed to go through a few cycles without proper flea control, it will take much more effort, time, and products to get it under control."},{"rating":"1","title":"create your own flea circus","review":"I had used this product at the urging of the pet store clerk.

I returned after a few hours, opened the widows and started up the air conditioners and picked up the dog. The next day I noticed several adult fleas, though they were sluggish. I thought..great! Then the family started getting bites and seeing small and adult fleas. I feel I wasted my money for a product that seemed to give us 24hrs of relief.

Has 3 lock tite latches on outside and 3 holes for pad locks for when you travel. Is airline approved. My husband has not has a chance to take it on a plane yet so not known how it would stand up, but my 1 1/2 yr. old twins liked to knock it over and stand on it a lot when it was within their reach. So I think it would hold up well for air travel if it could stand 2 kids without damaging the bow inside.

And you have to put in the arrow holders when they should be able to put that together at the factory.Pros-Easy to take, compact, lightweight, holds arrows, holds everything you need, big enough, not too small, good foam padding.OVERALL it's a really nice case especially for the money. i would buy this case 1,000,000 times again. everything is great. the only not so good thing is the construction. it's nice. don't get me wrong. but it's a little flimsy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plano Compact Bow Case","review":"For the price its an excellent bow case.

However, even compared to these releases, this CD is the bomb. The first few tracks really jump out at you as infectious dance floor groovers.

Are you kidding me?","review":"Yep, that was my reaction when I first heard of the girth of this book. I tend to believe that if you can't write a good story under 600 pages or a very little bit more, you can't write a good story period. I stopped picking up any book over 600 pages by authors I didn't already like years ago. And even though I really like the work of Lackey, Flint, and Freer, it did take me a few weeks to go get it and then read it. I read it in about two and a half days, a better pace than many a book half it's length. The characters are all worth reading about no matter who you fell most drawn to. The world is a little harder to adjust to than the run of the mill (DRECK!!) stuff that is usually based on northern European mythology were English is the norm and German and French are thrown in for 'culture' and 'scope'. Not only a good read but it has put any follow on's into the top portion of my must buy list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This book was disappointing. It has too many major characters that are inadequately developed and too many plot lines to follow. The magic is an awkward add-in that the book could well have been written without.The first half of the book's plot, several of the characters, and the setting closely resemble one of C. J. Cherryh's Merovingian Nights stories, which was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"Mercedes Lackey is one of my favorite Authors. This book was such a let down, so much about nothing. The different plot lines were written by different people and you can tell where one picks up and one leaves off. it was a very irritating style.There are so many characters it's easy to mix them up.

So, of course, I picked this book up at my local store. After wrestling through 50 pages, I gave up!

Now he thinks that this is a good example of her work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest!","review":"A large part of this book has been cannibalized from an earlier series, Merovingen Nights, a shared world based on a novel by C.J Cherryh (Angel with the Sword). This fact is mentioned nowhere in the book or cover and no credit to C.J. Cherryh is given for the concept.This book is a pale imitation of the original sections of the series that Lackey wrote. In my opinion some of the best writing Lackey has done are in the original series. Unfortunately, the series was never completed and the books are now out of print. I find it sad that Lackey has to resort to presenting previously written work as new. Clearly, she has run out of original ideas and her best works are behind her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternate Italian Renaissance Light History","review":"Any book set in the Renaissance is pretty much bound to be a complex amalgam of plots and counter plots. This book lives up to its setting in history. I was cautious in approaching a book that was written by three authors, expecting writing dissonance and perhaps some plot danglies. But the authors did a very good job of developing characters and coherent plot. I didn't expect anything along the lines of a serious historial novel, and so was not disappointed. I would almost classify this as a Young Adult book because the majority of the main characters are in the process of coming of age. This is light fare that is well enough written and well plotted to engage your attention. Very light on the fantasy element, and light on characterization - - but don't think that any of the characters are cardboard cutouts. The plot is woven well enough and moves fast enough that deep characterization isn't missed. Well done entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST GREAT","review":"So it was long, and it was a slow read, big DEAL. Ms Lackey and cohorts have spun a gripping, involved tale of GREAT characters, involved PLOTTING and lots of FUN. I read for pleasure and this was a pleasure. I was always looking back to keep things straight, but it was FUN. I lost most of two nights sleep because I couldn't put it down. This team should write lots of sequels, and I WILL BUY THEM ALL.Be warned, if you pick up this book and start reading you will suffer.

The Shadow of the Lion was a major disappointment to me, not to mention I could have spent my money more wisely on another book.

It is very obvious it is a collaboration and it needs the hand of a better editor.

The female vocals in my opinion were better than the male vocals. A five star review is out of the question because the male vocals in fact were not very impressive at all. At times, I was so impressed with the background elements that I just wished the male vocals would just stop.

The characters are one dimensional, the acting is sluggish, the dialogue is banal and contrived, the directing is awful, but worst of all, the script is terrible. The screenplay oozes simplistic simple minded notions of political correctness and insight where there is none. Audrey Wells purports to have written a complex and surprising story with unexpected twists and turns, but what she has produced is a shallow and unsatisfying film with no real purpose other than to make the fairly obvious point that life is full of surprises and unexpected outcomes. Gee - what an insight. The characters are completely unsympathetic and the only thing that makes this film watchable at all is the backdrop of Cortona.

Watching Diane Lanes character as she gets over her divorce, and moves to a foreign country by herself is inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart warming movie","review":"I saw the movie last night in a preview showing. I found it to be very charming. The best part of the movie by far is the cinematography. Tuscany and Italy in general are both places that I have never been before but just seeing this movie makes me want to go there all the more. I felt that the story line of this movie has a few holes but otherwise is very entertaining. My reccomendation would be to see this movie in a matine or wait until it comes out on video."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN!","review":"I eagerly anticipated watching this movie, as I thoroughly enjoyed the book; however, the movie shares only a passing resemblance to the book. It gets 2 stars because I enjoy Diane Lane and Tuscany is gorgeous, but other than that the movie was dull, Lane's character is nothing short of pathetic, and the ending is trite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not follow the book much. Had to insert all the PC garbage.","review":"Not bad entertainment...but the book is better, at least according to my wife who chose the movie after reading the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable escapism","review":"Fun and light but, a bit unrealistic. Just let go and enjoy! Diane Lane and Sandra Oh are great! Linsay Duncan steals the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie night","review":"Well, this was a perfect ending to a long busy day. I ordered the movie under the Tucson Sun to sit back and relax. It was very very enjoyable. I'm saying all this in a long-winded way because this review requires I write 20 words. This is actually kind of a pain because I am turned off about writing anything about these. But it was a fine purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice scenery, but MAD CHEESIE storyline","review":"I was pretty darn cheesed out by this movie. It's definitely nice to look at, and Diane Lane is a very lovely woman. However, the characters were all sugary sweet cheeseballs, and Diane Lane's character had no spine.Sandra Oh was great, as usual."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book is WAY Better..and That's all You Really Need to Know!","review":"Don't waste your money on a DVD unless: 1) You just want to see beautiful Italian scenery (and it is gorgeous!) or 2) You actually enjoy watching a whiny, sniveling, pathetic female character waiting for a man to fulfill her life. Doubt if the author was thrilled with this version of her story. BUY THE BOOK!!! It's a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible stinker!","review":"What a stupid movie! There was nothign admirable in the main character. What the heck was she thinking in sleeping with a man she hadn't even known for a day! That is not realistic at all. The whole storyline had no logical sequence. Stay away from this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"I love the full screen edition of the movie.

It came and I put it in to watch it; it stopped playing 3/4 of the way through!!! I tried it in all of our devices and it did the same thing each time! Very disappointed!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Pleasant Story","review":"Diane Lane gives a great performance in this romantic/fantasy driven movie.

Great message ... unbelievably good things can happen ... even later in life. Breathtaking views of Italy ... This movie never loses its magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you read the book, don't watch the movie!","review":"I really enjoyed this book, but I was very disappointed by the movie. Rather than a story about the Italian countryside and the adventure of remodeling a home in a foreign country, this movie was about a divorced woman looking for love and her gay friend's dramatic life. Blah. I had wanted to see the charming Polish workers and the quaint Italian villages that were an important part of the original story. Oh well, this wasn't the movie for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked the book, you will not like this film.","review":"Unfortunately, the screenwriter completely changed the story of Under the Tuscan Sun. True, the main character did buy a villa in Tuscany. However, this story primarily concerns Diane Lane's trauma of divorce and trying to find herself in Italy. The film has very little about the trials of her renovation of the villa. Most importantly, the film says nothing about the book's description of life in a small Tuscan village and the people who live there. I was very disappointed in the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The biggest surprise of the year! This film is a marvel!","review":"We'll I'm not usually one to go to see comedy-romance films but my girlfriend insisted and I was persuaded by the fact that Diane Lane (one of my favorite actresses) was starring in it. Honestly, this is a very good movie. It is one of the best surprises of the year. The film is edited in a way that never makes it seem boring or long-winded and the film is very (I mean very) entertaining, with some great dialog and some excellent comedy and well-timed laughs. A few times I was uncontrollably laughing it was so funny. The acting was amazing with Diane Lane giving one of her best performances in the lead role as Frances Mayes. The film looked great and had an excellent soundtrack as well. I recommend this film very much indeed, even to guys because it isn't cliched and slushy in the same way other romantic films are. It sure makes a great date movie - Under The Tuscan Sun is a marvel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Guys miss this one","review":"Gentlemen miss this movie. As a married man I am consigned to the fact that I must watch certain movies that are geared towards the ladies, I am okay with that. Having suffered through most of said type of movies, I can say that this particular movie is a truly a painful experience without any humor to help. All this movie does is follow a sad and lonely woman around Italy and waste the two hours that is the movie running time. Do not buy this movie for the lady in your life because then you will be forced to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best chick flicks ever","review":"Diane Lane is perfect. Plays the full range of female - bold, timid, snotty, exuberant and everything in between. Watch it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Relationships in Tuscany","review":"This is a lovely movie set in the stunning beauty of Tuscany. It deftly explores several types of relationships from that of a recent divorcee, to the break up of a gay union to young lovers in a Romeo and Juliet type romance. The divorcee finally discovers that a meaningful relationship doesn't depend on one person but a variety of people. Well worth seeing - you will enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a change from the book","review":"Yes, you get lovely views of Tuscany and yes, she is renovating a run down villa. Otherwise, it is pretty much a new story. For those who loved the book, just make that mental adjustment and start with a fresh slate and you will enjoy the parallel blossoming in the movie of the woman and her house.I took off one star since it put my husband to sleep, but I found it a pleasant enough romance with good scenery. The main character is lovely and the various subplots such as the Polish laborer romancing a local girl expands the story to pull in the younger audience, I presume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful People. Beautiful Scenery. Not so beautiful Plot","review":"Beautiful Scenery. Beautiful People. Thin Plot. Diane Lane is gorgeous in this film and her performance was excellent - she just needed a better script to work with. Her friendship with the men who remodel her house is one of the good things in the film. Much of the rest of the film is just too much escapism for me. Why do movies seem to always portray the solution to pain and heartache as running away and starting a new life? I would think that if I was hurting - the last thing I would want is to be thousands of miles away from my closest friends and family. And in a new culture, where I didn't speak the language?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very charming warm movie on a cold winter Saturday afternoon","review":"This movie is very warm toned and sincere. I really give a lot of credit to film makers who can create a romantic comedy that is not contrived and unoriginal. Under the Tuscan Sun is a fresh romantic comedy that has a heart.Of course this is not a masterpiece that will change your perception of life and leave you breathless, but it will leave you smiling for at least a half an hour after it is over.Also, it has a really good point. So many times we force things to happen in our lives and and become totally frustrated in the process. It is indeed so much easier to just \\"fall asleep and let the ladybugs crawl all over you\\". You will see what I mean when you watch the movie.Highly recommended enterntainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"My only complaint is the length of time it took to arrive. Could not use a gift as planned. Somehow, shipping needs to be speedier!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for you and your gal friends to watch together!","review":"Pop the popcorn. Open a bottle of wine. Call your girlfriends and to come over and watch this movie and have a little party. This is a great girl movie!! Diane Lane is great in this movie and it really is all about her....and she carries this movie so well. You will enjoy meeting the people that come in and out of her life on her journey through life and her journey to Tuscany. Call your friends and let this movie entertain you!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable & Light","review":"When I go to the movies, I go to relax and enjoy a break from everday life. Who cares if it is realisitc or not. Being a romantic comedy buff, I found this movie entertaining and refreshing. Anyone who wants to enjoy a light movie will enjoy this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!","review":"This is supposed to be a romantic comedy, yet there are no comic moments. I could see the potential for comedy, but it just wasn't there. Maybe it's Diane Lane or maybe it's the director. I kept wondering if Lane was playing a teenager or an adult. I couldn't get involved with the character at all. She seemed to be faking it all the way through. I would've given no stars, but I thought the Italian countryside deserved at least 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming surprise...","review":"This is such a feel-good film. Diane lane does a wonderful job playing the woman who leaves behind everything and starts over new. The people she meets, the scenery, the neuroses are all charming in their own way. Where Eat, Pray, Love failed, this film succeeded. A woman sets out to find herself after a personal disappointment, but rather than the whiny arrogant character of Julia Roberts in Eat, Pray, Love, Diane Lane's character has a relatable warmth and energy despite her situation. i highly recommend this film for a rainy day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opposing View of Divorce","review":"The heart break and loss from a womans point of view,abused by the court system, robbed of her hard earned home and possessons to a new and very different life in a strange country and different culture. Ms. Lanes best effort in an attention holding and often surprising, recovery. Beautiful scenery and superior directing make this one of movie lands best kept secrets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undercover?","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed watching another T.V. while this show was playing out in the family room. The wife got a good night sleep and didn't even bother to replay the part she missed. After complaining, Hollywood Video gave us a comp, so all in all, we felt like we got our money's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good flick","review":"Yes i'm a guy and yes i enjoy chic flicks from time to time,so sue me.This is a good film from Diane Lane(best known for her great performance in Unfaithful)which was also the first flim i recall her having a main staring role.I won't get in to deep to the story but she is a recent divorcy,whom feels she can't go on living in San Fransico,so her 2 gay lesbian friends convince her to go on an all gay trip to tuscan(italy).While there she becomes intrigued by a 300 year old italian home,mind you nothing works,and its in pretty sad shape.So she hires contractor's to help her with her project,and all along the way she runs into various men whom you think she'll develop an attraction to and maybe more but it never pan's out.So thats all i'll give for now,watch for yourself.Although it seems a little slow in places it's an entertaining little piece of film none the less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This movie was very boring and hard to get into. I started falling asleep in the first fifteen minutes. It's a very chick flick type of movie and I suggest men do not see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you KIDDING ME????","review":"Frances Mayes sold out! She sold the title of her best seller book to hollywood and they used it to create romance novel drivel! It contains very little her sweet, beautiful tribute to Tuscany. What a shame! While I liked Diane Lane I was completely disappointed in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Drawn Out Movie","review":"I watched the movie before reading the book. The movie was so bad that I felt compelled to read the book to see if it could redeem itself. The characters as depicted in the movie were very one dimensional and I just didn't care about them or what happened to them. The book tells a totally different story than is depicted in the movie and is SO MUCH BETTER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent movie! Diane Lane shines!","review":"A truly magnificent movie. Diane Lane shines in her role as Frances Mayes in this funny, sweet, enjoyable piece of great entertainment. The director makes this movie so engrossing and enjoyable that it is impossible to not be drawn into the wonderfully realized 3D characters and the brilliant played out scenes. The scenic locations help and so does the likable characters. Make no mistake... this is a magnificent movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional film - genuinely funny, moving and entertaining","review":"Genuinely funny and moving - exceptional film.This is an exceptional film that shows that no matter what life throws at you, the human spirit can survive and make a comeback. I love films that show you the inner strength of the human spirit and peoples faith. The film is genuinely affecting - it is funny, very moving and it looks exceptional on a big screen. Most of all though this film entertains without resorting to cliches and melodrama. Diane Lane is exceptional and deserves Oscar recognition for creating such a three dimensional and believable heroine. The acting from everyone is first rate and the direction is fresh and infectious. An exceptional film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid movie","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this movie. The story had no sense of direction. It seemed too badly glued together, as if the scriptwriters were just adding more things as they went along, saying, \\"we'll make her a divorced woman...and then we'll make her go on a gay tour...and oh wait, let's make her have no morals and have sex with a man she hasn't known for even one day...and lets make her flirt with the married real estate man.\\" All in all, the story turned out to be pretty stupid with nothing to admire in the main character."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it was not for Diane Lane....","review":"If it was not for Diane Lane, this movie would have been a total loser. It's a swindle. It's advertised as \\"romantic comedy\\", when there is little (if any) comedy. It's boring, it portrays the Italians with all the cliches available. Blegh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tuscany steals the show","review":"This title was on my Amazon recommended list, and since I never heard of it before I decided to pick it up.In short, I think ANY movie would benefit from being set and shot in Tuscany Italy. This one did. Without the beautiful backdrop - I don't think I would have watched the whole thing. A patchwork story-line, left me with the feeling that it had a lot of interesting bits and pieces BUT it appeared that they were put together for no apparent reason.It just wasn't believable.Maybe rent it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diane Lane feast...","review":"Man, hardly have I watched a movie this long (one hour and 53 minutes) that portrays the leading character in every (I mean, every!!) single scene, every single second of the whole movie!This is a bonus if you are a Diane Lane fan (and who is not? The woman is simply gorgeous, besides being a very good actress!), but otherwise youl will be imersed in a chick flick all along, and a bad one by the way, one that will lead you absolutely nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-Hum","review":"One of the biggest disappointments I have seen in some time. My main complaint is when I see a theatrical trailer for a movie, and that rrailer implies the movie is a comedy, and then the movie does not deliver what the trailer seems to have promised, I hit the ceiling.There are characters in this movie who's inclusion makes no sense since they don't advance the plot and don't really come off as amusing either.The whole premise of buying a house in a foreign country in which you barely speak the language makes no sense either.I don't know -- maybe it's me -- it seems like the time would have been better spent watching a travel film on Tuscany.Ho-HUM!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"barely cosi cosi (so so)","review":"This might be an ok movie to watch on a weekend when you're bored and have absolutely nothing better to do. Of course it's nothing like the book. It's terribly contrived with some very unlikely scenes. For example, there's this one scene where the long-haired Chinese man that shows up for an extended visit after his girlfriend dumps him actually gives birth. That just can't happen in real life!! Guys can't get pregant (yet)!! Anyway, forget about the movie. Read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but typical","review":"So-so at it's best. Great scenery. Good-looking men, but so typically \\"chick-flick\\" despite the true story. Diane Lane's character is a disillusioned divorcee who takes a trip to Italy and on a whim decides to buy a house in the local area. Intitially, there is frustration as the maintenance and upkeep of the house becomes overwhelming, but in time, her curious neighbors become very close friends and she eventually becomes intertwined in their cheerful lives. In a country where love and passion is so rampant, why does she feel so lonely? When wil her true amore come into her life?Cute flick, but not much depth to the story with very typical characters. The cinematography is lovely, though. Great flick for an empty afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"Under the Tuscan Sun was such an enjoyable movie.Diane Lane is just great in the starring role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Movie!!!","review":"I absolutely HATED this movie. It was SUCH a waste of my time. The first ten minutes made the movie seem worth watching, but then the storyline, along with my desire to watch it, fell dramatically after that. It was not worth my time! I couldn't wait for the credits to come. I found myself fast forwarding through parts, just to get through it quicker. The main character, Diane Lane, annoyed me. Plus, the storyline was depressing. Nothing ever went right in her life. I don't see what other people see in it. I would not recommend watching this movie, unless you actually like being bored senseless."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worthy to be a chick flick","review":"First, this movie has nothing to do whatsoever with the book except for the title. That said, once again Diane Lane plays someone who is supposed to be sympathetic as if she's a sociopath. Really - when she looks serious, you think she's about to kill someone. When she's happy she looks like she just did. Then you have the fact that nothing that happens in the movie is realistic at all -- except, if someone like Cameron Diaz were in the title role, we'd probably not care and even enjoy it. I feel used and cheap after being duped into watching this movie and I'm no longer going to waste my time on DL's films. She doesn't deliver. If she plays a Black Widow, I'll watch. If she plays another sensitive caring woman, I'll hurl first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gutless garbage","review":"\\"Under The Tuscan Sun\\": Ridiculous, nauseating doggerel with terrible acting; ineptly, superficially, and condescendingly trawling all the most banal cliches about Tuscany and Italy, divorce and midlife. The main actor nervously grimaces her way through the film, struggling to portray the appropriate level of smug, self-congratulatory self-pity the worthless character and script call for. I'm sure the book was bad, but it can't have been this bad! The camera is permanently fitted with a vomit-yellow \\"Tuscan\\" lense filter (perhaps the Tuscan sun wasn't Tuscan enough?), which they forgot to remove when the scene shifts to Rome and (how imaginative!) the Amalfi coast. You've never seen the white marble of Rome's Vittorio Emmanuelle monument looking so yellow... I mean Tuscan. One of the worst movies ever, and therefore quite worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WALTZ OF SCHMALTZ ~ AMORE' ABORE'","review":"Under the Tuscan Sun, sounds like a dish at Macaroni Grill, and the movie itself plays like a pre-processed plate of bland Italiano. Implausable plot, rediculous faux feel good moments.Diane Lane is so better than this cheesy little movie ..its Money Pit meets The View. Lets invent a new genre of movies, lets call this Terra Cotta Trite.I wont divulge the plot, because you can't prove a negative.

However, I was absolutely offended by some of the content of this film. In the first 15 minutes, you're introduced to a lesbian couple as they greet each other with a kiss on the mouth, and then announce that they're having a baby together. In the same scene, the main character uses the f--- word and it sounds like it was inserted into the script simply for the shock value. Also, there's teenage (and adult) premarital sex. Overall the film has a very casual attitude about sex and shows some rather graphic scenes for a PG-13 film. It's just another attempt by Hollywood to get us all comfortable with homosexuality, promiscuity, and a general idea of \\"If it feels good, do it.\\" I would strongly advise against seeing this movie, especially with kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Movie!!!","review":"I absolutely HATED this movie.

There is a scene where an old woman calls ayoung German couple \\"facists\\". The irony is, the old lady is Italian. Whoever wrote the scene doesn't own I history book Iguess. That's a little on the predjudice side for me and it didn't belong in a comedy. I'm glad the couple weren't African-American, I wonder what she would have called them.Don't support this garbage by buying it, loan it from your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Woman finds herself in Italy","review":"Francis just got divorced from her husband, and is depressed.

She soon finds that Tuscany is just what she needed and sees a house that she then buys to her friend's astonishment.With a bunch of friends including a former model, a bunch of Polish construction workers Francis asked to fix the house, and a neighbor she starts to heal. It also doesn't hurt that while she was in Rome she met a man that does not turn out to be Mr. Right, but turns out being good for her self-esteem.A very good movie about starting over"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this really a 'chick flick'??????","review":"I think TUSCAN SUN is a study in what is so wonderful about the Tuscany and Cinque Terra part of Italy.....Diane Lane is a favorite of mine. Ever since I saw her in COTTON CLUB I have liked her. I guess in some minds the story could be conjured up as a chick flick. And why? because she gets a divorce from a guy who apparently is having a midlife crisis??? or is it because she packs up and heads off on a gay holiday provided by two lesbian friends?...But this is how she finds the abode of her dreams!.....Actually more like a nightmare.I think it is a film that deserves the accolades it has gotten, but not because it would only be appreciated by 'chicks', but by anyone who loves Tuscany the way I do.The cast of characters in TUSCAN SUN was a study in why I love to sit and watch the parade go by when I travel. It is one of the facinating parts of travel for me.....locales are not the only thing exotic about it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"IS OK...I GUESS","review":"THIS MOVIE WAS GIVEN TO ME BY A FRIEND, THOUGHT I WOULD ENJOY IT, AND IN A WAY I DID, I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD SEE IT NOT BUY IT.THE SCENERY WAS AMAZING, THE STORY WAS A BIT DOWN.

It arrived just in time and I could keep track (via UPS) where it was, since I purchased it being in Puerto Rico."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diane Lane and Under The Tuscan Sun","review":"This is a good movie. It had the misfortune of coming out around the same time as Julia Robert's feminist 'Mona Lisa Smile' and being sometimes confused with that film by critics. This is not a feminist, male-bashing movie. And it isn't entirely a 'chic flick' either. Diane Lane is apparently very picky about the roles she plays and the films she appears in. This is another good choice for her.There are plenty of reviews here telling what this film is about. I'll simply tell you that I bought the DVD for my wife, but I usually watch it with her. It is a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting and Beautiful","review":"The scenery in this film was breathtaking- the countryside, the house, the people, the food- the way of life in general was just inspriring.What made this movie great, though, was the romance between Frances and Marcello. In any typical romantic comedy, the broken-down and lonely Frances would have met Marcello and all her problems would have been solved. The end. But in this film, Frances thinks her life has turned around and that she has found the answer to her prayers....but, like in real life, this is not the case.I liked this movie because it didn't sugar-coat anything, but at the same time it was very uplifting."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH MY GOD!","review":"One sunday afternoon, I sat down to watch this movie with my girlfriend, and sat back awaiting stimulating entertainment....

Though, I am aware of the many video formats out there, I still assumed that this DVD was just like any other DVD or Blue Ray that I have pruchased.The PAL is for countries like Japan and Europe, I confirmed my findings when I red the back information of the DVD package.Good thing that I have an adopted daughter in France, she will like this DVD.

But Diane Lane is such a good actress, and Tuscany is so beautiful (similar to central California -- now I understand why California is a \\"Mediterranean\\" climate) that I was able to forgive the clichés and the fact that I could basically stay one step ahead of every plot twist. I only wish that they had shown the transformation of the villa, a la \\"This Old House.\\"OK, so maybe I also wish they had shown a little more of Ms Lane's body. So sue me for being honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"For MEN only","review":"maybe they are clever enough to figure out why these actresses,directors, producers, etc. are still in circulation.This film is not only BORING BORING BORING but also an INSULT to everyone ... except perhaps the Far Eastern looking \\"actress\\" who gets to play the \\"friend\\" of the protagonist, and who fairly deliberately ruins what was supposed to be a one night-stand (one-night lay to be more precise) anyway, on the part of the slow, but dark-looking Italian HOD (hunk of the day, my abbreviation, he-he). Don't worry, a bearded, rugged looking American is going to fill the Italian's rubber shoes ... Sorry for italianizing and americanizing but there is more than enough of that going on in the film, at least on the DVD version.The film forgot to elaborate on the potential dangers of adult owls snatching kittens though, as it's a romantic, and not a realistic view of the world, and it was definitely not meant to be a horror flick. Then again, some of the scenes are pure horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under the Tuscan Sun","review":"This was one of the most predictable, syrupy, twisted excuses for a movie I have seen in a long time. Based on unlikely premises, this movie is about a woman who gets the very raw end of a divorce (we're supposed to feel sorry for her within the first 3 minutes of the movie) and then takes a vacation (courtesy of her gay lover friends) and buys a villa in Tuscany based on a whim. Somehow she has enough lire to fix things up, enough moxie to make friends with Italians (?) and live in a small town. In case the audience doesn't \\"get\\" that men are cruel and heartless, she has yet another experience with a philandering man whom she has fallen for (but never bothered to tell him). Finally her pregnant gay friend from San Francisco (now herself jilted by the 'man' in her relationship) comes and delivers her baby in Tuscany, creating a 'family' that our protagonist always wanted in theory.

It's so fun and captivating! Diane Lane is flawless, as usual. The Italian scenery is breathtaking! I hope to see the landscape someday, but until then, this movie takes me away there. I love the whole vibe of the movie... beautiful and cheery.

So, keep a look-out for this years! It really is a nice accompaniment to the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"delightful and quirky","review":"I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. Anyone who has ever undergone a painful divorce will relate to this movie. Unlike an earlier reviewer, I did not feel that Lane's acting was overdone. The angst of betrayal and divorce is just that, angst.The movie also had its delightfully quirky moments and while it was heavily salted and peppered with typical love story fare, it was also full of marvelous insights.Life marches on and there are opportunities at every turn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful scenery, but thats about all","review":"Very little plot, VERY predictable, just a movie to show off a pretty face.The only saving part of the movie were the carpenters that helped Ms. Lane restore the old Tuscan villa that she had purchased. They were also a bit predictable, but rather endearing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal","review":"I hated this dismal movie. Not completely, of course. Diane Lane, the villa, Italy and the builders are lovely, but the story is dismally surreal. First you have the divorce, then the lesbian couple, then a gay tour bus, then some promiscuous italians, then more breakups, then a nice pormiscuous fellow writer. Yuck. There is no romance in this movie - this is not romantic, it's a biological and twisted tale of some womens pre-menopausal angst and bedroom problems. And as if her bedroom problems weren't enough, we get everbody else's too. What happened to nice normal romantic comedys in the Audrey Hepburn style?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Non vero Italia!","review":"This not a window into Italy, but rather an American contrivance of Italy.

I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie, Great scenery","review":"From the onset, this movie was stilted and poorly developed. While Diane Lane is wonderful in some other films, she was(or her character was) irritating at best in this one. The plot is trite, Hollywood drivel. Some of the costuming and lightingwere well-done. I'd like my two hours back.

Just watched the BD version this week and actually very happy and impressed by the transfer and DTS audio. Would give the video a 4.5 stars out of 5, and audio 5 out of 5. The overall movie is just gorgeous on BD, and if you a big fan of the movie, I'd say it's money well spent for the double dip.Perhaps just a slight downside and that is the BD clarity and details do make Diane Lane look a tad older than she needs to be.But, still a great release and worthy purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propoganda","review":"This is another movie in the long line of movies trying to shove homosexuality down our throats.

I realise that good scripts aren't plentiful for actors over 35, but Diane should have left this one alone. I also have to agree with another reviewer about Diane's facial expressions during this film - quite annoying!Full of every cliche possible, the film does not allow you to think even for a second. On top of that, every scene seemed to be stolen from another movie.The scenery thankfully is the movie's saving grace. Watch it for that alone.Definitely disappointed with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diane Lane shines in this wonderful movie!","review":"Oscar nominee DIANE LANE shines in this wonderful comedy about changing your life for the better after a devastating blow.

Horowitz's book documents the fact that rightward ideas are winning ideas and will resonate with voters across the nation. This is a collection of essays, and, for the most part, they are brilliant. Two chapters, The War Room and How to Beat the Democrats, should be very influential upon politicians and the average reader. He preaches tactics and strategies that conservatives must hear and internalize. Important points are that politics are emotional and they should always be about hope. Republicans would be wise to learn from the words of this master. Ten more Horowitz's and the country would be in a much better place.

There's good reason that there are hundreds of this Rollerball movie being sold for a penny on Amazon and Ebay while the 1975 version still demands a fair price.Talk about living in a dystopic future society.

Okay, this is a boring film, lost in an emptiness that serves as a grave for the makers' credibility. Even excellent actor Jean Reno does little in the way of making this movie even remotely interesting. It is a monotonous, unexciting flop, a plaigerized version of the fun James Caan film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little to say about this embarrassing film...","review":"Not many films make me feel stupid for actually watching them, but this movie did. Despite starring LL Cool J (who generally happens to at least make stupid films entertaining) this film falls so far flat that it almost bows under and creates a ditch. Chris Klein is a horrendous actor and he manages to muddle up nearly everything he comes in contact with, and no matter how hot Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is (just Romijn now), she doesn't bring anything to this film outside of her body, and that just can't cut it. The violence is cheap, the script is preposterous and the action sequences feel third rate. This is one of those films that offer us absolutely nothing.I have nothing else to say about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"BALLISTIC BOMB","review":"This tedious and unnecessary remake of the 1975 James Caan classic has little to recommend it. Director John McTiernan, who did so well with DIE HARD, blasts us with heavy metal rock garbage throughout the entire movie, action scenes that are incomprehensible and lifeless, and a cast that fizzles from the start. Chris Klein's good looks don't help his vapid, uninspired performance; LL Cool J is surprisingly uneffective; Rebecca Stamjin-Stamos does better in blue make-up in the X Men flicks; Jean Reno is laughably miscast as the Russian owner.McTiernan also films one lengthy chase scene in what appears to be night vision goggles; green of all things. It makes no creative sense and adds nothing to the overall movie.Remakes like this add further validity to the fact that if you're going to remake a movie, either make it as good or better, or let us savor the originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horible","review":"this movie, other than the scenes that depicted the actual game rollerball, was horifyingly (if thats a word) bad. do not see it! it is a huge waste of your moola."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm, I don't know what they were trying to do","review":"This movie is just plain sad. In addition to mediocre acting, the special effects were just as bad. In one scene you could plainly see the safety wire connected to the motorcycle. Bad diologue and senseless nudity made the film even worse. The plot drug and the resolution could have been solved a little sooner than it did. They came up with a lame chase scene with an airplane cruising on the ground after a motorcycle. Maybe that was a last ditch effort to make the movie a little bit more exciting. The only slightly interesting character was played by LL Cool J. His on camera presence is always rather captivating to me. It also carried him through a poorly written character. Since most of the movie took place on the track, there was more of the game than I could really put up with. Avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pits","review":"A complete waste of film start to finish.Don't waste your money.If you must see it for yourself, rent it.This movie didn't need a remake, the original starring James Caan was just fine.One star is generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of celluloid","review":"It takes a lot for me to not like a movie, and Rollerball managed to pull it off.I can't decide where it went wrong, or if it just was never right. The whole motorcycle chase thing to the border was unnecessary and seemed wedged into the movie; kinda unnatural. And the fact that the whole sequence was filmed in nightvision was just plain weird. I don't know what gave them that idea. The brief nudity seemed to come out of nowhere and added little to the plot. I had to rewind it to try and understand why on Earth it suddenly happened. The action sequences were ok, but considering what the plot was, it seemed overly dramatic. I work at Blockbuster, and this is one of the few movies that I tell people not to even bother with."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Word","review":"Mesmerizing, Haunting, & Touching are words to describe this movie.

The first time, I wrote Cuisinart a letter, and they graciously sent me a new kettle. Great customer service. The second time, I'm going with a less confusing design, the Capresso glass electric kettle for a couple extra bucks. It's not worth burning my house down ; ).This design looks just like Cusinart's other standard kettles.

Also, when you press a button on its back, its wings and legs spread out, so like the Duel Disk Launcher, it could hurt a real little kid, but not kids who know what it does.

In addition to the normal specs for these devices, I particularly liked the commercial skip, its low standby power level, and its 5-year battery backup.But the TV Guide is truly a deal-breaker. In the week I had my unit, it literally chattered continuously as it tried (with only partial success) to download the guide. It was very irritating in an otherwise quiet room, and quiet passages in music or TV programs are a thing of the past with this in the same room.I emailed Pioneer; they said it is normal for the unit \\"to make some sound\\" when it is on, and the TV Guide cannot be disabled.If it worked well, the TV guide would be nice, but it isn't worth the racket.

I get to fight viruses like Lan and enter tournaments once you bet 10 viruses.Then you can battle against rival NetNavis and use battlechips.I also like the fact that you can battle against your friends. The only thing I don't like is that when Megaman loses a battle, it takes a long time to shake him back to full health. But I do a little cheat so I don't have to. The cheat is this. If you are battling a virus and you know you are about to lose, leave the PET alone for 3 minutes. After 3 minutes, the PET should be turned off by itself. When you turn it back on megaman should be back on the standby screen and the virus should have ran away.

As opposed to the crude \\"deathcrushing\\" sound of their early stuff & the atmospheric shred of \\"De Mysteriis,\\" this album tends more towards technical chaotic black/death metal, really unlike anything else I've heard before.

As the first Mayhem release with the current lineup, they came right out of the box with a masterpiece of unanticipated power.

Every story will make you crave a stiff drink and perhaps even leaving a smell of tabacoo in your clothes. I recomend these stories to people who want to understand LA better because Chandler caught the essence of the city that can even be seen today. Look down the 2nd street tunnel at 2 am and see that barrel of a gun or drive to the Rosebowl and see why he makes reference that there are no sidewalks in that wealthy neighborhood.

Following the trail blazed by Dashiell Hammett, Chandler created Philip Marlowe and the set the standard against which all private detective fiction is measured. This two-volume set covers almost the full canon of Chandler's work from early pulp stories to all the Marlowe novels, the screenplay for \\"Double Indemnity,\\" and essays on the mystery genre plus the usual Library of America goodies such as notes on the text and a chronology of the author's life. In terms of literary inventions, the Wild West cowboy and the hard-boiled PI are this country's only true native sons, and, as such, are deserving of resepct.

I only wish Mr. Pratchett had spent more time talking about the librarian/watcher monks. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not at all what you'd expect from fantasy, but...","review":"still well worth reading, whether you are looking for something light to take the edge off a long day at work or something a little heavier to pose a few interesting questions. Small Gods is the only Discworld novel I've read, so I can't compare it to the rest of Pratchett's work, but it grabbed my attention and held it. It's a many-layered book, but Pratchett doesn't force the reader to go any deeper than they feel like. Knowing Latin is an asset in reading (he can come out and say more adult things which he leaves implied in English.) Also, this book doesn't have either a \\"British\\" or an \\"American\\" feel, which so much fantasy falls into. Overall, excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The turtle moves!","review":"My sister read this book aloud to me on a road trip from Seattle to California. It is a work of multilayered artistry to be appreciated from the spiritual to the fantastic. It's also fun and unlike most of Pratchett's books you actually care about most of the characters. Reads well out loud as well. Like many readers here, I see it as the author's pinnacle, the book that he will be remembered for. Here's to immortality, Mr. Pratchett!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun, as usual","review":"A really fun book, well worth your time if you like Pratchett. None of our old pals [Rincewind, Gaspode, Vimes, Susan] put in an appearence [other than the guy WHO TALKS LIKE THIS and an old monk with a broom, and they but briefly], but it does add some info to the overall Discworld mythology, and provides some laughs as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do the gods make man or does man make the gods or ....","review":"I've read quite a few of the Pratchett books, mostly at the insistence of my 13 year old son who loves these novels. This ranks right up there among my favorites, and is intriguing for the allusions to so many of the world's religions. The author is clearly well read, and catching these little references produced many aha! moments, I confess that I even lugged home a compendium on world religion to dig out the paralells and little obscure references - and there is alot more to this book than meets the eye. Well, but in the end, I find myself in complete sympathy with the conclusion, and thus a truly satisfying narrative from start to finish. I should add that this approach to reading this book drove my son absolutely crazy, and in fact taken only at face value, no references or allusions the book is still a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Prachett's best by a long shot.","review":"Terry Pratchett's other books are a lot like well painted homes. There are several layers. \\"Small Gods\\" is like inviting over your friends to paint. There is one uneven coat of paint and they left masking tape on all of the edging in an unsuccessful attempt to miss it with their paintbrushes. The ending of the book (and middle and beginning too if truth be known) left me with the same vague feeling of dissatisfaction as when I realized that to get the place properly painted I would have to have another seperate group of friends and throw another 'paint party'."},{"rating":"2","title":"MIGHTY ENDING","review":"I have to say this: I enjoyed this book from top to bottom. Terry is there all right, with its excelent writing and a very, very odd way of looking at things. Of course, you laugh your eyes out in almost every page, specially with the screams of the shelled God Om and the comentaries of Dydactilus and Urn. And the book has one of the best endings I have read in a very long time. Lets just said:I. Is Godly.II. Respect tortoises over yourself.P.S. If I had the incredible memory of Brutha, surely I would be a prophet, without the requisite of crossing the desert, although maybe not having that much fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Even though I am an atheist/agnostic I still appreciated this book for what it was... funny.

And then one day he actually heard the voice of Om. (\\"Psst!\\") It seems that true belief in Om has been declining for years, and as such his power has waned until he found himself trapped in the likeness of a tortoise! But this revelation is going to turn the entire church of Om upside-down...starting with Brutha.Overall, I found this to be an interesting book. As with so many of Terry Pratchett's book, this one is both entertaining and quite thought provoking. As an added bonus, this book marks the first appearance of the interesting History Monks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a Terry Pratchett's fan","review":"Nice critic about inquisition times combined with a great introduction to small gods concept for those not familiar with it.

Finding himself with only one true believer (the others trusting in the Quisition)he must try to find a way, using this beliver as his prophet, to regain proper godship.

This book was a pretty strong expression of Pratchett's religious stance, in my opinion. The humor wasn't as strong as other books, I thought it was almost more of a philosophy book, or a book of opinions on religion. I wasn't sure how to rate this as I enjoyed the views on religion, but thought they would be better written in a non-Discworld novel. For Discworld, I didn't think the storyline was very fitting. I'd probably give it 3.5 stars, but rounded up as well. If you're looking for Discworld humor, I wouldn't choose this book. If you want some views (primarily mocking) on religion, then it's good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"The great god Om chooses to speak to the humans of Discworld about their lack of faith, not through an angel, not in the form of a burning bush but in the form of a turtle, and not a GIANT TURTLE, more like a box turtle. Remember the movie Oh God? Now think about trying to convince the world god speaks through a tiny turtle. Yeah, and it just gets better, Sir Terry's wit will leave you in stitches- or maybe in traction when you throw something out of whack laughing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for whoever enjoys zany stories and good laughs!","review":"Terry Pratchett continues the Discworld tradition in fine fashion with Small Gods.

However, Pratchett finally let me down.It plods along, in no particular hurry to let the reader move on to better things.The humor -- what little there is of it -- is forced. It has the feel of sophomore philosophy majors sitting 'round the Quad on a Saturday night, dateless and full of mockery. It is kind of sad.Far from one of his best. PYRAMIDS, any of the series having to do with the Watch or the wondrous three witches -- you will enjoy those far more.This one droops as limply as an Ayn Rand novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Ideas, Poor Presentation","review":"While the ideas that lay the framework for this book are solid, everything else is lacking.The humor is forced, awkward, and on occasion plagarized. A nearly verbatim quote from a Monty Python sketch stands out in my mind.The plot is slow and seldom rivetting. The only thing that kept me turning the pages at some points was my search for the origin of the \\"REMIND ME AGAIN HOW THE HORSE-SHAPED ONES MOVE\\" quote.The character development is poor. The main character, Brutha, makes a sudden transition from a bumbling idiot to a sagely leader-of-men and bargainer-with-gods. I wasn't convinced.The ideas, however, are the salvation of this book. Read it if you have a good imagination...you'll need it to make up a new story around the concept Pratchett so poorly utilizes."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply not that funny","review":"The last line of my review comes first:If you do not find church humor and church-esque situations (including a lot of parodying of church ideology and customs) funny, either due to inexposure (like me) or too much exposure (fundamentalism), this book is NOT for you.And now the review:I love Terry Pratchett - he is my favorite author of all time. And I picked up this book hoping it would become one of my favorites.The fact is, I didn't find much in this book that was funny.This novel moves along at a snail's pace, in terms of the plot and the humor. The chief reason for my disillusionment is that Pratchett includes a LOT of church analogies into the novel. The characters are all church characters. And the god is not so godly. Over half of this book came across as a particularly long and pointless conversation between a dullard and his favorite stuffed animal.Overall, I wish I'd had a review that had warned me thusly:(last line of the review)"},{"rating":"1","title":"a disgrace to religion","review":"although this book was an intentional attack on organized religion of the past, i thought that it went to far in trying to humor the audience. In light of this book being fiction, Pratchett still wanders a little far into even joking about something that is as important to millions of people as a supreme power.even so, the comedy good throughout. the characters were a little shallow at times, and my own obsession with imagery in fantasy novels (see Guy Gavriel Kay), made me feeling a bit disappointed in such a huge phenomenon as Terry Pratchett."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzz...","review":"In my opinion, the worst book in the series.

Halliday claims that new perceptions of Shakespeare were developed at fifty year intervals starting with his his contemporaries, then with Dryden in the Restoration, Pope in the Augustan Age, Johnson in the Age of Reason, and Coleridge in the Romantic Age. One of the surprising revelations is that it is only with Coleridge that Shakespeare is written and thought about primarily as a poet. It is Coleridge who too lays waste the conception that Shakespeare was a wild , careless genius with little concern for the artistic construction of his work.The second part of the work contains brief selections of criticisms about the individual plays.I found this work provides a sense of the overall development of Shakespeare criticism from its inception to the mid- twentieth century.A valuable work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst mess ever","review":"DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!!

The section on medications with gluten is especially troubling as it causes someone who thought they were safe to worry for no reason. Most troubling is her treatment of the risks of cancer. Her treatment is both superficial, incaccurate and unrealistic. First she says that the risk is the same whether you maintain a gluten free diet or not. Then she says that the only thing you can do about it is to not worry about it. Her discussion of picking food out of a sandwiches is poor advice. In one section she understands the problems of cross contamination, yet doesn't seem to understand that picking apart food is more of a risk than using a toaster.

It did not give enough day to day living details. I seldom go to cocktail parties, eat caviar or have business lunchs. The restaurants we patronize do not have reservations, most of the time do not have chefs.The author came across as a spoiled socialite with a 6 figure income and no children.

Barns are great relics from our past, conveying a sense of history, but many have been ruined by weather, time, and neglect. I didn't realize how many creative architects and owners have made barns useful for both residential and commercial use through renovation and restoration. The intrinsic character of these old barns brings an integrity and charm rarely seen in new construction. In many gorgeous illustrations, Rooney describes the history of barns, their adornment (who knew that it was all because of a 9th century pope that there are so many roosters on weathervanes?), and their use as gorgeous residences and fascinating commercial and establishments - including an architectural office, inns, and even a funeral chapel. One entrepreneur even used several to develop an office complex. If you love barns and if you like to see the past preserved in the present, you will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"cuts to the heart","review":"It seems the earned province of Canadian women writers to cut to the heart of gender, race, and class privilege. In the title piece (I would not call it a story in the traditional character/plot sense) Schoemperlen explores a series of intangibles, among them faith, prayer, and hope, and very subtly weaves them into an indictment of middle class privilege. In a later story, \\"Count Your Blessings (a Fairy Tale)\\" Schoemperlen, in a twist reminiscent of the best Roald Dahl stories, cuts the heart out of the woman who has everything and is still unhappy. These stories are well-written, and are accompanied by clever old woodcut clip art. But unlike many short story collections, this is not an \\"easy\\" book, for the reader, and I suspect, for the author as well. The book jacket describes her work as \\"electric\\"--the prospective reader would do well to remember that electricity can shock as well as enlighten."},{"rating":"2","title":"magic under a microscope","review":"After reading Schoemperlen's Language of Love I couldn't wait to read her new book.

It has some happy songs on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Amy's best pop albums...","review":"This is a sad and thoughtful album, indeed, and Amy writes one of the saddest songs on this album (Missing you). Many of the songs are about unrequited love, marriage, and hardships in life. This album def. reflects Amy's feelings on her marriage to Gary Chapman, and her love for Vince Gill. It is a beautiful, heartfelt album from a beautiful singer. Buy it if you like Amy's previous pop albums, or if you like sad songs (Which I do!)Choice tracks:Nobody homeCry a river,Leave it all behind,Missing you,The feeling that I had,Somewhere down the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing new material by Amy Grant","review":"Behind the Eyes is slightly different from Amy's two previous releases; BTE is more mature and it gets better and better the more one listens to it. \\"Turn This World Around\\" is my favorite on the CD, but the rest of the material is also great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd that this is my favorite...so you know it has to be good","review":"I'll keep it short since I want to go eat my lunch. Out of the hundreds (at least) of CDs I've listened to, this is my favorite of ALL TIME. Which is weird, because I don't have any other Amy Grant albums, and I'm actually not interested in any other albums by her. So you know there has to be something great about it. I heard this album, and promptly went out to buy it. I went on a cross-country train trip by myself last summer, and this CD was a great one to have while I looked out at America flying past my window and thought about life. I don't mean to sound dramatic or over-the-top, but this CD affects me in a way that VERY few other albums do. It trancends the normal music world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"I think that this is a great album.

I have loved the \\"Angels\\" song on the \\"Straight Ahead\\" Album for instance but not much else. You will not find this spirited type song on this album. She lost it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing!","review":"I own all of Amy Grant's other CD's and this is the worst! This album is so depressing, it makes sense when you realize that her marriage was on the rocks at the time. I find it amusing that she puts out one of her worst albums ever and her ex-husband (Gary Chapman) puts out one of his best. It seems like she is trying to break out of the \\"Gospel & Pop\\" mold that made her. I bet she does country (with Vince Gill) next."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD","review":"Who does she think she is? Amy Grant has been singing for years and years and still no one sees what she's doing?

I never regret purchasing this lcd monitor though my 17 inch CRT which this replaced was truly sharp. This lcd is totally comparable in sharpness which is a plus when editing your digital pictures. It being flat makes you take back very much needed space, of course. If you only have analog connector on your pc you will still find this lcd okay. I installed a pc card with digital connector on my pc thus allowing its signal to stay digital (versus the pc converting its signal to analog so you could use your crt monitor which is of course analog).

While not going so far to say that I was disappointed,I will say that it was the first Charles Dickens novel that I almost felt like not finishing. Not only is the plot rather humorless, but the characters are charmless and almost uninteresting. If it hadnt been written by Dickens then I may have liked it better but as it was it did not have any of Dickens usual charm and humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horrible Mess of Incoherent Words","review":"This book was terrible! Half the characters did not have an ending and no main character is apparent. Then again, I'm a freshman in high school and may be a little inexperienced to judge so harshly. I personally dislike Dicken's wordy style of writing because it's easy to get lost. If you like Dickens, and you don't mind his writing style I'm sure you would probably disagree with me. I'll give it a two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death by verbosity","review":"Charles Dickens did for the art of literature what the 80's did for music: Made it intolerable and robbed it of any beauty. The Dicken's aesthetic of excessive description drives the reader to tedium and makes him wish that Dicken's was payed for every word he saved instead of every one he wrote. His knack for wrapping up loose ends in a nice neat conclusion is overshadowed by the time and effort it takes to reach that point"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soot-covered Sentimentality","review":"Any Dickens book can be summarized in two words: coal and suffering. I was forced to read this weepy piece of high-strung emotional swill in high school. Dickens lacks the punch and anger of Zola's sweeping \\"Germinal\\". For the best critique of Dickens, read \\"Against Nature\\" by Joris-Karl Huysmans. The high schools of America would be better off trashing their Dickens paperbacks and reading something with real value, like Lewis Carroll or the Marquis De Sade, both masterful storytellers of the absurdity of authority. Plus both Carroll and Sade are a lot funnier than the ever-serious monotony of Dickens. Do yourself a favor, steer clear of all those Dickens books in the bookstore and curl up with a nice volume of Sade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and rich","review":"Dickens' shortest novel is an attack on utilitarianism, the squelching power of schools and factories to eliminate joy from life among the rich and poor alike. (Dickens perhaps prefigures Orwell with his Coketown of horror.) While some of the business about labor unions is unsuccessful, the love/despair story of Louisa Gradgrind is superbly rendered. A very good novel for those unsure of themselves in life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not his best, but pretty good","review":"It's the way things happen, not the pizzazzy prose or the dialogue, that sets Charlie up to be read by every high school student alive. While not hideously exciting to the modern reader, there is a lot to be gleaned from this compassionate narrative about the unhumanness of the modern world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The complexity of Dickens","review":"\\"Death by verbosity\\" describes the critic's failure not Dickens'. There are no such things as neat conclusions in Dickens, note the several rewrites of the the final chapter of \\"Great Expectations\\". Dickens expanded the concept of character in the novel to embrace the socially situated type as a means of understanding the relationship between society and the individual. This helped to forge a self-conciously social literature and thereby making the link between art and politics textually explicit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Dull, one of the worst books ever written","review":"This book was a total waste of my time. don't get me wrong though im a very avid reader but, DAG!! was Dickens intending for his book to be so boring or did it just mistakenly happen. The characters were hard to understand and so was the plot. ONe character in particular got on my last nerve: the circus person (can't remember his name because it was just that unimportant). He talked with a lipse which was hard to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Nariation but not that good of a book.","review":"This audio rendition of Charles Dickens Hard Times features the renowned voiced of Paul Scolfeild, distinguished British actor. I found the narration to be very well done and it helped me get into the story but I have to say that I did not find the story to be a classic.

I find his works good, thought-provoking books that are free of cuss words, violence, and lusts. I think this book was a realistic account of what life was like in the early nineteen hundreds. I was glad that Mr. Gragrind came around in his thinking and realized it is okay to have fun. I am also glad of how the book ended. I was glad to see that justice was preserved.

The story tried to be some sort of moralistic tale about the dangers of being self involved, but in reality it is a warning of the dangers of hiring a bad director. Please do not watch. And if you do - for the love of all that is quality movie making - DO NOT PAY THE $22 that amazon is charging.Note: The first scene involves a man ripping open his back to pull out an organ.

The west coast is all about the groove of the music and the rappers slicking there rhymes over the top in mesmeration to these beats. How any of the rappers that feature on this album does this beats me or are they like the producers just cashing in.

It made me wish that every child had a place they could go where they felt safe and cared about, where no one would make fun of them because they could not read or write or do math, skills that most children take for granted. It made me realize that schools should provide every child a place to go where they felt safe and cared about, a place such as the resource room and teacher as described in this story. It also made me realize how important it is that teachers learn to recognize signs of dyslexia in children in their classrooms and bring it to the attention of appropriate school personnel.

Both units I bought had defective motion sensors, no amount or variation of shaking would consistently launch battle mode. Also one unit had defective graphics, showing just black jiggling specks. Most of the reviews on this product are by eager boys who WANT a PET but don't have one yet and they are giving it high ratings. Trust me boys (and parents), this is not worth $30. As I said, a sonic game from a happy meal will be more satisfying and functional than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Megaman PET","review":"This toy is so cool its the best toy I have ever had and i'm 11I think evryone should get one so there would be alot of kids you could battle with"},{"rating":"2","title":"cool!!!!!!!!","review":"the pet is preety cool its a nice sise and also if u want great game exp. buy more battlechips i cant give this toy 5 stars becuse when u die u need to shake it which is retadrded when i bought it at first i thought it would be a load of crap now i know that and if u buy it i want u to know"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy","review":"I got this for my 8 year old son because he loves hand held games.

For kids (like me) don't ask to buy it ,it was hard to find some body with the pet. for parents make sure there is a x on this thing on your child's list,it won't last long (more likely for younger kids). overall to everyone should get the nintendo ds,GBA or atleat the video now thing, this pet is a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool, man!","review":"My friend had a PET except it was blue.

It opens with an uptempo, improvisational-like, number, \\"Don't Git Sassy\\" then settles into a contemplative, salsa tune \\"For Somoeone I Love,\\" where Carter plucks her violin then make it laugh, weep and glide all in one song. I haven't heard the Milt Jackson version, but it would be interesting to hear the original to see how this interpretation is different. There also some interesting selections like \\"The Love Theme from Spartacus.\\" Carter's lamenteous violin is softly accompanied by Marcus Belgrave's flugelhorn. In some instances, the two instruments merge into one sound. But the ultimate gem in this CD is Carter's version of Chattanooga Choo Choo. It should be a standard violin piece much like Mozart's Sonatas. It sounds like it was written for the violin and Carter is in absolute command here, with such fire and fluidity, I'm definetly impress!

With this release, I sometimes feel like I'm listening to elevator music but the sultry \\"Forever February\\" redeems it somewhat; her cover of Marvin Gaye's \\"Don't Mess With Mr. T\\" is also interesting.

Don't bother with the movie; not only is the casting all wrong, but the reality was 100 times worse. Caranza Tene looked nothing like Judd Hirsch and was unbelievable violent. Steven Tene grew up in a culture where kids weren't allowed to go to school and had to beg and steal for their families. Girls were married off at age 11 and had to work, while their husbands did nothing. Loyalty meant giving all your earnings to your husband or father. If you made your fellow Gypsies angry, they'd lie to the police to get you in trouble.I'd like to see this book reissued, with a chapter on where they are now. Caranza Tene is definitely dead, and Steve Tene must be in his 60's.

I found the plot messy and muddled, with many clumsy devices and scenes that felt forced (the climax, in particular, seemed very rushed, cinematically speaking). The characters, for the most part, were thin - and perhaps the author reached too far in casting the reference-net.

I liked how it was written and all the cameos by other famous vampires/historical figures, but what I didn't like was the ending. The killer I thought was a real let down, as was how he was eventually caught. And the way Dracula was presented at the very end....ugh. Not good at all.I guess if you're really bored and desperately want to read a vampire novel, this will do. Otherwise, steer clear of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique presentation of the vampire genre","review":"This is a truly unique novel. Newman presents us with a London virtually taken over by the undead. Vampires have come out of hiding and are now fully \\"out\\". Living people (referred to as \\"warm\\") flock to be turned, and vampires are now found in every walk of life from government to shop keeper to prostitute. Newman is extremely detailed, and he introduces numerous characters while weaving in actual historical occurrences into the story. We get a glimpse of this London at the time of the Whitechapel murders; only this time, the Ripper preys on vamp prostitutes, and his identity harkens back to Stoker's DRACULA.All in all, this is a delightful and creative novel. It is a breath of fresh air amidst the Lestat wannabes. Keeping up with all the different characters can be a task, but if you give this novel a chance, you most definitely won't be disappointed. This is the first novel of a trilogy, and I'm rushing to read the next in the series (BLOODY RED BARON)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anno Dracula Boring","review":"The book was boring and to far fetched to be entertaining.

Not only is Newman spot on in his depiction of London in 1888, but he also brings in a wide range of fictional characters from Victorian novels including their authors!Characters Charles Beauregard and Genevieve Dieudonne team up to be an unstoppable duo in search of Jack the Ripper. It is hard to put the book down once you've started reading. So glad Titan Books reprinted this!

Many names from the original Dracula, as well as other literary works find this way into the story, which is fun.I had a little trouble sticking with this book at first--it is quite complex and with many characters--but once I got pulled in, I could not put the book down. I highly recommend this for fans of the original Dracula."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternate History meets Classic Horror","review":"Kim Newman's gothic horror novel, \\"Anno Dracula\\" is a fine riff of Bram Stoker's original masterpiece. Newman asks the reader a simple question: What if Dracula had won in his confrontation with van Helsing and the other protagonists from Stoker's novel? His ultimate objective, it appears, was to marry Queen Victoria and claim the British throne for himself. To cement his rule, the vampire spreads his curse to create a whole new class of subject, the undead. Within this mess Dr. Seward finds himself cast in the role of Jack the Ripper as he seeks to destroy the undead in his quest for vengeance. With a fine eye for literary satire Newman throws in plenty of Victorian characters from other great works just for kicks.

A mysterious killer is cutting down young vampire prostitutes in the streets, and the police have received a letter claiming credit from someone who calls himself Jack the Ripper. If you enjoy classic vampire stories, mysteries, Victorian London, or just a really good story, it's worth taking a look.My only complaint is that the tangled threads of multiple viewpoint characters get confusing. There are quite a few characters to keep track of, each with their own agendas. Most of them are familiar from other works (the good Dr. Jekyll inspects a recent murder victim; when he is visited for further questioning, he's consulting with his friend Dr. Moreau), and there's a healthy appendix at the end that lists historical and fictional references by chapter, but it's still a lot to keep track of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anno dracula","review":"Story is disjointed and so at times difficult to follow.

One of my co-workers and I were having a difficult time getting along. I loved my job, but this friction between the two of us was really starting to bug me and although the job market is tight right now, I had decided to float my resume around and see what was out there.BUt, I went to the bookstore and saw CRUCIAL CONFRONTATIONS. It had so much great advice on how to deal with confrontation in a positive way. By using the books advice, I was able to \\"confront\\" my co-worker and I realized we really were not that far apart in opinions...we just expressed them differently. It would be a stretch to say that we will be best friends, but I do think we have reached a common ground and I no longer feel the need to leave my job.Go buy this book if you are have difficulty in your job. marriage or family...It is worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"conversation tools","review":"I liked the book and definitely picked up on tools for working thru violated expectations.

But I liked it most because it showed the kids thinking and the dangers of not trusting your brain when you are in trouble and the way out is not by getting into more trouble.The kids, before committing to read it, also wanted to know that no dogs die, and no one dies in the story. They are sick of stories where the main character or their dog dies. So there are dead people mentioned in the book, a dead mother, but she's long gone by the time the story starts.Anyway I liked it.

There were no finer writers than HDH during the second half of the twentieth century and this set is testimony to that. Sadly, most of these songs are available elsewhere and avid Motown fans will find this redundant. Great mono versions of a good chunk of their biggest hits but a second volume is called for with more of the post Motown output and a deeper look into the vaults for demos of some of the literally hundreds of top shelf songs these guys wrote.

The musicians are in excellent shape, the line-up is superb, the selections are well-chosen and the DDS 5.1 mix is a showroom example of a proper live concert mix. Ambient and live but clear and focused.

Sure enough, Doby sounds awful, but when I selected 5.1 the sound was perfect. After that I enjoyed a really great concert with some excellent cuts from Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler-Dire Straits, Sting, Paul McCartney and many others. Brothers in Arms, Money for Nothing, Layla, Hey Jude and a great rendition of Kansas City with everyone joining in.

This is a wonderful concert; I just wish I could have heard it in person.This DVD looks fantastic and sounds terrific--especially on a DTS capable system like mind. I buy music DVD's only if I can see that they have DTS encoding on the disk (Amazon please take note). However, in a few places--just a couple--the sound quality of \\"Music for Monserrat\\" falls down a wee bit compared to other music DVD's I have; otherwise, I would have rated it 5 stars.That said, this is a great DVD for those like me who love these artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio= Very Poor","review":"First time I have purchased a DVD that had a 4 star+ rating and been disappointed.

Memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"McCartney Lovers Only","review":"I buy/view/listen to a lot of music video's (read, sorry night life) and this one was a disappointment. Sound varies too widely act to act. Couple of goosebump moments (I love the Mega-Guitars on Kansas City) but mostly a smorgas-bored of available talent putting in their charity work. Zero additives for the video freak and no real explanation of charitable intentions ever given. Borrow this from someone instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a collector's item.","review":"It is extremely rare to see so many world famous super artists performing together in the same concert doing some of their greatest hits - Elton John, Sting, Mark Knofler, Carl Perkin, Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney, Phil Colins etc. You must own this DVD before it is out of stock. I would have given it 5 stars should the audio recording be slightly better. Go and buy this one with confidence. I am sure you will not regret."},{"rating":"2","title":"All-Star Lineup","review":"This is a very good recording of a fabulous concert.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with the sound quality","review":"If you buy concerts on DVD because of the great sound, skip this one. I was amazed that George Martin and all those experienced players allowed such an amateurish recording to happen.

After he was bulldozed into joining the family dance-music business, engineer-trained Josef (1827-1870) proved to be the most industrious of all the Strauss family during the remainder of his short life. I reckon, having collected and listened to all the volumes so far issued in this Marco Polo Josef Strauss Edition, that inspiration and innovation did not always keep up with his gruelling work schedule. Reliance on the family formula seems evident in most of the items on this CD, where you'll find a spanking little march, three waltzes, a quadrille and a variety of polkas, heard best at concert hall volume so that subtle lifts in rhythm and phrase and the skilful orchestration are heard to best advantage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Lens Cap","review":"This is a good lens cap and does meet the purpose.

Almost impossible to remove without either dropping it or having your fingers slip off of it which usually results in your fingernails scraping across the surface of your lens or lens filter. After 10 drops and 4 fingernail scrapes, I ordered the following product.Mennon Pro Center Pinch 67mm Snap-On Lens Cap with Leash. It's much better.

Just another small thing to enjoy your shooting more.One star off, as it still could be 30% cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality product","review":"Fits as expected and is well made.

The end was so predictable, the entire book turned into a major disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"IMHO not for children","review":"I found the beginning to be interesting, albeit kind of sad.

I really am not sure whether this CD emits sounds that will make me more creative or open up my alpha brain waves like the cover says. I've tried and I don't really feel any different. And yet I'm admitedly intrigued by the warnings on the label that say \\"do not use while operating heavy machinery\\" and such. However, the cd provides only a single song - if you call it that - that lasts for an hour - and its really just a low thumpy staticy rain noise that remains fairly constant and does not ebb and flow. Nothing really mind blowing if you ask me. Also, the packaging looks more backyard than mass production leading me to believe the $23 price is also a bit high. Ok experts, flame away! Tell me I'm simply not smart enough to get it. Perhaps that is the case... either way I guess i expected something different."},{"rating":"2","title":"be careful with size","review":"Great boot.

That's a big deal for me. I thought the author did a fantastic job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of adjectives, adverbs, and cliches","review":"The story itself was interesting, but the book is not well written. The author pads out half her sentences with adjectives and adverbs that are meant to add feeling that she apparently doesn't believe the facts will convey. She also seems unaware of the many cliches she uses. A potentially compelling story, written in an irritating, amateurish style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the \\"Truth\\"","review":"As a St. Louis resident during this crime, I was especially interested in this book. I was very disheartened when I heard Ms. Cummins interviewed on the radio and a police detective called in and challenged her account, claiming that she misquoted him. It appears that Ms. Cummins chose to not interview anyone, just go by court documnets. Needless to say, I am left still wondering what the real truth is, since apparently this is really a work of fiction.I also felt like this was a way to clear her brother's name, as there was very little in this book about the actual victims, who in my mind, are the girls who were raped and murdered. The fact that a family member is trying to ride this tragedy to fame and fortune is beyond obscene, and I can't imagine the pain this is causing the family of the actual victims.If this story needed resurecting, I would have liked to see what the truth really is, not a family member's whitewashed version of things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greased Lightning","review":"This story will literally suck you in like a tornado and doesn't let go of you until the dust and debris settles, leaving you frazzled and perplexed. The lesson to be learned from this book, is that the majority of us at one time or another have walked to the fringe and escaped unchanged and luckier then we can imagine . A horrific tale that hopefully will save others a simliar FATE, It's difficult to comprehend that this is just one family's tragedy out of the thousands of cries of anguish that go on in silence. Trust me (or not), don't miss this book !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Page Turner","review":"I read the review on this book in People Magazine and finished it in three days.

She continues with a chronologic order of each happening as you take part by reading the in-depth view of all events, each persons thoughts and the unfortunate truth. This book gives us the knowledge and makes us aware of the tragedy that can happen in any family. Cummins reminds us that a family is ONE, no matter what occurrences take place in life. As a Gaithersburg resident, Volunteer Fire/Rescue worker and a friend of the Cummins family, I encourage all to revisit in the family's heartbreaking tragedy and uplifting story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, fast reading story","review":"This book was referred to me by a friend and it turned out to be a story that I coulnd't put down.

I agree that the account of the aftermath was drawn out and took away from the description of the crime itself, but I can appreciate the relief that came from sharing that experience.A couple of weeks after reading the book I had a chance encounter with Jeanine and Tom Cummins' mother - it was a complete coincidence that I came to realize who she was. The book had quite an impact on me, and meeting someone face to face who was so intimately involved forever etched this story in my mind.It's a stark reminder that evil does exist, that chance encounters can change your life forever, that you should trust your instincts and listen to your mother, and that only the good die young."},{"rating":"2","title":"A families point of view","review":"I went to high school with Robin and Julie. I can't drive over the Mississippi River without thinking about them. The newspaper articles, and TV interviews in St Louis were mainly focused on Tom's (the cousin) guilt, and these \\"mystery 4 men\\". I was glad to hear a book had been written from \\"their\\" point of view. When I say \\"their\\" I mean Robin and Julie. Robin and Julie are gone, and no longer have a voice for themselves, so Jeanine did the best she could to capture this horrible moment in time, and the aftermath it caused.I feel that as much hatred that she COULD have to the four men that murdered her cousins, and let her brother be blamed for the crimes, Jeanine was fair, and kind to the men. She did not make excuses for their actions, but she did explain how a fun night out, a decision to rob, could turn so dangerous and deadly in minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out Standing","review":"I've never read a book that so profoundly hit me in the heart. This is such an incredible account of one families struggle with something that should never happen to anyone. I read the book in two hours and can't wait to pass Jeanine Cummins name on to everyone I know. This book puts the perspective on violent crimes back where it should be, on the victims. Though this book was about her family Ms. Cummins was able to write the book without turning the guilty into monsters, she made them human which is even scarier. They took three kids and ruined their world and the world of their families. When I finished the book I also realized that the guilty also made Ms. Cummins family that much stronger. Congratulations on such a fine book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality","review":"I have bought two of these, about a year apart.The last one i bought had a nicer finish to the edges, not just cut leather.Really nice, and i get compliments all the time on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enter Slayer","review":"Like the famousMetal Massacre, Vol. 1, which is noteworthy for introducing the world to Metallica, Metal Massacre III's major claim to fame is that it unleashed thrash legends Slayer.The early Metal Massacre compilations are the best reflection of the American metal scene at the time, as such this 1983 release is full of power, traditional, and proto-thrash metal bands that are all clearly influenced by the NWOBHM scene. In addition to some of the \\"name\\" bands like Slayer, Virgin Steele, and Bitch, Metal Massacre III featured bands like Snowhite (later Znowhite) and Warlord that developed a cult following, as well Medusa, Test Pattern, Sexist, Marauder, and La Mort, who appear only on this album and were never heard from again.A lot of these bands and songs are raw and unpolished, but that was part of the charm of the early 80's metal scene.

The cord is thicker than usual for both the positive and negative polarities - a separate wire for each - and I'm quite pleased with this, will perhaps get another because of its thickness. I now have great headphone sound within a twenty-foot range - just what I was looking for. Even if you don't need 15-feet of cord, I would recommend this over the shorter 10 foot cords where the wiring is about half as thick and not likely to hold up over time...I subject all my electronics to heavy use.

This is a definite departure from the more business-like stylings of \\"Diversity Blues - How to Shake Them\\".

Ms. Gossett's storytelling and ability to keep the reader in suspense was amazing! As I was reading it, I felt Ms. Gosssett was there in the room with me telling me a story!I also loved how she craftfully weaved in diversity themes throughout and it was refreshing to read a story based in Cincinnati where I have lived and worked.It was a real treat living out the story plot and trying to play out in my mind - Who dunnit? I was surprised at the ending and with the very last cliffhanger. I truley believe this would make for a great suspense movie and the book is as good as any Grisham novel I've read (and I have read them all!)!Kudos to Ms. Gossett who has \\"come into her own\\" and deserves so much success with this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and well made!","review":"Certainly this 2nd symphony should have shown the world Raff was a rising star.

However, I'm very pleased with this very fine disk and strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys hearing Romantic era works that ought to be better known!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Melancholy views and interpretations","review":"This book, was far too long, and was not at all appealing. The length of the book, bored me to tears, and was too hard for people unfamiliar with his work (i am though somewhat familiar but still his theories made no sense to me and lacked relevance in my life). The book went into painstaking great detail describing dreams and interpretations. His theories and interpretations were intriguing, and informative, but lacked any research to back up his theories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Effort","review":"It is very hard to find the logic in believing Freud when he himself was quite mentally disturbed and sick. Freud rationalizes things to death, he gives no hope, and removes all magic from the world. It seems, finally, that Freud is falling into disrepute after some years of popularity. He was never correct, only popular. If you want really important work in the field, then read Karl Gustav Jung, because, as I mentioned in the title, Freud is not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A New Translation","review":"This is a new translation (2006) of Freud's Interpretation of Dreams. I hope someone qualified might soon comment on the merits or significance of this new translation. Meanwhile, the Editorial Review information offered for this book comes from an earlier edition of a different translation of Freud's work, FWIW. And the second paragraph in the editorial review prelim is entirely inappropriate--it's for another book altogether.I give Freud's book (not the translation) a low rating because it is misleading. It's not about the interpretation of dreams in general, but more specifically it's, covertly of course, about Freud's own dreams. More basically, it's about \\"infantile memories\\" he claimed dreams concealed. (For more explanation of this point, one could consult \\"If Freud's Theory Be True...\\" in Psychological Reports (1992, 70, 611-620), which would explain how Freud himself tells us his book is not about what it appears to be about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughing out loud","review":"As a licensed psychologist I LOL when I saw Dr.Freud in the Religion/ Spirituality section.

If you are reading this book for pleasure, starting at the beginning and proceeding directly, this may not be a problem. If, however, like me, you are using it for a course and/or in conjunction with a hard copy edition, this makes it virtually impossible to locate anything in the book or to navigate from chapter to chapter. You have to use successive approximations of the location number every time you want/need to change locations. Consequently, this Kindle edition is useless to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Binding","review":"Though the content of the text met expectations (it's a fairly canonical text), the binding on this book was terrible. It does not include any print or publishing information, making it nearly impossible to cite. There is neither table of contents nor an index, inexcusable for a text of this length and genre. The section breaks were unpredictable and poorly marked.

(1911). There were five more editions (to 1929), which are integrated in the standard edition translation by James Strachey (Avon/Discus pb 1965). This one, however, benefits from a creative intro by Daniel O'Hara and Gina MacKenzie, who correct some of the translation in an appendix, adding endnotes, comments, questions and valuable suggestions for further reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"the hidden meaning of dreams","review":"The science of interpretting the hidden meaning of one's dreams is the key to unlocking the door to our unconscious psychic life. Sigmund Freud was the one who discovered that through our dreams we can explore our unconscious, which means that if we can unravel what our dreams mean, we can find out what our mind secretly wants and desires. These wants and desires are otherwise hidden and suppressed by our conscious mind because of our moral and social inhibitions and tensions. In fact, Sigmund Freud theories invented a whole new branch of treatment for neurosis. Freud's \\"Interprettation of Dreams\\" has its flaws, and his theories have been constantly modified and improved upon in accordance with new discoveries in contemporary psychology, but it was Freud who first put the wheels in spin.David Rehakauthor of \\"Love and Madness\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard read","review":"Such a hard read for a non-psychology student - never to the point, ineptly organised, more 'jargon' type language than really necessary.

So this rating is only on the particular edition that is published by NuVision. They did not include an index or any information about who translated this version. Also, the table of contents is nearly worthless; no detail what-so-ever about the chapters, not even titles of the chapters, just Chapter 1 etc. and a page number.

Well, my Sony stereo -- not entry level, at least according to the money I paid for it! -- doesn't recognize the CD at all, so I can only listen to it using my computer CD player.

But its offerings merely begin there. Levine, a master of metaphor and tone, uses these 18 surreal parables to critique power dynamics and to expose the oppressive mechanisms of family, relationships, body and gender. Often simultaneously funny and disturbing, these stories will resonate years after a first reading. Her expert use of the surreal is often called Kafka-esque, an overused and misused literary cliche that, for once, fits the bill. Her keen grasp and expression of humanity's politics precisely suits the Kafka legacy. Her expert use of language and imagery remind us that writing really is an art."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Missing Link","review":"\\"Other Side of Love\\" was never released on either of Yazoo's albums.

All the dance numbers have been slaughtered in the editing room and there is no way to see the great choreography. If you like 120 minutes of Janet close up then this DVD is for you.

With a combination of costume changes, great choreography, Janet's greatest hits, and a sold out crowd at Madison Square Garden, the DVD makes for an excellent night of entertainment. I only regret that I was not able to see the concert in person here in my home town due to a cancelation of the concert;however, the DVD is definately a suitable substitute.

The concert begins with a big book being opened and then seperated into two screens then comes janet. She sings songs from velvet rope which are perfectly mixed with classic dance hits of hers over the years. A lot of the control and rhythm nation songs were made into medleys though some of the ones with intense choreography like If, Rhythm Nation and so forth were performed wonderfully. Janet also created great new chorography for what about, you and i get lonely which could have also been singles. I wish Everytime was sang on this show though that ballad is just so beautiful.

The character of Dulcinea is particularly touching - where those who would use and abuse her see only a whore broken by life's cruelties and painful necessities, our mad hero sees a woman capable of love, kindness, and friendship. He sees a person, with pain and sorrow and strength and inner beauty. How can we know that this view is \\"insanity\\"?

Of particular interest is the plot's patient development of the relationship between Crawford and Palance, an intricate bond that continues to intrigue as the harmony of their home begins to ring hollow. Palance's powerful sex appeal is like a lightning rod that draws both Crawford and Grahame, and, though nothing in the storyline comes as a shock, the details are utterly jolting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best laid plans...","review":"Joan Crawford chews the scenery, Jack Palance looks ugly and menacing, and Gloria Grahame slinks around in this fabulous film noir. Crawford is a wealthy socialite and playwright who marries Palance, an actor she had previously rejected from one of her plays. Turns out he has a girlfriend (Grahame) and they're plotting to murder Joan for her money. Joan finds out and decides to beat them to the punch (so to speak) by hatching a plan to murder her husband and frame his lover for the crime, complete with a little dream sequence showing the audience how it's supposed to turn out. In the middle of the plan, however, Joan loses her nerve...and that's when things get really interesting. The suspense starts about halfway through the film, when Joan discovers the plot against her, but the last ten minutes of the film dials up it a few levels. A must for any fan of Crawford and/or film noir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated in my search","review":"Disappointed in the viewer comment on poor quality transfer from VHS to DVD which has discouraged me from completing my contemplated purchase of the DVD.

It an Olympian display of overacting that has never been equalled: Crawford pulls at her hair, wildly darts her unfocused, bulging eyes, clamps her ears shut, pulls tight her grimacing mouth. A lunatic chimpanzee receiving electroshock couldn't do justice to Crawford's facial contortions here. I guess the reason that Crawford is such a fascinating screen presence to fans and nonfans alike is that she's a relentless masochist. In movie after movie, no matter what terrible fate befalls her, no matter how many times she is betrayed, it's nothing compared to the mental punishments she visits upon herself. The movie itself is serviceable but fairly ludicrous; there are glaring plot holes almost never seen in true film noir. The entire switched-identities ending is just about as bizarre as Crawford's performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!!! DON'T BUY HERE CHEAP!!!!

She is the racist.This viewpoint is part of the problem that African-Americans cannot escape from; racism against others. Sister Souljah blames white people throughout her book without thinking that it was the early Egyptions that raided the African villages for slaves, not the early Europeans. With her point the finger mentality we, as a nation not just individual races, will not be able to overcome this debilitating disease called racism.The situations she gets into with people are not only caused by a lack of common sense but embarrassingly phony.

Though it has been since the early nineties that I read No Disrespect, I will always heartily recommend Sister Souljah's grand debut; this book is pure heart; not easy to come by in these plastic times. I say, pick it up and give it a read, you won't be disappointed, and something might change within your soul, a new perspective, or even a song within your heart might be born and you might chance to sing along with No Disrespect ~ I think it takes guts to write like this, and this author has my full respect for putting herself out there.

It was one of the first books recommended to me as to be really good. It is pretty good and I have to admit Sister Souljah does tell it like it is and she sounds very respectful towards herself and others. Personally I think she was too goodie-goodie, though. She stays monogamous for way too long. I'm not going by other reviews either. I don't know any girl that thinks as pure as her, and I know goodie-goodie girls!

Also, while white students are worrying about their student loans, and wondering how in the world they will ever be able to pay them back, little or nothing was said about the African-American students concerns about their pay-back. Oh, yes, I forgot \\"We Owe You\\"(?) Great that Sister Souljah is trying to help her \\"brothers\\" and \\"sisters\\", but maybe she should start with teaching them some morals, and maybe cleaning up her act while she is at it.

The vast majority of the text is spent pointing fingers at various groups who are seen by Souljah to be opressing the African-American woman, and yet she doesen't go into any real solutions to the problems. I, being a black lesbian, was extremely offended by her outright homophobic comments in the book, and had to try to get through them without throwing it away. I ended up throwing it away anyway at the end. Feel like revolution? Listen to Me'Shell Ndegeocello. Don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Support What She Says, But I don't believe It","review":"I read \\"No Disrespect after reading \\"The Coldest Winter Ever\\", and finding that work of fiction riveting, and well -told. I found \\"No Disrespect\\" a non-fiction work that is told with the caveat - I will tell the truth, and the names are changed only to protect the innocent\\", to be poorly told, hard to believe, and self serving. Yes, I do believe it is possible to have morals and values as SS describes herself to have in this work, but the stories she writes, rather than honest, smack of someone that is holding back, or more to the point someone tailoring the story to conclude in an ending that is suitable to them. I don't mean any disrepect, but I don't buy it was the prevailing thought as I read her story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Further proof that stupidity comes in all colors.","review":"Firstly, I find it startling that Vintage would deign to publish something so poorly written. The semi-literacy of this prose (I'm being generous) does, if nothing else, suggest that Miss Souljah didn't use a ghost writer. The words, in all their ghettofied glory, are hers. Booker T. Washington would have wept. While I can appreciate to some extent this woman's pathological disgust of whites, I cannot understand the roots of her homophobia or anti-Semitism. Her easy-way-out philosophy (Everybody's to Blame Except Me) is the very thing that keeps her where she is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the real deal","review":"We received our comforter, and it was not the dimensions advertised. We contacted the seller(Egyptian Cotton Factory Outlet Store) and the claimed manufacturer (Warm Things). The manufacturer responded quickly to tell us that this seller does not have access to their products. The seller has copied the language from the manufacturer's website and is selling fraudulent products in their name. If you care about the quality or dimensions of the comforter you're buying, don't buy from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to Parallels","review":"If you like the Parallels cd, then you will probably like this one too. Inside Out contains songs that, I think, could have easily been included on the Parallels disc, released three years previous. The production on this disc is kind of lacking in bass and depth, but the songs are just as beautiful as those on Parallels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continuing the trendy radio feel,still too good!","review":"Yeah it got a lot of radio friendly tunes but still this album is real good.Songs like the opening track,Monument & The Strand are the highlight of this album,FW never let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly beautiful recording, very personal and deep","review":"A lot of people hate this album. I guess is because is of the softer more retrospective style. For me this album is great, far better than Paralles. As a painter and graphic artist is one of the albums a use to get in the mood to paint and create. You can find here some of the most personal and beautiful of the band's songs like, Pale fire, Shelter Me, and Island in the Stream. Plus you get one of Fates's most awesome progressive tracks- Monument. Overall an excellent production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fates Warning is killer.....","review":"Fates Warning continues to push the envelope.

In one hundred years, will both islands be populated assuming that reproductive technologies are not available to either group? I suggest that Planet Alpha will be; but Planet Beta will not. Why? The basic answer is to be found in the biological complementarity of the heterosexual couple necessary for procreation that is absent in same-sex couple. This is a scientific argument...\\"As I suspected, Natural Law theorists are about as serious as Trekkies"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Page Turner","review":"Jack Polidoro has a writing style that will keep you turning the pages.

Jack included a generous helping of juicy sex too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take the good with the bad","review":"Ok, before I bought this DVD, I read all the reviews and I was prepared for it to be really annoying. IT WAS! She gets on your nerves. She LOVES to act, and she thinks she is really funny, but it gets old quick. On the other hand, I was so glad that I sat thru it because me and my husband learned so much. It was too late for us to get into a class, and this was really so informative, and it went over pretty much everything you need to know about going thru labor or having a c-section. So, for the people who said it wasnt enough cuz you didnt get to interact with couples or instructor, why did you buy it? Its great if you cant go to a class. What you learn is the most important part of this, isnt it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Education","review":"A good choice for those who are not a ble to make it to birthing class, or those that want additional information. Funny, witty and covers everything from start to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kim's review","review":"These classes were a lot better than I expected. Most of the infomration was refresher, but there were several things that I never knew. The instructer doing the classes is hilarious, and my husband actually sat down and enjoyed watching them. These were much easier for him since he doesn't do well in a class room setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Don't have enough time or money for Childbirth classes? Are the classes full? Watch this video instead! Really thorough and informative. It has the same information as classes for about a tenth of the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED THIS VIDEO","review":"The lady is kinda annoying. But the videos made me feel prepared and made me feel comfortable with my decision to not go to any formal classes, these were more than enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"So helpful!","review":"I was induced with my first baby, which led to a c-section. I was bound and determined to do a VBAC with my second, but didn't want to redo the hospital birth classes. Got these DVDs, watched them once with my husband and several times on my own. Extremely educational, entertaining and helpful. Had a successful, drug-free VBAC and used much of the advice and information DVDs while laboring."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty helpful","review":"My husband and I both enjoyed this helpful dvd to better prepare us for the \\"BIG\\" day. We were not able to go to an actual birthing class because of his work schedule. There are a lot of reviews complaining about how the birthing instructor isn't very funny and somewhat cheesy, but it's really not all that bad. We both found her to actually be humorous in most parts. This dvd is very easy to understand and is great, especially for new parents like us. I def recommend it, and also, if you have netflix, you can rent it instead of buying it. But it's dvd by mail only, not instant streaming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard program to watch","review":"This dvd is very difficult to watch. The instructor is very annoying. Herinappropriate, unprofessional comments clearly make the couples in the class very uncomfortable. We were actually shocked by some of her poor attempts at humor. The entire program consists of this instructor lecturing to a small group of expectant couples, using outdated props and pointing to diagrams from old childbirth classes. You never get a real sense of what labor and birth are really like. Comfort measures and breathing techniques are extremely limited. All she does is lecture to this class. The format is boring and the content limited.There are better ways to prepare for childbirth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Informative...nice alternative.","review":"I was on the fence about a child birth class, so I bought this video. I watched the first lesson on her website and that was really helpful. I really liked it. Sheri is fun. She knows her stuff and you feel like you are in the class with them. It did drone on at some points (medical interventions/medications/cord blood banking). When you get to the second disc, she talks about medications, positions, and really important stuff, but after a few mins it gets to be too much. Watch this in small increments! It makes processing the information so much easier. You can always go back and watch important sections again :-))) I plan on buying the breastfeeding video!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"informative","review":"I think the video was really good, im a nurse so i know most of the information already but it will hopefully help my husband. I think my husband preferred the video to an actual class. I mainly chose to use a video because of my schedule. The only thing I would have liked to see a little more was ways to help deal with the pain- like more breathing techniques. Overall I think it was good and would reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money . . . bad quality, not DVD worthy!","review":"This is a DVD! Why is it presented as a badly shot (often shaky camera work) montage of a lady talking to a birthing class? I really thought there would be actual scenes of a birth (i.e., a birth film as you would see in a real life class), and real graphics (instead of zooming in on the sign the instructor is holding up!), etc. Also, the sound varies from very low to extremely low through the entire thing. I had my tv almost on max volume just to hear.The information is ok, but several years old and new studies are showing controlled breathing beats all the patterned breathing that is taught here. Also, the NY accents get old fast. Again, I really expected more from a $50 DVD. Save your money and buy a book! Also, there's a typo on the back cover, which appears to have been put together on a home PC. The DVD looks like something I would burn. Not high quality stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I did not enjoy this video or find it informative. I thought the video was very boring and only watched half of it before I tossed it. Also, I bought this because I was having my first child and didn't know what to expect during labor but once you go into labor the nurses tell you everything to do so the video was a total waste. Also, the lady on the video is very annoying. I felt embarrassed for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"i felt like i was being talked down to the whole time. Me and my wife found this video to be a waste of money. The women in the video seem uninterested with what was going on and the video as a whole felt very out of date. Do not waste your time with this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long winded.","review":"This video was dull and did not provide any information that I didn't already read in the books that I checked out from the public library for free. I'm fairly disappointed with my purchase and I feel that my money could have been better spent. I find the video rather pricey, but gave it a try because of a very enthusiastic recommendation from a friend. Needless to say, if you are the type of person who must have audio and visual to learn, steer clear of this and find an instructional video that's more concise. If you can learn through just reading, I highly suggest you just check out some books for free and save yourself some money. If you like long winded stories and have too much free time on your hands, this might be the video for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too annoying","review":"I'm sure the information presented in this class is good, but the presentation set my teeth on edge. Sheri thinks she is funny when she talks in a screeching voice and makes fun of new mother's foibles in her \\"funny stories\\". I cringed every time I heard her squeal as a pretended mother with a problem. If you can get past her, then I guess the DVD can give you the information and techniques you need for Lamaze. But unfortuanately Sheri spends more time talking or shrieking while trying to be amusing than just giving the information you would like to hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare yourself from this","review":"Turns out Sheri is the most annoying person ever. And, she really must hate women in labor, judging by the way she makes fun of them and mimics them with a whiney, high-pitched baby voice. Throughout the whole \\"pushing\\" section she talks about how much you will whine, and if you don't, just wait because you must not really be in labor yet. She goes on and on about how horrific the pain will be, but them she tries to talk you out of an epidural!! If she was my L&D nurse, I would cross my legs until the next shift change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take the time and go to the casses","review":"This DVD was over rated and to be honest, as a first time mother, I found watching this video in my 6 & 7 month to be nerve racking and at times scary.

The classes were informative, I received more info there along with some freebeees."},{"rating":"2","title":"its great","review":"was helpful, it comes down all the nerves that exist before having the baby, enjoyed, did not get bored, its interesting and you feel like your part of the class. thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative!","review":"My husband and I didn't have time to attend an 8 hour birthing class at the hospital, so we opted for this video. It was very informative and helped us understand what was happening when we went to the hospital. It was a little cheesy, but definitely worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"great alternative to going to a class","review":"My husband and I felt prepared enough after watching this DVD. Sometimes the teacher's sense of humor was annoying BUT I learned A LOT from her. (Though she's also clearly pro-natural birthing)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"The information is ok. However, I feel like I am watching an episode of Family Guy when they stretch a joke way past the funny part. She is trying so hard to be funny that she ruins the purpose of the video. I really wanted to learn from the video but the dumb jokes and Sheri trying so hard to make it funny just makes it tough to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video!","review":"I really didn't want to take Lamaze classes, just not my thing. So I researched DVD's and found the Laugh and Learn Series. This is an excellent teaching and exceeded my expectations. Very helpful, detailed and well layed out video.

I maye even watch it one more time before my baby is born this July."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn About Birth at Home: Convenient, Easy","review":"Love it!This DVD includes real couples in classes by Shirley (who is teaching the classes)In a nutshell she walks you through women anatomy, birth (or labor signs), do's and dont's; breathing exercises, and labor.Because each sections is separated in chapters, you can choose which ones to view; The best part is to be able to view this in the comfort of your home with your partner or husband, at your convenience; ask questions to you doctor or midwife as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter loved it!","review":"I purchased this for my daughter, expecting her 1st child.

The breathing technique and education was on point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it","review":"My husband and I were not able to attend a birthing class, so the doctor suggested we rent/buy a video.

It is a reasonable video and keeps you fairly entertained. However I do not agree with everything that is \\"taught\\" on this video; I guess that's why we chose a midwife instead of a doctor/hosptal for this birth. If you buy this video (or get it from the local library) make sure you take what is said with a grain of salt. Birthing on your back in a hospital is NOT the best or least traumatic way to bring a new baby into the world! Good luck!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster, Uninformative DVD","review":"The presentation and content of this video leaves a lot to be desired. The visual aides, diagrams, etc. are not professionally done nor are they referred to in a clear manner. The video is frankly quite boring.Search for another Lamaze video, you'll find that there is another that offers a lot more detail with a much more exciting and engaging presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no laughing in this video...","review":"There's not much learning either. Sheri is incredibly condescending when she mimicks pregnant women. This video could also really use some visual aids besides Sheri holding up a poor illustration, writing lists (that she doesn't finish) on a whiteboard and the worst...her on the ground, legs spread in high-waisted khakis demonstrating childbirth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Because I love condescension","review":"If there is one thing that will turn me off to any form of instruction it's condescension.

I was trying to be part of the whole child birthing process. Thing is, this DVD provoked an unearthly rage in my spouse. While watching it Bayles seemed more intent on belittle the viewer and sharing her own life story then furnishing us with information. My spouse secretly thought that this Sheri Bayles was trying to ruin her child's birth. The DVD taught us nothing, 80% of this DVD is about Sheri talking about her own life.. The information she did give is easily obtainable from a free pamphlet. When I told my spouse I paid $[...] for the movie she freaked! [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Run away from Sheri Bayles!!!!","review":"Altough the content on childbirth is descriptive (at times a bit too descriptive), the commentator/director Sheri Bayles is one of the most annoying, irritating, wanna-be-actresses that my husband and I have ever seen. Her approach to teaching by injecting humor is painful, and it took all of our strength to not plug our ears and cover our eyes to watch this woman. If you can handle obnoxious, loud and nerdy instructors, then you may enjoy this DVD. The 5 couples she works with in the instruction look bored and confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most annyoying childbirth video....ever!!!","review":"You could not pick a more annoying instructor than Sheir Bayles. She absolutely ruins this class. The video quality is horrible as are the 80's rejects posing as her audience.

We became childbirth experts. Sheri, thank you for sharing this information in such an easy to understand and humorous way.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful purchase","review":"This DVD was a great investment. I was pregnant with my second daughter when I bought this DVD trying to avoid taking a Lamaze class and it totally did the trick. I felt better informed and prepared for natural child birth and how to avoid unnecessary interventions. I recommend this for any new or repeat Mommy's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing tons of crucial elements","review":"This video/DVD does not thoroughly explore all the elements of Lamaze preparation. The cover reminds me of Wilson from Castaway...he didn't know much about childbirth either.If you want to pay for only ~10 or so minutes of good information, spend your money. There are other products out there on the market that have a much greater wealth of knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying instructor- waste of time","review":"I wish I could give this video 0 stars. Don't waste your money on this video. It's a 4 hour tirade of this woman trying to be funny. She is not funny. The actual INFORMATION in this video could have been condensed into an hour or less- if you cut out all her nonsense.You could learn more in an hour of watching youtube videos and surfing- for free... and you won't have to endure this woman's awful personality and attempts at humor (numerous times SCREAMING into her microphone.) Also, the footage appears to be from the mid 1990's- very dated, it's like watching a VHS recording. If you don't believe me go ahead and buy this- you'll see."},{"rating":"1","title":"blagh","review":"I was hoping to have a condensed, to-the-point, informative guide on giving birth. I had missed my window of opportunity to be in a class and decided I preferred to be able to watch a video from home anyway. I feel that a lot of time is wasted in this video with theatrics and cheesy humor. I ended up fast forwarding through a lot of it only to realize she was still desperately trying for laughs 5 minutes in to one point.I am probably going to purchase another video simply for the fact that her style irks me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Good Information","review":"I am currently taking a birthing class and it did not cover many areas that this DVD covers. I am so glad I purchased this video. The price is very good for the information received.Updated 30 Nov 10 :This video was a life saver. The useful information allowed me to make an informed decision for having natural child birth vs medical intervention and delivery (epidural and possible C- section). I had natural child birth and was very pleased to find out that the pain was tolerable without medication and I wasn't hooked up to anything except a Hep lock. If you are having your first baby you should watch this video with your spouse/partner so that you can create a birth plan before delivery. Also, look at the Business of Being Born video by Ricki Lake it is also very informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Our baby is here, and the DVDs prepared us very well for what was in store. We knew what questions to ask, and what the nurses/doctors meant when they were using their vernacular thanks to these classes. This is a great substitute for the classes at the hospital because you get the same information at a fraction of the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"It gets the job done","review":"My husband works shift work so attending an actual class week after week wouldn't have worked. I figured the next best idea (and actually cheaper idea) was to get a DVD we could both watch. Sheri Bayle's attempt at humor is not as good as she would probably have hoped but she is still an informative and relaxing teacher. I would recommend this DVD if you can't attend a class or if you just need to save a little money for all the stuff you will need to buy your new baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very informative","review":"I bought this DVD because I didn't want to attend a traditional childbirth class, but still wanted to be informed. I found this to be just what I needed. The instructor gives a lot of good information is a pretty compact amount of time. I like the fact that I can go back and review parts of it whenever I want. I did not find the audio quality, her sense of humor or her accent to be annoying or prohibitive to the learning process as some others seem to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than taking a class!","review":"This video was almost like taking a birthing class. It's almost as if you are in a classroom setting, but in the comfort of your own home. The people are a bit out dated, but so far I've learned a lot and this has been so much more convenient that going to an actual class. I recommend it highly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying and condescending","review":"My husband and I couldn't fit a birthing class into our schedule, so upon reviewing our options we decided to buy this dvd. Being that we are a couple with a great sense of humor, and don't like to take anything too seriously, \\"laugh and learn\\" sounded like the right choice. Honestly, we both found this woman-Ms. Bayles- to be extremely annoying with her stories and condescending atttude. She constantly made fun of the people she was talking about...especially the men. We were expecting a nice take it easy approach to lamaze, but we found ourselves rolling our eyes at every digression. Although, I have to say that she is quite knowledgeable and if she would stick to the facts and not try so hard to be funny, this would be a worthwhile dvd. By the way, I never write reviews, ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"She gets funny, annoying... but you learn in the end.","review":"I read other reviews before buying this DVD and I was aware of what to expect. I think you will learn from this DVD everything you need to know for labor. Husbands can also have fun with this video. If you dont mind the jokes and silly faces she makes then buy it. The best part is that you can re play the video again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I bought this because I am a bit introverted and the idea of sitting in a room with other couples was causing me anxiety. But, my midwife really wanted me to get the wealth of knowledge that a child birth class provides. I took a chance and found this DVD on amazon. I truly lucked out, this dvd is awesome! The teacher is qualified and just funny. She keeps you interested and gives the info in easy to remember ways. I like that there are five couples in the class, so you still get the worries and questions that other new parents could only provide. The interaction is great and you can stop and start the dvd at you convenience. I will say that it held my interest so much that I watched the entire first dvd without stopping! If going to a an actual class is not for you for whatever reason, then I would highly recommend this to you! You will not regret it and will come out more knowledgeable and feeling confident about your upcoming birth. Good Luck!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiny. Annoying. Can't watch.

The only time i can tolerate the video is when she was actually serious and informative about childbirth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is a wonderful DVD to watch, especially for those who are having their first child. I watched this before my son was born, and had a completely natural birth because of it. This was MUCH better than the birthing class that we took at our local hospital. The woman who presents the information is a little goofy, but there is a lot of helpful information here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable Resource!","review":"Sherry's a bit quirky but she has a teaching style that is amazing. We loved this video and learned so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic if you can't make a live childbirth class","review":"We had signed up for a live childbirth class but then I was put on bed rest and unable to attend.

I would highly recommend this DVD as a great alternative to a live class."},{"rating":"2","title":"could have done without the \\"laugh\\"","review":"very informative, content was well structured, though the instructor is a self-declared \\"comedian\\" with only a couple people laughing out of obligation. it was painful. this made me glad that i didn't attend a childbirth class (and bought this instead).i also could have done without the Viacord plug... it's like a commercial took over the ending of the program to spoil it.all things considered, definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Current and easygoing class on childbirth.","review":"My husband and I decided to buy this when we had to miss the childbirth class we had signed up for at the hospital. It was easy to watch, very informative and we appreciated the up-to-date information on labor and childbirth. I would recommend it to any pregnant women/couples out there looking for a cheaper and more relaxed childbirth class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than actual class!","review":"My husband and I had signed up for a 4 week childbirth class through our hospital - attended the 1st class and decided we would not be going back. It was very outdated. This DVD was great - very current. Yes, some of her jokes were lame and her attempting to be funny gets a little old, but overall it was really a beneficial DVD. It was nice to be able to do it at our own pace and in the comfort of our own home. I would definitely recommend this DVD to expectant parents rather than taking an actual class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD for soon-to-be parents with busy schedule","review":"This DVD worked out excellent for my husband and I who don't have a lot of time to go to the traditional classes. We were able to do these classes out of the comfort of our own home, on our time and without the frustration of traffic, etc. Also, the DVD was less money than what the hospital wanted to charge us for enrollment into their classes. The sound fluctuates a bit, but it did not get in the way of our learning experience. I would recommend this DVD to anyone out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I ordered this video because we are living overseas and couldn't find a live class in English. I'm giving it 2 stars because it's better than nothing, but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise. The production quality is quite low - the volume fluctuates and there are are very few visuals. It's just a film of the instructor talking to about five couples on a bare stage. Both my husband and I found the instructor annoying, especially her whiny impressions of women in labor. Putting together a DVD class is a great idea but could have been done much better, especially considering the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good video, not as cheesy as people say","review":"I was very happy with this DVD set (and in fact just ordered the breastfeeding DVD from the same instructor). I watched it in lieu of attending childbirth classes and do not regret that decision. I had read several books about labor and delivery, etc., and can't say that the video really contained a lot of new information but it brought the information together nicely and made me feel more prepared overall. I also appreciated the fact that the instructor did not spend a lot of time on breathing techniques and did not overly emphasize natural childbirth. Instead, she discussed the desirability of postponing medications until the labor is well underway because of the cascade effect of interventions (which seems sensible to me). But she certainly didn't try to push going natural all the way. As for the humor, it's not anywhere near as bad as some other reviews have made it out to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Verry happy with this video - 1st time mom here","review":"I am a first time mom and had no idea what I was in for as far as the birthing part goes. I don't have time to take a class so I bought this video. I am soooo happy I did! I have learned sooo much and feel very confident now about what to expect at the labor. Sherri Bayles is funny and explains things very very well. I highly recommend this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Educational and Informative","review":"My husband and I purchased this DVD after attempting to attend an in-person childbirthing class....they just weren't for us. We loved being able to watch this DVD at our leisure in the privacy of our own home. This was one of two DVD's that we purchased and this one was by far the best. Sheri's sense of humor was perfect for the subject matter in my opinion. It really put my mind at ease (a lot of the other courses really scared me) and I feel extremely prepared for labor and delivery. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants the benefit of being knowledgeable of labor and delivery, yet is hesitant to join an in-person class. I'll certainly keep this one and watch it for subsequent pregnancies."},{"rating":"2","title":"This DVD really helped me","review":"My husband and I were unable to find any classes in our area that would work for us, so we purchased this DVD. We found it very helpful! I loved that I could go back to it and watch certain parts over again to refresh my memory. If we had gone to a class, I wouldn't have had that luxury. Once I went into labor, I knew exactly what to do and I was able to make it without any drugs. The nurses at the hospital were all asking me if I had gone to a class and I told them about the DVD. They said it must have been good because I did everything perfectly. I would highly recommend this DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's laughing?","review":"My husband and I are expecting our first baby any day now. We opted to get a childbirth video versus attending a class. After doing some research and getting reccomendations from friends, I decided to purchase this video. While the information on the DVD is helpful and each segment is clear and easy to understand, the instructor presented it in such a way that made extremely painful to watch.The instructor continuously makes annoying jokes, mocks pregnant women and their partners, using the most unfunny and unflattering impersonations imaginable. Watching this woman's attempt stand-up routine was so uncomfortable that we often found ourselves fast forwarding through a lot of it. Please believe that neither me or my husband laughed during this DVD. Not once.I wish we had just gone to childbirth class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful...........!","review":"I loved this Dvd. It had so much info that I found so very helpful. I would tell all my friends to buy it. It was very intertaining and funny. It awnsered all my questions on child birth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase! Worth it!","review":"My husband and I did not want to have to take the time or money to attend an actual birthing class. We decided to purchase this video and we are very pleased with the product. The video goes over everything you will need to know. It is very informative. My husband loves the way that Sheri Bayles teaches about child birth. He thinks she is funny. Defiantly recommend this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I needed to know...","review":"I am really enjoying this DVD. It answers everything you need to know and makes me feel like I know what to expect when the big day comes! I have watched this video over and over by chapters and take notes simply because it's hard to take in so much information at once. What made me happier was to see the couples in Sheri's group get together for a reunion after they had delivered. I would have liked to hear the couples experiences in delivery, though. I appreciate a light and easy going environment and attitude as she teaches this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great knowledge for a new mommy or experienced mother","review":"I purchased this product at my eight month of pregnancy. It comes with two disc of information.The DVD is of a live class with real people participating in discussions . This is the best you can get to attending a class yourself. I felt engaged and involved in the class just by watching it on the Television. It covers everything that you need to know about childbirth and I loved it. I would recommend this to anyone who cannot attend childbirth class,does not want to attend classes or a mom that is scared about natural childbirth. After watching this DVD I felt as If I had attended class and I am now more confident and ready to go with only two more weeks to go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive and fun","review":"Sherri's video gives you all the information you need to know about having a baby in a straightforward and easy to understand manner. Plus, she is just plain funny. The video is divided into six \\"classes\\" that each cover an easily digestible amount of information. My husband and I watched them 2 classes a sitting. I highly recommend the set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have!","review":"This DVD is a must have for anyone who is going through childbirth...your birthing class may not explain things with this much clarity and detail (I know my didn't). I learned a lot about breathing, and controlling your breath, and although I am not planning on using drugs through labor, I thought her section on medical interventions very useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"good information, but...","review":"A great video for the information it provides, though some of the sections do seem brief. You do have to get past her humor, which can be annoying at times (would be better to have more info and less joking around)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rudimentary, though a tad insightful","review":"It seems to attempt to reach out, but overall remains a small personal account of the trials and tribulations of an $8 billion/year industry. Just not professional enough for me to get my undivided attention. It was a worthy attempt, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"First of all, the information in the DVD is very informative but for $50 buck I figured it would show something more than a lady standing in front of a black curtain holding up the same anatomy pictures that are on my doctors wall. I love how she simulates labor by pushing a doll out of a wool hat....It was so realistic. I sat there thinking,'are you kidding me?' Sheri, the instructor, knows what she is talking about but is extremely annoying and shares a lengthy personal story for every point. For every 10 min of information, you get 20 minutes of insight into her personal life. I would pull my hair out and ask for general anestesia if she was my labor nurse."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor choice!","review":"Do not buy this dvd! if you are curious check it out at the library.... she spends the 1st half an hour talking about how big babies and small pelvis are to blame for most of the problems in labor...... SO UNTRUE!!! I am a trained Doula and we should never blame babies or women's bodies for unexpected outcomes in labor. Birth is Normal.... Birth is Natural..... Babies and Women's bodies know what to do and CAN GIVE BIRTH. Interventions are sometimes needed, but this woman does not inspire confidence..... but fear! Look elsewhere for your information and make sure to read Ina mAY gASKIN'S GUIDE TO CHILDBIRTH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly unwatchable - nonstop grating attempts at standup comedy","review":"Incredibly inefficient information delivery.

Pure torture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great information","review":"I wasn't able to attend a in person class but I am so glad I bought the DVD to learn about childbirth and what to expect. I fully intend to use the breathing techniques and I learned a lot of information about labor and delivery. I really like I could go at my own pace and watch and re-watch any parts I needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for calming first child fears","review":"I felt completely in the dark about what to expect when my wife was pregnant.... I like being in control of my situations and knowing the right things to pay attention to, I was concerned about my lack of knowledge especially since we were giving birth in Hong Kong and I was worried about a possible language barrier.This DVD made me a self-proclaimed expert.. I really felt like I knew everything I needed to know and it completely dispelled all my worries.When it came to the big day... despite complications such as water breaking with no signs of labor, introduction of a drug to induce labor, and the ultimate required c-section, I never broke a sweat. I even helped with some decisions, like how long we were going to wait until we gave up on a natural birth. My wife didn't watch this DVD with me, but I was able to comfort her through the whole process by telling her what to expect next.This is an ABSOLUTE no question about it MUST for a new parent-to-be."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST Childbirth DVDs ever","review":"These DVDs (I believe she has three or four of them) are not boring, definitely entertaining, and Sheri has a one-of-a-kind sense of humor. Some people criticize that, but I'm quirky...so maybe that's why I like it. She's obviously an advocate of natural childbirth, but I don't feel like she was beating that down your throat through the whole DVD. I'm very much of the mindset that \\"if I need meds, I'll scream for them.\\" From the DVD, I didn't get the impression that if I ever said that to her, she would claw out my eyes. But really, even my husband LOVES watching this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"helpful","review":"This dvd was very helpful before I had my first baby. I wanted to be aware of the different things to do and what my husband should expect and it gave lots of information. loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"laugh and learn about childbirth","review":"Fantastic!! My husband and I found this DVD very informative and easy to follow along. We both felt very comfortable watching in our own living room. ;) The instructor puts you at ease. Only thing I would add is more footage of actual birth. (although i still feel nothing more could have been learned by seeing this actual footage) My husband strongly disagrees. He found lack of footage to be quite comforting."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for the modern enpowered mother to be or her husband","review":"I will give her I did learn something while I wasn't being insulted by her gurgle giberish bad jokes. After weeding through, rolling my eyes and totally annoyed by this person, I did find out something. There was NO LAUGHING though. I found her unsympathetic unattached to the really beautiful thing that will be happening when I give birth. Just when I wasn't scared anymore after reading Ina Mae's guide to Childbirth, this woman made me feel aweful about the impending doom that awaits me. I am saposed to be scared and my husband an unhelpful weenie who can't deal, how can this women do this to the world when we've come so far. Unrelaxing and totally neurotic!! A huge waste of money and time. Don't buy it, I wish I hadn't. Really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lot of time is wasted in describing the steps","review":"me and my wife are both professionals.

There's no memorable music; no fantastic use of color; and no likeable characters. The holes in the plot are unforgiveable and the story-line is infantile. The plot twists are predictable and almost laughable. This is simply a sorry excuse for an Argento film. I just hope that He'll make-up for it on his next project."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Quality Blu-ray ever!","review":"I couldn't get through the first ten minutes because the quality was as if it was a DVD from the dollar store. The quality of this Blu-ray makes VHS look fabulous. I even wrote a letter to the company and got no response. I buy lots of Blu-rays and DVD's and I will NEVER buy one from this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why an EP release of this film?","review":"While Troma treated this well regarded latter day Argento film reasonably well with its DVD release, and its initial $14.98 VHS release, anyone who is a fan of this talented director's visual virtuosity and deft use of color, camerawork, and scene composition should be aware that this new, reduced-price VHS version of The Stendhal Syndrome is in the inferior *EP* speed mode. I have yet to ever see an EP release of a film on video that did not have considerable video noise and very poor color quality. Since the original, more expensive SP version of the tape appears to be in the process of being phased out by the less than artistic-oriented Troma, this is very unfortunate.Please, Troma, give us VHS buyers back a decent quality SP version of this film.And please, Amazon, do include a note in the technical information section when you do carry a VHS tape in EP mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"The blu-ray image is TERRIBLE!","review":"I wish I had read the negative and accurate reviews of the terrible quality of the blu-ray before I bought a copy.

I have not seen the DVD, but I can't imagine it is any worse than this blu-ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and pointless","review":"Great idea--strange reactions to art--is tossed aside and scene after scene is set up yet goes nowhere. (Why does she return home? Why does she have to be a cop? She never shows up at the station!) Poorly edited with transitions so bad, title cards were added so you know where you are -- Rome, etc. Interesting conclusion, yet really, it's a mess so skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, really bad","review":"Argento used to be one of Italy's best film makers, unfortunately with \\"Trauma\\", this and \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" it looks as if the old boy has completely lost it. This film holds none of the magic and mystery of his other films and is competely lacking in style. Asia Argento is very pretty but totally unbelievable in the part of the policewoman. She is years to young and whoever decided on her for the part must have been blind. There are moments in this film where I'm sure I must of blushed in embarassment for Argento the acting is so incredibly BAD. Unfortunately the film is completely lacking in style as well and Argento seems to have become interested in CGI and treats us to some of the most pointless CGI visuals I have ever seen. My advice is give this film a wide berth... but then it's all a matter of taste and Argento fans will have to see it... Just make sure you rent before buying"},{"rating":"2","title":"Late masterpiece by a brilliant director","review":"The Stendhal Syndrome is definetely one of the finest entries to the oeuvre of Dario Argento and refers strongly to the likes of Alfred Hitchcock. On the one hand it offers you all you ever liked about Argento's flicks: beautiful images, a brilliant soundtrack (this time by Ennio Morricone), ingenious camera working, bloody killings and breathtaking locations. Added to that you get fine performances by Dario's daughter Asia and Thomas Kretschmann. But moreover the movie doesn't lack a good story and shows not one narrative weakness throughout it's complete running time. The stringent plot makes it somehow different from almost every Argento flick since. The movie is highly recommended to all fans of the horror-/thriller-genre - you won't be disappointed. And all the earlier aficionados, that didn't waste to much thought about the story, will get their kicks too. After all we're talking about the maestro..."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst picture quality i saw since old rental vhs","review":"Previous review is right. Horrible!

Argento's films are usually released on Anchor Bay, who does a stellar job with the transfers. This DVD, though, is so full of artifacts in dark scenes that it felt like I was watching a 5 year old video from a rental store. It also didn't feel like it was a FULL letterbox version as parts of the opening credits were cut off on the left and right edges.One of the interviews was OK, but it was really an interview all about Argento's 'Phantom of the Opera'. The other interviews were extremely cheesy as they weren't even done in person -- it was just Dario holding a microphone answering questions that were coming to him over the phone.The movie is quite interesting and better than I expected. It deserves a much better DVD than this extremely cheesy production from Troma, though. Movie gets a 4/5, DVD gets a 1/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stendhal Syndrome (2-Disc Special Edition)","review":"Blue Underground has done another great job with this horror / suspense movie director Argento.Great plot & suspense.The movie's main character is the beautiful and young policewoman Anna Manni (played by Dario Argento's daughter - Asia Argento) who is tracking down a violent serial killer and rapist (played by Thomas Kretschmann). Her track leads her to the Uffizi museum in Florence. There however, Anna is struck by the Stendhal Syndrome, which makes her faint, when among certain works of art, like paintings and statues. Her new handicap makes it very difficult for her to track down the killer,But she did finally found him .But i found the story a bit fantasy base but common since argento directs no comments.........long live Dario.........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible blu-ray transfer!","review":"This is one of my favorite Argento movies, but a horrible blu-ray transfer. Maybe the worst I've seen so far. I popped in my special edition DVD just to make sure it wasn't my imagination, and the DVD looks fantastic. I'm all for maintaining film grain, but based on a comparison with the DVD, it looks like the blu-ray artificially manufactured it (maybe it has something to do with going back to the original negative). So if you have the Blue Underground 2-Disc Special Edition DVD, don't waste your money like I did. Just stick with the DVD. And if you don't have the DVD, I highly recommend it (if you're into Italian horror movies, that is...or Thomas Kretschmann)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad transfer...","review":"The DVD Transfer of this movie is an absolute fiasco, and I am surprised there isn't more noise about it in the reviews. Very close to unwatchable...and I have an ugly feeling the hideously unprofessional and cheezy Troma studios is will be doing more \\"transfers\\" of Argento's work. It truly looks as if Troma \\"studios\\" ran a bad copy of a VHS tape on a television set, pointed a camcorder at the screen and then made a transfer from that tape. Disgusting. How's the movie?

The film alone would rate at least 4 (out of 5 stars) but the Troma DVD is pretty appalling. The audio is hissy and the volume low and the picture is incorrectly letterboxed and riddled with digital artifacts. If the DVD weren't bad enough it's made even worse by having a horrible, embarrassing introduction and foolish, faux interviews with Troma president Lloyd Kaufman. A good film is severely cheapened by a poor presentation. A big, fat ZERO for the disc. Hopefully, Blue Undergroud or Anchor Bay or Mondo Macabro will be able to obtain the rights soon and do this film justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out!","review":"I bought some pills for myself and some of my friends to try out.

Guess I shouldn't have spent my money to learn that... The book is no different from her previous book, Lotto Wheel Five to Win. Well, the new one has some shorter wheels than the previous one (that is why I give two stars), but if you are into wheeling, you will be able to find them elsewhere.

The songs are catchy, the lyrics are funny yet full of truth, and her voice is awsome. The songs are full of crude humor as she talks extensively about drinking and sex. Somehow though, even a more conservative girl like me can grow to loooove her music. The reason is because of how deep her lyrics can be, even though, at a first lisen, it might not appear that way. Her songs can range from very funny like, The World is Full of Bastards, which almost any girl can relate to, and guys laugh about, and Mata Hari, about a fake and slutty girl to more somber like Takes His Place, about relationships never working out. Her songs speak to everyone as she speaks about messing up in life and about bad relationships.

It's full of original, creative surprises that restore faith in the existence of musicians courageous enough to speak with their own voice, from something deeper and broader than a desire for popularity.

I recommend Animal Dreams and Ron Newman as a musician worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"single song makes it worth it","review":"Almond sings off-key, but that is a longstanding trademark , and, oddly, creates a weird appeal regarding his singing style.

It might be of greater utility if the tone wasn't vaguely condescending and pedantic, and it eschews the panoply of actual examples in favor of definitions. To wit: the 2nd person singular present perfect conjugation of \\"to love\\" results in \\"If you have been loved...\\" gives me one (singular) example but not the rationale of when to use this. The density of the text preceding the example conjugations will require your own self-study to master (if you must) the ability to spin off a subjunctive 3rd person plural present tense conjugation.The best recommendation I can offer for this is as a companion for language learners who need a quick reference for English analogs of other-language conjugations, such as when you try to conjugate \\"falar\\" and need to know which one to use.--#"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Hard Cover","review":"Very Slick Looking Book - Perfect Condition and Glossy Looking - Looking forward to reading it :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"If the title is incorrect...","review":"If you REALLY want to write correct, you won't write \\"correctly.\\" Yes, it's in common use but it is, by the rules of grammar, incorrect.

The ending was ...well, what were they doing? The heroine was bashing in the skull of a person who obviously was no where near her from the angle of the camera shot and where she was swinging. Anyway, the movie was pretty bad.

In order to turn it on, you have to twist the base. The problem is, it goes from zero to full strength. No gradual increase.

Yes, the pillow appears expensive but it is much less expensive than buying an adjustable bed. I don't use the neck roll - I prefer to use my own memory foam pillow.

I wish I knew where Ms. Auel got all the information she did on the herbs and plants that she describes in her book, that the characters (Iza and Ayla) use for medicine. Some of them (like the willow bark) I know for a fact were used, and I wonder if all of the other herbs and plants really work the way she describes... Guess I'll have to check on herb and plant books for that matter! In any case, I also read the other books of the series (The Valley of Horses, The Mammoth Hunters and Plains of Passage), and I regularly check to see if Ms. Auel has published another book of this series.

But where the book really stands out is in the detailed, sometimes almost too detailed, picture of the world. The author clearly knows the world, the animals, the plants, the conditions exceptionally well, and only rarely does she really go overboard in the detailing of this information.Although at times the structure is kind of awkward, especially when characters are thinking, it is a fascinating, absorbing and hard-to-put-down book with likeable, understandable characters.I definately recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good book","review":"This is the first in a series of very good books following the life of a prehistoric woman.

The characters are all one-dimensional and stiff and Auel never really succeeds in bringing them to life. And come on, who really didn't see the ending or the rape scene coming? Auel was obviously trying to create a novel centered around a strong central female character, but she just succeeded in making Ayla looking like an untouchable annoying kid with all the answers.

After working at the local library's book sale where I could obtain hardcopies of several of Jean Auel's books, I decided to just order through Amazon.com those books that I couldn't get at the library. The Clan of the Cave Bear was one of those books. Since I already read it, I decided to go the used book route. The used book I got was in good shape. I was pleased with its appearance.

Ayla's life from the loss of her parents, to being found by the Clan at age 5, to dealing with their differences is all very well told. I love the fact that she becomes what most women in the tribe would not even consider becomming. I read this very huge book in 2 days, I don't even remember if I stopped to eat or sleep.

I highly, highly recommend it, along with the rest of the Earth Children's Series. You will love these books! Ayla is the strongest, most beautiful, lovable character I have ever confronted in literature. If I could meet any fictional character - it would without a doubt be Ayla. :-)The books are written beautifully as well. Auel does a fabulous job bringing the ice-age to life through breathtaking images and memorable characters.My ONLY complaint in this series is that the sex scenes are ridiculously \\"too perfect\\" - Augh. They could definitely be shorter, and there could be fewer of them. (You will not encounter these though, until the later books in the series, if you decide to read on.)I am a little hesitant for the final (6th) book to come out though... the 5th one ended on such a high note, I'm afraid to read on. Eeep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This is a truly touching book, in which you follow the life of Ayla, a girl born to the \\"Others\\", who is found by Iza, the top medicine woman of the Clan( aka cave people). You explore the feelings of the characters. Auel has created a wormhole into the past. Each character is distinct in itself, and you have a story outline both dramatic and explicit. When Creb\\\\ Mog-ur performs his ceremonies, you feel as if you are there. It's like watching a movie, only deeper. You explore the humiliation of Creb's deformaty, the stubborness of Broud, and the kindness and caring of Iza. When Ayla is discovered to be hunting against the Clan laws, you plead along with her against the death curse. This is a truly wonderfull book. There are some mature parts, so if you don't feel you can handle them, don't try. Once again, I strongly reccomend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well researched and written.","review":"Reading this book was an emotional experience. The author was able to describe scenes so accurate that I actually felt as if I were that little 5 year old girl, lost in the wilderness, hungry, cold, tired, delusional, and frightened. I was captivated with this series and reread all four books five times already. I've learned more about survival from this book than I have from 12 years in our public school systems. Great job. When's the wedding going to be written?"},{"rating":"2","title":"very exiting series","review":"I read those books, few years back and i'm still thinking about them, i would love to have another book that would continue the story. I miss the caracters. Is there ever going to be another book??????????????????????"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful story of early man.","review":"I was introduced to this book this summer by my aunt. She recommended it as one of her favourites. So, I decided to give it a try. I found the beginning a little slow moving. Once I got into it I couldn't put it down. The story is starts at the begging of man and is based on the evolution of man. Ayla, the main character is left to die because her clan was killed in an earthquake. She is adopted by a passing clan and brought to live with them. The story deals with her acceptance into a very different community. She is cast as an outcast from her clan because she is different. In fact she is one step above them on the evolution scale. In the end she is exiled from the only family she has ever known and goes on to search for people like her. I enjoyed this book alot,especially learning about different plants and their many uses. Jean M. Auel wrote a wonderful book and I can't wait to read the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best series of books out there","review":"This book is if not the best then it's up there in the top five, along with the other 3 she has written. The story of a young women struggling to grow up and live in a world that doesn't accept her can be related to each of us and will be a book you remember for the rest of your life. The writing is fantastic and you are swept away into a world of prehistoric man that you won't want to come back from. The only problem is when you finish all 4 of her books you are on edge waiting for her to finish the next one. Earth's Children should be the set of books every person has and you will reread it many a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story - You will enjoy it.","review":"This was a great book. Although the story takes place about 35,000 years ago you can see lots of parallels to events in our lives today. As well as enjoying the story and learning about primative times you will also be thinking about how this can relate to today... Although the book is about 500 pages and small print its an easy read.."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD, I WAS IMPRESSED AND WILL READ MORE","review":"I never thought I would read this book based on the title, but I did and really liked it. I just bought the 2nd one and can't wait to start that one. At times there was too much detail and not enough action, but a great story that makes you think, what was it really like?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Prehistorical Meandering Story","review":"The plot of Clan or the Cave Bear is ok, but I found myself skipping alot as the narrator goes on and on and on. For example, every time the protagonist goes herb gathering with her mentor, 2-3 pages are dedicated to describing the herbs and techniques. A short description would've added some depth to the story, but I really wasn't reading the book to get a lecture on neanderthal medicine.The characters are the saving grace of this story, adding entertainment and almost overcoming the sorry narrative. Almost, overall this book is very boring.One gets the feeling that Auel is trying to make a statement about feminism or male-female relationships, but whatever point the author is trying to make is not clear.I think my money would've been better spent on something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificently compelling...","review":"This is a wonderfully entertaining, well-written and thought provoking story. The author did a superb job of developing character and plot, leaving the reader with a lust for the story to continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amature.","review":"I'm a reader. I am not a writer, but if I had the writing skills of Jean Auel, my review of Clan of the Cave Bear might look like this:\\"I eagerly awaited the rare opportunity to read the famous book by Jean Auel. As I anxiously read the exciting words on the white pages, I was constantly distracted by the desparate use of poorly-chosen adjectives. After reading two large paragraphs, I could easily tell that the large book was poorly written by a hopelessly unskilled amature.\\"Jean Auel had some great ideas for a story, but does not have the skills to tell it. The story might be interesting and well researched, but it is difficult to get past her awful prose which does nothing to paint a picture of a prehistoric time, and her amature use of adjectives is forever distracting from the story she's trying to tell.Please read the sample pages before buying this book. This is not a book for anyone who enjoys good writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"clan of the cave bear","review":"this book opened my mind to the life of the first people and strugles they indured. she showed rational method as to how many discoveries could have come about. riding a horse for the first time must have been a true sight, it is taken for granted by us today but can you inagine what it must have been like to wittnes this for the first time. i have read all her books several times and been just as awe struck by every one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an amazing book.","review":"This book was required summer reading 2 years ago for my english II AP class. I thought it was really an amazing book. I loved the main character how strong willed she was even though she was more human and not cave man. I thought Auel did a great job writing it, but sometimes she was too descriptive about setting of the story. Description and imagery is good, but too much of it takes away from the story. I have read the rest of the series, but if you like this book you should read the others that go along with this series.thank you for your time,Loran"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Scientific Saga","review":"I just finished reading this book and I think it is one of the best books I ever read. This book tracks the voyage of a Cromagnon girl who lives in a clan of neanderthals. This clan adopts her as a member of it. This book is about how the clan accepts her and learns to deal with her differences. This book is not only a great story but it is scientifically accurate. I would call this book a scientific saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, puhleeeeaze!","review":"I wouldn't have stuck with this improbably (even for fantasy) tale much beyond the parts where Ayla: 1) invents shampoo and 2)discovers fire, but I was in that proverbial \\"desert island\\" situation (it happens!). I guess you have to be into sci fi set in the stone age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compelling story but reads like a textbook","review":"The premise of this story is interesting and the story is good; it's too bad it's so poorly executed. The prose is blocky and reads like a pre-history textbook with characters and plot slapped on as an afterthought. In general there is just too much time spent on detail, like the author needed to make several length-reducing rewrites. For example she spends quite a bit of time describing how the women in the Clan are treated as property, which is so cliched it doesn't need more than a passing mention. She spends a lot of time talking about side characters who are too under-developed as characters to tell apart. The detail about the pre-historical fauna and lifestyle are told in long paragraphs that bring the story to a screeching halt, rather than being woven into the narrative in a way that's still entertaining. However with a lot of skimming the book did keep me reading until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"First in the series ..","review":"This, the first book in the series of \\"Earth's Children\\" is a gripping, fascinating introduction to the first of our thinking ancestors. Almost as if we were there."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful epic","review":"This is one long story that really takes you into the depth of prehistoric times and rituals. It's wonderfully researched and finely detailed. I read with wonder all the recipes for medicine. What herb cured or maintained certain diseases. The movie does this book absolutely no justice. What was Darrel Hannah thinking when she signed up for that bomb? This book takes a look at human relations and the beginnings of communication. A great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup of Tea","review":"I felt like I was reading an anthropology book, which may be appealing to some readers, but wasn't what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving book about the endurance of humanity","review":"I first read this book when I was in 7th grade, and am rereading it now, in 11th grade. This is an amazing story that my dad convinced me to read, and I've become hooked on the whole series! Auel gives the reader not only meticulously researced information concerning culture, vivid descriptions of the neanderthals, and geography, but also a twisting, inviting plot that makes the book impossible to put down! Thus Clan of the Cave Bear(and the entire Earth's ChildrenTM series) appeals to a wide audience. Adventure, history, and an eloquent storytelling style are combined with excellent results."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOURS OF GREAT READING......","review":"I have the entire collection of Jean Auel's Children of the Earth series, and reread them over and over. Great books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"This book was interesting with great promise. The premise was fascinating but the writer fought with herself throughout. She spent a great deal of time on the flora and the fauna. There was always a paragraph on a bush when a sentence would do, a sentence on a tree when a word would suffice. The characters were well developed. Over all it was a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read For Ice Age Purists!!!","review":"Thank you Auel for giving us this great prehistoric ice age novel. It is refreshing to see that the heroine is such a strong female character portrayed with so many different layers. It reminds me of Etok inThe Age of Eternal Firein how forward thinking they are from their tribe mates. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this delightful book and look forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Added to my collection","review":"I had almost all of the Jean Auel's books and needed this one to complete my collection. It turned out to be a book club size and I traded it to a friend for the full size version."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it.","review":"I loved this book.

Its a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best of her books but still high quality...","review":"The descriptions and stories are great, though sometimes the nature descriptions get a little out of hand. The book is interesting and you can learn from it, and at the same time it's exciting. I would off course encourage anyone to read the book, but I would also say there is more to look forward to."},{"rating":"2","title":"The clan Of the cave bear is a good book","review":"It has an interesting plot and alot of great information. I read this book when I was in 6th grade, what made me be able to get through it was the fact that the character Ayla was so well built and that I was able to believe she was real and that those thing's actually happened to her. The rest of the character's were good too but Iza and Ayla were my favorite. I am in 8th grade now and have read the four book's in the series that have came out, and I'm waiting for the 5th to be written so I can read it! when I read this book I couldn't set it down. Don't worry about letting young children read it, I read it when I was young and I was able to get over the troubling part's. I actually think it is very educational. Jean did a great job on reaserch and wrote a very interesting, fun book. I reccomend it"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really tried to like it","review":"My Mom and sister both recommended this book, but I couldn't make it through more than half. Really not very interesting.

I mean the way Ayla treated as some stupid animal then next she's treated like a savior come down to help them. But other then that it was a wonderful book. The way Ayla makes the bad things in her life seem like they were put there so she could be tested to see if she was worthy enough to do other things that the woman of the clan are not supposed to do.

Well researched - maybe, poorly written - definately. The plot simply goes nowhere, and the characters are so unrealistic and banal that it is impossible to feel sympathetic toward them.

Good story, a little difficult to believe at times, since a lot of the actions of the people in the \\"clans\\" are hypothesized. But all in all a determinate story of survival, and coming of age in the post ice valleys. I do believe that she, Auel stole a bit from the Native Americans, well not steal per se, since their culture more closely mirrors the nomadic clans, but there are interesting depictions of seers, spirit chasers and medicine women. There are some romantic scenes which I have to admit were a little much for a 14 year old, but interesting nonetheless. Slightly educational and a good read. - Jennifer Rees"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good reading.","review":"I loved all three books.

But Clan of the Cave Bear is one with glue that sticks with us forever. I read this book 30 years ago when it was first published, and loved it. Shared it with my friends and family members at the time, who loved it, too. Now that I have a teenage granddaughter, I ordered it so she could enjoy it as well.Jean Auel created a character set in the backdrop of the Neantherthal age who could be (should be) a hero and role model to young girls everywhere. Her journey takes the reader into the hearts and minds of people who lived so long ago, yet the human element of love resounds deeply.Read this book! You won't be able to put it down.

Great read.","review":"If you enjoy anthropology, archeaology, and learning about the first of mankind on our planet, then you will find this entire series plausibe, and very enjoyable reading. This is a series of books that completely holds your attention through every page. Every book is based on thorough research of ancient sites, tools, and other findings that tell us about the people of yesteryear and how they survived the glacier period. The characters are so well presented that they seem real. Each additional novel is a continual saga from the prior book, so continuity flows very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, excellent insight into prehistoric man","review":"While the story and characters are good, what really draws me into this series is the information on prehistoric man. Did you ever wonder how people figured out fire or how to tame horses, why one species of pre-human eventually won out over another, how knowledge was passed down, how people spent their days, how they explained biological processes? What customs established in prehistoric times have influenced today's culture? This series gives you insight into all these things and more.There is a bit of fantasy in this novel, but the facts are incredibly well-researched by the author (medicinal herbs!).Once you've read this first book, you will have to read the rest.This is the first historical fiction I have read - it has opened my eyes to the genre.(The later books in the series have more sexual themes, so parents might want to discuss books with their teens who are reading it.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cave of the Clan Bear","review":"Cave of the Clan Bear is well written.

Leaving aside all the wild inaccuracies - one of the main ones being Auel's portrayal of Neandertals as doltish brutes -the heroine is constantly making one earthshaking discovery after another - shampoo, domestication of animals, law of genetics, sex=pregnancy, and, last but not least, tampax. No one else can figure anything out, but there she is, churning out one Nobel-Laureate discovery after another. I'm sure in one of the later books she will be found making a short-wave radio out of a large rock. It became really maddening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle's edition is full of typos","review":"The kindle editions of these books are chock full of typographical errors that sometimes make it difficult to figure out what should have been written.

Now here's the bad part. It is anthropologically inaccurate. Mrs. Auel does a beautifully stereotyped depiction of the Neanderthals as stooped, muzzle-jawed, intellectually inferior creatures as compared to wonderful Cro-Magnon people with their tall erect graceful carriage, blue eyes and blond hair. I mentioned this book to my anthropology professor and he said, very succintly, \\"Burn it!&quot"},{"rating":"2","title":"This series is a \\"keeper\\"","review":"Normally, I read contemporaries but this series drew me in. Ayla struggles to live when ice sheets were retreating from Europe. She's raised by Clan, people who communicate with body language more than vocals, and makes many mistakes on her way to adulthood. Jean Auel's research at times intrudes but mostly this is a story that completely transports the reader to a long ago time where you root for the heroine and feel the fear and trauma along with her. My bookshelves are few but this series has designated space because I revisit favorite scenes often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Clan of the cave bear is about a Cro-Magnon girl named Ayla. She is orphaned during an earthquake as a child. When she is attacked by a lion she is found nearly dead by a clan of Neanderthals.

The story is based on actual archealogical findings. The character Creb is a medicine man who has severe physical deformities. An actual neanderthal skeleton was discovered that apears to have the same deformaties that Creb has. The story is fictionalized but it is amazing how they cancreate a culture based on a few artifacts.

I have all her books in hardback. The reason I am so attached to these books is that the details she interweaves into the story line really brings it to life. The descriptions of the plants and their uses, the feel of living in a cave, these are the things make Clan of the Cave Bear great. I know the author does at least a year of research before each book and it really shows.The plight of Ayla, her constant feeling of being different and insufficient, her struggle to please those she loves, this is something everyone can relate to on some level. I look forward to diving into the Painted Caves very soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clan of the Cave Bear, good read.","review":"This story while not being for young children, is a wonderful trip into prehistoric times.

I had never read a book based in prehistory and I was pleasantly surprised. The author's careful description of the tribe's skills held my attention, and I truly enjoyed watching the human girl, Ayla, become a woman among a Neanderthal tribe. I recommend this to high school students and older."},{"rating":"2","title":"I fell in love with this book from the first page......","review":"TCotCB was fantastic. I fell in love with Ayla, and the rich descriptions of the surroundings and life. Jean M Auel did a wonderful job of researching the lives of the Cro Magnan man, and about herb lore.

I laughed with her triumphs, and still cry with her tragedies everytime I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prehistoric Research Fiction?","review":"I can't say enough about this book. It is about two prehistoric stages of man (one is on its way out, one is on its way in). The lesser developed man (\\"the clan\\") finds a little girl from the more modern man whose parents have been killed in an earthquake. They take her into the clan and raise her as their own.The story itself is interesting and urges you to read on. But it's the research that's fabulous.

I first read it when I was in sixth grade and have since re-read it many times over. I felt for every single one of the characters -- even those who were less than desirable. No one character was truly evil nor was any one character truly good. Each developed and matured realistically as to their own personal phyche. By the time I turned the last page page I felt as if these characters had really lived and breathed. I must also say that the ending haunted me longer than any other book I have read. The same can not be said for the next couple of books. The second started off pretty well but then degraded itself by becoming nothing more than a romance novel. The other two quickly followed suite. Other than using them as a sex manual, I can see little value in them. I still care for Ayla and the Clan to want to know what happens next but I will probably wait until the paperback issues of her next two novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational.","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot.

When is the next book coming out?"},{"rating":"2","title":"there's nothing better than this","review":"I was incredibly bored one day, and went snooping around the basement looking for a new book to read. When I found my mom's old tattered copy of Clan of the Cave Bears, I didn't expect much. Oh my goodness, though, Auel is a virtuoso. I cannot wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELENT!!!","review":"It's just fantastic, an adventure full of emotions and wonderful landscapes. These series have given to humanity a great gift. Thanks a lot Ms. Auel. I hope you will continue the Ayla's story. I've been waiting for years to continue the story, I'm sure you have too much to write. When the next book will be coming out?. Every time I go to a bookstore I look for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cave Woman","review":"I had the misfortune to read the other three books of the series before reading clan of the cave bear but that did not detract from the joy of reading this book.Ayla's story is just that,although the author has written about our ancestors one should not take it as a trueism.Ayla's constant fight for survival and her success inspite of Broud's dislike for her,simply because she is diffrent from him helps push the story along.Their battle of their will continues even after her brutily beats and rapes her.Her decision to leave the clan inserch of her own is out of selfpreservation,leaving her son is hard but so necessary.The book is highly intresting and this authors eye for detail is truly awsom.Keep on Mz Auel.There is a rumor that there is another book in the works.Hurry PLEASE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good, But Not For Immature Children","review":"This was an excellent book, probably my favorite of the first four. I read it when I was 11 years old, and have re-read it so many times the book is practically destroyed. However, this book, while I as a 6th grader enjoyed it, is not for the immature child. Think carefully before you tell anyone about the series, especially your child, because it contains a few explicit scenes, which increase as the books go on. Another word of advice- if you don't like a lot of details in a book, don't read this, because the author details surroundings and histories frequently. However, I thought the details were fascinating. Jean Auel is a wonderful writer, and I eagerly await the fifth book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally addictive","review":"Loving this series. Best books ive read for a long time. All six books keep u hooked and wanting more"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book and get hooked on the entire series!","review":"A 5-year old Cro-Magnon girl in prehistoric Europe is tragically orphaned by an earthquake that kills her family. She is left to wander aimlessly through an ice age harsh barren landscape without clothing or resources. She suffers terribly from starvation, exhaustion, and wounds sustained from a cave lion attack before being adopted by a Neanderthal clan when she was near death. The heroine Ayla is a survivor. She is strong and resourceful. She polishes her survival skills at a very young age and develops many positive characteristics. I was enthralled with her character and the hardships she had to endure. She is an inspirational figure and I thought about her often when writing 'Adoption Detective'. The long wait between sequels was agonizing. Read this book and you will be hooked on the entire Jean M. Auel series.Judith Land, AuthorAdoption Detective: Memoir of an Adopted Child"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"I first purchased this book nearly 20 years ago, and each time I re-read it I find new and fascinating things within. There is no doubt that this is a meticulously researched and crafted novel, and we all learn to identify with the waif Ayla as she struggles to survive with her new family.However I must say that even though I have read and enjoyed all the books in the series so far (one just has to know how Ayla is faring!), this is by far THE strongest and best. The characterisations are strong, and the trials and tribulations of the clan believable. Please don't be put off by the success of the series, this book is a gem which can more than stand by itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING series","review":"I have difficulty putting into words just how much each of the Earth's Children books have transformed my way of thinking. Auel's ability to create characters who use our natural resources for the greatest good has strong appeal. Each book has spun a world of reality-based fantasy which can guide how we see the world today. The world of Ayla, the Clan, and the Others is one in which EVERYONE should enter... and decide to stay."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Clan of the Cave Bear","review":"I read the series for the first time when I was in Matric. As can be believed, I was unable to put down this absolutely riveting book. I have subsequently reread the series twice, and also convinced my family and friends to read it. It is an emotionally evocative tale of a young woman full of strength, courage and an abounding love. I strongly suggest this series, and wait with impatience for the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Fantastic!","review":"It took me quite sometime to actually read 'Clan of the Cave Bear', and when I did, I could finally see why it was so popular, but there was much more...Valley of the Horses followed, and there was no turning back, I read all three in one weekend. And then Plans of Passage hit the book stores, and, well like so many can't wait for the fifth, and here's counting on a sixth. I thank Jean for such an impressive story. Thanks again:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the most beautiful books I've read.","review":"What can I say? Obviously most people who have read it think the same as I do, judging by the amount of reviews with 5 stars. I was 12 when I read it for the first time, even though my teacher told me it was too old for me. This book is not too old or too young for anyone. It is filled with the joy and pain of life, and shows that tribulations lead to better time later in life. I experianced Ayla's fear, delight, anger, sadness and despair at finding herself so differnt to those in her life. She is someone we can all relate to. Ayla is the only character who really developed much (and she is developed A LOT, esp. in later books)but she is the one we are all concerned with, and th others are forced to react to her changes. If you haven't read this book, read it. You will never regret it. P.S.

I had an older version of this backpack that the XPS would just fit into snugly but, alas, the zipper teeth eventually broke off. I was concerned that this backpack might be too small and after first slipping the laptop in... it didn't. But I discovered that theres a removable cushion liner at the bottom of the laptop slot (attached with Velcro), removing that gave me an extra half an inch and voila, the laptop fits (albeit snugly again). The laptop isn't completely unprotected at the bottom, there's a hard plastic shell there as well and the snug fit keeps the laptop from sliding around. 15.5\\" is max though...those with a larger laptop (say the newer 16\\" wide Dell XPS latops) will probably want to seek another backpack."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality backpack, don't buy...","review":"I bought this backpack when I wanted to have a new bag for my laptop. I got a good JanSport Backpack for my niece a few month ago and she liked that one, so I chose JanSport again. It's out of question that JanSport is generally a good brand.But this particular backpack is really poorly made. The texture is made by some cheap materials, and definitely looks not as good as the picture shown on the website. There are not many compartments in the bag with poor paddings, and the space is not as big as that was described at all. Nevertheless, the laptop sleeve is too wide for my 15' widescreen notebook. So I bought another backpack of Swissgear this weekend when I saw it on sale with only one third price of this JanSport. And the quality of my new bag is Much Much Much BETTER than this one.Don't buy this backpack!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind boggling design flaws","review":"I had a Jansport pack which I dragged all over the world for 12 years. It finally needed some serious repairs, and I sent it in. Apparently they no longer repaired that model, and sent me a Firewire instead.First, the pack is made for midgets. It is simply not long enough for my back. I'm 6' and don't have unusual proportions, so this is kind of disturbing.Second, the weird laptop pocket in the main compartment is an incredible design flaw. The rigid support at the bottom is about two inches above the bottom of the backpack, so if you load the pack, whatever you put in can't ride against your lower back, and effectively pulls the backpack into a curve so you feel the very straight, rather uncomfortable stays at the bottom of the laptop pocket, and the top of the shoulder straps.It's simply not an acceptable pack for day to day use as it's designed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boogie Woogie needed a Title Cover!","review":"Although the music of this CD was just what I needed to teach a lesson on early jazz and it's influence on the artist, Mondrian, I was disappointed that it did not have the cover sheet shown or any information about the artists.

While many films have a rental fee, this film was included and I would not have watched it without that incentive.I found the plot of this film rather predictable, but the acting was good. I haven't seen many Danish films so it was interesting to me on a cultural level. The scenery wasn't a huge part of the film, but it showed some lovely aspects of Copenhagen.

So, I won't say anything about the plot.This is a movie that enfolds little by little as the viewer, and the characters, begin to learn what is going on. I simply can't express how much I loved this movie. It was very well done, the story was captivating and the actors' performances were engaging, completely believable and simply superb.The film is very well edited, the camera angles used were essential to getting to know the characters.

Larsson meanders through the chapters, dropping and picking up points like a stream-of-concience dictation. While his Pro-globalization points are good, he disregards the arguments against globalization as if they are irrelevant. The point of the book could be made in about half the pages, especially if Larsson would leave politial bashing out.If you want to explore the issues of globalization to make your own decision on whether you agree with it or not, choose something else, or supplement this book heavily. It's a little boring, but may be useful once you have the background on globalization.If you have a background in business, don't waste your time with this book.

The entries (with drawings or photographs) of these one-off variants and technological near-misses make the volume worth owning.

Fire Emblem is one horribly designed game. 75% of it is listening to the characters talk. And by talk I mean you see pictures of them on your screen with nothing but their mouths moving and eyes blinking and written below are what they have to say. It gets boring very quickly. On top of that the fighting is almost like playing chess, you move your characters around through squares on a board and you never get to actually attack any enemies. All you do is initiate the attack command and they show a little video of your targeted character hitting the enemy and maybe them hitting you back once. It's monotonous, cheap-looking, and not very fun at all. My advice to anyone considering buying this game is to rent it first. Then you can see for yourself how bad it is before wasting your money on, in my opinion, the worst gamecube game ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Fire Emblem Yet","review":"This game is awesome!

The only con for this game is that if you've ever played Fire Emblem Sacred Stones, you will find out that this game loses the choices of classes to change into.

A lot of story is packed into this beginning chapter book. Although some profound issues are raised, I think what will appeal to most young readers is the adventure and the relationship between the boy and the new pet he brings home - which, in this case, happens to be a dragon!

It does not even contain the \\"The Owl and the Pussycat,\\" which from the ad I expected to be included. The table of contents is a joke - listing the page numbers of each of the numbered limericks, which could have been written by almost any college freshman after 3 beers at the local bar. There was no attempt at editing, and often a limeick with one line at the bottom of one page would be continued at the top of the next.This is a book which Amazon should be ashamed to list and should be obliged to refund all of the money paid by each person taken in by the listing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, classic, but...","review":"I'm going to review this briefly as a book for children, which is what it is. I read most of this to my 3-year-old (including all the limericks and most of the poems, and a little of the other stuff). As long as I didn't read it too often, my son was usually game for this. He liked it but he didn't love it to pieces. The nonsense and silliness certainly appeals to silly little kids, and why shouldn't it? And as far as I'm concerned, it's excellent, and deservedly considered classic children's lit., but frankly, I didn't think it was five-stars great. The conceits and poetry are not always exactly inspired, and the illustrations are pretty crude, although plenty entertaining.\\"The Owl and the Pussycat\\" (which we've read many times) and some of the limericks are definitely five-star selections in any case.At $5, this is a nice cheap edition. It would help if the pictures were in color, but I gather you're getting it closer to what was published in the 19th century here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formatting problems","review":"The two stars refer of course not to the book but to its format. I recently acquired my first Kindle and thought I'd download some freebies to try it out.

It's a wonderfully entertaining book to get in print form though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version - lost formatting","review":"Once again, the free kindle version is a disappointment.

There are a huge variety of game modes in this game. Although this game only has 15 characters, this game is very attractive. The characters are very recognizable. And unlike the first Road to Wrestlemania, each character has a unique moveset. For example: The Rock has his Layin' the SmackDown Punch Rush, Undertaker has the Chokeslam and the Tombstone, Triple H has his Jumping Knee Attack, Chin Crusher, and his Spinebuster. The championship mode on this game is fun, although no storylines. You can win merchandise from ShopZone by by doing special tasks. You can create a PPV, but you must make the events enjoyable not only to the fans, but...Vince McMahon! Overall, this game is a great game, I recommend this to any Pro Wrestling fan.

After looking at it, the book was returned.Words cannot even describe the dissappointment I felt after glancing through it. Boring, old, uninviting, crafty suggestions.

Edgar Rice B. has made me bored with his style. This story is LONG on description and SHORT on plot. There is so much description that I lost track of what I was reading.

I guess I will be very embarrassed if the Mars Rover proves Edgar Rice was right!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I remembered it!","review":"Read the John Carter of Mars series back in junior high school. I remembered the violence of the culture created by ERB in that series and the concept of honor in battle, but I had forgotten that there were underlying messages relating to family values, honesty, integrity, trust, the individual's right to seek success, the strength to stand up for one's own beliefs. While the storyline definitely is somewhat thin, the book reads easily and leaves no loose ends. Didn't see the recent movie that came out based on the series; kind of glad that I didn't. It was fun venturing back into that realm of imagination that only books can provide."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great find!","review":"I recently discovered this band while surfing the net.I sampled a few songs off their website,and I really loved Bemoaned Animosity.I wasn't sure if I'd like them that much,but wow was I wrong.Their tagline says it all,Death Trash Chaos!This cd has got to be one of my favorites,an instant classic for me.I find it difficult to compare them to other bands,as they have their own sound.My sister chuckled when she heard the name of the cd,but after she heard the title track,she was hooked and loves it as much as I do.It's certainly heavy,but blends thrash and death metal so well that I never really notice,cause I'm to busy head bangin'!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal all the way.","review":"This band has some very good music.

Upon first sampling I thought it was interesting and fresh; I hadn't really heard a lot of music like this before. Upon repeated listenings, layers upon layers of new musical discoveries started trickling out of my loudspeakers. I was dumbfounded! To this day, Oui is one of the few albums I have that I can put on any time of day and enjoy thoroughly without reservation - I cannot say this of very many albums that I have. I cannot praise this album enough, if I could give it 10 stars, I would. The reason is that it sounds great; the album is quirky yet very accessible; the vocals are so different, yet once they get in your head you can't get enough of them and you wouldn't want them to be anything other than what they are; the arrnagements are fabulous and the compositions inventive and refreshing. I cannot recomment this album more highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good album","review":"The reason is that it sounds great is because the album is kinda odd-yet very accessible-the vocals are so unique,The instrumentation is great, the performance is right on the money. The melodies and interplay amongst the various instruments has always held my attention. Oui sounds like the next step of a fine tuned, experimental, rock band. I'm always listening to and buying new music. I have generally liked most Sterolab songs so when I heard that Archer Prewitt had joined I figured I'd take a shot.The occasional electronic textures are cool, not in-the-way. I have been listening to this CD a lot lately. All in all this is a very good album. If you like other bands in this genre like Spoon, Smoke Ring Days, and Death Cab for Cutie, you will most likely like this. The Sea and Cake are the jazziest of the bunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sonic summer's day","review":"I think this is the best Sea & Cake album so far. Song for song, this stands up against any of their previous albums, and it's their most cohesive album to date as well. The music could be described as latin jazz played by musicians with a rock background, or as rock music heavily informed by jazz influences. There are touches of synthesizers, there are breezes of strings, the guitars dance around each other, the drums create rhythms that are part latin, part kraut rock, while the bass anchors the entire album, creating a foundation (a mobile dynamic foundation) for the other players to weave their sounds around."},{"rating":"2","title":"whoa","review":"Some people find have bad taste in music and for the rest there is Sea and cake whose originality and creativity is a rarity these days. No cool videos or haircuts not even a cool belt! but some damn fine music. just listen to \\"all the Photos\\" MAN!! Some people find this boring and i feel bad for their simple minds that cannot wrap around the sea and cakes sweet melodies. the colony also is fabulous among others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blissfully arranged, elegant easy listening music.....","review":"Something of a Cult band insofar as their albums (although critically applauded) are usually stumbled across by word of mouth. The unashamedly \`Easy Listening' tag associated with their music, probably deters people. But if you actually listen to the tracks, there's a preciousness to they very accessibly music, that although features lyrics of hushed sighs & several instrumental tracks feature throughout. You'd have to be a cynical listener not to smile when hearing the catchy guitar pop of \\"Afternoon Speaker\\", or indeed the acoustic lounge of \\"The Leaf\\".....not an album to impress your friends with. But for music that evokes positive expression & sunny afternoon on every turn, restrained, Bittersweet indie Pop has rarely been so well composed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozic","review":"This idea was interesting on their earlier albums. If I listen to Oui ten times, I can't recall a single song, or even a single idea. Nothing here is memorable. It's sonic wallpaper. If you like this record, you sure are in luck. There are thousands of boring, fungible records like this released in the mid-60s from Brazil, France, etc. This is not to say that all of this type of stuff is worthless. Rather, now that the Sea and Cake's output is an emotionally devoid genre exercise, there are many other mediocre examples to collect and savor. I'm sure most of them are similarly \\"positive,\\" as our reviewer friend from Venezuela found Oui to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Sea & Cake are critically acclaimed and have made some decent jazz pop in the past, but there is only one good song on this album, and \\"Afternoon Speaker\\" is it.

The energy being is given the form of a young woman. What follows are scenes of her spying on couples and her interactions with others. The alien is collecting and cataloging experiences for her race who have risen above physicality but still miss it.

The plot could have been expressed in two lines of text and only functioned to serve up sex scenes. Which there were an endless string of. Starting with in minutes of the start when Femalien looks out her window and watches the neibors get it on in the backyard. The kink scene left me cold. Maybe the scene will seem kinky to a really Vanilla person, but hardly anyone else. The actors were so-so. They didn't look bored, but didn't seem to put much into their roles. Most of the acress were agmented and in one case had the profile that comes from a bad job of surgury. The main star had a wonderful face which reminded me of Jennifer Tilly. As a polyfiditous person I was pleased to see an ending that clearly indicated a ongoing triad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!! A Cheap Stinko!!","review":"Big disappointment. During the simulated unsexy sex scenes the sound track changes to some awful detached music that kills the mood. The main charactor isn't even that good looking. You want \\"HOT STUFF\\"? Then check out (the unedited or Unrated versions of)Emmanuelle, Emmanuelle 2, Dessert Hearts (the hottest lesbian scene ever made), Butterflies Are Free, Tender Cousins (the french language version), Carried Away, Lured Innocence.

I bought the VHS version from another source expecting the sort of movie \\"Roger Corman Presents\\" might sponsor, something along the lines of \\"Species\\" or Amanda & the Alien. While more in the vein of the latter the sci-fi part, {or any other technology for that matter}, is limited to a few teleportations via telekinesis and some aura/emotion melding. The movie is probably 60% by time made of sexual contact. Technically the movie is suprisingly well made for the genera. It is shot on film {not video tape}. The scenery is professionally done and the acting level reaches that of daytime soap operas. The sound quality is not bad. So the technical qualities are there to be transfered to DVD, just beware of the content."},{"rating":"2","title":"close encounters of the sexy kind","review":"As a nerd, I'd always dreamed that a race of nymphomaniacal superwomen would descend upon me from space and probe me to no end.

Femalien offers those nerds too scared to undergo sexy alien abduction a legitimate erotic alternative. Three billion thumbs up."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"I had the movie before, but when I saw that the collectors addition had the \\"Flyboys Game\\" I thought I would buy it off the market place. Good seller, but the DVD did not come with the game as advertised. It only came with a DEMO version of the game. They should have said that on the box. Thanks a bunch for false advertisement. Thought the other extras might make up for it, WRONG! Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty awful","review":"I'm an aviation buff and I'll accept a mediocre screenplay and poor character development if the flying is worthwhile. Sorry to say that this film falls short on all fronts (pun intended). The CGI flying scenes are very contrived, and are sadly inaccurate. The Fokker triplane was not introduced until 1917-not '16 as the plot suggests; the Nieuport 17 had a Gnome rotary engine which revolved around it's own crankshaft, but in closeups, the cylinders are stationary.Now the plot--can there be any more cliches in one movie? I can appreciate campy lines such as \\"We can't send those green kids up in those flimsy crates\\" when they're delivered by Errol Flynn or Basil Rathbone (The Dawn Patrol) but here the dialogue is flat and the acting is only passable at best.I was hoping that this film would be better than the reviews suggested, but it wasn't. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth Watching","review":"Like the movies \\"Titanic\\" and \\"The Great Escape\\", This is a story taking place during a historic event with characters that are a composit of some of the real people involved.It's WWI and the US has not yet entered the war. American volunteers are trained in France to fly and fight the war. They become the \\"Lafayette Escadrille\\". This movie covers their training, flying/fighting, squadron bonding and off duty time.This is no documentary. It is a gripping story of the Americans who flew for the French combined with excellent air combat sequences. Better in the Blu-Ray Disc version. It will leave you wanting to run it again and again. Good photography, good story, good sound/special effects, good characters, . . . can you tell I thoroughly enjoyed it? Be sure to watch the special features, see how the combat footage was filmed.Those who have seen \\"The DaVinci Code\\" will recognize Jean Reno as the squadron commander."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely disappointing","review":"I do enjoy historical war movies when they're done right. This cliché-ridden story is pain to watch and I fell asleep several times during the second half. The movie is ridiculously predictable, although in a few scenes the writers still managed to surprise me - the private airlift flown by the main character in order to rescue French girlfriend with kids from advancing German troops, or taking out the villainous German ace pilot during the final dogfight with revolver (after machine gun jammed/broke) are few examples of the worst writing taste. To say something positive - most acting wasn't too bad in my opinion (I've seen much worse lately), but couldn't save the flawed project. I wouldn't object the lack of historical accuracy if the story was enjoyable - but it was not. I'm giving one star in order to offset the multitude of 4-5 stars ratings; otherwise I'd give two stars. Do yourself a favor, ignore this movie and watch Blue Max again instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible - I walked out of this movie","review":"When I heard Larry Ellison the world's second richest man was involved, I had to go see this movie. Expecting great things. ORACLE sized greatness. Instead don't be fooled by the 4,5 star ratings people give this movie. What a load of rubbish! I expected an action movie - great fights - true war. Not a romance set in a very serious war. The lead actor is terrible. Sorry they cast too young an actor. It wasn't interesting. The only interesting actor was the guy with the lion. The rest I can't even remember. All I will remember from this movie was the zepplin exploding and the funeral where they mention that the guy with the lion was an atheist and that he didn't care much about religion anyway. So that is it - a true waste of money. And these second rate actors and kiddie script writers are getting rich from hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie or a music video??","review":"What is it where a director has so little confidence in his own work, that he has to fill in whatever blanks he perceives with incessant music??

What can I say, I love to study the elements of war, and I enjoy a good love story along the way. This movie was a great introduction to the role airplanes had in the first World War. Featuring the story of the Lafayette Escadrille, and the role Americans had in the early aerial engagements. The story also allows those who have little knowledge about early technology to understand that it was very rudimentary. (Using hammers to clear your machine gun comes to mind.) The soundtrack was very well done, and the needed animation(?) was excellent as well. I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Flying Adventure","review":"This movie is very fun and entertaining. It does slow down quite a bit at times developing the subplots, but even two solid hours of nothing but action would get monotonous and boring.It explores the bravery, sacrifice, and even politics exemplified by so many in so many wars. In this case it is WWI. It is the story of the Lafayette Escadrille, among the very first fighter pilots, as they take on the Germans. There is lots of action, great cinematography, a good plot, and a love story as well.Despite any inaccuracies with the aircraft in this movie, it is nothing that a non-expert would notice. The flying scenes may be CGI, but it is done very well. A very enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another computer generated teen brain flick","review":"The computer generated flying scenes are so unreal that us real pilots can't watch this thing....You can not fly next to each other and yell back and forth between aircraft...

There was almost NO sexual content, and no adult language problems, so, excepting for some occasional war violence, the movie would be suitable for almost all ages. The backgrounds of the various characters were the usual \\"composite characters\\" that one would expect in a movie where disparate personalities came together to be molded into a \\"team,\\" but this was better than most.

The plot does not flow well, the actors lines don't always fit in to the scene, the background music does nothing for the movie, & there is a love side story thrown in for good measure. The computer animation of the air battles is the only good thing about this movie. My wife & I both watched it together. We both did not enjoy it.

However, for all other reasons this is a great film. The storyline is top-rate, the effects are stunning, and the actors take the spotlight. Also, as it stars James Franco this film will, most likely, go over well with fans of the spiderman movies(like me). Not to shune the other actors, they all contribute to the movie. The action is also very realistic and sure to keep you on the edge. The life struggles of the characters add a feeling of depth to the film.

Devoid of historical substance, second-rate acting, predictable storyline - it shouldn't come as a big surprise that this movie was a flop at the theaters.Briefly, the CGI dogfights border on the ridiculous: aircraft in 1916 were hardly capable of the acrobatics and stunts shown throughout the film. More reminiscent of Star Wars than actual flying.Also: the portrayal of the Germans is laughable....all German pilots flying bright red, Red Baron-style, Fokker Dr.I triplanes, and led by the sinister \\"Black Falcon.\\" (!)

The CGI effects are painfully bad, so obviously fake that it hurts to watch. And the scenes where they use actual airplanes, or recreations, are just as bad. What really bugged me was the fighters with fixed radial engines, rather than the rotaries they should have had.

The makers tried to tell everything and as a result told nothing. The characters were unbelieveably superficial and too many of the flying scenes were historically inaccurate and unreal. If a few special effects are good too many are not necessarly better. The Blue Max and Battle of Britain are far far superior.

The aerial scenes are outstanding and it's actually good to know they could be done without injuries or crashes like some of the first World War I movies (Dawn Patrol comes to mind). The movie also pulls no punches about there being no glory in dogfights: if you were shot down, if the enemy's bullets didn't kill you the fall and crash most likely would.

As a lover of The Blue Max I hoped that Flyboys would exceed it largley because of advances in film effects. Was I wrong or what! A dismal screenplay peppered with gung ho naf lines paying scant attention to history. The best (worst) part of the film was the romance and our hero stealing a plane to rescue the heroine and her two young charges, for which the hero recieves a medal!! Yea right! But the one scene worth of \\"the skunk of the year award\\" was the hero landing his plane in a shell pocked no mans land to rescue his comrade traped under his aircraft, how did he do that?

I have been a World War I aviation buff for many years. When I first heard that someone was making a film about this subject I knew that I had to see it. My disappointment when I finally saw the film can hardly be imagined. It's not just that they drag in every movie cliche thats ever been used in this type of story; there is literally not a single authentic detail or presentation of such detail in this film. The airplanes are wrong, the airplane paint jobs, markings. armaments are wrong. The clothes and uniforms are wrong, even the airfield that these guys are flying out of is wrong. It appears that the film makers, instead of researching information on life as a volunteer in the french air service of that period, opted for looking at old hollywood movies on this subject.

First of all it is in color not black and white like most everything you see there.

My biggest complaint of this movie is that it's so cliche you could cut it with a knife. The role of Texan Blaine Rawlings, who flits off at a moments notice to be with his new love, is beyond belief or plausability. The rest of the acting ensemble, other than Capt. Thenault (Jean Reno), were window dressing in this piece of movie dribble. And the dreaded German Ace was hardly more than a voyeur who wanted to savor his victory by the sight of his victim's face before they died.Lame plot, poor acting, dubious historical accuracy, wrapped around some nice dogfight sequences.

You will enjoy this film and want to learn more about these great heroes!NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: I feel the picture is clean and beautiful with the stand out scene being the Zeppelin fight. However, I was slightly disappointed with the picture. I thought it would stand out and be more vibrant, but maybe it was intentional because it is a WWI period piece. The audio was also not the best I've heard either. All the special features from the 2 disc dvd appear to be here. FINAL VERDICT: If you don't own it already get the Blu-Ray version.

There was no creativity in the rest of the album; only canned and simplistic bubblegum boyband pop. If you want to torture anyone get this CD and make them listen to it.

As it happens, most of the book is devoted to a character analysis of Judith. In a nut shell, Judith knows that she is an ugly duckling with incredible brain power. We don't see any real attraction developing between Luke and Judith until the last quarter of the book. And then when it does, the author's analysis of Judith is vindicated for she is accepted by Luke because of her brainy self rather than her looks. The most tragicomedical line of the book must be when Luke agrees with Judith that she is not beautiful. Disappointingly for me, just when I'm getting interested in the story in the last quarter of the book, the plot reaches its climax and comes to an end. The story is dry and tends to drag on. I must say that the writing is good as can be expected from Charlotte Lamb. I gave it two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooring!!","review":"This game is way to easy.

Sure, does not contain the better-known novels - The Big Sleep and Farewell my Lovely - but it does contain The Long Goodbye, which is not only Chandler's finest, but a great novel by any measure.Chandler lived a tough, hard-drinking life, and these later works came out of his mind with difficulty. But the quality of The Lady in the Lake and The Long Goodbye (The Little Sister is less memorable) make this collection essential.In addition, the book contains some essays and letters, including Chandler's writing on the mystery genre, which will interest any budding suspense author.In short, read this book!

Kay Aurthur advocates letting scripture interpret scripture. The author of \\"The Parables\\" did a nice job, but I guess I was looking for more indepth analysis of the various parables. I would recommend this book; it is an easy read and does give a lot of information about the parables. Maybe if I were to read it a second time I'm sure I would get more out of the book.

Pumping, excellent score thanks to Craig Armstrong lets you walk away from the film with some sensation of feeling; other than that, bland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and Predictable","review":"There is real plot in this film, it just follows two bumbling theives. Actually the two actors are the only aspect that make this movie watchable, just barely however.The self-concious humour ends up being incredibly pretentious, it even seems to revel in the fact that it is pretentious, and somehow that makes the movie selfaware and hip.Some people might leap to this films defense and claim that the forgetable plot was part of the grand scheme to keep it fun and exciting. The problem is asides from the an uninvolving plot, this movie is extremely predictable, which further deminishes the already trite affair."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies EVER !!!!","review":"I don't get it. How can anybody give this miscreation of a film more than 1, maybe 2 stars? I expected to see a funny, original film but instead got to see some of the worst screenwriting ever.

This movie is not sophomoric.This has to be one of the most maturely realised and under-recognised films in recent film history. To whatever extent there is a modernism in the styling of the characters, there is also a remarkable restraint and authenticity in portraying the psychological tone of the time - in every social class and role, and the subtleties as well as the vulgarities of the social interactions. Read up on the period. This was SPOT ON. Affected Dandies did exist. The f**k word was absolutely in common usage. This film may be a lot more accurate than us moderns may want to admit.The cinematography is consistently superb. The acting and character development almost exceptional. Lighting, continuity... all first rate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasently Surprised","review":"I bought this movie on a whim, knowing that two of my favorite actors were in it, but also knowing it had not done well in the theatres and that one of my LEAST favorite actresses was in it. However, after viewing this movie, I'm shocked at how good it was. The music threw me at first, but I soon got into the mood. Knowing that Ridley Scott's son directed this movie also gives it merit. I would recommend this movie to ANYONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new old fantasy","review":"A very good book with a lot of fun. It's a little slow at the start, but once things get moving, it become worth the wait. In fact, this was a book in which its ending justified its beginning. It's a fantasy story which reminds us that all fantasy stories do not have to be about Tolkien and such. Every review I see of this book likens it to Alice, Dorothy, and friends.

Unfortunately, what could have been an interesting and scary film was just plain dumb!I would NOT recommend renting this movie (or even watching it for free once it comes to Cable), let alone paying money for it.

The action gets intense, and some scenes are pretty gruesome (don't eat your dinner in front of this film if you have a weak stomach), but I really loved the story and acting.

First of all, this movie has more of a plausible plot. Young people on vacation in Brazil are lured away from their hotel to become unwilling organ donors. Josh Dumal, Fergie's hubby and former Vegas star, is one of the actors. I think organ stealing is possible and maybe even probable when certain groups of people (can you say drug cartels?) have unlimited money. I have definitely seen some weird situations in Brazil and in other places in South America. Thank God that none of the things I have seen compare to this movie. Very scary.

But to be honest I think Turistas is slightly more realistic than Hostel. A group of 20s something were picked up one by one and slaughtered for their internal organs while vacationing in Brazil (wonder whether this movie is banned in Brazil for bad publicity of its tourism).Lead charactered is a brother and a sister (a rarity as flicks like this usually they are lovers - also check out Jeepers Creepers 1 as the main heroes are also brother and sister)Overall, the movie is well-paced, well-balanced between action, gore, humour and yes, SEX. The dvd itself is slighty disappointing. The 5.1 sound is OK but the picture transfer is too dark so it is hard to see what's going on the screen in the night scenes.

I have owned it on video for several years and i constantly watched it, so when it came out on dvd i jumped at the oppurtunity to purchase it. The story is about a lawer who is put in charge of a hockey team as his community service assigment. Gordon hates kids and he hates hockey. When Gordon was a child he used to play hockey so he is going to be a good coach if he could just get over the fact that he doesnt want to be there.

A movie that all kids have seen in their lives if they enjoy watching hockey."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't have to know hockey","review":"One of the things that I like best about these movies (and about the Major League series as well) is that as a non-north american, and someone who doesn't follow or know anything about either of these sports, I can still enjoy these movies and even learn something. I often feel that they are underrated in how clearly they communicate the underlying foundation of the story, which is the sport, its rules, tactics, and language, without sacrificing the entertainment value. There is a reason why the Mighty Ducks movies keep getting repeated on Australian TV - they are inoffensive, pure entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family-Friendly Hockey Fun","review":"If you're looking for a good hockey movie that the kids can actually watch, this Disney vehicle starring Emilio Estevez is actually pretty decent. Estevez plays hotshot Minnesota lawyer and former youth hockey star Gordon Bombay, who gets popped for DUI and sentenced to community service. His assignment: Coach a hapless youth hockey team made up of misfits from the wrong side of the tracks. It's been called \\"The Bad News Bears on skates,\\" but The Mighty Ducks is a little too saccharine for the comparison. If you can get past that (and all the shameless tie-ins to the NHL franchise Disney once owned) there's some good hockey action and positive messages about sportsmanship, teamwork, believing in yourself and coming to grips with past mistakes. Especially in the final scenes, when the unheralded Ducks play for the league championship against their arch-rivals, the Hawks, a team led by Bombay's ruthless former coach. (Avoid the movie's two sequels, which don't measure up.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened.","review":"Ray J Ray j Ray j whats goin on this album is crap theres about 3 songs with good beats on em but ray j's vocals just screw them up. theres nothing great about this album or ray j."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to this man?","review":"I previewed this album, and although some of the songs are pretty off the hook, I really have to ask: What happened to this man?I remember first hearing him sing on an episode of his big sister's hit sitcom \\"Moesha\\" about 10 years ago, and he was terrific.

It's gritty and it's honest. His vocals are REAL. When you're a true artist you understand that making a song is not always about hitting the 'right note\\". It's about the feeling behind the lyrics. The world is so obsessed with perfection that they're just not ready for this man. They won't let him grow up. One Wish is a gorgeous track. War Is Over is one of my faves. I love it when Ray and Bran sing together and the overall message is outstanding. He seemed extremely mellow on the track. Anytime is super sexy and sensual. What I Need and Exotic are also GREAT! But when you get to the last track 'Centerview\\" it'll blow ya mind. It's so gritty and honest. Sheds some real light on this mans ability to move an audience.

Furthermore, the information on Spiegelman was mainly gleaned from his comics. That basically means any fan of Spiegelman won't learn anything new. There were some interesting quotes and a few tidbits taken from various interviews with Spiegelman, but it was really nothing new to me.Its redeeming qualities were a few photos I hadn't seen before, but the images were primarily panels from comics of Spiegelman's.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This could be the best yet...","review":"In some ways I think this is Bebel's best album to date. Her music on this album exudes sensuality and sex appeal in a relaxed and mellow way. I am amazed that some fellow reviewers did not feel this from listening to this album. I have counted 2 so-so songs out of the whole entire album. The rest of the album is awesome, hence why I give 4 instead of five stars. Looking back on her other albums I found that there were always a few songs that were just so-so compared to the other songs on the album. She again beautifully fuses electronic and organic elements on this album. She shifts between the slower more intimate songs like \\"Close to You\\" and \\"Night and Day\\" to more festive songs like \\"Cadaca\\" and the great \\"Os Novos Yorkinos\\" (one of my favorites). All in all I think the songs are well arranged, Bebel's sounds great as always, and you should buy this if you liked her other albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet Nights","review":"Momento is a continuation of Gilbertos bossa nova lineage and the near perfect production shouldn't be minimized. Gilberto creates moods backed by rhythm and song and she hasn't done it better than on this disc -- really a perfect marriage of Tanto Tempo and it's gorgeous follow up Bebel Gilberto. I had the pleasure of seeing her perform with a symphony orchestra a few months ago and the songs here were alive and shimmered with orchestral backing -- Bebel herself is sublime. A true talent that will be around for years to come.The Shine of Dried Electric Leaves"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bebel Gilberto does it again!","review":"Along with Ceu she is one of my favorite Brazilian singers and have to say, bought this one more hoping for the best. After her previous releases I thought to myself \\"Well it cant get better than this\\" and while maybe I can't say she has improved this is still up there with the rest of her releases.Soft vocals over an almost African rhythm that just blend together so well. Yeh this is quality lounge music, this is music for the summer, long lazy days having a drink with friends, just being alone after a hard day or a long drive.Probably the only thing I dislike on this CD are when she sings in English. Give me that Portuguese any day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another solid collection...","review":"I wouldn't be at all surprised if this release, Bebel's third, receives mixed reviews. Its flaw is that the first two tracks are the weakest songs on the cd- hard to believe, I know...(and the 2nd track is the supposed 'hit single'). But starting with track 3, Close to You, through til the end, it's consistently strong, varied material, closer in spirit to Bebel's 2nd release, Bebel Gilberto, than Tanto Tempo: more focus on Brazilian music than electronica (though admittedly 'Cade Voce' does recall the insipidness of the opening two tracks). That said, there's none of the soaring intensity as on Bebel Gilberto: Memento, by comparison, is a rather laid-back, understated affair. Um Segundo- entirely acoustic and recorded live in a studio in nyc- is one of a handful of standout tracks, reminding me of how much I'd love to be back in Bahia..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Ouch!!

I rejoiced when I found a second and then when I listened to it could hardly keep myself away from it! If I had listened to this album first I would have dismissed Bebel immediately as not worthy of listening to. Her cut of Night and Day sounds like she is drunk and her instrumentalist joined in in the partying. There were a few good moments when the real Bebel seemed like she would make an appearance, but these quickly faded. I would not purchase a fourth CD without listening to it in its entirety first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album","review":"Bebel up to date still remains my favorite female artist. She continues to do what she does best in this album and that's make deep and sensual music. Though personally this isn't my favorite album that she's made, however the songs Momento, Close to you, Azul, and Cade Voce in my opinion are more of the rare gems Bebel has added to her already popular arsenal of great Bossa Nova music. Any true fan of hers would be satisfied with her overall performance of this album. Keep it up Bebel!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultra Force Field Jacket","review":"The real deal.

This upsets Miss Pickerell, but her curiosity overwhelms her and in a major mistake, she replaces Mr. Haggerty on the flight to Mars.This story is generally silly science fiction; the crew demonstrates incompetence to the point where Miss Pickerell has to come to their rescue.

It was difficult to warm up to the hero and heroine - Edie, a former lingerie model is cold and colorless, she returns to her home town and buys up the property that Wade has always wanted because he ticked her off. This is neither adult nor endearing. He, on the other hand, is your typical alpha male who, in this case 'jerks' off while looking at her layouts in lingerie. Not an attractive trait either. These two people are just not likeable and Edie is so dumb, it's scarey - while she's being stalked, she buys an isolated piece of property. The scene where her sister is being tortured is far too explicit for a category romance and more appropriate to a mainstream thriller. The rest of Edie's family were far more interesting than the main characters. Overall, disappointing and not nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that much of a heartache .,","review":"When Evie Brand comes home from L.A.,an ex-model running from a stalker she seems to get on the wrong side of Wade Armstrong ,someone who's been in love with her since high school, someone who's help she needs and wants even though she does not want to admit it.

Then read it only when it's one of those days where you just can't find anything else to read.She claimed to have been a mountain climber before Everest, but yet she had to ask other people what she needed to purchase for that climb. I would think that a \\"Mountain Climber\\" would have known what to purchase as far as equipment needed.She talks of this Zen responsibility then turns around to inform the readers of how Sandy Pittman is having an affair going on in her tent, of how Anatoli Boukreev's girlfriend \\"tip-toes\\" each afternoon to his tent to spend the night with him. I then ask myself, I wonder whose tent she was \\"tip-toeing\\" to, with the \\"sexy green underware\\" she speaks of in her book.

Gammelgaard offers no insight into why the disaster happened and virtualy ignores the other climbers who were on Everest that day. The book has none of the gripping suspense of Into Thin Air and none of the factual reporting of The Climb. I'm happy Gammelgaard survived but she should turn her attentions to things other than writing. One of the worst books I've yet to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-absorbed garbage","review":"Of all that has been written about the 1996 Everest tragedy of errors, this is the weakest piece.

Imagine how disappointed I was to find that Ms. Gammelgaard could not write about anything outside of herself. Yes, I know it is a personal account of climbing Everest, but her trip was not a solo ascent. From her account though, you would think no one else was around. Okay, perhaps that is a slight exaggeration, but I was pretty tired of Ms. Gammelgaard far before the end of this book. Additionally, her writing style is quite disjointed and distracting. I find it difficult to believe the claim that she has \\"been a journalist,\\" unless you understand that to include anyone who has, perhaps, simply kept a journal.If you want to get a feel for being a woman and climbing, better to try Stacy Allison or Ruth Anne Kocour. You will get much more rich detail from either of those, along with more of a sense of the community of climbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most powerful account of Everest I have ever read.","review":"It's about time the world heard a woman's account of the 1996 Everest tragedy.

A MUST read for anyone who's read Into Thin Air, The Climb, or The Other Side of Everest. I'd recommend catching one of her bookstore appearances as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey Lene, did you ever pay Mountain Madness?","review":"I haven't read this book but I've read Krakauer & Boukreev at least 7 times each. It is public knowledge that Lene G. did not pay Mountain Madness the full fee to be guided up the mountain. Ask Karen Dickenson. Maybe that's why Fischer's expedition had few (and inferior) radios. Hopefully LG paid Mountain Madness (after the fact) with the profits from her book. Otherwise she's just a user who used Fischer's good nature to sleaze her way into his expedition. Even if she paid, it's too late. I have zero respect for her. I would like to read her book but I won't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self aggrandizing psycho-babble,","review":"The book is poorly written with a lot of name dropping and gossipy insinuations. Into Thin Air, Climb, High Exposure are all better written and far more interesting. I think she figures if she refers to the \\"mother goddess\\" enough times she can pass the book off as feminist treatise. Lucky for Gammelgaard, she's a better climber than writer, or she'd be just be another fossil on the mountain. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A badly written book!","review":"The author came across as a rather selfish and arrogant person, totally self involved. There were enough problems up there on Mt. Everest without Gammelgaard throwing temper tantrums because Scott Fischer wanted her to summit with oxygen. She frequently drew conclusions about other's thoughts and motivations without any basis for these judgements. The writing was boring, choppy, and unedited for grammar. Hopefully, Gammelgaard did get around to paying Mountain Madness the balance of what she owed them. She tried to convince us that she did in fact pay in full. Not true. Frankly, the woman has difficulty in relating the facts with truthfulness. I could never recommend a book this poorly written. She didn't really write about mountain climbing. She wrote more about love of self. Her own self, that is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Krakauer!","review":"What should have been insightful, educated insight into one the higher accomplishments of a human, turned into a self absorbed effort at self affirmation and ego stroking.

I have turned into an \\"Armchair Everest Junkie\\". Lene's perspective on her survival was of particular interest to me because I am such a chicken when it comes to taking risks. This book was more about who Lene liked and who she thought little of. There was very little credible information that shed light on what she went through. I found it distasteful that she took shots at those whom she accompanied and collectively staked their lives on the bid for the Everest summit. True, Anatoli was a fine mountaineer and human being but he was the only other person she respected. That pretty much sums up the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major disappointment","review":"Like several others who have reviewed this book, I found it a total waste of time. I was able to read the entire book in one day and I kept thinking, \\"it's got to get better,\\" but it never did. There is no sense of what drives this woman, no personal history in which to \\"get to know her\\" and certainly nothing is added to the Everest story, either historically or in the context of the '96 tragedy. I found it shallow and filled with exclamation points that made no point. While I certainly understand and accept the intuitive mind and its differences from a more analytical perspective, this book did little in the way of informing me about the mountain or the author. Instead it seems trite and superficial and filled with pithy statements and insinuations which discredit her perspective. I am, however, thrilled that she made the summit and returned safely and that it fulfilled a personal quest she had. I only wish she hadn't written so poorly about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and shallow!","review":"There's not much to this shallow account of the '96 Everest tragedy. The book features double spacing between paragraphs -- apparently to make it long enough to be considered a book. If you like reprints of the 3-page itinerary that Scott Fisher sent to the author, this book is for you! If you want great writing on these events, read Into Thin Air, which is far superior. The author does very little to add new insight into the tragedy, and in fact the moments that should have been gripping -- when her group was lost on the mountain -- amount to little more than \\"we yelled at each other for hours to stay awake so we could live through the storm.\\" This would have made a decent magazine article, but it doesn't amount to a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-indulgent drivel","review":"I purchased this book looking for a new perspective on the tragic Everest climb of May 1996. I was sorely disappointed. Perhaps in Denmark people were interested in how she, a female Dane, attempted and summitted Mt. Everest. However, the novelty, for any climber and for most everyone else, of a woman climbing Everest on a guided expedition is nonexistent. After hundreds of ascents of Everest, it approaches absurdity to have the author repeatedly mention that she will be the first Danish woman to summit.Those who like to read self-help books may enjoy her spin on the \\"inner game\\" of preparing for Everest, but I didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cosmological Eye","review":"I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in getting into Miller.

Well, what it did was show Elmo scared half to death about a fire in which he was a part. They actually show him shaking and in a lot of fear, something that should not be shown to young toddlers. They don't understand why Elmo, their hero, is so afraid and it really upsets them. Why they had to take such a great idea and ruin it is beyond me. There are ways to teach safety without scaring someone to the point where they cannot hear what you are saying out of fear, which is what happens to Elmo in this video.

It has simple left-right steering controls, accelerate, brake, etc. It is shameless Harley Davidson promotion with H-D road signs showing up every mile or so, and cheesy 80's rock (Poison, I think), but is a LOT OF FUN.You can ride up to your opponents, kick them off their bikes, hit turbo boost to go really fast, and you gain points to buy better bikes and equipment.After playing so many \\"simulators\\" out there which just succeed in making me more tired after a long work day, this is simple, relaxing fun. Rock on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Master Teacher!","review":"Avery Dulles takes the untrained reader on a journey through the complex thought processes of a religious scholar, in an easy-to-follow, step-by-step manner.He sets up criteria and begins building five philosophies or models of revelation theology that are most commonly embraced by Christians today. These models serve as a great eye-opening tool in the final compare-and-contrast stage of his analysis.Perhaps more fascinating, Dulles expands his search to include specific historical periods, so that the reader gets a better understanding of how theological thought evolves and changes, as one generation of Christian believers builds on the knowledge or misconceptions of the past, and how meaningful dialogue with historians, scientists and other religious groups have enhanced our traditions and affirmed our convictions.This book represents a rare opportunity for one of the laity to peer into the mind of a great theologian. One can not help but be impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"Probably ostaras best release to date.

And how the human mindis so animalistic. This season only had one returning character, but made itworth while to get more insight of the character of Gil Crissom.

Episodes like 'The Accused is Entitled' show the strength of this show, but the middle of the season is weak compared to previous seasons.

In this season, apart from the usual puzzling crime scenes, the stars of the show find themselves in varying crises: Grissom's hearing loss gets worse and a decision must be made; Katherine's personal life undergoes a tragic change; Warrick finds himself involved in an internal affairs investigation; Sarah loses one love and contemplates a surprising replacement; Nick takes up a dangerous new hobby; and Brass continues to be his wonderfully sardonic self.

Yeah, but it's realism, they say.Another 'but' and a big one: just about all the viewers l know - friends, neighbors, co-workers - complain about the same thing: in the show, why is Marg Helgenberger all too often referred to as 'beautiful' or 'gorgeous' or 'lovely' when she is simply an ordinary-looking, run-of-the-mill actress with tight, low-cut clothing?

The game is filled with secreat passways and catchers who will try to catch Taz. The only bad thing about this game is that the colors are so bright that they could give you a headache and taz MOVES SO MUCH that you could get dizzy. Also at first, the posters will not be so eassy to find and destroy, but you must keep trying.(...)P>Good Luck!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot","review":"I confess I didn't play past the first level, but here's why. The colors are so bright in this cartoon-graphics game, it can give you a headache. Then on the first level, a dinosaur kept coming out of nowhere and jumping on my Taz, delaying the game as Taz recovered. There's no warning this is going to happen, and no way you can defend yourself. Maybe I didn't give it a chance, but if I have problems on the very first level, it just isn't right.

Be aware, however, Turchin's analysis is more appropriate to displacement and redistribution questions and less suited for those interested in inferring motivation from movement trajectories.This is an intensely mathematical treatment, so be prepared.

Crispin Glover is great as Simon and this movie delivers on all levels. Fans of the original Mother's Day, Texas Chainsaw 2 and others of this ilk will enjoy this.

Why?","review":"This was one of the worst movies I've seen in recent memory. I'll start off by saying that all the sped up and slo-mo effects were unnecessary and honestly annoying. The kill scenes were cheaply done CGI which looked terrible for the most part. It's a spoiler, but in the last attack scene of the movie the 'dream girl' literally bursts through a tree and a burned body to attack Simon/Stanley. My biggest problem with this movie is that I know Cripin Glover can do so much better. I'm sure he did the best with the script he was given, which wasn't much, but I'd have passed on this role. After seeing him in Rivers Edge and Willard it was almost painful to watch him play this character.

Also, all the flying axes get a little old after the first few times. What I wanted to know was how he could set them all up so quickly...?? The final showdown was odd and cheesey.

But, seriously the movie is nowhere near good. Crispin Glover does what he does best, I can recognize his psychotic face from a mile away and still run like hell. But, the story line and the graphics quality was disappointing. The first few minutes watching the movie I thought \\"This is not going to go well\\" but then I realize the name Blake Lively on the cover and was relieved. \\"Thank goodness\\" I said, but then I sat through the whole movie only to see Blake enter 5 minutes in the end saying a few lines, looking hot as usual, and capiche.

If you want to know more about Byron than you can find out from an anthology introduction, but don't want to plough through (or have your students plough through) one of the long biographies, this is the book for you.

It wasn't the only resource I used though.The publishers of the book even claim that using only this book will not help you pass the exam. It is an OVERVIEW text. It is a primer to help you delve into the material. This book will not substitute the large amount of qualitative reading and equation memorization that you'll need to do in order to pass.I give it a 4 mainly because the book does what it claims and because some of the more negative reviews are too far-fetched.

It is the worst possible written book that I have ever seen. Even the topics that I have a very good knowledge of (e.g. Duration, Convexity etc.) are written in such a disjointed fashion that I could not recognise them. The author uses symbols without describing them, the passages have no relevance to the examples which in turn cannot be connected to the solutions. It was a great disappointment.

For the errors, this book is not a good value for your moneyI agree with other readers. Book is full of errors and irony is most of these errors are not corrected in the downloadable supplement - available on GARP web-site. Agreed the book covers everything within the Body of Knowledge for FRM exam, but many important issues / theories are mentioned / covered in the Handbook because they are part of syllabus but sufficient justice is not done to them. One definately gets this strong feeling that continuity is missing in certain parts of the book and they seem to be just product of simple copy / paste action.I strongly recommend GARP, Wiley Finance to correct the errors and replace current book with an error free version. Why should the readers pay for the errors? And please let the readers know what actions you are taking and when?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you rely on it for FRM exam preparation?","review":"As comparing with some other exam-oriented books for CFA and AICPA exam., it would be the most poor book I have read up to now. The book is poorly prepared and organized. While it is organized in according with the exam. structure, it is still difficult for the reader to follow. Most concepts have insufficient explanation. While some notations have not been clearly explained, some topics are explained (or jumped) very fast without proper elaboration. Some examples are even not supported by adequate reading before the examples and the explanation can only be found in the answers. Thus, it has made a chapter in pieces and then becomes difficult for the reader to memorize. I doubt why GARP recommend it to the candidates since 2000 and whether it is suitable and sufficient for exam. preparation purposes. I suggest some serious candidates may be required to refer to other textbooks and even myself has such planning."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wish I Hadn't","review":"This book cost me the FRM last year. I made it the center of my study program. The book's writing is atrocious; there are gaps in what is covered; and there are many errors and misstatements.

They incorporate more muffled strumming bass/guitar impacts in the style of mainstream bands like Pantera, but these musicians are serious about reforming after loss of a member and making competitive, current music.

This album is kinda like a re-hash on 'War and Pain' with all the \\"death metal-esque\\" vocals and has very poor mix. The mix sounded like all the guitars, bass and drums are overlapping Eric Forrest's vocals. You can bearly hear him singing. This album is pretty sloppy to my liking.

Well I sure was wrong! this camera gets fuzzy and you can hardly tell whats going on when it is 10ft away behind my helicopter box. I am very disappointed and hope to warn potential buyers that the range is terrible and can barely broadcast through a window let alone in the room right beside it. Unless you have one big room where the camera and receiver will both be placed, its not worth it. I just am saying It does not have a range near 200 ft like some are saying.. maybe you could tell whats going on at 50 ft no obstructions sitting still, but otherwis I do not recommend this to anyone and I am planning on returning the camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"research before buying","review":"i have bought several of these types of camera's form other sellers that work way better. spend the extra couple buck for something reliable. now saying that, with the cost you can't be picky if you are willing to gamble.SECURITY - DON'T BOTHER ( the tuning is way to sensitive, whereas it it really hard to get a constant clear picture.I would not use it for home security of any type as i live in a townhouse, and when set up it literaly make a cracking sound on the monitor when the unit transmits through one wall. )the range is not 200 feet..... maybe 10 feet line of sight. the advertising is false and i think this is why it was a dissapointing buy. i spent $50 bucks on the same type of unit several years ago and it works through the entire house and outside with no problems. this one has trouble transmitting clearly in the same room if large.Sorry to the seller for the bad review, but people need to know the truth about the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible video","review":"I purchased this wireless camera for use in a medium size model helicopter.

I takes too much adjusting every little move the camera makes so it is impossible to view off of a moving toy like a helicopter or RC vehicle as the product states plus RC products emit own signals than can cause video interruption.

I've seen them many times live, and have purchased most of their music.

Rick's surf'n swamp guitar work just gets better along with the rest of the band.Thats why I dig this new album so much. I seems like the band really put some time and effort into this disc. Hearing them play The Kinks 'Muswell Hillbilly' and making it their own is a beautiful thing. Rick Miller tearing into 'Tombstone Shadow', awesome. Makes me wish they would do a whole album of Creedence covers! The whole band is really on the same wave-length playing each one of these diverse tunes.

Well its not, all thats changed are the graphics, besides the general opening there is almost no development storywise, and tecnically speaking all that revolutionary platform actoin can be had in games the like of the Rayman titles, or Ratchet and Clank.

The gameplay is uneccesarily difficult at times and ceases to be 'fun' after about 4 levels in. The camera is terrible. Some have said here dismiss it as 'oh well, all platform games have camera problems'. However, this game definately has the lamest camera of them all.Another dissapointment is the fact that there are no milestones. If you [expire], you get to start over. Period. No matter how many lives you have left, how many items you have collected no matter how far into the level you have gotten, they all get erased to zero and you get the distinct pleasure of having wasted your time. Isn't that Fun?Acclaim has definately failed in their foray into platform gaming. Get Ratchet and Clank or Rayman, you will actually enjoy those games. This one looked like it had potential but is just too frustrating. Don't waste your money on this game. It just ain't worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"VEXX","review":"This is a very cool, very fun game - much in the vein of Ratchet & Clank and Jak and Daxter. The only problems were the maddening camera angles (tough to control) and the feshman swimming controls. And don't bother with the Prima Strategy Guide.

It seems as if it was just slapped together to meet a deadline."},{"rating":"2","title":"HE LOVED BIG BROTHER","review":"Those last four words will make you CRINGE! Of course, they mean NOTHING to you if you haven't read the book. This is by far the most depressing book I've read. Stephen King's Stand can eat its heart out. A very frightening portrayal of life without privacy. Microphones in parks, surveillance mechanisms in all restaurants. Betrayal, love, hate, etc. I've read this book once, but I don't think I need to read it again, its effect was that powerful. A friend of mine also found this book depressing. Orwell does an outstanding narrative towards the end which contributes to the cringing part at the very end. I've read this book quite a while ago but its fascinating how much I remember it. This book shouldn't be ignored. Read it once, at once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality on Kindle","review":"I purchased the e-version of this book to be read on my Kindle. There were numerous spelling errors where two words had been combined into one. The further intothe book theworse it got. Two to three errorsper page. I believe a spell checkwould have pickedthese allup."},{"rating":"2","title":"1984 is Still A Possibility","review":"I read this book in high school and thought it was okay. I decided to read it again as an adult and see what I thought of it (something about going back and reading the classics). Turns out that I liked it more as an adult but found the story to fall short. At the end you can't tell if the main character was tortured, turned or just dreaming. I felt like the first half was really slow, the middle was FANTASTIC and the last bit was just over before I could get my mind around what had happened. I really wish that it could have ended differently. Still worth reading through.The story is about the year 1984 and the hell in which people live in. Countries are always at war, but whom they are fighting keeps changing. Things that Big Brother doesn't like are just erased. Whole histories, whole stories, are whipped as if they never were. People live in hunger and fear of Big Brother."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"This is one of the few books I think everyone should read at one point or another of their life. I read this book about 7 years back and I think it does an amazing job of narrating the harrowing experience of people under an oppressive regime."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Frighteningly Real Masterpiece","review":"This book was excellant and scary as hell when your reading it and realize that a lot of things that are in it are happening in our country today. Most people, myself included, who hear about this classic don't realize that there's a tragic love story wrapped inside of the haunting world of Orwell's 1984 that helps drive home the authors anti-utopian message. Also, the realism of the book seems almost three-dimensional casting a crystal clear picture of the nightmarish world of 1984 where Big Brother is always watching you- not just what you say or do but, what your thinking. Scarier than anything Stephen King ever wrote- and more realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book","review":"I thought it was going to be a cheesy nostradomus-type thing, but it turned out to be a book about the rebellious nature of the human mind, as well as a testament to the number of those who do not understand those things going on around them (the proles). I've read it four times, and it never loses its impact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Brother is watching you...","review":"Orwell's 1984 seems to grow increasingly relevant with every passing year.1984 tells the story of Winston Smith, who's job is \\"correcting\\" historical documents and removing words from the dictionary. He is a drone in the machine that is the Party, the ruling power of Oceania. Every thought, movement, and gesture is watched through telescreens by a policing force called the Thought Police. Big Brother, the figurehead of the Party, is revered and loved, and any thought otherwise is punishable by death.Whatever trace of humanity that lies in Winston causes him to seek answers, question his reality, and pursue a forbidden realtionship with a woman named Julia, all which lead to a frightful and thought provoking end.This book should be a staple in every person's library. Orwell's satire has withstood the test of time, and has inspired a countless number of books and films. A classic in every sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Very Good Book Indeed.","review":"This is one of the best written books I have had the opportunity to read. Those of you who gave it a 1 are ignorant. And dont worry Sheri, he wont be writting anymore books seeing as how he has been dead for a while now. Before you criticize the writing of a wonderful author please learn how to spell correctly.1984 is a wonderful trip into the human mind and it shows how those of us in charge can and will do anything to remain in charge. It is a very good follow-up to Animal Farm. They both describe power hungry and greedy people can go to extreme measures to keep that power.Those who said the government would never end up like this are fooling yourself. The future could very easily end up like this. With the formation of the \\"Homeland Security\\" it is becoming even more likely that this may well be the future of the world. (Of course thank goodness 1984 wasnt really like that)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Parallels","review":"1984 is a haunting political satire about Big Brother's relentless assault on privacy, individuality and freedom.One can only hope 1984 is more brilliant story than cautionary tale because parallels seem so easily drawn with our warrantless searches, ubiquitous cameras, invasive software, workplace surveillance and legislation that erodes the rights of citizens in the name of fighting terrorism.Yet it is the relationship that develops between Winston, a cautious but hopeful thinking man, and Julia, a young seemingly committed Party member, that adds incredible humanity to otherwise empty, cheerless lives in Oceania. Theirs is a relationship that surprisingly springs amid bleakness and desolation, flowers against all odds, and ultimately wilts under betrayal.Readers will discover that Orwell's objectives are both thoroughly and terrifyingly achieved with a perfectly dystopian ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book that gets old fast","review":"1984 is a great book. It really makes you think. thee plot is a very interesting one about a dictator ruining everything, but the scary part is they have so much power you can't say anything against their party. This book is very good for those epeople who like to really think about things and take them deep. I would not recommend this title for action fiends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Harry Potter, says I","review":"While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between \\"serious\\" works of literature like this one and allegedly \\"lesser\\" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are \\"better\\" than any others, and the concept of a \\"great novel\\" is an intellectual hoax. This book isn't as good as Harry Potter in MY opinion, and no one can refute me. Tastes are relative!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"1984 by George Orwell, is the most BORING book I ever read for school. To me the plot was not interesting, the characters were useless and the time period ....

The only part of the book I did not like was the ending. Winston sells out. Through the whole book he has you believe he secretly wants to disobey and rebell against this opressive leadership, but then at the end instead of taking the cruel death with pain and honor he sells out. He takes the easy road. It almost makes it seam like the whole book was for nothing. He ended right where he started off.

Not mad at Orwell, or Winston (the main charterer), more mad at the way it went. Don't worry no spoilers here but as a first time read for this nearly 35 year old guy I can say that I'm glad I waited to read it as I think having done so at a lesser age wouldn't have proved as beneficial an understanding as it did just now.This is a 4+ star book (we'll just round it down to 4 for measures sake) in my opinion simply for the fact that it was able to move me and keep my attention even while not reading it.

It's absolutely graphically realistic in it's descriptions, and the story - I'm gonna give it away here - does not end happily. I read this in high school and have never forgotten it; it frightened me then and it still frightens me. The word is bleak.You should still read it. You should not only read books that give you happiness, or catharsis, or what you want; those are candy for your mind and will not tell you harsh truths. You should also read books that give you gifts you don't want, gifts that make you uncomfortable or upset or frightened. Books that point out things you'd much rather you could ignore and hope they'd go away. That's why this is a classic; not because of stupendous writing or anything else (I've seen better writing).I still hate this book. And I still gave it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.

Clearly written to explore the plausibility of what would happen if the technocratic regime of the socialist state was allowed to take its course, it stretches beyond this very palpable social critique. The final part is the most disturbing and harrowing as one can almost feel Winston's physical and psychological torment in a world that forbids love and legitimates peace through fear.I am amazed that this was written so long ago since these drives in social order seem so shockingly prevalent and the spectre of war as a lever to condition responses from the masses is clearly a vehicle even in the US. It does slowdown in the middle with the very transparent political commentary wrought by Goldstein's manual. Yet the impact of what abuse and harnessing of technical, psychological, social, and political power punches hard at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important for its portrayal of the mechanisms and motivations of totalitarian power","review":"Discomfiting, penetrating, imaginative, and very grey, this book deserves its fame not for elegance of prose (it is only adequately written) nor for an interesting plot (not much happens, at least as novels usually go), but for its indelible, devastating portrait of human degradation and its far-fetched-yet-just-around-the-corner description of the hows and whys of totalitarian power.

The whole reason we live in a democracy is so that we the people don't have to worry about things like this. \\"Brave New World\\" played up the science fiction aspect of it's \\"futuristic\\" setting ,and I thought that book worked much better. Orwell's lecturing on politics was ok one time around (\\"Animal Farm\\"), but this book gets so bogged down in a million issues that just don't matter (\\"double-speak?\\" Who cares how people choose to talk-- we should be able to talk to each other however we want) and gets lost. If you want to read Orwell when he actual has something to say, try \\"The Road to Wigan Pier,\\" which acutally is enlightening, not this preachy homily of something that never happened.

He's nothing more nor less than a second-rate hack who profiteered by preying on the worst fears of modern man. Today, his book is the modern bible of the paranoid disgruntled white male and other conspiracy nutcases. Yet another fairy tale, albeit a grown-up one, warns us to LOOK OUT for that proverbial boogy man--Big Brother, in this case, being the latest in a long line of aliases he goes under. Perhaps Orwell's \\"Newspeak\\" should include these additions: \\"Propaganda is Truth\\"; \\"Truth is Absolute\\"; \\"Freedom springs from Fear\\"; \\"Extremism is Virtue.\\" This book has never made anyone stop to think, but, instead, to fear and hate one more faceless abstraction. Contemporary paranoia gets a much more powerful portrayal in the works of Thomas Pynchon, such as \\"The Crying of Lot 49.\\" At least IT has the virtue of being well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"Cannot say that I enjoyed reading this book, because I did not approve of a lot of the things the author included.

So Amazon deleted the book from the Kindles of customers who had already purchased it and credited their accounts. A small problem: what about annotations people had made on the book for their term papers? A big problem: what if I buy a book by a liberal and Amazon decides they only like books by conservatives, so they delete the book from my player?

Reading the book was like re-visiting my childhood, as well as refreshing my mother's and grandmother's stories of the soviet life in the 1950's, all the brainwashings, terrible living conditions, propaganda, people disappearing in the middle of the night, etc. Basically, Orwell took soviet reality of that era, and then took it a few notches up, and then twisted it some. Art imitates life, so to speak. I'm not sure why everyone credits Orwell's imagination, then. Either way, the book is extremely boring, the plot is almost non-existent, nothing is really going on, the [unlikely] love affair took half-the book to unfold, and it wasn't even worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very powerful!","review":"There are few books that I reference as much as this one.

'He who controls the past, controls the present' is Orwell's brilliant insight. And, as such, his thesis is applicable to an astonishlingly wide variety of modern situations.How do ... religious leaders get their followers to blindly accept everything they say? Simple application of doublethink, though policing and control of information. How do modern conglomerates get away with collecting and selling your personal information? Tell you that its all for your own protection, that's how.1984 is a brilliant, timeless book. It explores the strange quirks of human psychology that make it inevitable that we will always be controlled.

Prehaps he was getting old and lost his touch. Animal Farm was okay, but 1984 was horrible. It took him forever, it seemed like, to get into the accual book. If someone were to take out all of the useless part of 1984, it would be half as long. Why would he wirte so much about nothing? I havent ever meet someone who could wirte such a boring book about the goverment. I have meet many people who have loved this book, but i dispised it. I am not at all intrested in the goverment.

Despite the fact that it was orriginaly an inditement against Stalinism, it is still relevant in 21st century America.The nature of the \\"War on Terror\\" could have been taken dirrectly from the book, in places word for word.

I couldn't put it down. The story is frightening, especially when you think about some of our current issues such as \\"Homeland Security\\", and the new measures the government is taking to \\"protect\\" us. Given the current situation in this country I think it is essential to read 1984. This book has made me rethink somethings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and Bold","review":"1984 is written in the style of the \\"negative utopia.\\" It is a dark vision of a future society in which personal freedom has been destroyed and in which a small group have established dictatorial control over the many. It was written mainly as a warning against authoritarianism and totalitarianism.....not just the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, but also against the totalitarianism of the mind that is currently evolving in capitalist culture as well. Orwell was a socialist. This is only relevant to counter those who say that Orwell was criticizing socialism. He most certainly was not...socialists stand for personal freedom and economic democracy.This is a very well written book with a good plot. Orwell's vision was a clear one and a danger that has not entirely been eliminated today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it!","review":"Why are you sitting there? Get up and read this book.

The interesting part of the book was the interworkings of the government with Big Brother and the five minute hate that they include themselves in. Also I liked the characters of Winston and Juila. Both of their stories were amazing and there seceret life together. The bad part of the book is that it got complicated sometimes with the back story of the government. With Goldsteins book on his view of government, it gets to the point where you get bored. Also the characters of O'Brian and Big Brother get annoying. Sometimes I just wanted them to disappear. Overall the book was good but it also had moments of greatness that could hold my attention and keep me riveted. However, parts of the book lacked that spark that kept me coming back for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Love Story of Our Time.","review":"1984 is a social commentary on history and the appalling state of public policy and society generally told through a love story that resonates with a deep familiarity for all modern readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of genius that provides warning","review":"1984 is one of the best novels ever written in English. The dismal world of the \\"future\\" presented here is beyond belief but also seems within reach. Although it may seem to be a warning against communism (some of the elements are found in A Darkness at Noon - a true critique of the pogroms of Stalin), it is in fact a warning against excess that can occur in any government system.The foreward by T.

You really feel scared for Winston throughout the entire story. It made me cringe all the times where he was sneaking around. The only thing that made it unrealistic to me was how sex and love were eliminated totally from the party. It goes against human nature. Was everybody tortured like Winston in the party to make them this way? Anyway it was a great book that makes you think"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classic Everyone Should Read","review":"Orwell's classic about Big Brother that will really keep you thinking.

Go read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"History repeats itself","review":"George Orwell is right. He has always been right and will always be right. This novel, 1984, shows a scary, terror-filled world where everyone is a potential enemy. Before 9/11 this stood as an important piece of British 20th Century fiction; now it is a must read for all because it is hard to know where the fiction ends and the \\"true\\" narrative begins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a \\"Political\\" Novel","review":"As Orwell's 1984 is conventionally viewed as a \\"political\\" novel, it's value lies more in the deeper psychological meaning the book conveys, as Erich Fromm eloquently expounds in his afterword. More in this respect can the book be viewed as meaningful across both time and nation. It definitely is not just a novel for the disgruntled paranoids in our time and country as the political point of view might have it. As Fromm basically explains, the book is fundamentally an expression of the \\"deepest alienation in the minds of organizational man\\". In light of that, you might say that Dilbert lovers would appreciate the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prophetic and Frightening","review":"Orwell was a prophet. He introduced such words into our vocabulary as 'newspeak' and 'thoughtcrime' which have forever changed the way we look at government. No one who hasn't read 1984 can truly call themselves politically literate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a very good story","review":"1984 was for me the most interesting book I've read in 2000. Though the book is written in a time in which the political spectrum in the world was totally different, this book still has a high warning rate for everybody who is thinking that freedom, or better said, being free, is something that is well assured nowadays. The treath of being dominated by 'things', and not , is with the continuing rise of the technological influence in modern society still a great treath. Besides, we already have a Big Brother. The TV-program with the same name, which started in my home country, is now conquering the world. As if this program doesn't demonstrate the fact that we are about to loose our knowledge for making ethical decisions. 1984 is still a warning for everybody, and therefore highly recommendable."},{"rating":"2","title":"1984 - Frighteningly Realistic","review":"George Orwell's horrific representation of Oceania, a world power and dominating force throughout the story, is a frighteningly realistic presentation of how governments work. Orwell displays the common theme of disinformation (called \\"doublethink\\")used by government powers. Although 1984 has come and passed, the idea that governments can gain totalitarian control through complacent, uniterested citizens is not far from present conditions. 1984 is an excellent read, filled with wondrous insight for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read as Both Sci-Fi and Analysis of Society","review":"This is one of those books that you here so much about before you have a chance to read it. It makes you seem to think that you know what to expect from cover to cover. You are flat out wrong. Yes, with an overbearing government and a subversive hero this work had me riveted and unable to put it down until I had read it twice. The book can also be likened to a modern day example of Machiacelli's \\"Prince\\" and had definite anarcho/commune supporting undertones. One of the members of the Inner Party takes the time to explain in detail how a political group can stay in power. The surreptitious \\"Book\\" explains all there is to know about class struggle and how to eliminate it. Fantastic as both a political and as a literary work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant paranoia!","review":"1984 is a classic and rightfully so! It does not matter that the year has come and passed without such a world but there are subtelties that resemble such a world.

If this had any effect on my life, it made me appreciate where and how I live my life. The book itself was very well written and entertaining. The beginning of the book was depressing to the point where I didn't want to read it, but as I progressed, I started to enjoy it. It was very difficult to emphasize with Winston because I cannot imagine the world he lives in. As I reflect on the book as a whole, I realize that it was more than worth my time to read. Every person who reads this book gets something different out of it, but I can guarentee if you read with interest you will get something out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ain't the future scary?","review":"THe Party dominate all aspects of life and Big Brother is everywhere with cameras and microphones.

Orwell attempts to shock us with the extremities that exist in a totalitarian society whose ultimate purpose is to obtain power. Perhaps these issues, as mentioned in the afterthought, are relevant in areas apart from totalitarianism. Perhaps capitalism is also a class distinction where money is representative of power.These and other issues are covered, proving Orwell's brilliant writing genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Never has a book made me think so much and yet be absolutely terrified for the future.

In a way, this whole book was about heresy, 'thoughtcrime' towards the regime which ruled Airstrip One. This book will be able to teach a lot about politics in the modern day. The only place where it really strays is at Orwell's atheistic uterances. Otherwise a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"If you're politically inclined, you'll love this novel about Oceania.

The symbolism is great and should be a must-read for any high school student in a high school civics course."},{"rating":"2","title":"The dark world of the future","review":"After reading 1984 it is easy to see why it is a classic. George Orwell's predictions are a dark and terrifying world that captures the reader and forces them on. The stories told is one that may yet come to pass. The things he predicts have in some cases already been implemented in some areas of the world. I found the book to be a somewhat difficult read, so don't expect to breeze through it. All in all I rate it a 5 out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go to the real source","review":"This is a great book. Because it has been unsuccessfully re-written many times by lesser minds people suggest this as the source. However, the book \\"We\\" by Eugene Zamatin, an exiled Russian (like Nabokov, or Dostoyevsky), came first is even more powerful. I believe that it is out of print (at least the english translation), but if there is enough interest in it that could be rectified. Also, now more than ever the theme of governmental control is very relevant."},{"rating":"2","title":"1984 - Fascinating and Terrifying (Doublethink at work!)","review":"This book is a work of genius. It is so much more than science fiction. In fact, it's bleak vision of the world is scary because of its plausibility. It is so completely credible and convincing. It is brilliant philosophy, masterful thriller, and love story all at the same time.There is enough explanation about the plot of the book in other reviews, so I'll spare you. This book captured me completely. Read this book if you like thought provoking literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Orwell was a pioneer in this form of literature. His insight into a \\"possible\\" future held more accuracy than I'm sure even he imagined.The book is a struggle of man vs. ministry.

The ending had me in tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"if it was a prediction...","review":"If this book represents Orwell's circa 1948 prediction of 1984, he wasn't exactly right, but he wasn't completely wrong either. Some have argued that we now live in a pseudofascist state in the modern United States, in large part thanks to another George. I'm sure Orwell's book was profoundly influenced by the historical context of his own life, especially WWII. It's certainly a very well written book, with vivid imagery and several memorable scenes. The movie version with John Hurt is also very well orchestrated. Author ofAdjust Your Brain: A Practical Theory for Maximizing Mental Health."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic","review":"This is a timeless book that seems more true with each passing year. Despite being written by Orwell in the 40s, this classic novel is still relevant. Instead of the Ministry of Information, we have the TSA and other government authorities telling us things we know not to be true. Orwell was a prophet when it came to predicting how governments would try to keep control of information. Fortunately for us, there is no \\"memory hole\\" down which inconvenient facts can disappear - we have the Internet and the free flow of information. As Orwell wrote in his book, the story of our age is one of government against the individual. 1984 is a great cautionary tale and a prescient warning to all who love liberty, to be on guard against tyranny."},{"rating":"2","title":"NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR","review":"A very well written piece of literature for its time.

This is not one of them.","review":"Some books you read you enjoy and forget and then there are books that stick with you for the rest of your life. I can honestly say this is probably one of the most important books written in human history. One of the reasons is that it is an almost recognizably real dystopian world eerily close to the one we live in. This book is a stark warning of what we could become; what unchecked government erosion of liberty can eventually lead to.If you read this, you'll read the news in a different way.In the end, you'll love Big Brother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nineteen Ninety Nine","review":"This book is as powerful as it was when it was written. The universality of literature in this book is evident. It clearly shows the effects of totalitarianism and a loss of human spirit; this novel shows it almost as well as Anthony Burgess's \\"A Clockwork Orange\\", which holds the best novel of all time in my esteem"},{"rating":"2","title":"allthough it shows the extreme, it shows a possilbe truth","review":"This book describes an extreme situation of what totalitarianism can lead to. But I think that's just the power of the book; because the state, as talked about in the book,is an extreme example, but I think that extremes show the real danger of something; it makes you more aware of a situation (a state form, a social question etc.) than a report based on real facts does. therefore you also shouldn't take this book for real, but you should take parts of this books and compare them to reality. and by doing so you'll find a lot of things that form, as described in the book, dangers in present day society also. this book actually shows all what totalitarianism can lead to, and therefore enables you to see the danger of it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Couldn't Put It Down!!!","review":"Orwell portrays a great image of a utopian sociaty, although the part in the story where Winston is reading \\"the book\\" is rather boring and takes a while to read. Overall I would suggest reading it as soon as you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"My class could do this for an extra credit grad and I am glad about that. This book is frightening realistic. The technology in this is possibly and some of its here, the government has come and gone in a lesser degree, and the issues faced are here.

The story is very believable and is a must read for casual and serious readers alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doubleplusgood!","review":"Wow! I read this after reading \\"Animal Farm\\" and found it fascinating. It's amazing that a book written so long ago could so vividly portray an author's prediction of how the world would be in 1984. Slightly scary, when you think of how Communism did take control of an empire. George Orwell's \\"1984\\" is a classic that should always be remembered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still poignant after 64 years...Newspeak, Big Brother, and Orwell","review":"This novel can be read from the left side or the right side of the political spectrum because the overarching horror of the totalitarian state presented by Orwell here is told to us in an honest and forthright manner. Orwell's narrative retains its relevance because we still seem to go through phases where the freedoms of the enlightenment are challenged from many angles. Whether you read Big Brother as Joseph Stalin or Sam Walton and The Party as being representative of a fascist or communistic authoritarian State, the \\"truth\\" of this novel, that liberty, personal freedom, and the freedom to speak and be understood are ideals that should be treasured and protected in practice. As long as there are human beings who wish to control and eradicate the humanity of others, 1984 will remain a novel worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition is a very sloppy copy/paste","review":"The Kindle Edition of 1984 is incredibly sloppy. There are some blatant typos I'm surprised weren't noticed by editors, but the real slap in the face is when there are page numbers (from the print edition) in the middle of sentences that someone didn't bother removing when they copy/pasted the book from whatever was on file."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank our lucky stars government isn't like that...yet.","review":"Orwell creates a frightening picture of how easy it is to manipulate human minds using extreme nationalism, unification from a common enemy, misplaced love, and the love of hating things. Readers ask themselves \\"WHY? Why do these people let themselves be subjected to such mind control?\\" Really it's all the people know. Somehow to them it makes perfect sense that the past doesn't exist. Scary. One of the best books I've ever read"},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece!","review":"I found 1984 to be a fascinating and realistic portrayal of human nature. Orwell's insight into the nature of governments is amazing and enlightening. He has this detached, slightly pessimistic attitude toward human nature that I love. He is so frank about man's selfishness and greed -- not only as it relates to the governments in 1984, but also to the rebels like Winston who, in the end, care only for themselves. There are no glamorous heroes in 1984 just as there are any in real life. Orwell has stripped man of all glory and glamour and shown him in an honest, if unflattering, light.I was also very impressed with Orwell's thoroughness. He described the society, the history and, most of all, the language of the futuristic Oceania in such detail. 1984 is truly a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book you should read, but don't in High School","review":"Across the country there is a travesty going on. High School teachers are requiring students to read Animal Farm by George Orwell. By the same author there is a much finer example of satire and the multiple levels Orwell attached to each of his books. Nineteen Eighty-Four is simply one of the best books written this century. It approaches a subject matter, Communism, attacks it and then inadvertantly exposes a greater meaning and truth, the essence of freedom. Orwell meant 1984 to be an attack on Russia and what would happen if Stalin and Lenin won. It trascended that and became a handbook for freedom. If anyone doesn't come out a Libertarian after reading this book, they didn't read it close enough. One of the many books that will be on classic reading lists for centuries to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is great, but terrifying.","review":"After I read this book, I was so disturbed that I couldn't concentrate on my homework. Since I could do nothing else, I thought about the book. I realized how lucky we are that we live in a society with privacy, fairness, and freedom. I though it was inhuman when the man in jail (I'm not saying who) was proud of his daughter for turning him in after hearing him mutter in his sleep against the Party. This is the least of the inhuman things that happen. I really am able to apreciate our living in a free society. I hope others can too."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Ordaniary man and his response during a Revolution","review":"This was a wonderful book where the main character, Winston Smith is compelled to speak out aganist Big Brother and the end result is exactly what any one of us would have done.

It is more than the socio-political commentary, on which many other reviewers have focused on solely, but has an enchanting love story weaved seemlessly in to it. I apologise for my 'flowery' style, but I can not speak highly enough of this novel. It is also written to think about, not just to read. I read a review which stated that the novel had a sad ending. Once you have read the book, ask yourself 'When is Winston at his most happy?'. That is the books contradiction, and its achievement."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this book.","review":"This was a good book.

Not only is it unrealistic, but also a boring book. Orwell has an imaginative mind, I must say, but thuis book talks about 1949, when he published it when there were such things as totalitarism. How could he know it would still be the exact same thing in 1984? This book also has strange events. The author skipped around too many times. At one sentence, he would be in the appartment in Winston's home, and without telling a reason for it, he would be some where else. The book is also boring. There is not enough action and suspense to make the reader willing to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Boring Book I Ever Read","review":"I think 1984 is not very interesting.

There are so many things I have not forgotten about this book, and given that it's been that long ago, it's amazing.I think that we all know how the story goes. Government censorship, Big Brother is douple plus un good. No books or writing. So on and so forth. Authoritarian, totalitarian, dictatorship. Not sure what exactly the government would fall under; not a big government/history buff.This is one of those books I am truly happy to have read.

I enjoyed reading this book, it was very creative and well written. It makes me appreciate what I have in life. I also woundn't like the situation that Wiston is put by being watch all the time.

At least the grass will become something you enjoy. The title and plotline of the story intrigued me to read it. Don't get me wrong, if well-written, this storyline could be very interesting. But even after just ten pages, the only thought going through my mind was \\"When will this guy shut up and tell the story???\\" The plot comes in a distant second to the narrator's monotone, seemingly unending monologue.

The main character in the book, Winston, is an ordinary worker at a regular office in England. The catch is he can remember the past some what. In England's future it is ruled by an all knowing man named Big Brother of BB in new speak (the language of oceania earlier called England).Once Winston realizes this chick named Julia likes him he and she start secretively dating which is against the rules of the party. Winston finally realizes what is going on with society and BB. Winston and his girlfriend finally get the nerve and take a chance and join the resistance against the party.

Whilst the totalitarian governments of \`Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia' depicted by Orwell may seem to have passed (in the majority), his general sense of helplessness, as expressed through both the protagonist Winston, and the oppressive atmosphere, is as relevant today as during the years of the Cold War. A timeless and enduring tale that will remain relevant and controversial well into the future, despite being set in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"1984","review":"This is yet another book that is difficult to put down.

I too cried '1984' when the government tried to collect even more info on us.Shortly after Princess Diana's death, though, I read this book for a second time. I then realized that we have been looking for 'Big Brother' in all the wrong places. Big Brother isn't the collector of information, he is the controller of information.

Christ, you make it sound like 1984 is the work of a nihilist. 1984 is a dark satire of totalitarian governments. No, the Soviet Union was not as bad as Oceania, but a satire is supposed to exaggerate.The novel has a perfectly legitimate political purpose, and has nothing to do with Orwell being mad at the rest of the world. You clearly didn't understand much about the book at all.As for why I liked it, most of it has been said already. It offers great insight into human nature and politics. Plus it's very well written. It is also probably the most immediately interesting and intriguing books I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling tale of anti-utopian England","review":"I won't say that Orwell was ahead of his time, because 1984 came and went without any domineering governments popping up, but this is still a brilliant book. It follows the life of Winston Smith, who edits history to serve \\"the Party\\" and its needs. THe Party controls every aspect in peoples' lives, watching and listening as much as possible. Nonetheless, Winston begins a love affair with a co-worker, knowing only too well the ramifications of doing so. 1984 also provides some interesting insights about how weak memory when compared to facts, or what everybosy says are facts.

Your daily life monitored continuously, no rights to show individuality or freedom of speech, and constant fear of being whiped clean off the world if you did anything not in accordance with the Party, also known as Big Brother.I sure hope something like this doesn't happen to us any time soon, not until I build my rocket ship to go to Mars and live in a cave.I would certainly recommend this book to you, for only 300 pages it is some good reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just cheap propaganda!","review":"I've read the book and found not only fun in it, but also deepness and complex political explanations.

It was a fascinating read on the complexities of strict government control. But the story is really more than about government, and it's strict control over the populace. It's about the psychology of humans and living in a society with limited personal freedoms.What I struggled with was the persistent inner-monologue. This book is written like most 20th century literature and is loaded with the protagonist basically thinking/talking to himself for long periods of time, which, to me, can be quite boring and hard to read.Maybe it's because my generation and I'm not used to such writing styles.

It's not that I think Orwell isn't relevant, it's just that I think high school English teachers could do a little research, find books that are well-written, expand horizons, but that lift people up, not depress them. Maybe books that would help kids, at their vulnerable age, to laugh, become wiser, and look at others with more compassion. \\"Cold Sassy Tree\\" comes to mind.

Set in 1984, it depicts a horrible society where Big Brother (the government) is always watching and you can be punished for \\"thought crimes.\\" There is no freedom at all, and it is just a really punishing and strict society. Winston Smith tries to rebel against the government, and meets two people, Julia, a young woman who hands him a note reading, \\"I love you\\" and O'Brien, a mysterious man at his workplace. One of these people betrays him, and, against his own instincts, he betrays the other.This is a pretty engaging and suspenseful book, though like I said, it was quite grim, and I think I preferred Animal Farm, as it was more effective in terms of the point Orwell was trying to make and was not quite so grim. However, still a good book.*You can read all of my reviews at my blog, novareviews.blogspot.com*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Right in the feels","review":"George Orwell's oft referenced 1984 is a strikingly visual and visceral portrayal of life under a completely effective totalitarian regime. Orwell's use of adjectives to create a dank, despairing mood is beyond astonishing; I don't think I've ever read anything which approaches its power. He seems to criticize a government which resembles Nazi Germany in many ways, though I don't know exactly what he was aiming his literary ire at. Overall, an emotionally stabbing book which refuses to allow the reader any positive feelings toward powerful governments."},{"rating":"2","title":"The classic privacy horror story","review":"Nineteen Eighty-Four remains the popular watchword for invasion of privacy fifty years after its publication. The novel can be read as a warning against the malign personalization that could be possible with a systematic technological attack on privacy. \`The worst thing in the world,' says the hero's torturer, \`varies from individual to individual.' The evil state in 1984 sought to control mindspace and to dictate identity to its subjects. \`\`The command of the old despotisms was \`\`thou shalt not''.

You'll be most successful if you consider what we have today compared to what we had when Orwell wrote the book in 1949. Think of how much the world has changed, and how far there is left to go.Read this book, and every chapter think of the relationship to everyday life. This isn't a book that should be skimmed.

At times brilliantly lurid and erotic and at other times completely bleek and depressing. At all times it is however engaging to the point of being one of those cant-put-down type books.Secondly this book is just as important as Hayek's Road to Serfdom. Although Hayek's treatise rightly or wrongly (and I would tend towards the latter) skewed economic thinking towards the economic rationalist line so favoured by the Friedmanites, it was 1984 that put the fear of god into people who care little for economics. It has helped shape the world that we live in today.As a side note, the final part of Simon Schama's History of Britain is a look at The Two Winstons.

I would finish the book in only a few days, but I absolutely loved it. I just started over and kept reading it and re-reading it. This is one of those books where the plot got better every time and even knowing the ending did not dampen the suspense. I thought this book is one of the greatest of its class ever. Orwell is a true master."},{"rating":"2","title":"1984 is based on \\"We\\" by Jevgenij Samjatin","review":"1984 On september the 6.th someone said that Orwell never read, and therefore was not inspired by \\"We\\". That is not true. I have got a rewiew of \\"we\\" that Orwell wrote in 1947. Besides, I have read a danish translation of Samjatins novel, and there are loads of parralels. But still I regard 1984 as one of the greatest, and most visionary, novels of modern times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frighting............","review":"A frighting look at how the future could turn out. A world where Independent thought is a crime, because it is not sactioned by the goverment. A world where Big Brother is always right, because there is no way to prove it is wrong. A world where your kids may turn you in for being an Enemy of the State, simply because you said the words \\"Down with Big Brother\\". A protrait of a world that could very easily become our own unless we do everything in our power to fight it. Those who believe that Big Brother could never happen, will most likely be the first ones into Room 101. Thomas Jefferson and Ben Franklin both once said \\"Those who give up Freedom for Security, will not have, niether do they deserve, either.\\" 1984 is a perfect description of a society that gave up their freedom hoping for safety. Instead, they lost both, trading in the criminal in the streets, for criminals in the Halls of Government, and in essence, the innocent have become the criminals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagine the image of a boot stamping a human face, forever..","review":"Nineteen Eighty Four offers a harrowing glimpse into the totalitarian state. Previous posters are correct that Orwell NEVER intended his novel to be an indictment against Communism. After all, Orwell himself fought against the Franco Regime during the Spanish Civil War - on the side of the Republicans AND Socialists. I would like to respond to a certain (British) poster thus: The individual reads and relates his interpretation of a novel/philosophy to the modern situation in which he/she finds him/herself. This would inevitably lead some to relate Nineteen Eight Four to a modern totalitarian society based upon the personality cult, e.g., North Korea (Kim jong Il, Our Dear Leader)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book of prophecy about America","review":"Someone gave me a used copy of this book when I was very young, and it sat on my bookshelf for many years before I read it. Although I found its \\"science fiction\\" setting to be engaging, it wasn't until my later years as an adult in the U.S. that I began to appreciate Orwell's foresight into the political future of our country.I am sure it would be controversial to conclude that we are now living under the watchful eye of Big Brother, but having read this book, I consistently do a \\"double-take\\" when I observe the evolving cultural and legal climate in our country. Our mainstream media may not admit that the \\"thought police\\" exist, but thanks to Orwell, I find myself always looking over my shoulder!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic","review":"i have read this book over and over. it never bores meno matter what stage of life i am at the book reflects the times we live inpoliticians never change and always practice the art of deception.people seem to become more and more like sheep blindly following authority.if you have the above sentiments you will enjoy this book immensely"},{"rating":"2","title":"Literally Genius, Politically Mind-Provoking","review":"The way Orwell suck you into the book is one of the most effective ways I've experienced. His metaphysical imagination of the last decade is frightening and mind-blowing at the same time. It makes us think of the world in the book, and inevitably compare it with ours. 1984 stands as one of my all-time favourite. And to the 15-year-old reader from USA who said that it's mundane, I have a word of advice for you. If you can't imbibe the message in the book, then you're just immature. Mind you, I'm 16."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Symbolic and Incredibly Smart Book","review":"Stephen Bradley: I first read this book and now Im 15 and I still haven't read another book. Every time I read it again I find another piece of clever symbolism. I would recommend this book to anyone! I am incredibly awed by the clever uses of English and symbolic meanings. For example I have been told that Gin was thought to be the downfall of the British Working Class. It would be a shallow understanding of the book to claim it as an anti-socalist book as Orwell (Eric Blair) obviously cared about the working class and was only against pretentous totalatarian states. I invite any like minded people to discuss the book with me. I apolagise for carless grammar and spelling (Im only 15 :) )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story, poor Kindle rendition","review":"Nothing needs to be said about 1984 as a story - it's an excellent read.However, the publisher should be ashamed of the \\"Kindle edition\\" of this great novel. Page numbers (which mean nothing on a Kindle) frequently show up in the middle of sentences. It seems that the publisher scanned the paper text, ran it through some OCR software, and published the work without a human reviewing it for quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth is scary, isn't it?","review":"I feel as though I should be shouting all the cheesy cliches: \\"What a page-turner!\\", \\"I couldn't put it down!\\"; but I would hate to parallel such mindlessness with Orwell's pure genius. 1984 is an excellent story with familliar characters (the rebel, the romantic, etc.), but also much more. Orwell's accuracy surrouding both the government and the media is undeniably disturbing. This book and \\"Brave New World\\" have turned me on to a whole new genre of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"a shattering ending to a rather slow book","review":"Though I consider this book a masterpiece I personally like \\"Animal Farm\\" better. The ending of 1984 is fantastic..shocking and all around genius...but before reaching that climax, one is exposed to a long and dreary relationship that is based more on hate of their surrounding then actual love. I wish Orwill had paid just a little more attention to the characters. They could have made the book go by a little faster. then again he was a conceptual writer and never really paid much attention to his charactes. Its the message that counts not the content...and the message is a warning about big government presented by BB himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book, makes you believe in how good a story can be","review":"\\"Under the spreading chestnut tree I sold you and you sold me: There lie they, and here lie we Under the spreading chestnut tree.\\" 1984 is a powerful book about communism and one mans defiance against it. Imagine the world split up into three huge superstates which all are communist. The government controls your way of life, where you work, what you think, how to love, what your provisions will be, and everythiing in between. It is a stunning tale of passion and rebellion that ends with a BANG. A must read for anyone who loves a good story. BEWARE OF ROOM 101."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good if you stick with it","review":"At the mention of 1984, critics will prostrate worshipping Orwell's mastery of metaphors, readers will rejoice at his clarity, and soothsayer's will marvel at his prescience. 1984 has even spawned new english words like \\"doublethink\\" and \\"newspeak\\". And along with capri pants, it seems in fashion to like 1984. This praise is not meritless and Orwell did indite a great book; however, it didn't grab me the way other books have. For me a good beginning makes me stick with a book, and this is something 1984 lacks. The beginning is ponderous and confusing, and I debated giving up on the book numerous times, but I remembered all the adulatory reviews and decided to stick with it. I am glad I did because the story picks up and still maintains its themes. The beginning did tarnish my view of 1984 a little though and I was still cynical of the praise it receive; after my cynicism disperesed I realized the book did deserve the praise--if the reader can bear the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"on my shortest list of favorites","review":"Just to add my voice to the rest here.

This book is scary and too real."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you read it years ago, try listening this time...","review":"This review is for the unabridged audio book version read by Frank Muller. Just the fact that Muller is reading this book makes it worth listening to. But I encourage you to listen even if you read the book before. I read 1984 when I was in high school 30 years ago. I thought it was funny to read about the future predictions as we approached the end of the 1970's. I just finished listening to the audio version, and I now have a better appreciation for the true intent of the work. Orwell was not trying to predict the future. He was trying to show us the pitfalls of certain ways of thinking, of the dangers of taking the human drive for power to its logical conclusion. This is more a picture into the human soul than a prediction. In addition, listening to this work opened my eyes to the influence Orwell has had on more contemporary works, such as the movie The Matrix. Read it. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ideas are more important than the literature","review":"This by now legendary work gave us the concepts doublespeak, thoughtcrime and Big Brother. It is the most important fictional work envisioning a totalitarian future, and warning against it. At the same time it is not a very convincing or moving fiction. Orwell had a one- dimensional quality in his creation of character, and it is very difficult to identify closely with or feel deeply about his characters in this work.Yet now that '1984' has come and gone without the disaster Orwell predicted it still holds our attention as one possible nightmare human future. As importantly it makes its own forceful statement against the kind of controlled, closed- minded world the Soviets, the Nazis, and now the Islamic Radical Fundamentalists would have us be imprisoned in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly relevant","review":"This was an important book when it was written, and amazingly it is still very relevant today. When it was written, the world was facing the threat of global communism. Wells does an excellent job of attacking the flaws of communism while also focusing on the ways it would be expanded in the future. When you look at the technology we have now, you realize that this book was somewhat prophetic.This book was certainly not a call to action against communism however. It was more the product of frustration and hopelessness, and a warning to the reader. As such, the book is pretty depressing. The characters are trapped in their world and completely unable to change anything about it. Even when it looks like there may be hope, it is soon crushed by Big Brother. I don't want to ruin the book for anyone who is thinking of buying it, so I'll say no more. This is a great read for anyone who needs a reminder of how important and delicate our freedoms are."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding","review":"I first read this book 30 years ago and I was certain that it explained much in American politics at that time. As I read it today, I see that it still explains much of American politics, but, it also explains much of politics of nations throughout the world and is fully consistent with much of the more cynical writings of political philosophy over the years, such as Machievelli. This is a fantastic story that is VERY easy to read, get involved in, relate to the main character, and find oneself caught in the truth of versus the appearance of reality. Excellent!!!

And although the boook made me dislike Big Brother and The Party--the fact that the proles and even the disagreeing members of the Party didn't care enough to attempt an uprising meant that I really didn't care about any of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"doubleplusungood crimethinkers untruthful reviews","review":"this morning at 235am dudes in ninja suits came into my house and stole my copy of this book.

When flipping through, it's difficult to turn just one page at a time. Also, the print is a little hard to read; the font is Times style, and the thin parts of the font are much thinner than the thick parts, unusually so, making the letters harder to recognize."},{"rating":"1","title":"1984 is a classic that doesn't deserve to be.","review":"While regarded as a \\"classic\\" by some literary scholars, 1984 is devoid of nearly every element of classical literature. The fall of Communism has erased nearly every trace of relevance this book may once have had. Its warnings of the evils of totalitarianism were overly alarmist by even Cold War standards and are even more so today. The absence of strong, 3-D characters makes even a man vs. society theme seem sorely lacking in depth . The only redeeming quality of this book may lie in providing future readers with an McCarthyist view of the evils of communism from the standpoint of a conservative 50s faux intellectual. If you're looking for a deeper, better-written, and tremendously more entertaining book, try Orwell's Animal Farm. Even walking, talking farm animals seem realistic compared to 1984."},{"rating":"1","title":"It rings false.","review":"The book has not much to say. It is just the common night-mares of its time.

I enjoyed reading this book, it was very creative and well written. It makes me appreciate what I have in life. I also woundn't like the situation that Winston is put by being watch all the time.

The intricacy of this world that George Orwell creates is fantastic and frightening. The themes of history, control, and technology sent my mind in a good thought-provoking buzz. Winston provides a wonderful central character who is seemingly broken yet somehow hopes still. The ending is depressing but fitting.I have only one issue with this novel. The relationship between Winston and Julia feels artificial and purely sexual. It feels as if Orwell was trying to express a love between them, but I didn't believe it.This novel is definitely worth a read.

I thought the book was just a little too far fetched for me. His prediction of 1984 was just so negative I found it really hard to get into it. It was difficult to read simply from lack of interest. I Think that this book may do wonders for other people though, it's just not really my style. For the most part I've always heard good things about this novel from other people.
