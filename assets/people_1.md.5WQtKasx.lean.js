It is a very tight fit for the ipod, it makes it hard to get in and out.Once in, it is almost impossible to use the ipod, the cover doesn't line up well and often causes you to do the wrong action. Using the dial is almost impossible.The hole at the bottom for the speaker wire is not fitted correctly so it causes the wire to become disconnected easily.In short don't buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfectly, and I have HUGE arms!","review":"Did any of the other reviewers follow the directions? This kit works great! I used this plus the Nike+ sensor kit and an Ipod Nano (1st gen) to train for USMC OCS and it worked like a charm. And at 6'2\\", 220lbs and a 270PFT I have HUGE upper arms!!It is designed for one thing: holding the Nano&Nike;+ sensor to your arm while running, and it keeps it nice and tight and flush, even when doing other exercises and crosstraining. The case is very thin and light, it is DESIGNED to be!!! It basically straps the ipod as tightly as possible to your arm, which I thought was great. Anyway, I think the other reviewers are idiots, this is a great case for runners of just about any size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible don't buy it","review":"Don't waste your money.

It shifts and turns the volume up to full blast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not user friendly","review":"The armband works fine, but it is such a pain! You can't see the screen, it is hard to control the volume, pause, etc... through the fabric and you have to take it out anytime you want to do something. I understand that this is the one with room for the iPod/Nike attachment, but I would try to figure out another solution with a different armband."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Pain to Use","review":"Nothing against the seller, but the item sucks. I have to take my pod out of the armstrap all the time to see the screen. It a real piece of junk.

They just came out with a similar model with a window. Save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not made for Ipod Nano, look elsewhere","review":"I bought this for my Ipod Nano, this is not made for the Nano.Yes the Nano fits in the item, but the screen is not visible at all.The thick foam also makes the controls difficult.This was probably designed for the Shuffle and just repackaged when the Nano cought on.I had a much better Nike armband that had a cover that let you see the screen and access the controls(dog ate it).This armband is cheap, but not worth it at all.I am buying a better one very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous, Designed quite possibly by Fisher-Price","review":"First off, I'll talk about the size of the band. The armband is resizable by velcro and at it's smallest, it's too tight for my arm. I'm a runner not a bodybuilder, so go figure who on who decided the proper size for this thing should be. Next, a key feature of the Nike+ is......well, let's see, how about the fact that it can display all of your running data as you run? It shows MPH, laps, etc.... What good is it to display ALL of this data on the IPod Nano screen as you run....if the Nike+ case covers the screen completely. There are hundreds of Ipod armband cases on the market and this is the first one I have ever seen that covers the screen.So, to recap. It's way too small. And, while the purpose of the Nike+ is to display running stats.....the Nike+ armband covers the screen. Way to go Nike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful if you make some \\"alterations\\"","review":"Like everyone else said, it makes no sense that you can't see the screen. I often don't even use my headphones when I'm running - I just use the iPod+ to track my distance and keep cumulative totals for me. So I DO need to see the screen while I'm running.I ended up cutting a square hole where the screen is, and now it's perfect! Nike should just make this part of the design, and put a piece of clear plastic over it to protect the screen. Then, I'd give it a 4.5-star rating. The band is comfortable, and the controls work fine through the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've tried to like it, but I just can't!","review":"I've tried running with this armband, and before I got the nike plus system it was ok. But as other posters point out, it's really tricky to end your workout at the precise time without hitting another button, etc. The nano fits in the armband, but the position is not absolute so the controls printed on the outside don't always line up with the nano buttons. The fit is ok for me, and I don't notice it while I run. Overall, I'd much rather just hold the nano while I'm running than deal with the workout controls. Also, as another poster pointed out, the headphone jack is very hard to find once you have the armband on. Maybe I'll try the upside down method to help me with that. Buy the $3-5 velcro armband with the cheap rubbery case from e-bay, I think you'll be happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"It's a bit awkward to get on, doesn't really stay in place, and worst, doesn't really protect my Ipod from sweat. It was really only useful on cooler days, when I put it on over a shirt sleeve to run."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but wouldn't recommend","review":"This thing works, but is a hassle to get on and off. The iPod screen can't be seen, so you have to memorize the locations to make changes. It's pretty cheap, that's the only advantage I see to it over the standard Apple bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I don't know why anyone would not want access to the control wheel or the DISPLAY, but its a bit annoying that its completely covered. If you are just looking for something to attach an Ipod to your arm and then not have to do anything, its fine, but if you are using it for hte Nike+ aspect, then you'd probably want to see some of the settings or navigate to end workout at some point which this doens't really let you do. it would have also been nice if they put in a small sleeve to keep your keys."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a bad product.","review":"I have two main problems with this product. First, the pouch completely covers up the screen so that you can't see what's on your iPod's display. This effectively turns the device into an iPod Shuffle. This may or may not be a big deal for you since many runners are focusing on the run too much to fiddle with music anyway.The second (and biggest) complaint that I have is that the velcro strap is really hard to fasten. Usually on things like this, the armband will have a metal piece where you run one flap through the other side, then pull it tight and velcro. This version just has the velcro pieces on either side. Unless you arm is teeny-tiny, it's really hard to fasten this armband because you can't pull the two sides together easily.I'm sure that Nike will eventually fix the problems with this, but until then I would pass on this disappointing product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for people with Avg Arms.","review":"Not for people with Avg Arms you will find that it's way too small. it's like putting on an over inflated bload pressure cuff.I would order one in a second if they made them in a normal size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it, really JUST DON'T DO IT","review":"I have used it for 5 months and it's been tearing apart since the first one, besides that, it is cumbersome to fit it correctly with one hand, the way I use it, (I run a lot), the Ipod end up soaked in sweat at the end of the wourkout, lately I've been having problems with my sensor/receiver, I don't know if that's due to be so wet so often, but the armband won't prevent it a bit.You can get use to control the music and volume with it, but if you wanna see how fast or how long you've been running, you have to wait until you finish your workout, that's an obvious flaw (screen covered), but the bad craftmanship and how difficult is to fit it, worth mention it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly designed!","review":"Possibly the worst design for an armband. A fifth-grader could make a better armband with felt, velcro, scissors and some thread. Not only can you not see the Nano screen, or adjust the volume while you are running (changing the volume is like trying to text message with gloves on), but you cannot adjust the tightness of the band with just one hand, it has too little elesticity and too small a velcro strip. To top it off, the Nano is kinda difficult to get in and out of the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"probably the worst armband ever for the nano","review":"i dont know what moron created this but it makes no sense. you cannot see the screen of your nano. i thought this thing was made for the nano as well as the shuffle but apparently it isnt. im sure the rest of it is fine it just sucks you cant see what the hell you are playing or doing if you have a nano."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a good buy!","review":"This armband is too large for my arm. I am a somewhat small woman, but not tiny. The armband only stays put if I'm wearing long sleeves. But more annoying, the only functions that work while the iPod is in the sleeve are pause/play, reverse and forward. The neoprene does not allow you to adjust volume, and the center and menu buttons are useless since you can't see the iPod screen when it's in the sleeve. I curse this armband daily."},{"rating":"2","title":"good cymbal for the money","review":"like others have said, this is a good cymbal for the money.

Years ago I owned one that I loved, but unfortunatley it was stolen from a rehersal room. All of my Sonor drums were in the room, but they took the cymbal!(?) I didn't think they made Wuhans anymore - I'm super psyched! Wuhans have a real gong/trash sound and the 16\\" - 18\\" are pitched high enough and decay fast for explosive accents. Like a firecracker when popped with the snare, but sticking lightly like a ride cymbal, they have dark, low overtones that give you a whole new \\"Asian\\" pallette. I heard about these from researching Neil Peart's cymbal configuration. I was so impressed with his distinctive china sound and discovered he plays Wuhans. You absolutely cannot beat this cymbal for the $$$!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, funny notation though","review":"So I took the class with the man last quarter and thought I did not need the book. Well, by the end of the semester I started reading it and I was pleasantly surprised by the organized nature of the book. Rubinstein's thoughts are well explained and there is a lot of clarity in his derivations, which are not overly mathematical . Rubinstein comes from another era in finance, an era when intuition was more important than the math. Right now, there is so much math in finance that intuition seems to be undervalued, which is a shame.If this book had a solid set of questions and answers at the end, it would be a great book. Then again, we got our own problem sets from the professor, so I can't complain about that myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.... disposable chain is worthless for a days of cutting","review":"Cutting mixed soft and hard, chain initially cut well.

Moved by his own personal tortures, he risks everything to help them. In the process, he ends up in a Mexican prison, which is ironic as he is trying to help the very people who imprison him. Coming from a wealthy family, he uses his resources to continue his efforts to assist the refugees, only to provoke the wrath of the town's people who want to halt the never ending influx of illegals.

My second review involves the cover art work. Is it just me or does GLJ have the worst seven album covers of all time? This new cd though, takes the cake. This is the most horrific artwork ever done. Are they doing it on purpose? Do they not realize the power of visuals? This cover resembles some compilation cd for an indie label on the tightest budget imaginable. I realyze the Aston brothers aren't loaded like other bands, but this cover is inexcusable. Bad marketing. I trully believe this impacts record sales tremendously. You get nauseated looking at this cover. It is repulsive at best. Gene Loves Jezebel is one of my favorite bands of all time. I've seen them live five times over the years. I collect their cassette singles and old lps.

There are three old songs here from previous releases; \\"Love Keeps Dragging Me Down\\", Who Wants to go to Heaven?\\", and \\"When We Were One\\". The remakes of these songs are a real nice touch to previously spectacular songs. This album is Gene at their finest. Songs like Liquor Man and Welcome to LA are as good and inventive as rock can get. It's a shame no big label has exploited the market with these guys and all their talent. They could rake in millions. These songs are at a level much higher then the mediocrity of stuff being played on radio these days and selling millions. Every Gene album is a phenom.

Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Rip-Off","review":"I was dumb enough to buy the VHS copies of these years ago for megabucks. I have hundreds of workout videos. These shouldn't even be categorized as \\"workout\\" videos. There is no cuing, no instruction, no routines, nothing.

As a jazz lover owning more than 1500 CDs spanning from the late 40s to today jazz, I can tell you that I like very much this Kenny Werner work. All through the CD the music conveys freedom, space, relaxed tone, freshness and a sense of inner joy. The more I listen to it, the more I like it. Recommended if you are into contemporary jazz piano trio."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Devil Got Ahold of Dick Cavett\\"","review":"This is my favorite Rifftrax DVD so far, with \\"Voodoo Man\\" coming in second. I love this DVD! Perhaps the funniest short in the collection was \\"Know For Sure\\". It will have you rolling from the get-go. It's about the evils of syphlis and how it is spread. When the doctor tells the young man, \\"And no one ever need know that you have syphlis.\\" one of the guys, (Bill?) says, \\"Unless they read my blog.\\" I was rolling. Non-stop hilarity. \\"Kitty Cleans Up\\" and \\"Technological Failures\\" are two other standouts from this awesome collection. MST3K fans will love this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst service ever","review":"I ordered this a month ago and still haven't received it. I contacted their \\"customer service\\" (hah, what a joke) and they kept putting me off saying give it more time/ my post office was probably holding it. The DHL tracking number they gave didn't work. Finally after 3 weeks, they agreed to re-ship. That was a week ago and I still don't have it, despite telling them NOT to re-ship via DHL/ USPS. (I even paid double postage seeing that I bought another item from them and didn't ask for the postage to be reduced. You'd think they could have sent it Priority Mail, but no.) All I know is that I have an autistic son who has a meltdown EVERY DAY because it's not here. (The new DHL tracking number says it's been stuck in Kentucky for the past 3 days.)Don't order from these people if you actually want to receive your item. They deserve ZERO stars for a rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Hero","review":"This book is a a previoulsy published book under another title.

Then she meets Parker Davidson, who is the epitome of everything she wants the hero of her book to be. Will she be content with merely writing about him, or will she let him be the hero in her real life? In this book, Macomber cleverly addresses the faults in how the hero is written in the typical romance novel, and in doing so highlights how much different, how much more real the character of Parker is. It's funny, insightful, unique, and something I have read over and over for years. I'm sure anyone who reads it once will do the same!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Hero","review":"Did not realize it was a religious story. Just too much!

One thing that really got me was the closing sound track. Teresa Straley's rendition of \\"Sleep Baby Sleep\\" was not only haunting, but captivating. I only wish that it were available on a sound track album. In my opinion, this movie is, for horror fans, well worth watching.

Amazon promptly sent a replacement but it too had the same problem.Since the copies had problems in different parts of the DVD, my family was able to watch a total of three of the shorts and all of them were funny. Nothing quite as grand as children in monkey masks being killed off in biking accidents one-by-one Final Destination-style as in one of the other Rifftrax Shorts, but still funny. Hopefully Amazon will get a replacement shipment of DVDs that work properly because the shorts are definitely the best Rifftrax material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Showing","review":"I always have a soft spot the shorts as they are great for a quick watch or to share with others to introduce them to MST3Kesque antics. This set is pretty strong, although not my favorite of the Rifftrax shorts. I have found I enjoy these Rifftrax more on rewatching, so I hope these season well.

The title specifies thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail, but many of the topics covered are of interest to women who love spending time outdoors. Input from numerous sources is well blended to offer balanced, solid advice. I was surprized at the diversity of topics covered.

I haven't put it out because it is silly looking. For one thing, the decorated portion is heavy and thick, and the disproportionately small towel part is comparatively thin. Heavy, bulky embellishment on a slight, skimpy towel. The towel part would have to be longer or the embellishment cut in half to make it look right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid watch.","review":"It's heavy, it's accurate, and it's nice looking.Down sides:- I had to take it into a watch store to have the band serviced. It only cost $5, but it was something more to do after I got my product. If I left things as they were, that watch would fit around my forearm, not my wrist!- The face is made out of plastic, and will scratch if you're not careful.- Setting the date means winding the time endlessly until the correct day of the month shows up. Seriously.Aside from that, as long as you wear your watch, it takes the kinetic energy from your movements, and converts that to the same thing that winding an old fashioned watch would do. You'll never have to wind this watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"an unknown little gem","review":"It is sometimes hard to buy CDs by super obscure little bands of this era, because you never know what you're paying for. Some are great, and some are just pale imitations of bigger bands.Kahavas Jute is hard, chunky, bluesy riff rock. Think early Deep Purple without the keyboards or progressive elements. The songs are condenced and straighforward, but the riffs and playing never fail to punch, and the singer is excellent. Good writting. Lots of nice hard rock techniques, like fuzz bass, add texture.This is not essential, but you definately will never regret buying it. I have had it for five years and still enjoy it.PLAY LOUD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Orchestre Baobab","review":"Since there are no music samples for this CD, I just want to point out that this Baobab group is not the same as the Orchestre Baobab from Dakar Senegal, whose CD's are listed at the top of the page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad policy.","review":"Who can rate a product that is unavailable?

While its fun to really get in there and whip up some multiple layered, exotic material, ultra-realistic pattern from time to time, in my day-to-day fishing, I want patterns that catch fish, tie up quickly, and don't break my heart when I end up snapping them off.Bob Clouser's patterns in his new book are just what the doctor ordered; they tie up quickly, use a minimum of materials, and most importantly, they catch the heck out of fish!I'll face any fish, anywhere, with the appropriately sized and colored Clouser Deep Minnow. It's that good. His other patterns are equally as effective, and who better to learn from than the guy that developed them.I absolutely recommend this book for the excellent intructions and clear photography, which make this a useful tool for both novice and experienced tiers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very High Quality Book","review":"This book gives very clear instructions with great high res color pictures showing how to tie some of Bob Couser's most popular flies.

Expectations were high, considering the outstanding work the band did and the longstanding fan base they developed, but \\"Biorritmos\\" was not up to the challenge. The resulting album was a bland pop production that didn't sound any different from the other artists that were topping the Venezuelan charts at the time (Pedro Castillo, who played guitars in the album, being one of the most famous ones). As a result, this album went mostly unnoticed and became an effort that most hardcore Venezuelan rock fans became dissapointed with.Dagnino later went on to form the band Pixel with former members of other famous Venezuelan bands. They've recorded two albums to this day, none of which I've had a chance to listen to.

It wouldn't open again. I turned the tv off and back on and after a long wait, it finally gave back the dvd. When I tried to play the same dvd an hour later, it wouldn't even play. I got the FBI warning and then nothing else. So we used another tv and dvd player. We didn't even have a chance to see if it would work on cable since we had it up and running only 2 hours before we decided that a kids tv that didn't play dvds was worthless to us. It is also very long(20\\"). Our 20 year old tv was 2\\" shorter than this new one. The new one was about 5lbs less than the old one.If you want all of the components to work, don't buy this one.

I was told the DW716 is the same saw as the 36-422L (looks more like the 322L to me), which i find hard to believe (there are \\"some design changes\\"), but at least they are supposedly built on the same line. The DeWalt 716 is also highly rated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Saw, great value!!","review":"I purchased this saw to replace an older 12\\" DeWalt saw. I am blown away at the new features. The laser, with a little adjusting, is bright and easy to see, the mitre gauge clear and precise, and the compound setting is rock solid at the front of the saw. No more reaching to the back to adjust the tilt, hooray. This saw is heavy, and I recommend it for the serious home improvement person, or would be great for a trim carpenter relying on quality tools for a quality job. The saw came ready to use, with a good 12\\" carbide tipped blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Applicable to more than addiction.","review":"Who in this world doesn't have a secret? This book is relatable on more levels than just addiction. It's about the tenacious journey of a man struggling and finally enjoying the inspirational triumph of breaking free of secrets. It's achingly real and raw, opening the door for others to follow in his footsteps. John Howard Prin does a fantastic job leading us down a road of vulnerability, strength, and triumph.As a postpartum depression survivor, I kept my experience a secret. It was devastating and kept me from connecting with loved ones. Once released, I was finally free to live the life I've always dreamed of living.

On the contrary, I found a bit of history along with a bunch of old ads. The price tag is a bit much for a book of such low quality.

The story wasn't exactly a new one but was told with a warmth and attitude that made the characters very endearing. I like a book which involves the reader in the development of the characters and this one does just that. Even as Jo Quincy is inevitably exposed, the book doesn't end there but deals with Sinclair's new chemistry with his Josephine. Sinclair's physical issues are also seen through the author's empathetic eyes. A good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"Not an avid reader of romance novels I picked this book up on the advise of a long time friend.

I agree with the reviewer who indicated that the characters were not well described. I had no picture in my mind as to the main character's appearance. I kept picturing \\"Jo\\" as Hilary Swank's character in \\"Boys Don't Cry\\"!! Also, the ending was disappointing as well. I agree with the reviewer who indicated that an epilogue was needed.

Three examples:1. The Emancipation Proclamation: This is presented as an empty gesture by Lincoln. It should be understood that Lincoln was afraid of losing the border states.2. The Sherman/Grant/Sheridan strategies of total war weren't presented with any reasoning (destroying the continuing means of making war material, breaking the will of the people, etc).3.

Unfortunately understanding the behavior of biological weapons was and is a necessity. This book reviews a few of the 239 admitted tests. It does not provide in depth information on the individual tests such as plume spread or pattern. It does expose the use of U.S. cities as the test tubes for these experiments. Several times the author refers to alleged violations of the BWC by the former USSR. As history has proven, they were not alleged but rampant violations of the BWC.

The macro / zoom capabilities are outstanding, with a little practice and use of tripod or a patient steady hand.

It's amazing how you can get all three for the price of one here at Amazon.I've been playing jazz piano for several years by ear, I can play any chord in any key solely by the feel and position of my hands. I have for so long desired to learn theory and teach. Why does this lead to that? How is it all connected? I can explain it all now, as music theory is an exact science. The content in these books, if learned well is priceless, especially if you're teaching others to play as well.For those who commented on needing the cd's and the teacher's edition to get full use of these books are in no doubt being unreasonable based on the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but have to buy the ear training discs separately?","review":"It wasn't clear to me that you need the ear training CD's to go with the lessons until we got several lessons into the book.

It's a compilation of all of the 3 Alfred's music theory books, so it's pretty thorough and covers a LOT of material. There are short exercises on most pages for the students to practice everything from writing a clef sign to analyzing chords. My only complaint is that a few of the exercises are designed to be used with their CD's, which are not included with the book purchase.

This is an all-time fantasy classic, rich in imagery, symbolism and good old-fashioned adventure. Its sweet, understated style builds through a compelling plot to a rewarding climax and a bombshell ending, all the while peppering the reader with neat turns of phrase (one of my favorites: \\"Sea-dogs are like other dogs, and bark at what we're not used to\\"). A magnificent take on the dichotomies between reality and fantasy, life and death, prose and poetry. My poor words cannot do it justice.

Also portrayed are the strong bonds of faith and love that unite a family whatever hardships life may bring. One of the story strands follows a pair of young sweethearts who have become parents in an unusual way by the end of the film. It is enchanting.

I don't know if I'd call it folk, more like modern American Standards (Dylan and Leonard Cohen, indeed). Judy Collins uses her seemingly flawless vocals to conjure up a patchwork of rich emotions -- taking you through optimism, sadness, regret, longing and innocent hope. That's typical for Judy Collins though. What seems unique about this album is that she sings in a lower register and with more definite phrasing, so she sounds more like a story teller than on other albums (a lot like in the 9/11 tribute song she wrote). The stories become rich under her command, so we are grabbed by the urgency of \\"Story of Isaac\\", the hope in \\"Someday Soon\\" and the mixed pensive sentiment in the beautiful \\"My Father\\". If you've ever liked Judy Collins but perhaps aren't familiar with the songs on this album, give it a try -- she sounds great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Bible Series","review":"I grew up with my father reading to me from this Bible story series.

From start to finish Meisel takes the listener through tales of love, trainwrecks, coal miner blues and everything in between painting beautiful stories which leave the listener wanting more. \\"Red Moshannon\\" is the opening track and is a very passionate look into coal mining and the scars it leaves on the Moshannon river. \\"Trainwreck at Cajon Pass\\" is my personal favorite and is a beautiful tale of two boys dreaming about the great Union Pacific and following their dreams to a tragic end. Other standout tracks are \\"The Great Transmission\\" and the title track, \\"Coal and Diamonds.\\" You definitely do not want to miss this one folks.

Immediately I knew that must have been what I saw long ago. It didn't disappoint me then either. Made in the bleak early days of World War II, \\"Bataan\\" is stirring tribute to the fighting spirit of the American soldier beset by an enemy horde.

To be fair, I have developed a quite elaborate shaving process that involves Emu oil, regular shaving cream, and some very hot water, along with very precise strokes; nonetheless, these blades and the strip of aloe help tremendously, and the sensitivity of my skin allows me to notice subtle differences more so than the average person (not a good thing, but true in any case).

I haven't used March 3 in over a year. I prefer electric razors due to ability to shave on the go. With convention shavers, there is always the need for shaving cream, after shave, and too time consuming. Because of the price of these Mach3 being on sale, i decided to give it a try again. I am currently on my first blade and I've only used it 3 times and the green strip already fell off. It doesn't give a close shave plus it pulls on my hair.

Well worth the money and you know what you are getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to save some money?","review":"I love my Mach 3 Turbo, and the 1 star isnt because its a crappy product. I get a pretty awesome shave from it. It is because of clever marketing to fleece money out of loyal consumers. Heres a nifty secret, the most discernible difference between the Turbo refill blades and the regular Mach 3 blades......packaging and a different colored stripe.Yup, its practically the same thing. Just far more expensive. Ive been refilling my turbo with regular Mach 3 blades for about 3 years now and I promise there isnt enough of a difference to pay more. It fits the same, shaves the same and almost looks the same. Just buy the cheaper Gillette Mach3 blades and presto changeo, you have saved some cash and gotten an nearly identical blade refill. I just bought a 5 pack of regulars for $13 instead of the turbo blades for $17. You're welcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAKE!!","review":"I should have read the reviews more carefully. When I received the blades, they looked like the same ones I buy in the stores, but they were not. I just started to use them and they are dull and dangerous.

But I still received the inferior blades that are not manufactured to U.S. standards. These blades are not as sharp from the start and only last 2 or 3 shaves compared to 10 or more for the ones I buy from Walmart, Target, or Sam's. The lube strip also wears out with the first shave.

If I'd known they were fakes I would have returned them to Amazon, but I just figured they just didn't work for me for some reason. I could barely get three shaves off them before getting cuts and abrasions. Even the very first shave with a new cartidge felt worse than a well-used cheap blade. I'm really disappointed with Amazon.

Stay away from buying these here!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Naysayers, alas, are right","review":"Gillette's Mach 3 Turbo is probably the best razor ever made. My research, though, indicates that Gillette has let its quality control on this item go down to the basement. The blade head follows the curvature of your face but in a lackadaisical manner. So if you're shaving your chin, say, the razor may think its still shaving your cheek and ouch! goes a piece of your skin.Amazon buys its blades directly from Gillette so Amazon seemingly is not at fault. But the large number of complaints over the past several years, and my direct inquiry to Amazon about the matter has brought no effective action.My advice: any man who wants to keep a pretty, nick-free face should look for blades aother than the Mach3 Turbo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"The Boccherini 'Stabat Mater' is sung hideously (I reviewed it some years ago), the Pergolesi 'Stabat Mater' is not only sung hideously but seems to have been utterly botched by the recording technicians and editors.

There are NO redeeming qualities to this 'box set', since I doubt that it would start much of a camp fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"diverse and magnetic","review":"For anyone used to the sugary sweet Judy Collins from later in her career, be prepared for a shock, because this album features a startling range of styles and emotions. In Marat Sade and the great Kurt Weil song from the Threepenny Opera Pirate Jenny, Collins sounds unbelievably menacing. On Dress Rehearsal Rag, an unappreciated Leonard Cohen classic, she is haunting. And of course she also sings other songs with her usual beauty and grace, like Suzanne (one of the masterpieces of all time), In My Life, Sunny Goodge Street, etc. She also does a wonderfully understated job with the early Randy Newman classic I Think It's Going to Rain Today. All in all, an incredible range of singing and songs, very special even for those who don't like Judy Collins."},{"rating":"2","title":"In my ears","review":"A variety of styles of songs and productions fronted by a vocal intelligence and ability that makes sound magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing CD","review":"I love Judy Collins. She is a singer that you never outgrow. But this is one of the most disappointing compilations of her music that I've ever come across.

This one doesn't do her justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"In My Life, I've Loved You, Judy!","review":"This is the first album I ever heard by Judy Collins. I remember it well. A group of us English graduate students at a Southern state university sat around blown away by \\"Suzanne\\" and tried to figure out what it meant-- as only pretentious graduate students can. Although I didn't understand it then or now, it remains one of my favorite songs-- and no one with the possible exception of the writer himself sings it better than Judy. We owe her a debt of gratitude for introducing Leonard Cohen to the U. S.Thre are so many other beautiful cuts here. I particularly like \\"La Colombe,\\" Dylan's \\"Tom Thumb's Blues\\", and Randy Newman's \\"I think It's Going To Rain Today.\\" Then there is Judy's incomparable version of \\"In My Life.\\" She doesn't get better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money for extra material","review":"I don't have much of an opinion about the remastering, other than to note that it sounds clear and I really enjoy the music. I consider the original a 3-star album. If you like The Doors, you'll like the original. My particular favorites include Shaman's Blues, Wild Child and the title track.The Rhino remix includes several additional tracks including Who Scared You and 2 versions of Whisky, Mystics and Men. These tracks are hard to find elsewhere, very strong, and bump this version of the CD up to 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of their best","review":"the doors 4th album found them in transition from psychedelic death pop to a subtle blues/rock style. so in between we got th esoft parade. Unfairly derided, it contains experimentation that worked. There was a combination bluegrass/rock/psychedelic/jazz tinge to most of the songs. Jim's vocal is mature and defined most of the time and the lyrics well you can work them out but thwy're cool. The title track is 1 of their most powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Doors' Weakest Album? NOT AT ALL!","review":"Many people seem to believe that The Soft Parade is the weakest Doors album. That is a popular opinion, but the album is wonderful. It includes their most \\"radio friendly\\" song, Touch Me, and many other pop hits.

Listen to this album, light up and soar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two words: Contractual obligation.","review":"I am a huge Doors fan, but have to acknowledge sub-par performance when it happens. Credit the band for completing the album, considering the internal problems they were encountering. Still, they are a fantastic band. Never has there been a more perfect fit with only four players to fit the parts. The Grateful Dead could do wonders, but they had a lot of people involved. The Doors were that quick spark that makes you both uncomfortable, and excited about the darkness that pervades our everyday existence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother Buying This!","review":"Jim Morrison must be rolling over in his grave. They have redone the whole album and it sucks. It does not have the gritty bite of the original.

If it ain't broke don't fix it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogus Doors","review":"This is a bogus Doors CD with Jim Morrison. They didn't really sell out but were trying to shed their rebellious hippie image in favor of teeny bopper bubble gum to the point where they were on the cover of Tiger Beat. The music isn't bad, in fact it's really good, it's just the fact of one of their weakest singles, Touch Me, and compares poorly to the more inspired debut and LA Woman, poorly to even Morrison Hotel. This is called Soft Parade because The Doors are soft core now. If you just listen to it straight through it's great background music for sitting back and relaxing, but the Doors here are pure bubble gum, which got criticized for catering to pubescent audiences. I got this as relic of the 60s and 1900s for 2 bucks. I don't have the 2007 remaster, this is the 1990 CD reissue. I want rebellous or older drunk Doors.

I am sorry but the opener: Tell all the People, has got to be the most pretencious song on this album. It really goes beyond cheesy. Touch me, well now there is a song to match anything Sweat, Blood and Tears ever did. Actually, the entire Soft Parade struggles to be the Doors and at the same time Sweat, Blood and Tears. Why? It is obvious why Jim Morrison did not want his songs orchastrated..they would loose their raw sensuality. The songs that lack punch here are Robbie Kriegers. They inspire only a subtle muse. Shaman Blues and Wild Child, both by Morrison, clearly display the only direction in this shallow album. But it is not enough to carry the weight.

Jim what right to order that each song to be labeled so that everyone would know who wrote which songs. Most of Robbie's songs were weak, except for Touch Me. Many of Jim's weren't all to great either. The only songs that are really worth listening to are Shaman's Blues, Touch Me and Wild Child. And perhaps Runnin' Blues, just for the laughs you get when Robbie breaks into song with Jim. They must have been stoned to let HIM sing. He's a great guitarits, but he should keep his mouth shut. I can NOT believe that I have said such things about my absolute favorite band.

So, out came \\"Waiting for the Sun\\", and ...it's a hit. Would the next album go in the direction of great songs such as \\"Five to One\\", and \\"Not to Touch the Earth\\"? No. It went in the direction of the worst song on WFTS, \\"Winterime love\\". Well, why not. If yours fans prefer \\"Hello, I love you\\" to \\"People are Strange\\", then you better give them what they want, good and hard. ... Well here it is, the Soft (and oh so sticky) Parade.

This should be the last Doors album you buy, to complete a well worthwhile collection, yet purchase well after the live shows and Morrison's American Prayer."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"There are only two tracks on this cd that I like: \\"Wild Child\\" and \\"Wishful, Sinful.\\" The rest is, as one reviewer put it, schizophrenic. Judging from the cover, even The Doors themselves seem to be shying away from this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"Although i am a diehard Doors fan and i own every album, i dislike this one. The song Soft Parade is overrated. Really the only worhwhile songs are Wild Child, Tell all the people and Touch Me, as opposed to almost all songs on other Doors albums being classics. if ur a new Doors fan go with Self Titled or Morrison Hotel. Then get Strange Days or LA woman or a live album. Keep the Soft Parade, WFTS, and American Prayer for last."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Doors album","review":"Buy this album and you will agree. Miami was surely on all their minds when they did this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could This Be It?","review":"Is it true? Have I found the worst album of all time? I think so. It's a thirty-three minute record with three minutes of enjoyment: the first three minutes of Shaman's Blues (which even then overstays its welcome). The rest? Oh, god. The rest. Well, there's the over-the-top hippy anthem Tell All the People. There are a pair of annoying good-timey blues tunes (Do It; Easy Ride) and one painfully bad one (Wild Child). There's Wishful Sinful, which is painful. Runnin' Blue, a country/soul Otis Redding tribute, is a disgrace to the man's memory thanks in part to Krieger's vocals in the chorus. The overblown, eight-minute title track is an example of how over-the-top Jim could be if he tried. Touch Me, the one everybody knows, is the second-best song on this album, but would've been the second-worst on the debut or Morrison Hotel.Teah, I'd say this is the worst ever, though some of AC/DC's '80's work gives it a run for its money."},{"rating":"1","title":"basic relaxation techniques","review":"This woman has never (to my knowledge) suffered a miscarriage.

The net broke at the first time I used it. A ball tore and ripped the net, flew through it, and created a hole at the wall 25 feet behind the net. We have to postpone the research project until find a safe way to continue -- which definitely can't be achieved with this net.The net simply doesn't have the strength to stop a baseball hit by a college level player. Three or four strings were broken by the ball.For reference, the ball speed was around 90mph. You may use this net for either hitting or pitching practice. However, if you think the ball you hit can be this fast, or you are a pitcher who can throw this fast, don't buy it. You may accidentally hurt somebody when this net fails and you are in big trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Updated Narrator Uses a Video Camera but Lacks Some Existential Angst","review":"This film version is an interesting update of the written story and would be good as a contrast/discussion point to Dostoyevsky's orginal written version. The narrator in the film lacks the urgent and powerful sense of alienation and angst that the literary narrator struggles with; however, the film narrator confronts his inner desperation in later scenes with other characters, although at some times he falls to just being an angry young man; in that sense, the film is uneven. However, it is interesting and somewhat logical for the director to choose to have him self-record and self-confess to the camera to reach a modern, visual audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"*Yaaaawn*","review":"More self-righteous tripe from a Leftist nag. Novick has convinced himself through the compilation of various incidents that White racism is ominpresent and all powerful. The solution? Socialism. That's right, more government, more regulation. The fact of the matter is, the world is becoming homogenized under the banner of the global economy. Ethnic and cultural identity (especially White) are seen as obstacles to this process and such feelings are being criminalized through indoctrination and various pieces of legislation. But hey, what's a Leftist going to do without White racism? It pays their bills. So if they have to, they will see it where it doesn't exist.

It has some helpful ingredients (jojoba, tea tree oil etc.) but it also contains Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS). This stuff dries out your hair follicles and scalp and and cause a reaction which actually creates more dandruff and sebum. I've started using Jaons Natural Cosmetic Dandruff Relief Shampoo. All the same ingredients minus the SLS. This has worked soooo much better than Nature's Gate. Write me if you have questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silky Smooth","review":"I just received this product and it is awesome. My hair is super smooth (that may also be because I am using the tea tree conditioner from nature's gate in addition to the shampoo). I love the pleasant scent, it's not overbearing. I find that this lathers up much nicer than the Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo. I feel like my hair isn't clean if I don't have a lot of suds (strange, but true). I've only been using it for 3 or 4 days, but so far I really like it. I gave this review a four because I haven't noticed any difference in my scalp condition yet, this doesn't really bother me as I have yet to find a product that helps.

As I read it, I kept nodding my head in response to what Dr. Kramer was writing. She was describing so perfectly thoughts and feelings that I have had myself about depression. The book is easy to read and so down to earth. Dr. Kramer describes depression as it really is, so simply, so perfectly.

Unfortunately, we only made it about 40 minutes in before we had to turn it off! The singing is not the problem, it's the rolling on the floor that drove us crazy. Maybe it seemed like a fresh idea in 1996, but it doesn't now!Don't be fooled by the glorious colors and the intriguing postmodern-retro-baroque production. The end result is that each of the characters ends up an unappealing caricature, someone you really don't care about. This one rolls on the floor all the time, that one tongues his walking stick in a lewd manner all the time... Enough said. Now you have various opinions, and you'll have to make up your own mind...We did enjoy the ENO's production of Xerxes, though, in case you're looking for an alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muggles, Beware!","review":"This is clearly a production intended for Lucius Malfoy and his social set. Polinesso even bears a close resemblance to Professor Snape. In short, it's very hard to look at. However, I can't second the recommendation of other reviewers to darken the screen and just listen. It's not well sung. How could it be, when the singers are asked to distort their instruments (their bodies) and pervert the affect of every aria in the most far-fetched manner possible. I'm not a conservative about opera productions, by the way. I heartily recommend Handel's \\"Theodora\\" and \\"Rodelinda\\" - both modernistic, both conducted by William Christie and sung gloriously. This Ariodante is simply a bad piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unattractive singers, horrible stage setting","review":"The performance is sung in English, but the original language is Italian. The singers look very unattractive, if not ugly. I know, not every singer can look like Netrebko or Garanca, but there are plenty of attractive looking singers of Baroque music (Didonato, Bartoli, Kermes, Génaux, Antonacci, etc. etc.). But then the singing must be in the original language, which I find much better. I cannot enjoy this production, I find it rather horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Fireworks User Should Own This Book","review":"This book is definitely a book that I shall keep for reference.

The book reads like a lame first novel with the \\"island\\" sections grafted on to make it a part of the \\"Lost\\" franchise. The main character, Faith, is so naive and spineless that it is hard to have any sympathy for her whatsoever. She is manipulated and abused consistently by the men in her life, her contact with the TV show characters on the island is minimal, and the \\"resolution\\" of her tale is totally underwhelming.

It has very little to do with LOST other than a few chance encounters with the main characters we've come to know and love. The plot was weak and repetitive.

There was little interaction with the castaways we know and love; Sun & Jin were completely absent. I didn't care much for Faith with her talk about \\"beautiful snakes.\\" Doesn't she know that man's antipathy to snakes dates back to the Garden of Eden? It was obvious that George was afraid of the spider, but she wasn't at all understanding. And she was naive not to suspect that Oscar and the others were up to something in Australia. I hope the next books are better, but they have to be. They can't be worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read better fanfic","review":"I bought this book because I thought it would be about the characters I have a vested interest in. I don't care about the anonymous background extras that populate the show, I want Jack or Sawyer or hell, I'll even take Kate. I've read other book series based on TV shows and they concentrate on the main characters.

Comprehensive and well researched, the author relies heavily on contemporary interviews, reviews, and articles, along with Kay's own diary and memories of her close friends, to give a glowing, though not uncritical view of Kay's life and career. Peppered throughout with juicy tidbits about her love life without being lurid or sensationalistic, it also covers her contract struggle with Warner Bros., her tireless and often overlooked charity work during WW2, and features many rare photos, including several of Kay in her later years.

There are awkwardly worded sentences, misspellings, wrong names and dates, and cliché after cliche. This is basically a rehash of the George Eells' chapter that came out decades ago and offers little new information. The photographs are crudely reproduced and look like seventh generation photocopies. Yes, the book is inexpensive, but it looks, feels, and reads like it. This must be a self-published book. The writer clearly needed an editor and a better printer. There's a better book out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"MEDIOCRE","review":"This book proved to be disappointing. The author adores Kay Francis (perhaps too much), but he has no grasp of film history or the times in which she lived.

If you're looking for a true manual of steel construction, meaning a how-to book, this isn't the book to buy. This book is centered around architecture, not down and dirty steel construction techniques. There are no methods included in the book for such things as calculating loads, yield, tensile, etc. If you want a world wide sampling of connecting means, truss designs, etc. with no dimensions in the examples then this is the book for you.

I would recommend that you give yourself a week or two to listen to this. It is worth the time and effort.Also thwe subject matter varies from a weird love triangle(The Jimmy Lee story,), social injustice(Livin the Lie).

We race 2 trucks, and my husband likes to review the video's to see how driving patterns can be changed. We are able to watch the videos on TV with no problem, but, since the software did not come with the camera, we have to buy new discs quite often. I contacted Panasonic about the software, and they advise that \\"it is not available for 4-6 weeks.\\" HUH?? You cannot buy this anywhere except Panasonic - you'd think they'd have copies of the software in stock.

Haven't followed up with the company yet so not sure how that will go. The smell that people have commented on was definitely there but not that bad for ours. Also it is kinda difficult to switch the height on it. Once its set and locked with screws it works fairly well althought the height is kind of annoying. They have it color coded and have you set the height according to the size of your hand which was weird. All of the heights took some getting used to before it became comfortable.follow up: I emailed the company to send me replacement screws and they let me know they don't manufacture these individually and refered me to best buy or any other store that sells office accessories.

The rubber is a good material and it seems very sturdy. You can adjust it's height and it's angle toward you. Loosing the knobs on the side will allow you to slide the product up and down to adjust the height relatively easily and there is an easy access pedal in the front that locks the rest into place once you have it set to your desired postion.

Largely unknown outside of the people who seek and are rewarded, and of course his knowing peers; James Willis Ponder is simply a master jazz guitar player. He was dubbed \\"little Wes\\" early in his career and while certainly a compliment, the monniker served to push him further toward an identity of his own. He succeeded. His blues, phrasing, depth, and color are uniquely Ponder. While Wes Montgomery settled in to a style, Jimmy Ponder still stretches the boundaries of his own talent and genious. This CD is an example. Even while being stepped-on by an out-of-place sax, Ponder continues to stay true to the spirit of the title; not by outdoing the reedman (he could with ease), but by playing soulful melodies IN SPITE OF the frenetic sax.

The songs are standard 90s alt-rock infused with Native American and/or Hindu rhythms and melodies. \\"Operation Spirit\\" and \\"Good Pain\\" should be familiar to Live fans, as the songs were eventually released on their full length debut. \\"Heaven Wore a Shirt\\" and \\"Negation,\\" round out the four songs. These two songs alone are worth the purchase price of the EP. I'd give all of these songs 4 1/2 - 5 stars, easily. This is a MUST HAVE for any Live fan.

Songs such as \\"I'm Old Fashioned\\" and \\"Long Ago and far Away\\" are timeless love songs.However, the quality of this CD is poor at best. From what I could tell the recording is done in mono. When I first put the CD on and queued up the first track I thought somehow my CD player had been transformed into a Victrola. The sound was scratchy, hissy and tinny. If the producers of this video were looking to capture authentic old-time sound, they got it.Fromn what I've been able to find this is the only recording of the Cover Girl soundtrack, which is a real shame. Music of this caliber deserves better treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This trash does not deserve even a single star!!","review":"'Madagascar' was an abysmal disappointment. It was one of those films that [wisely] put all the decent moments into the previews. What was left was a stack of cliche's and flat attempts at humor. Jada Pinckett's character, the Hippo, was given nothing to do. David Schwimmer's constantly fretting, hypochondriac Giraffe just got in the way, without being witty. The film is basically carried by the friendship between the Lion and the Zebra...and what happens is flat and predictable. What about the 'Fusa' who were eating the Lemurs? That sub-plot got lost entirely. The penguins, who were the most interesting characters, disappeared all too soon, and I was fidgeting in my seat by the halfway point, debating whether to leave or stay.

The previews were just not that appealing. The storyline didn't seem to make any sense (from the previews.) I had no clue. (In more ways than one!)The fact is the movie was very smartly written. The animation was creative and very bright. It was realistic but abstract enough to be slightly amusing. The storyline is simple, but with a wide array of gags and \\"physical comedy\\" that entertains young and old alike. Of course, having said all that I must admit that the simple story is balanced by characters that are very complex in nature.Alex is the king of the jungle... only his jungle is the city zoo. Melman, the hypochondriac giraffe, along with lovely hippo, Gloria and Marty the laughable zebra make for an interesting zoo dynamic.Throw in a bunch of oddball penquins with military delusions and a gaggle of lemurs that like to \\"move it\\" and you have the screwball hit of the year!A perfect story for the kid in all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice DVD","review":"I watched this movie with my mom and we both thought it was really cute and funny.

First of all, it's made by DreamWorks Animations, and not Disney-Pixar. Since it's not Disney, you don't get the corny formulaic singing and dancing often seen in Disney animations put just to pimp soundtrack sales.What you get is a cleverly written (and animated) movie that my kid absolutely loves and I enjoy along with him. Grown-ups can enjoy the pop-culture references such The Twilight Zone spoof, and Alex the Lion doing his best G-Rated impression of Charlton Heston from Planet of the Apes. If you're good with the pause button, you can also catch many subtle cookies left behind by the makers of the movie. For example, when on the ship, as the penguins are about to take over the bridge, the logo on the captain's shirt says \\"S.S. Act II\\". Why? Becuase the Act II of the movie is just starting then. Clever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly forgettable","review":"I'm sorry, but this film wasn't all that great. Yes, there were a few laugh out loud moments, such as the leamur king and the skelleton arm, however, overall i found myself bored through just about all of it.The plot isn't really anything new: Marty the Zebra wants to leave his life at the zoo and live in the wild, but his friends want to stay put. THere is a little bit of conflict between the Zebra and his LIon friend, but it's trivial and almost stupid.When this movie was finished I was left with a feeling of \\"Okay, that was a big waste of time.\\" My brother loved it and I'm sure other little kids will find it funny, but for me it just didn't work well at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what it says","review":"I did receive the dvds but madagascar had 2 regular dvd's inside, the bluray was replaced with another regular one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for kids","review":"The Movie Madagascar is terrible for children.

Much of the movie has adult oriented jokes and scene reproductions from older adult movies that kids simply just wouldn't get (For example; drug induced hallucinations). For kids it offers cartoons acting silly and has questionable entertainment value and certainly little real educational or learning value.I as an adult give it three stars as i rather enjoy lemurs calling other animals \\"Pansies\\" and the penguins are very funny but for kids it is one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"honest","review":"The worst cartoon I ever seen in my whole life.

Unfortunately, the party is crashed by meat eating cat-like creatures.The only animal that I really liked was the psychedelic zebra. The hippo has a lovely voice, without a body to match. The psychedelic trips the lion took was cool too.Yet, the animals, like Jews escaping slavery with Moses long for the fleshpots of NYC.Loved the animation, laughed a few times but found the movie scary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OOOOOOOOMaGOD.","review":"Madagascar pretty much SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This movie provides a lot of enjoyment with more jokes perhaps that adults would laugh at than the kids. I can't say that for sure, since I watched it by myself....but I sure got my share of laughsThe main thing is that all the characters, including supporting ones, are likable and funny in their own way. Every character is quite different.

Animation is just OK. The lemur and penquin characters are relatively funny, but all the main characters just aren't.

But it's a kids' movie, you *know* it's going to all work out in the end.The game on the dvd is fun for kids, and helping the penquins \\"crack the code\\" was engaging, though a little frustrating even for an adult. I am sure that some kids would give up on it. I don't think we even found all the letters, just the first few and made a good guess.The extras are interesting, though mostly, I just got the dvd to be able to watch the movie when I want to.

He's the star of Central Park's Zoo, merchandising and all.When Marty gets the bright idea to escape to the wild--in CT--his pals run out to find him. The plan backfires when they get caught and shipped out to Africa.What ensues is a series of part madcap and part philosophical adventure, giving fresh meaning to \\"the grass is greener on the other side.\\" Kids will enjoy the film while learning that the things you wish you had aren't always what you want.The computer animated graphics are nicely done, including a fun, whimsical piece when Alex gets tranquilized at one point.It's not the greatest film ever made, but it certainly is worth getting for kids of kindergarten age and up. Younger children may enjoy it, too, for the animal escapades.-C.W."},{"rating":"1","title":"discs don't play","review":"I would like to watch this movie, but the discs don't work. I first bought the Madagascar (Widescreen) DVD. Two different computers and two different DVD media software programs refused to play the disc. I waited a long time and got the Blu-Ray version, which refuses to play on a laptop purchased just last November 2010. The movie is not available on Amazon's video on demand or on iTunes. End result: I didn't get to see it at the theater and don't have more than basic cable. I've now bought two non-working discs. I guess I'll have to wait for it on iTunes or find a friend who has it, because I don't want to be fooled a third time into paying for another disc.Sure, the movie may be great, but I'll never know, because neither the DVD nor the Blu-Ray will play. I feel like I've been robbed twice. I was looking forward to a fun romp of a movie. Maybe if it ever comes on iTunes I can rent it. Bah."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I don't know what everyone else see's in this movie but I failed to see anything funny in it. First of all a lot of the humor is way over a little kids head. They wouldn't have the slightest idea what they were talking about. It's like they wanted to make it for the adults to laugh at and forget about the kids. Isn't this a kids movie??? Also it has an incredibly slow start. The first 30 min. of the movie are very boring to say the least, most kids would have already lost interst in this movie before it ever picks up speed. Right when you think things are going to get going with the music and dancing, it stops! Way to much dialoge for little kids and not enough action and music to carry the movie through.

The writing was horrible!! There was only one laugh for me in the entire film which had something to do with wiping...that always makes you feel good to get one low brow laugh in. haha Ben Stiller in particular was a stand out for his poor voice performance. This guy's career has officially crashed and it's time for him to go away. Everyone involved here was horrible, though. Jada Pinkett, David Schwimmer, Chris Rock, Cedric the Entertainer, the list goes on and everyone deserves to be mentioned for their pathetic decisions to be a part of this mess.

The movie was interesting enough to keep her attention and contained enough adult humor to make watching it over and over and over and over again a bit less mundane. The story of four NYC zoo animals running away and ending up in Madagascar is hilarious and the music is very catchy. We \\"move it, move it\\" all the time in our house now.

This is fun for the whole family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughs, incredible animation, and is a nice story of friendship","review":"From the creators of Shrek, Madagascar is a fun movie for all ages to enjoy.

Led by their friends, aided by a wacky group of penguins, they set forth to return to their roots in Africa. After their ship wrecks, the animals find themselves on Madagascar and are befriended by a fun-filled group of lemurs.

I suppose that \\"cracker lackin\\" means \\"a place without white people,\\" because of the context that it is used in. Because of its repeated use, I have deducted three stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Sub-Par Dreamworks Production","review":"It's a shame this movie was below average. The animation was very good. Like Shark Tale, it had it's moments, but it didn't work as a movie. Dreamworks seems to have the problem to accommodate the actors with the characters instead of the other way around. Did the zebra really have to look like Chris Rock? Please. Ben Stiller was uninspired as was Ross from FRIENDS. Again Like Shark Tale, the actors ruined the movie. The story had potential but ultimately fell flat. The only good Dreamworks production was Shrek Two.I know there is always the comparison between Dreamworks and Pixar but Pixar is by far the better company. Toy Story, Toy Story 2, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Monsters, Inc. all have two things going for it: imagination & great story telling.

It shakes and it turns on lights either with a pulse or with a steady flow. A high pitch sound is also an option.However, the snooze time is fixed at 9 minutes and not adjustable. And sometimes the LED display flickers randomly (power surge?). Sometimes the vibrator gets warm after lots of snoozes. Moreover, only one alarm time can be set and no dual alarm times are allowed. This was the only one that I know that can wake you up by both light and vibration.All in all, the alarm clock does what it's supposed to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent bed shaker!","review":"I bought this alarm clock because my upstairs neighbor doesn't care about home-training her children.

Bought one of the original black models (looks like this one , but black). It worked beautifully for well over 10 years. By that time , the set buttons were almost waorn out and the alarm pulse signal went from the original one to one with short intervals. Ordered a new one like the above from the company. The unit that arrived worked fine for a few days , then the alarm failed. The alarm never went off when set , but the test button worked fine. Problem with the alarm itself. Returned it and a new one was sent (they said the returned one was working fine). New one did the same thing. Went through that cycle several times. They finally sent one of the newer ones with the large display. Hopefully , that one will work!So , while the product is a great idea , there are definite bugs to be worked out.

As far as it goes, the bed shaker worked pretty well... for about 6 months. That's when it sh@t the bed (pun intended). After that happened I just had a very expensive alarm!As an alarm, this isn't that good. The buttons are all mixed in with each other and it is pretty easy to hit the snooze and the off buttons at the same time. Also, they must be using automotive relays to control the vibrator and the outlet for the light. The noise from the relay opening and closing is enough to wake me up sometimes. That's good of course, but it worries me when I hear an electrical device making loud sounds that sound like electricity arcing.BTW, I thought of buying a new bed shaker, but they want more for the shaker than they want for some of the alarms that come with shakers. Go figure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Receiver did not work","review":"We bought this alarm clock to work with a baby monitor signaller made by the same company. When we plugged both of them and turned the receiver function on the clock went crazy: flashing lights, shaking bed, etc. It turns out that \\"sometimes\\" there is another signal in the houses electrical system that can interfere with the receiver. The Sonic Alert website said we could send it in and get them adjusted to another at a cost of $5 each plus $7 shipping. We did that, and now when we turn the receiver on it just vibrates and buzzes even if the signaller isn't plugged in.Otherwise, it's an ugly alarm clock. The vibrating puck doesn't wake my wife up and the light feature gets \\"stuck\\" sometimes.Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good investment","review":"I sleep like a rock and Ive tried at least 5 other alarm clocks none of which seemed to do the trick. I even have the clocky alarm clock that rolls around but still I managed to snooze through everything. The reason this works for me is the bed shaker. Even though it doesn't actually \\"shake\\" the bed the vibrations are enough to jolt me awake in the morning. I think its a good product and it feels sturdy, the display is bright and easy to read but there's no brightness adjustment for it. Also the operation can be a little confusing so I have to double check each night to make sure both the sound and vibration are on. I don't use the lamp outlet but I can see how that would be helpful. It is very loud if turned up all the way, so loud it hurts my ears when jacked up, but that's easily adjustable. I still set clocky and my phone as backups but so far I haven't been late to work since getting this I would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost good","review":"A lot about the history of zoos and their evolving design- but not much else.

One part is true: Four ill-prepared and reckless climbers got kidnapped. The rest of the story is based on their version. Another version puts it this way: They got kidnapped, the kidnappers were not prepared to babysit four climbers and did not have enough food or water for everyone. They got no support from local villagers so they let the climbers go. End of Story.The climbers say they pushed a kidnapper to his death and then ran the equivalent of a marathon across mountainous terrain with no food or water, after having had no food or water for days.... not likely.

I like listening to this while dining Japanese, because it would be a great fit. This one will outshine most music used at restaurants cause they mostly sound just uninspiring to me.

Each of the games contains miniatures decided by decisive attacks on the King's Field (f7/f2, g7/g2, h7/h2, f6/f3, g6/g3, h6/h3), whether the king is castled or not. You can basically follow these without a chess set and sometimes I like to open this book and \\"do\\" some of these in my head as an attacking refresher. I have some of Convekta's software (CT Art, etc) but those compendia have more varied problems and with this section of L. Polgar's book, I can focus in on kingside attacking practice.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book to improve your game","review":"The book is by Polgar, and the introduction is by Pandolfini, a well known chess figure and pedagogue. Need I say more?The 5334 puzzles range in difficulty from mate in x (for values of x between 1 and 3), to endgame puzzles and minigame scenarios.

It's not funny, not interesting, not entertaining, nor does it offer any real point. These \\"books\\" will probably be the sort of thing you give as a joke birthday/retirement gift, or \\"collect\\" yourself, just to have a \\"set,\\" thinking they might be \\"worth something\\" or \\"meaningful\\" someday. I kept hoping for the book to go from a dwaddle to a trot, but it was the same yawn.

Get that and skip this.I downloaded the sample to my kindle first- the introduction was a witty description of the self-help industry and the treadmill of self improvement. What I failed to understand was that was not merely an introduction to the topic, that was the book. I kept turning the pages waiting for an actual sociological discussion of sloth and was utterly dissapointed. This was a similar experience to the discomfort and annoyance one feels when a Saturday night live sketch goes on way too long, completely killing any initial humor by beating the dead no longer funny horse.Waste of money. I suppose the intent may have been to repulse me with the product of laziness, to show what sloth truly is. It worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassing both for the author and the readers.","review":"I hope someone responsible for accepting Ms. Wasserstein manuscript for publication had more good sense or maybe courage to spell the facts to the author: it's horribly unfunny and mildly disgusting.It begs for the laughs so pathetically, it wants to be liked so desperately one is tempted to go on, not to insult the lady by quitting after the first 10-12 pages. After all the book is tiny, you can read it in a couple hours.But I could not finish it. Some books are just not to be published, but if they ARE published everyone can see it was a bad mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I read this work after I read Gluttony which was sharp and acute. This work by Wasserstein by contrast is sort of like the subject she chose 'sloth', that is to say sloppy and without effort. This work is not funny, has tired joke themes from some of her other work, sags, is inert, not sparkling. Contrast with Hunter Thompson, a sharp eyed and sharp minded satirist. Or with Mencken.

Sometimes I can get it to work by unplugging and replugging the USB jack.I've posted this problem on several forums, and everyone seems to agree it's the drivers at fault.I've always had success with Creative's sound cards before this but am now shopping for another external card.I've tried to get support from Creative for several months, but to date they have never even responded to my numerous inquiries via their online tech suport and forums.Because of this, I have decided to never buy another of their products of any kind, if an acceptable substitute is available."},{"rating":"1","title":"801 locust ave apt 403 fairmont,wv","review":"I have purchased a sound card from Creative Type by Amazon did not come the disk and cable I could not use it and i send messages to the seller did not return it and now I'm uncomfortable"},{"rating":"1","title":"noise problem","review":"It can create 'crackling and popping' noise when used with some nVidia boards.

I have muddled about and can get there with third party programs but it is messy. The included software is also clunky and dis-coordinated.Hardware-wise, the unit is adequate although the gain available is too low and always maxed out during recordings.For the few who need multi-channel sound from a laptop, maybe it works OK, but for everyone else... get a real, internal sound card for your PC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice cleanup, with a catch","review":"I bought this to clean up the hiss that comes out of my laptop when I connect it to my Yamaha 5.1 reciever.

Unfortunately, while the initial plot is very promising (I loved Tess's dare to the other debs), the romance between the characters is sappy and only just this side of believable. Further, the supporting characters are weak. They are poorly developed, shallow copies of the kinds of characters that many romance authors use to enhance their stories. \\"Marriage in Haste\\" had a lot of promise in the beginning, but was terribly trite in the end.

Even if you manage to get the clip open far enough to hold a book, it will not hold it for long before collapsing."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"The phrase you get what you pay for is very appropriate when it comes to this product. While it holds papers okay. It frequently falls apart and is flimsy. It does not hold books well, the clip on top does little to nothing to hold things in place, and it only has one true place in which to keep it set in place as the other setting have no secure slot to prevent to small slates from sliding out. I would recommend spending extra to get a decent one if you really use it a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak","review":"To light for texts books, when one turns the page the book holder topples-over.

It's difficult to move the pages due to the bottom lip, the clip is insufficient and both snag pages when turning, its to light, and it's not wide enough for most books. It's reasonable for papers. I miss a line guide. Its best feature is that its adjustable in height and angle. Its okay but there are better products out there but you will probably pay a bit more for them. This was my first holder.

I have not needed it to prop up books, so I cannot comment on its abilities in that area.This copy holder does not move well. My desk is small and I move quickly from project to project. It would be helpful if I could shift the copy holder without having to worry that it is going to collapse. Since the stand does not click into hold the copy holder upright, if I am not careful and try to move it - or heaven forbid, bump it - it collapses.The end of the world? Oh, no. And it does what I need it to do - hold papers for transcription. I do wish I had spent a little more money for a better quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited usefulness","review":"This book and document holder has limited usefulness for both. The height adjustment does not stay up on its own very well and it cannot hold a document over 6 inches in height unless extended. Magazines and periodicals of any thickness will not do very well since it will not support their weight. Since the top clip is only good for something up to 1/2 inch thick and the bottom does not retain well it has limited usefulness for books of any thickness or binding stiffness. The stand does not snap into place so any disturbance will likely cause it to collapse. Pass on this one. I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor construction","review":"I was so hoping I would like this. I liked that you could raise the top part so I could raise the papers up to eye level - but the angle adjustment is horrible, It DOESN'T LOCK INTO PLACE!!!!!! Once you set it up at the angle you want.....if you touch it - it will collapse!!! Talk about frustrating. That is the most ridiculous design ever. Why doesn't it lock into place? Don't you usually flip through papers you might have on a stand or flip through pages in a book on a stand? The slightest touch makes it collapse. Needless to say I returned it and bought the Fellowes Booklift Copyholder #21100...........much better and it folds flat when you're not using it.

I made her a binder full of page protectors holding pictures and cards from loved ones. I chose this item because I could adjust it down for her bible and up for her binder. The good thing is that it is easy to turn the pages. The problem lies in the adjustable angle in the back. It does not snap or lock into place. My relative has a shaky arm and often must make several attempts to reach the page to turn it. Unfortunately, she winds up knocking it over more often that turning the page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a sturdy product","review":"This is not a sturdy product. It's made of very lightweight plastic and the design isn't particularly good. It's easy to collapse it accidentally. I have used it for paper but I wouldn't try to use it for a book. Mine arrived minus the clip at the top because the packaging was poor. On the plus side, the footprint is small -- doesn't take up a lot of room on the desk.

To waste even more time it even has several interviews (all in Khmer) about how difficult it was to farm under the Lon Nol Goverment...blah blah blah..

It makes it look like you are getting a CD - book combination, but that is not so. That being said, the price for just the CD set is very high, as the materials are really not sufficient for standalone use. The speakers on the CD speak relatively quickly for beginners, and the CD doesn't offer enough repetition for it to sink in. As a learning method, I don't think it is very functional. It is useful for hearing pronunciation, but the teaching method is inferior to that of say, Pimsleur or the like. I even found the 'Easy Khmer Rhythms' audio book ($6 on audible), to be more useful as an absolute intro tool. They do more repetition and definition of the words so it is easier to learn the terms and familiarize with pronunciation. Overall, I would not recommend using this CD set in isolation. If you purchase the additional book too, (doubling the price) it might be a more useful series, but I have not done that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what we needed","review":"My husband and I purchased these tapes as we are moving to Camodia soon and wanted an overview of the language, which we need to learn.Unfortunately, we found the tapes to be quite useless without a workbook or anything to follow along with.

Hard to argue with the simplistic design and the sultry chrome- Works great and provides a wind proof flame- New notched insert provides a tighter fit meaning the fuel will evaporate slower- Unbeatable lifetime warrantyCon's:- Build quality does not appear as good as it was a few years ago, compared to my older models- Zippo branding at the bottom of the case isn't stamped, it's flat.

Goo Gone couldn't even begin to touch it. Eventually I tried WD40 with a lot of elbow grease and was finally able to completely dissolved this incredibly tuff glue. A Word of WARNING: be very careful of what you place your lighter on when scrubbing off the sticky unsightly glue mark.

I HIGHLY recommend these as a low-cost easy to use security device!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job...but has no delayed stop....","review":"This little door stop siren does go ON when pressed, but then it goes right off if you back the door off it. I would prefer a 30 second delay so that it stays on if someone pushes the door open, to scare them away, even if they pull the door closed again.Note there is also an off switch, so that you can turn the unit off anytime...which also keeps it from making noise while you are carrying it in your suitcase.Another small improvement would be to make the screw that holds the battery door cover a captive screw. It's actually not critical but is a simple improvement.For a few bucks, its worth the price. Note it needs 1 9V battery...and says that should last a year. I suggest you remove the battery if you are not going to use the door stopper for weeks or months, since that will prevent leakage and make it last for many many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"This door alarm will get every bodies attention!","review":"This door alarm has great quality.

She has it on laminate flooring and I suggested she place a carpet sample or mat under it but she said she does not have a problem with it on the floor as is. She also uses it in her hotel room when she travels. Will be purchasing more for other doors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Security on a budget","review":"I travel for work, so having this door stop allows me a sense of security that otherwise I would not have. The alarm is very annoying so hopefully, in the event it was triggered, it would be enough to awaken even fairly deep sleepers.My own issue with the unit is that you need a screwdriver to insert and remove the battery. I remove the battery when I travel so that there is no way for the on off switch to be activated by accident en route.Otherwise, good value and small enough to pack and take each trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing little gadget","review":"These little alarms are great, you can't believe how loud they are. I find it reassuring that I'd know if somebody tried to open the door while I was asleep. I don't expect them to keep out someone who was really determined to get in, but they would sure as heck advertise that they were trying to do it, and that's all I ask. They are good quality and easy to set up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"These are a cool idea. However, there are 2 flaws in the design. One, the ramp device does not meet the floor flush. There is basically a gap. My front door is very close to the floor so it would hit this unit too low and wouldn't press the ramp down (which is what initiates the alarm). Also, the device has rubber on the bottom to hold it in place via friction but it isn't grippy enough for my hardwoods so after the doors makes contact with the ramp too low, the unit just gets pushed back out of the way for a total fail. I think it would work great if you had a door with sufficient clearance so that it hits the unit high enough to depress the ramp AND if you have carpet so that the rubber can grip better. I have neither so this did not work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Door stop alarms","review":"The Ge Smart Home Door Stop Alarm works great but I have a very large home with doors in the basement that I couldn't set the alarm on. The doors open up to a couple of stairs and there is no flat area to place the alarm. I also have a dog that kept setting them off. Otherwise I recommend them highly if you have a small home or apartment and no dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work great","review":"Bought one for each of my adult daughters to use while traveling.

The sound it makes is more than loud enough to wake everyone in a medium to large home as well as close neighbors. It stays solid on the floor and doesn't slide when the door opens into it. We plan to take it on vacations with us as well throughout Europe. I definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud and effective","review":"Makes a loud noise; would be heard throughout my house and would wake me if I was sleeping.

I had bought an InterDesign squeegee at Target a couple of years ago and loved it's clean and sleek design. I wanted to replace it but they no longer carried it. I thought this one on Amazon was the same, but the quality clearly isn't. It is cheaply made and the junction where the blade meets with the plastic looks like it was glued by a first grader. Also, the suction cup is part of the squeegee handle, something I didn't notice when I bought it. So instead of being able to put the squeegee on a suction cup with a hook, you have to pull the suction cup off of the wall every time you use it. Horrible design and quality. What a waste of $$!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only buy if you are handy with tools","review":"I would have given this product 5 stars if I had not needed to correct some manufacturing defects. First, I used an electric drill in order to make the swivel holes a hair larger because the swivel arm would not swivel easily. Next, the line guide does not slide up and down because the plastic clips are holding it much too firmly. You will need to shave part of the clips away with your drill using a small drill bit. Finally, one plastic \\"clip-on\\" piece and one plastic \\"press-in\\" piece, at opposite ends of the swivel arm, require gluing before attaching, a fact not specified or addressed by the manufacturer. I used Gorilla Glue which worked very well. Now I love it, but are you ready, willing and able to do the modification?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious & often boring read","review":"This was intended for the eyes of German army's general staff and not for mass market paperback.

A must for anyone interested in tactics and the WWII German military."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed, but riveting","review":"(A) The author's insistance on listing every unit in every action, armoured or not, started to drone on like \\"the begats\\" in the Old Testament, but this cannot detract from the compelling story. I found the descriptions of events told from the point of view of both sides particularly valuable.(B) The maps provided might be reprints of the orginal edition's, for all I know -- but they are worthless. One cannot read much of the detail and they do not help illustrate what happen in the battles depicted. If this is what the German army used, it's a wonder they didn't attack Sweden by mistake! Keep a good atlas or detailed map of France at chairside instead.(C) I am only halfway through, three days into reading, and the binding is ALREADY falling apart.

The part right before the end is a little pat for my taste, but the ending itself makes up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thinly veiled attempt to legitimize Wiccan religion.","review":"It struck me as strange that the author of the Clifford series would write a book attempting to 'sell' witchcraft to children, but I suppose it is a reflection of his philosophical viewpoint. Many will find this little book to be inappropriate for those with a Judeo-Christian ethic since it portrays witchcraft as 'just another socially-acceptable' philosophy. The cute little witch seems like such a likeable character, not at all an enemy of truth.

Consequently there are almost no theatrics to the concert. I don't see that as a bad thing but I guess the video producers did, so yeah, there's a lot of unnecessary video junk mixed in.

It contains some awful effects on every song. The feel of this being an actual concert video is completely lost due to these effects and the blank space between each song. Because of the effects, you have to squint to see the band members, and when you see them, they look bored. They look like they don't even want to be there because they might be able to forsee the outcome of the video they're recording. Hopefully they'll never screw up future concert DVDs like this. Avoid this one at all costs! If you want a recent show on DVD, get House Of Yes instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't wate your money!!","review":"Is there any danger in just showing us the show \\"LIVE\\" ??

Video Bad.","review":"The sound quality and overall performance are unparalleled, that is why I (generously) give this DVD two stars, however...I got the impression that half the film shot during the show was somehow lost and they tried to make up for it with interspersed video clips that are nothing short of ridiculous.Furthermore,The step-motion videography is extremely annoying,If Steve Howe is performing a solo, don't show me Chris, or a flag, or water, or the ceiling, or anything else,It is obvious (and distracting) that the audio and video are out of sync through most of the show, however, in some cases, its apparent that the audio and video are combined from two completely different performances. This is just plain insulting.I dropped [money] on this and will likely never watch it again. I am a big yes fan going back to the mid-seventies but this is a big disapointment.I would rather watch a third generation VHS tape of YesShows than sit through this one again"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with all these cheesey effects?","review":"I don't know what they were thinking when they decided how they wanted this video to come out. If it were filmed normally without these awful, annoying effects, this video would get 5 stars from me. The songs are good, the sound is good, the picture [stinks]. It really makes it hard to watch. After years of waiting for this video to come out, I was expecting something a lot better. I recommend the House Of Yes video instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes - Keys to Ascension","review":"Let me start by saying, that I've been a Yes fan for over 25 years but I have to admit, that I was very disappointed with new Yes DVD. My first impression was - how could such a highly professional band as Yes hire amateurs to film their concert? And I'm not talking about sound and selections, but video! The video is absolutely horrible: angles the band members were shot, annoying and absolutely unnecessary MTV-ish nature clips, video editing. If you plan to own at least 1 Yes DVD it should be either 'House of Yes' or 'Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, Howe. An Evening Of Yes Music Plus' and if you you still want 'Keys to Acsension' go buy double CD and enjoy live concert plus studio recordings not included on any other CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did YES even watch this before allowing the release?","review":"While this DVD boasts a stellar songlist, the abysmal failure to synchronize the audio and video totally wrecks what could have been a solid effort. What were they thinking when they released this DVD? Did anyone in either Production or the band itself bother to watch this? Why does Alan White hit a snare and then we hear it a second later? This is horrible. For a band that has more raw talent than nearly anything released today, this is a disgrace. I didn't even mind the visual effects. In fact, I liked what they did for Starship Trooper. But how in the world could they put this to market with such an obvious flaw. Anyone with a computer and music software understands how simple it is to fix a minor adjustment like time-sync. Wow. I hope they admit to this error and offer a replacement to any fan that invested in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's shame, really...","review":"....that someone can so completely screw up an opportunity to record a concert from this classic lineup playing this classic material. I've been a fan of Yes for 30 years and was really intrigued by this DVD when I saw it. I should have read the reviews. Tacky video sequences repeatedly dwarf one of the greatest performing bands in the world. Segments edited into some songs appear to be from completely different pieces.

What a HUGE Bummer this turned out to be.1st, I must say that this idea could have been the most amazing concert ever filmed if they had just let it be an honest performance. Instead they doctored up the sound with noticeably thick overdubs on the vocals and occasional repair jobs on certain passages and solo's, then coupled with the absolute out of synch footage you wonder if it was even a real concert. They filmed 2 shows I believe and then edited them into one not so grand show complete with the Cheeziest effects and double exposures you have ever seen. There are times when Wakeman and Howe are soloing and the footage you are seeing is not even from the same song.As I said earlier this could have been great if they would just give us a show in this kind of setting with no effects and no doctoring up.

There are wonderful renditions of Awaken, The Revealing Science Of God and America. Much better than previous live albums. The problem with the CD versions was that the Live material could have fit on two CDs and the studio material could have fit on one CD. Instead of a three CD set, we had to buy two (2) double CD sets. Here now you get the entire live concert on one DVD. This alone makes it a worthy purchase. Some people are bored with professional musicians doing their thing. For others, the only important thing is the music itself. Count this reviewer among the latter group. Don't need the smoke and mirrors taking attention away from the music. That said, Yes did do a fine stage performance to accompany the music. These musicians are at the top of their game and this concert shows their proficiency. They are by no means just strumming a chord for an entire song. Sit back and enjoy the trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money or time on this one.","review":"I love Yes but this product is horrible. All of the bad reviews are true, but the overuse/misuse of graphic effects is in no way my biggest complaint. The main problem is that the video isn't properly syncronized to the audio. It's downright painful watching Steve Howe play when the audio is just a hair off or at times completely wrong. Bottom line is that I'll probably never watch this one again. If anyone knows how to contact the producer of this schlock please let me know as I'd love to tell them how I feel. Boycott this one folks.

You like the idea of some of the lyrics fading in for you to read as they are sung, so that you really pay attention to what those Yes lyrics are like.4.

Combinging the sexual honesty and sonic intelligence of early Pretenders with the girlish insecurity and complex honesty of Tanya Donnelly, she soars above a sea of expertly intertwined guitars, distorted and exhilarating. This is insightful, sexually honest, and original yet instantly accessible listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mixed bag","review":"If you are familiar with Bill Frisell's work, you will know what I mean by \\"mixed bag\\". This album has Frisell's signature 'jazz with a slight country twang' tone, plus everything from latin to rag to rock to free improv. The ensemble is fantastic, based around Frisell's regular trio of the time, Joey Baron on drums and Kermit Driscoll on bass. He augments this with clarinettist Don Byron, alto saxophonist Billy Drewes and trombonist Curtis Fowlkes. All in all an excellent work, highlights including Frisell standards \\"Rag\\", \\"Amarillo Barbados\\" and \\"Resistor\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT as featured in the film!","review":"This is not the theme song that plays over the opening credits for the film.

When I first heard the \\"rock\\" version of this song a month before the movie came out it caught me off guard, but eventually grew on me to the point where I listened to it on my ipod over 700 times!!! (itunes counter) So anyway, then other versions of the song came out. The music videos version is the POP version which in my opinion is better than the ROCK version. Then when I saw Casino Royale during the title sequence, it was another version, the FILM version which was better than any other previously released version. Then a few weeks after it was announced that the single would be released. On the cover it says \\"AS FEATURED IN THE MOTION PICTURE CASINO ROYALE\\" but DONT BE FOOLED!!!

Yes, Casino Royale is a different kind of Bond film; edgier, grittier and in some ways, even better, but this music adds nothing to the mix. It seems gray, even faceless, with none of the 'setting introduction' or character usually invoked by an opening theme. The other issue is how the artist did not want it included on the movie soundtrack, so it would have to be bought separately. Another indication that it may not belong in the Bond library?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter--Buy another brand!","review":"Yes, the single-serve packets are nice.

Any Cisco press book has much more useful info than this \\"study guide\\".

Although hailed as being similiar to their self-titled album released shortly before, \\"Strange Days\\" marked a change for The Doors and most importantly, Jim Morrison. Although still heavily involved in the psychedelic scene of the late 60's, The Doors expanded and incororated newer ideas into their music. I feel \\"Strange Days\\" is an extremely important album and one of thier best, if not their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"..what we'd hoped for from this band.\\"","review":"Jimbo nearly made himself into a real poet on this one. None of that silly Oedipal stuff from the debut album & none of the bullcrap love songs with horns that sunk later LPs. The two \\"Strange\\" songs are what we'd hoped for from this band. \\"My Eyes Have Seen You,\\" \\"Moonlight Mile\\" & \\"You're Lost Little Girl\\" are first rate album cuts. \\"When the Music's Over\\" is more interesting lyrically & musically than \\"The End,\\" based so it seems on a riff from \\"Soul Kitchen.\\" The slackers who think Morrison was an 80 proof literary genius can keep \\"Horse Latitudes.\\" I prefer \\"Strange Days\\" as a rock & roll album, more or less. Fun cover pic, too.Bob Rixon, WFMU-FM"},{"rating":"2","title":"The 2nd one is a masterful follow-up to a masterpiece!","review":"Strange Days is the last of the 'old Doors' sound that was so capitivating on the debut album. After Strange Days, fame and fortune permeated the band and their sound changed. They became more top 40. It's no wonder Morrison got sick of the whole thing. A little of the magic was recaptured on L.A.

When The Music's Over is basically the tune to Soul Kitchen. The only feeling this album gave me was one of sorrow when I realized that I had shelled out good money for this piece of crap. The Doors have discarded their distant, icy sound which was featured throughout the Debut. Morrison's lyrics are mediocre and a distant memory from his brilliance on the first album. Jim Morrison did'nt die in 1971, he died when this album came out.For an album titled Strange Days it is surprisingly normal."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened????","review":"This is a dissappointing follow up indeed. About as dissapointing at the follow up to Katrina and the Waves follow up to thier monster hit debut. The Doors just released this one too soon I feel. The title cut is somewhat decent, but \\"You're lost little girl\\" had a good intro, but they used a key change where there shouldn't have been one, \\"Love Me 2x's\\" , and \\"People Are Strange\\" have been overplayed, so I know where they stand. \\"Moonlight Drive\\", and \\"Horse Lattitudes\\" pretty much save this album from being completely panned by me. \\"Horse Lattitudes\\" is probably one of the best poems ever written, but when surrounded by weaker material it's going to get lost in the shuffle. \\"When The Music's Over\\" lacks the power and potency of \\"The End\\", and \\"Unhappy Girl\\" is annoying with the circus organ. This was obviously a rush job."},{"rating":"2","title":"They messed up the lead-off track!!","review":"Has anyone cared to comment on the \\"strange\\" noises that pop up in the song \\"Strange Days\\"? It's even worse on the 1999 remaster! As if they tried to fix a somehow-botched master tape but made it worse. Truly unforgiveable. The rest of the songs on the CD came out fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"ITS DARK, DEPPRESSING, AND JUST PLAIN AWESOME","review":"Doors part two. I've reveiwed all the studio albums this morning and I saved this one for last because, well, it's the most thought provoking of the bunch.My title should say it all. This is way darker than the first album and darker than any of the rest. It rocks and is definatley somewhere in my top 25 albums. (My top fives got DOORS ONE, top tens got LA WOMAN and top 15 got MORRISON HOTEL.)I could write a thousand pages on this and probably deep anylyze the hell out of every song but I won't. None of us got the time for that BUT like all other DOORS this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophomore effort proves Doors legacy in rock history","review":"If you look at the copyrights on the songs, most of these were written about the same time as their debut album, The Doors. A casual fan might say that the later album had all the hits, but a true Door's purist will most definitely concede \\"Strange Days\\" as being close to perfection. Overall this album will mesmerize you with the dark, gloomy, and brilliant lyrics of Jim Morrison. Starting with the ethereal \\"Strange Days,\\" Morrison's vocals shine on \\"Moonlight Drive,\\" the minor hit \\"Love Me Two Times,\\" and the eerie \\"You're Lost Little Girl\\", one of Ray Manzarek's favorites (See Disk 4 of The Doors Box Set). Not to be out gunned by \\"The End\\" on the previous album, \\"Strange Days\\" ends with the eleven-minute \\"When the Music's Over\\", the often featured closing song in many Doors live shows. If you even partially like the Doors debut album, \\"Strange Days\\" is a required follow up."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC","review":"I love The Doors; I love their music; I love this album(CD). I can listen to this over and over again without getting tired of it. Robby Krieger's talented guitar solos are prominent in most songs (You're Lost Little Girl, When The Music's Over, Moonlight Drive) and what I think makes this CD great. Morrison's vocals are right on target and haven't lost their edge yet as in later albums. A great follow-up to their unbelievably astounding debut album. A must-have for all Doors fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the best \\"40th Anniversary Mix\\"","review":"This is the 40th Anniversary mix that gets it just right. It expands the sonic range of the songs without adding, subtracting or altering the original content or tone. The only other one that comes close to this is The Soft Parade. The drums of \\"Strange Days\\" sound great. \\"Horse Latitudes\\" sounds powerful and scary. The peaks and valleys of \\"When The Music's Over\\" are thrilling. If you like Strange Days you will be thrilled by this version even if you have the excellent 1999 remaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Album for the Times","review":"This in my opinion, is the Doors greatest achievement. However it is hard to love any one of their albums anymore than the other. So i'm not gonna call it my favourite, they all are timeless, and breathtaking, but this album, i think, is not only mesmerizing but its finale \\"when the musics over\\" describes brilliantly the shape of Mother Earth is in today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, James, I think I will take that moonlight drive!","review":"Now how about this? It didn't have any big singles, it seemed to just sort of slink past audiences (especially in comparison to the success of their debut), and to this day it's regarded as a good but not great effort. I disagree. This record is so strange, so trippy, so psychedelic, so timelessly dated (!), that, like a moonlit trance, it's hard not to get sucked in. On top of that, the songs are well-constructed, impeccably performed, and Morrison's lyrics seem to be not only pointed but meaningful and even--god bless you, James Morrison--poetic. It loses a lot of steam on Side Two, thanks to the kitschy \\"People Are Strange\\" (Echo & the Bunnymen made it seem better, since everything was worse in the Eighties), and \\"Horse Latitudes\\" on Side One is completely unnecessary. Otherwise, start to finish--mostly--this one's a blast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album","review":"This is my second favorite Doors album. My favorite is their debut album \\"The Doors\\". Some of the songs I really like on this CD are \\"Strange Days\\", \\"Love Me Two Times\\", \\"People Are Strange\\", and \\"When The Music's Over\\".

Sadly, though, he lived long enough to see this book published.Humphrey Carpenter, the son of an Anglican bishop, and the author of several well-received books on JRR Tolkien and the Inklings, did not live up to his previous standards in this volume, and did, in the opinion of this reviewer, seriously strain the bounds of journalistic ethics, confidentiality, and certainly good taste.This book needs to be set in strong contrast with scholarly works about the life and ministry of Lord Runcie, and should not be considered an accurate or clear picture of the late archbishop.For a better picture of Lord Runcie, read Adrian Hastings biography, and the archbishop's own sermons."},{"rating":"1","title":"disgusting","review":"\\"Brazillian\\" refers to waxing one's \\"other\\" hair... sometimes crudely referred to as a \\"bush.\\" This is equating the leader of the free world with someone's not-so-public hair.

He does not star in this production, he ruins it. CAVEAT EMPTOR! Beware of this DVD at all costs. Although Waltraud Meier is wonderful, almost wonderful enough to buy this DVD for - almost - I can never watch this DVD again after the first time because Kollo is so bad and so ever-present.

The costumes and setting are too modern in my taste. René Kollo who plays the part of Tannheuser is too old and way too much vibrato in his singing. The opening scene is confusing and bewildering. It seems as if David Alden had the idea of being strange for no other reason than to shock his audience. I am huge fan of Wagner and this production is a travesty. Zubin Mehta the conductor simply does not understand Wagner. Listening to someone like Von Karajan conduct Wagner, you feel the passion and emotions. Listening to this production you feel nothing. A huge disappointment! Not recommended. 2/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close to disastrous...","review":"I bought it because of the raves about Secunde. She and Kollo make Trannhauser the Mom and Dad of this opera, and frumpy, at that. Elizabeth should be glowing and her voice reflecting that. As for Kollo, he had no business singing Tannhauser with his vocal spread and wobble. To me, he was an embarrasment. Meier is wonderful -- not a pretty voice, but solid and exciting; the small item of her beauty doesn't go unnoticed, either.The production/set is so depressing, I'm going to think twice before I complain about the VHS from the Met, although I'm not bowled over with Casilly or Marton.

The man is a professional story-teller, and the telling of his simple tales is both light and profound. The secret, as he said, is in the telling of a story that has multiple layers of meaning. Obviously, this reviewer didn't even attempt to get past the first layer. I found it to be rich in depth and meaning.

I'd stay in the room for practically hours just playing the Doors over and over again, perfecting my pool-playing skills! The debut album was one of my favorites as a child, and I still consider it a special listen. Talk about an album that sounds nothing like what other bands were doing at the time. I think that's what grabbed me the most- the Doors sounded like no one else, and to this day, even though plenty of imitators have tried copying their sound, no one has been able to capture the magic of Jim Morrison's vocals and lyrics.

I have heard this music in almost all formats, from the first Elektra pressings through open reel to the audiophile Mobile Fidelity LP to the various CD incarnations. In the late 70s, I also attended a press preview of \\"Apocalypse Now\\" at a 70mm six-track stereo installation in New York City where Coppola had personally checked the sound just before the showing. \\"The End\\" sounds almost a good here at it did that night. I haven't been crazy about all Steve Hoffman's audiophile LP and CD remasterings at DCC, but this one is simply terrific. The sound has a presence and depth you don't hear on the aluminum version, and Morrison's vocals are just lacerating! Highly recommended, and the DCC version of \\"L.A.

But still, I was raised completely on this album, I love it. It stays in my CD player all the time. All of the tracks are completely incredible, and Jim's vocals are amazing. Everyone should listen to this record, just because it's SO good. I love this record so much, I have it on CD, tape AND record, just because it's my favorite. If anyone's thinking about buying this album, they should buy it!

This album has so many different elements that work on it, you can definitely get lost in all of them. Which is how the Doors work. I would check it out, as stated elsewhere, the music isn't really lovey-dovey, it's wielded like a thunderous sword of darkness.

This shocked me though, I didn't think an older band could make such a great album. Pure pyschadelica! It really takes you away to a beautiful place if you allow yourself to just kind of drift into it. \\"Break On Through\\" is pretty good and really rocks out but is a song that I get tired of after a while. \\"Soul Kitchen\\" has great synthesizer and is one that you can just slip into. Contrary to what some people may think, it's not about sex. Its about Jim drifting and a nice lady let him spend the night at her house and he thanked her through the song Soul Kitchen. \\"The Crystal Ship\\" is a nice little ballad that is one of my favorites on this cd. I think it's timeless.Well there you go. Get this cd and I also recommend Strange Days, Morrison Hotel, and In Concert. I havent gotten LA Woman yet so I'll write a review on that one too sometime most likely."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best EVER!","review":"Simply put, one of the best albums ever made, which happens to include one of the greatest songs of all time \\"Light my fire\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"How could anyone not buy this album?","review":"The Doors are the absolute masters of emotional psychedelia. Every song on this CD is brilliant. Standouts include The Crystal Ship and Light My Fire. I could listen to this CD forever. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Terrific Debut From America's Greatest Rock Band","review":"\\"The Doors\\" is what I consider to be the group's best album, and I feel that they were the best rock band to come out of America. Jim Morrison's powerful voice and eerie, imagistic lyrics are backed splendidly by the other three musicians. Ray Manzarek's haunting organ-playing complements Morrison superbly. Robbie Krieger, while perhaps not a great guitarist, nevertheless does justice to the music, especially with his fine slide guitar work on \\"Moonlight Drive\\". John Densmore's drumming also complements Morrison finely in may instances with his rat-a-tat-tat style of playing. This is to put it simply, a splendid album from a superb group. In fact, the little weasel Mick Jagger once publicly criticized the Doors. Well, this overrated little pipsqueak could learn a lot from a fine group like The Doors, who, in my opinion, were light years ahead of this scrawny little twirp and his noisy group, all of whose members presently belong in nursing homes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST for any Doors Fan","review":"The year's 1967. Music is being processed within an inch of life and musicians are coming out onto the scene. Gotta admit it though- none like Jim, John, Ray and Robby. \\"The Doors\\" is an essential for anybody who's looking for a first or second Doors album to purchase. Although this isn't my favorite Doors album, the songs on here are memoriable ones. \\"Light My Fire\\", obviously one of the most famous Doors song, for one thing gives you 7 minutes of enjoyment and vocals that'd make even the dullest person want to dance. \\"Break On Through\\", another Doors favorite, is a song everyone has grown familiar with. \\"Backdoor Man\\", \\"End Of The Night\\", \\"End\\" and \\"I Looked at You\\" are among my favorites on the album.So ditch modern music and stick with artists like The Doors, and go out and by this CD. It'll be one you'll love to have in your CD collection! If you're looking for another Doors album to experience, try \\"L.A Woman\\" or \\"Morrison Hotel\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"She gets high...!","review":"Love this cd..can't stop Playing bREAK ON THROUGH and The End...The Crystal Ship and Light My fire are beautiful songs..love them both.I like the new Doors remasters. They restored the songs Break on through,Backdoor Man and the End especially. These 3 songs were edited on previous editions of CD's and Lp's. I think it was a shame to edit the songs in the first place. But hey..for the young and unitiated Doors fans they get the uncut Doors as it was intended! Loved this CD so much, I bought all 6 of the remasters..The Doors rule. Their music will live on forever.cheersphilip"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Doors fan for 40 years wasn't ready for these mixes","review":"Maybe I'm missing something, but in comparing the new mixes with the '99 masters, I'm really disappointed.The first thing is that the volume, and thus the signal-to-noise ratio, is considerably lower than the older ones. That is just plain bizarre. Usually, a new mastering allows for a higher bitrate and a \\"larger\\" sound without any increase in distortion. That's the way it SHOULD be, anyway. So what happened here ? Further, all of the flourishes and oddities may just take some getting use to, but generally with great bands like The Doors, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.I'm not writing these new mixes off, just pointing out some unusual and, to me, problematic issues upon initial listening.

After 40 years of enjoying my original mono & stereo pressings I was curious to hear what approach Bruce Botnick would take. In my opinion they decided to remove most of the subtle effects from the original mix in favor of \\"digital clarity\\" for a new generation.While I agree that the original release of The Doors was dark, I found it enveloping in a way that the new mixes are not. The keyboards on Light My Fire sound thin and fast instead of full and rounded, and completely mismatch the softness of Jim Morrison's vocals.Some classics are best left original, and this is one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Audio Revelation","review":"I purchased this as a record album the day it was released. The stuff I had on my turntable at this time was, Sgt. Peppers, In Search Of The Lost Chord, Disraeli Gears, Are You Experienced, Procol Harum, Etc. The debut album from the Doors was and is a perfect magic mirror back to that time. The \\"Doors\\" is recognized by the masses and critics alike as a masterpiece. So is this new release of a masterpiece that's been around for 40 years worth the bother? OH YES! The sound is so good these songs all sound like they were recorded at the same time in space but with the ultimate best fantastic recording equipment of all time!

The greatest album in music history!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A sound that has not fallen down","review":"4 1/2Undoubtedly one of the all-time classic rock debut albums, The Doors '67 self-titled release set the bar for their own specially formulated psychedelic blues awfully high, a level they were allowed to reach again, though arguably never surpass. Although I would be lying if I said all the songs hit me like the greatest ones do (maybe it would have also benefited from a different sequence) and also I'd be lying if I said I have not drained most of the emotional truths from their best work long ago, but after all the subjectivity, what is really not to like here? Rare is the album where each song can stand as a microcosm of it's brilliance- be it the longer, literate jams I personally gravitated towards or the more traditional verse-chorus keyboard driven bluesy numbers which in itself stood far apart from comparative kind. Credit Manzarek and company for ushering in a radio-ready rock synergy that has stood the tests of time like such few bands have."},{"rating":"2","title":"light my fire, baby","review":"Everyone knows the original Doors album.

The guy was such a total weenie. Since when is getting so drunk that you fall of the stage a great moral virtue? And what a preening, self-centered gasbag!Of all the great hippie-era 'Sixties bands, the Doors are perhaps the least deserving of their legendary status... They had a couple of volcanic, primal early hits but the Doors catalog as a whole is so boring and bloated. Skip ahead to 1976 and crank up the Ramones: now *that's* real rock rebellion!

Leave good enough alone, please!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jim Morrison's pretentions would bog down any album","review":"The Doors made a beautiful noise, but Jim Morrison was perhaps the most pretentious person ever to have lived, and his presence ruins the proceedings. He has been made into a god by the faceless rock followers who worship his preening and semi-mythological, pedestrian psychological constructs, but in fact he was an almost talentless lyricist and a very limited vocalist to say the least. Take this band right out of the so-called \\"Rock n Roll Pantheon,\\" and put them straight into the gutter where they belong. A sort of sixties Duran Duran."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotten","review":"I once knew a man who was the biggest Doors fan in the world. He knew more about Jim Morrison than his own dad.

The fact that their funniness was unintentional, and that they took themselves seriously makes it so much more relishable. Truly moronic lyrics and highly erratic muscianship, and on top of that Morrisons wobbly tenor. The highlight is the howlingly funny The End, it needs a Mike Myers to really do it justice. One of the most hilariously overblown, psuedo, pieces of nonsense to come out of a 60's recording studio, and oh boy did it have some competition. A collectors item for those who have a taste for kitsch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it ...","review":"If you are looking for great music from rock's beginning, skip this group, because the Doors are all reputation and no follow-through.

They whine. 1-Star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light My Fire is the raido version?","review":"I bought this album thinking it had the original long version of \\"Light My Fire\\" which it says it has. The real original version, remixed or not, is much longer than 3 minutes. That's maybe the version given to AM radio stations back in the 60's because the album version was too long for airplay? I had to buy the version off the box set which also says it's the \\"album version\\" but is over 7 minutes long. So, there are two \\"original\\" album versions of the song so be careful you buy what you expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album - Great remastering - sad issue of Fire","review":"I agree with the other reviews that speak to the mastering and correction of the speed issue. Having been familiar with album since 1966, it was a first a bit jarring, but quickly resolved into greater appreciation of the material.Like other reviews, I was severely disappointed with the inclusion of the SP version of Light My Fire, and this mislabeled as \\"LP Version\\". Remembering the first time (when I bought the LP) I heard the true LP version, I was looking forward to hearing it in its remastered glory.Like I'm sure many others did, I've gone back and also downloaded a true LP Version of the song and re-sequenced the listings for my own use. Also like many others, I think it would be just of Amazon to at least give those who have had to do as did I a $.99 refund. For those who didn't download the extra (and correct) version of the song, Amazon should offer them the download for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT like the original release","review":"This was my first album when I was a kid in junior high.

Opening with the classic \\"Break On Through (To the Other Side),\\" The Doors lead you through a set of wonderful psychedelic rock. One of the greatest things about the Doors is their unique sound, heralded by Ray Manzarek's ever-present keyboards. The twisted riff that opens \\"Light My Fire\\" is timeless, and the hypnotic middle section is one of the finest things the band laid down. \\"Twentieth Century Fox\\" has always been one of my favorites as well, but the whole album comes to a magnificent and eerie close with \\"The End.\\" An eleven and a half minute opus including some of the most disturbing lyrics Jim Morrison ever devised set against a languid, hazy, psychedelic backdrop. If you really want to get into the Doors, this is certainly a great place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 5.1 mix is one of the WORST ever","review":"I bought the box-set(Perception)and after listening to all 5.1 dvd-a disc I was so Mad!!!

I would spend more money and get a better quality unit... and hopefully, with better quality control so they actually include all the necessary screws, etc. The single-page \\"Instructions\\" is of little help with no orientation of the pieces you have to attach.Also, getting tired of having to do 100% of the assembly anymore.

At The Disco. The only thing that distinguishes the two bands for me is that Fall Out Boy lacks more energy. Other than that they might as well be the same band. The music is tired and I find myself on the verge of slumber when I listen to it. Fall Out Boy jumps on the emo bandwagon with the rest of MTV's run-of-the-mill music and I find it hard to believe that so many people fall in love with such clichéd, overused lyrics and weak music. Again, nothing special and it's not even worth the buy to listen to the music(unless you need a nap). It does however make a good paper weight!

With the exception of Dance Dance, the the only good song on the entire CD, everything Fall Out Boy writes sounds exactly the same. This music is like pop/rock set on easy-listening mode with a terribly annoying and whiney vocalist. I'll admit that Sugar, We're Goin' Down is tolerable, but it's just an exceptionally catchy version of the same tune used in the other eleven songs. I'd recommend not wasting your money purchasing From Under the Cork Tree and downloading Dance Dance. For a somewhat similar band that writes much better music, check out Panic!

Lets examine why these guys are popular, they appeal to teenagers, especially girls.They are, yet another, disgrace to music because they dont even try to make good music, they just want to get girls, be rich, and be popular. Basically they are not even music ... so therefore they get one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!!! So brilliant!","review":"God I love this album. It has very intense lyrics that I nearly cry when I hear them. The instruments are very very complex. I'm a guitarist for over 15 years and still this stuff is so hard to play. And OMFG the vocals!! Patrick is just a genius!!A modern masterpiece. Simply the best album of 2005. Buy it now!!(...sarcasm...)Alright, here's a real review. Fall Out Boy: One of the worst bands of the nrew millenium. This, is just like Good Charlotte and Simple Plan, the same pseudo emotional bulls**t that appeals only to homosexuals and teen girls who have no friends. The guitarist is a joke, I could smoke him with broken hands. And the vocals are just awful. Anyone who says this idiot can sing should burn along with all the FOB stuff. For the best albums of 2005 pick up Opeth's 'Ghost Reveries', Dark Tranquillity's 'Character' or Bruce Dickinson's 'Tyranny of Souls'. On the other hand though, don't do it. It would prbably be too heavy for you, you'll just get a heart attack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did Joe Strummer die?","review":"How could Punk turn into this crap? Emo has to be the lamest genre around. All it is is whiny losers talking about slitting their wrists or getting dumped. The songs on this crappy waste of disk have some of the lamest names Ive ever heard, (I slept with one of the guy from fall out boy and all I got was this song about me)see what I mean? Who buys this? Seriously, Emo is for queers. P.S: that lead singer guy is really anoying, he has really queer side burns and wears a stupid hat all the time. Save us, John Lydon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"....","review":"ok to start this off.... im not the biggest fan of fall out boy. But, you people who have the time to sit in front of the computer and flame about how much they hate FOB have a problem. When will this sink in with you guys? Punk, is NOT THE SAME AS CLASSIC ROCK!!!!!!!! Its almost retarted to compare Fall Out Boy to the Beatles! And just so you guys know, FOB isn't emo. Also, they aren't the same as Good Charlote and other crap punk bands! So get off your lazy butts, get out of your house, and accept this...... MUSIC CHANGES! Pretty soon im expecting to hear this from one of you. \\"They played classical music in the 1700's.... WE SHOULD ALL LISTEN TO CLASSICAL MUSIC!! ALL ROCK BANDS SHOULD DIE!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!!\\" etc. etc. etc. So overall, just open your ears just a little bit and stop wasting your time flaming about every little thing you whiny babys hate"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"this is probably on the top of my music lists i love almost every song except for like sugar~ and dance~, other than that its a great cd and patrick is hot (im not gay but i think i am now AHAHAHAH)"},{"rating":"2","title":"How these guys got labeled as \\"Emo\\" I'll NEVER know...","review":"I think these guys have a lot more in common with Bowling for Soup than any Emo/screamo band I've ever heard. They're just another powerpop/punk band, but a pretty good one at that. This CD's pretty solid all the way through. If you like catchy hooks, driving beats and/or a Creed-like guitar sound, you'll dig this."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely not a sell out","review":"Fall Out Boy has come a long way in less than a year. They deserve all the fame that this cd has brought to them. Now all everyone wants to talk about is how they sold out and went mainstream but this is what bands do. Bands evolve and change with the music industry. I would rather have a different style from a great band then have them regurgitate the same songs over and over. Everyone was expecting a cd like \\"Take this to your grave\\" and I admit, it's not like it at all. But it doesn't mean they sold out. They want their music to reach more people and it has. They wanted to sell more records and they have. This is a great album and I believe Fall Out Boy has done what any band would do if given the chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"On their way","review":"While I won't collapse into the hysterical blind adoration of some of the other reviewers here, I have to say Fall Out Boy certainly doesn't deserve the skewering some of the \\"old school\\" complainers have thrown at them.Is Fall Out Boy the next Sex Pistols, or Ramones? No, they do trend more towards the pop/angst end of the punk spectrum, but if you can open your mind wide enough to realize that music will always continue to evolve, then the CD is very enjoyable.The group is clearly talented, and while they could do more to stand out from the crowd (personally, I hear a lot of cues from Green Day and Weezer), that talent alone makes the CD a good listen. The improvement over their first album seems to indicate not only their commitment to growing their sound, but also to making the music that matters to them instead of being ruled by producers trying to simply recreate their very strong debut CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good stuff!","review":"I love fall out boy. None of the other songs are as good as the \\"dance dance\\" one or \\"sugar we're goin down\\", but they are all good....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD I've heard all year","review":"Seriously, this CD and the one prior, Take This To Your Grave are on constant rotation wherever my ears can be found.

Your making to broad of an assumption to say that.Now on to the album. I think it is great and really cannot tell how they sound \\"extactly\\" like NFG or Simple Plan.

It is FANTABULOUS! It is more mature than \\"take this to your grave\\", which i found to my liking. I also found out from the band that in\\"grave\\" just Pete and Patrick wrote the lyrics and music, but in \\"cork tree\\" everyone in the band pitched in. This is a great Cd which I have listened to everynight since i got it. With the melodic (aka \\"dreamy\\") yet edgy voice of Patrick Stump and the great and energetic music of Pete, Joe, and Andy in the backround this Cd stands out to be a guilty pleasure for all music lovers.MUCH respect to Fall Out Boy,their #1 fan"},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm...","review":"Why are these guys here?

So I went ahead and picked up the album, and I'm not going to lie, THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST CD I HAVE PURCHASED IN A LONG TIME!!!! I will even go as far as to say that it surpasses Green Day's American Idiot. I would love to elaborate on what my favorite tracks are, but the are all AWESOME!

That Great guitar and excellent music are part of metal is true, though not vice versa.Incredibly annoying - Breathy vocals, song titles that screams \\"TRYING too hard to be funny\\", and to top it off, stupid repetitive lyrics.

They sound too much like someone else without enough of themselves to really stand out. I was given a copy of this CD by a guy who admits he likes emo and Kylie Minogue (apologies on spelling).

If you are trying to listen to something of any value in the Punk/emo genre, please check out Through Being Cool or Stay What You Are by Saves The Day, which are great albums, although not for the people who enjoy garbage like Fallout boy.

At times, the vocals can't seem to decide if they want to be pop or Linkin Park (\\"Get Busy Living or Get Busy Dying\\"). But when they concentrate on their strengths, like \\"Dance Dance,\\" Fall Out Boy show what made them into superstars two years later. There's a tendency to mix their pop with classic rock hooks, which also makes for interesting songs (\\"I've Got a Dark Alley...\\"). Better than average, but Infinity On High is the better album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great follow up","review":"This is a great CD I think that Fall Out Boy never goes wrong and never ceases to amaze me.

Abnoxious vocals over lame-o punk stuff\\" Yet, over time, and a few go-rounds in my CD player, this CD has truely grown on me.Personally, I haven't taken much time to listen to the lyrics, so, i'm unsure as to how meaningful they are--I'm goin' strictly on sound here--and it's not bad.Looking at the titles of the songs, you can tell they're a very 'goofy' group, but, give them a chance--actually more than one chance.FAVORITE SONG: the fast paced, wild \\"Dance, Dance\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Music that causes brain cancer","review":"Ahh yes, the band I hate more than Hitler himself. Hell, if I had to choose between sharing a room with Adolf or the members of Fall Out Boy, I would share a room with der Fuhrer.

While the 90s had boy bands like 98 Degrees and the Backstreet Boys, we now have such pathetic groups as Fall Out Boy and Hawthorne Heights.While emo music is the current norm, I'm only glad that, like all fads, this band will be forgotten, and all the members will go back to doing what they were born to do, being gay pornstars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album ever!","review":"From Under The Cork Tree was the record that got Fall Out Boy noticed.

I think the former answers that question. Why you might ask? It's definitely not Patrick's impressive vocals, the wailing drums or soaring, crunching guitar riffs. It will likely be the pretentious nature of the bassist and his ignorant, rip-off lyrics. The first album was gorgeous, fresh and refreshing to say the least. This new album was a mere attempt to replicate the first album, but with a touch of forced lack of creativity and \\"let's make it completely obvious that we're trying way too hard to impress the wrong crowd\\". I gave this garbage two stars because there were only two songs I was impressed with, \\"Dance, Dance\\" and \\"Sugar...\\". I don't mind that \\"Sugar...\\" made it to MTV to be portrayed to the teeny-bopper, hot-topic generation, it is after-all a good song.

The lead singers voice is whiny and has a twang that is present with every note he sings and gets very annoying, he's the big reason I do not like this band. The song titles are unnecessary, showing that they spend more time worrying about the titles than they do actually writing music. It must be hard being a fan of theirs and trying to talk about different songs because it takes you 10 minutes just to remember the name of it. If they had something to do with the song itself, it may be more tolerable, but they're just a lame attempt at being funny.

Don't get sucked into them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The band that's cool to hate","review":"Since all of us mindless drones like anything that gets consistent airplay on MTV other than on Sunday Nights at midnight, Fall Out Boy must be horrible and those who listen to and like them are trendwhores.

If you think this is worth your money, you're really, REALLY WRONG. Buy real Rock music, not Good Charlotte, or Simple Plan, or any Emo or Pop or Punk.

It shaped the way I hear music, set the standard, especially \\"The Right Time\\" and \\"Tell the Truth\\". Why did Ray stop making this kind of music? Only explanation I can think of is that he was following the market. To tell the truth, I don't know that many people even today who can really relate to it. The Beatles, yes, but these unbelievable songs, no. Seems they just ain't got soul. So it's to nice hear stories of people with whom this music STUCK. It IS music for a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"The LP/CD Issue","review":"The LP begins with The Right Time 4:06 to open one concert; then picks it up again to start off the second concert which was recorded in mono. The first question I looked at was which order works. I have owned the LP for years, but I cannot say which order is accurate - maybe going back to the orginal 2 albums might give a hint.Either way these live recording match the power of Ray Charles at the height of his powers. It also shows that he has sax skills to match his piano. I saw him do it here in Seattle a couple of times.So the order is different. If it really irks you, then import them into iTunes and arrange them to match the LP. That's what I did to SGT. Pepper.The CD is great, but Ray Charles continued to evolve as an artist. Check out The Best of Ray Charles. So I drop a star for dropping and adding and rearranging the CD version. Still, at this price and after seeing RAY, this is where the performances live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally on Compact Disc!","review":"This was the first recording of Messiah I ever purchased, back in 1966. This Shaw performance was a big deal back then, as it represented the first real \\"period\\" performance practice version with its scaled down instrumental and choral forces - compared to the overblown Ormandy version, for example. The original vinyl discs imparted a muted dynamic range as I recall, so this splendid digitally-remastered release is truly stunning compared to the original. Of particular note is the gorgeous vocal work of soporano Judith Raskin, one of the most beautiful voices to appear on any recording of Messiah, and contralto Florence Kopleff whose vocal agility and sheen are something to behold. This is one of the best modern instrument Messiahs available today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book is an excellent tool to have in your library.

It teaches children to be antisocial, and that everyone outside of their handpicked circle of like-minded xenophobes is a subhuman monster out to destroy their lives. It teaches boys that their sexual urges are a character deformity, and that masturbation is unnatural and medically dangerous. It teaches girls to think of themselves as property, and that any fetus they could potentially birth is more important to God than their lives.

So I couldn't wait to get started on Buffa's newest book. I really don't like to give a bad review, but more than that I really don't like getting stuck reading a bad book. A busy professional mother, I just don't have the time to read anything \\"unworthy\\". Well, the Judgement is not up to par at all with Buffa's other books. I would relike to meet Mr. Buffa and ask him \\"what happened?\\" So I regret it, but I must give this book a bad review. Perhaps, he'll do better with the next one - no way he could do worse. Sorry Mr. Buffa."},{"rating":"2","title":"How we relate to Abraham","review":"A fairly detailed look at the life of Abraham as recorded in Genesis. This book is organized for small group studies with each chapter focusing on one major section of Abraham's life and study questions at the end. The major focus is the growth of Abraham's walk with God and the lessons we can learn in our similarly fallen lives and circumstances. Abraham committed some big sins! So do we. How does God work even through those to \\"grow up\\" Abraham and bring about His promises? That's a big theme in this book.Occasionally, the author stretches the text to make an illustration. The points made are good and true, but they are not necessarily backed up in the biblical texts studied. I still recommend the book, just be aware of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living in the Gap between Promise and Reality","review":"An insightful and practical book about faith as illustrated in the life of Abraham.

This release is terribly unexciting; even boring. Gone are the driving guitars, urgency, and soaring melodies that propelled many of the songs on the first release. Instead The Program offers slower and mostly dull songs - nothing to hum. If you haven't heard Marion, start with World & Body -- it's classic indie rock somewhere between the English groups Mansun and 3 Colors Red.

Itfeels a bit sappy at times, 'cute' at others, and the story feels abit too predicable.We know from the start the two old salts will soften and come to care fortheir charge, and they will all bond before the journey ends.Without the high level of talents involved, that predictability could havesunk the film, but the brio of Nicholson, the sure hand of director HalAshby, and Robert Towne's salty, idiosyncratic script keep it afloat andalways worth watching, if not quite rising to 'great film' level for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine work by Nicholson and others","review":"It's not Robert Towne's strongest screenplay nor Hal Ashby's strongest direction, but this film is very much worth seeing as a good examples of 1970s American cinema. If you are a Nicholson fan in particular and liked Five Easy Pieces, you would most likely enjoy this as well. Nicholson, Young, Quaid and the others do a great job here in a character study of three Navy men, two of whom must escort the other to eight years in prison for a petty theft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack At his Best","review":"This is one of a number of fantastic movies that came out in the early 1970s. Jack Nicholson was perfect for playing the role of Badass Buddusky a sailor for life in the navy in what might be his best acting ever. The movie is very real and the story is very well told with great character development unlike a lot movies that are made today where every 10 seconds there is some kind of explosion and mindless simpleton dialogue. This movie will take you along for quite a ride as Badass and Mule show Randy Quaid one last good time before they take him to prison and along the way you will laugh, you will feel sad and you might even shed a tear. This movie will evoke many emotions as it tells its story, too bad they dont make movies like this anymore!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"glorious","review":"I'd been looking at this CD for weeks when I finally bought it yesterday.

An earlier reviewer apparently did not understand this, so be prepared for some amusing hosting segments and video strangeness along with your feature presentation. Lobo does fine and funny work on the \\"Cinema Insomnia\\" series, proudly carrying on the horror host tradition of Bob Wilkins, Ghoulardi, the Cool Ghoul, Zacherle, Dr. San Guinary, Elvira and so many others, and his contributions here make the otherwise-dubious film a lot more fun.

The assessories of this toy fit all the dress-up Polly Pocket toys, i.e. magnetic series, part cloth series, and plastic/rubbery attire series. This set comes with a number of small parts, including dresses, shoes, and additional small toys - Dopey and a tiny bird. The rubbery dresses seem durable but wore off quite quickly with use. The glitter comes off every time my kid plays with it. The toy is not suitable for kids who may be rough with their toys as the dresses can tear and the assessories can go missing easily. My kid plays with them every day since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for girls.","review":"Bought this for my 41/2 yr. old granddaughter and it was a smashing hit.

This means that if there's any stickiness to the rollers at all -- say, if dirt or hair or pet fur gets in them -- the ball slips over the rollers and it ceases to function. And the rollers aren't easily accessible so they're nearly impossible to clean.The trackball is nice and big, which makes for good control (great for gaming or detail graphic work) but after a month or so of use it simply stops functioning well. It just isn't worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laptop incompatibility","review":"The mouse functions very well, however there is a dark side to the functionality. To configure all the buttons you must install mouseworks. When mouseworks is installed, it interferes with the operation of the onboard pointing device on laptops. The only way to recover use of the onboard pointing device is to un-install mouseworks.The mouse can be used w/o mouseworks, however it will then default to one of the microsoft mice, and you will have use of only one, default button.Kensington tech support has suggested disabling the laptop pointing device.I'm sure the mouse would work flawlessly on a desktop machine. Kensington needs to re-think how they support laptops."},{"rating":"2","title":"Built like a tank.","review":"I've used the Expert Mouse, daily, for at least eight years. Computer systems have come and gone, but the Expert Mouse endures. Calling it rugged doesn't begin to do it justice. I originally purchased this unit for computer graphics applications. The very large ball and stable base give the user precise control over cursor movement. And for games...it's speed and responsiveness are unbeatable. My first Expert Mouse developed a problem with the cable socket. Kensington replaced the entire unit, free of charge and no questions asked. The replacement has endured seven solid years of hard usage. The Mouseworks configuration software is a real bonus. Overall, the Expert Mouse is one of the better hardware investments you could possibly make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for spelling improvement","review":"My son had difficulty in spelling words.

I had not measured our dog's muzzle before shopping, but since she weighs just under 100 lbs. (a Great Pyrenees), I thought that a 7 might work. The size 7 was far too small for her, but fit our 65 lb. Husky mix just right. I measured the Pyrenees's muzzle before ordering online. The circumference was 12\\", putting her in the size 8 category, though she weighs much less than the other breeds listed there. So do be sure to go by muzzle size as opposed to weight. The muzzle works quite well & is easy to put on the dog. It has helped tremendously with toenail trimming, which has been a big issue for the Pyrenees. She is also a very drooly dog, so it's great to have a muzzle that's easy to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value for the Price.","review":"These bands are no nonsense wrist bands, they do the job for sweat, they are reasonably hard-wearing and look quite nice.Good value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"SORRY BUT NOT TOO GOOD ON THE QUALITY!","review":"I bought these as a gift for my son who is a huge fan of Scott Pilgrim.

Of note is that it does recognize the usb media being connected but is unable to recognize the MP3 files on it. Also, the CD mechanism is by far and away the worst I have ever seen - It will skip just sitting in the driveway, not even driving! Completely unsat for a car audio system.

This is validation enough and for those for whom the script is too simple, or subject matter too vague - see earlier reviews - other books exist to take up deeper concerns and to provide Miss Ducie's growing readership with a 'next stage'.

This is a huge difference in relation to Chist's story. In addition to this, the Krishna story that is used, including possible cruxifiction, is not widely accepted.

So when I saw that Danny Boyle had directed this \\"hilarious\\" film, I decided to give it a chance. When it starts, I only hoped the whole movie didn't look horribly pixilated.

It was a good show and the crowd was just awesome. The documentaries included are nice, really do a good job of making you feel like you actually attended the show. The last part of the show is Oasis at their best, compared to any other DVD or live show out there. At the beggining it drags a little: 'Who Feels love' and \\"gas Panic\\" are not great songs to play live and can get a little boring.

The transfer leaves a lot to be desired, but the sound mix is solid and engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"My last car stereo, a Sony AM/FM/CD with removable face, was nice. I became lazy about removing the face at night and a moment of carelessness -- leaving the driver's door open overnight -- made it easy for a burglar to steal the stereo. I decided to replace it with this cheapy so as to save money and discourage future theft. My expectations were low but was surprised to find that the product registered engine noise, so I needed a $30 filter; the receiver is really weak and only gets the high-powered FM stations, not my favorite public stations, and it drifts. It also has no clock which is unusual for a car stereo. But the tape player works well and sounds good. All in all, this $20 car stereo cost me over $130 installed including product, shipping and parts. This is a lesson I won't forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely clever words and music","review":"This is one of my all-time favourite CD's to play when I want to listen to something fun.

The 'book' consists of 4 pages. Of these 4 pages 1 is used up as the cover page and the last page contains frgament of a short paragraph.

Well, after watching sales for awhile, 25% is about the most you will ever get off of these watches. So I decided to check Amazon and I could not believe the awesome prices! I found this watch with the pink mother of pearl face, which I have never seen in the stores. I had to order it! It is more beautiful in person. It is extremely classy and eye catching.

Every fan asks \\"Where's _____? It's my favorite song!\\" which, given the comments, remains the case here. I'm happy to finally pick up the \\"One More Chance\\" Remix that samples DeBarge's \\"Stay With Me\\"; it was popular on the radio, and now we can all get it on iTunes. But I have to ask: where's \\"Mo' Money Mo' Problems\\"? It may not be his best hit, but it's definitely his biggest. \\"Hypnotize\\" is a hip hop classic, but even my grandma knows \\"Mo' Money, Mo' Problems.\\" And the phrase became part of our vernacular because of this song. I know many people that scoff at the mention of hip hop culture and can't pick Biggie out in a crowd, but even they remark, \\"Yeah, mo' money mo' problems.\\" Oh well, so much for documenting a cultural moment.

OK. But then my first Wireless Turbo Mouse sucked batteries; I had to change them about once a week. Kensington replaced it, and now I've been using the replacement for about a year and I'm finding that the cursor jumps randomly all over the screen. New batteries helped a little but I can be working and suddenly the cursor will jump to the other side of the screen-or if I'm word-processing, the cursor will just start drifting uncontrollably down the line. It's disastrous in Photoshop. I'm going back to usb. And I'll probably buy a Kensington Turbo Mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twangalicious","review":"Many aging crooners ape the \\"classics\\" genre to cash in (Rod, I'm looking at you), but country is hard to do with heart and conviction. Van nails it. Like Ray Charles before him he easily makes the jump from R&B and Soul to country with his distinctive voice. He does it like he loves it and not just because he has a mansion payment to make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Morrison","review":"Van Morrison has once again proven you can't peg him. He has taken country songs and put his twist on them so that you are reminded of greats like Hank Williams Sr. but still get the Morrison style of using his voice as an instrument to convey emotions as only he can.Who else could pull off Your Cheatin' Heart, a Williams trademark, and make it his own? I would have loved to hear his take on Patsy Cline's Don't It Make Your Brown Eyes Blue. Now that would be interesting, no?Morrison's style is so fluid he can sing anything and come out sounding only like he can. Hardcore Country fans will probably hate this album. Morrison fans might hate it, too, but it definately is done his way, blending Country with his own vocal jazz voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Van Morrison, Nor Country Music","review":"With all due respect to the musicians and the rest of folks that made possible this work, I reckon this is a bad album. I don't know if Mr. Van Morrison got IT during the sessions, but he certainly didn't get me. The album is as far away from real country music as Dublin is from Nashville, honestly. He seems to be cross at the lyrics, instead of really feelin' them, and the string section is well executed, but real bad placed; there shouldn't have been any in the first place. If you ain't heard any of Van Morrison's albums, please don't start here, you oughtta check outMoondanceorTupelo Honey (Exp). If you ain't heard any country music, please don't start here either: go to Hank Williams or Waylon Jennings, for instance. Whatever the case is, it'll give you a bad idea of both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme A Break Van","review":"It's [...] like this that causes me to forget what a great musician that Van Morrison once was. His tired, mumbling, versions of these classics offer nothing new to the mix. Bad Karioke is more like it.

It's embarrassing to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Morrison I know and love","review":"I was excited to hear Morrison's new CD as I am a huge fan of his music. I could not believe my ears. I gave it a few listens, thinking it was new and different and I wanted to be fair. Alas, I found the album to be boring and mundane. I hope that he has gotten \\"country\\" out of his system and gets back to doing it his way again. Sorry - it was a total disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, No, Please No","review":"I love Van Morrison. I have for years. Like everything he has ever done...till now that is.

Van, I am so disappointed in you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toooo country","review":"Van has done many great songs in his many years of recording, but he missed the boat on this one. Sure there are some great songs here and his voice sounds good, but the problem is he did not do anything to these songs to make them his own. I know there are a lot of covers here but a touch of bluegrass, some horns, a little slide guitar, just something to add a personal touch to the songs. Dolly Parton pulled it off with \\"The Grass Is Blue\\" Leon Russell did with \\"Hank Wilson's Back\\" but Van just missed it I am sorry to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"snore","review":"I'm sure it was fun for Van to record a bunch of songs he likes, but overall this would have made for a disappointing bootleg.

The Devil's been paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Van's worst.","review":"Van has made some fantastic music, and this isn't it!Simply put, it's Van's worst. Don't buy it, it's an absolutely ball scratchingly horrible album.

He's just not on top with it. I've listened to it because I love his voice, but the country thing should've ended with the rockabilly co-effort he did with Linda Gail Lewis. The songs remind me of flat soda. Sorry Van. No crests, all valley."},{"rating":"2","title":"You gotta love traditional country done right","review":"Unlike the mean minded review of the person from Austrailia who thought he should shoot everyone who recorded music 15 to 20 yrs ago, I thought this was a very good CD, I have always thought music reviews were intented to be objective about the music not about one persons obvious contempt for artists that may have seen better days in his view, but then that person probably doesnt understand north american music all that well so we have to make allowances for ignorance.Great job Van"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Super Song Gains 4 Stars for the Whole Deal","review":"By and large, most reviewers have gotten it right. Van hasn't produced a real stunner of an album for awhile--and Pay the Devil continues that trend. Although Van's had some fine recordings in the last 15 years, the last that made me cry 'cause it was so good allll the way through was probably Night in San Francisco. We devotees must be satisfied with a few great numbers each time out and settle for the rest because even when not up to our hopes, he's so great! Personally, he deserves to have me buy each CD.The great consolation is that those \\"few great numbers\\" are worth it; that is, worth the wait for the CD and worth the price. On Pay the Devil, that great number is Van's take on \\"Till I Gain Control Again.\\" It makes this album worthy of attention and support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Old School Country","review":"I love this album.

I don't think there isn't aything he can't sing. Great selection of songs. I'm not a big country music fan, but I could listen to this all day long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cross-genre master","review":"Morrison has produced credible albums in Rock, Blues, and Jazz genres. Pay the Devil has the Irish soulster performing classic American country music and some originals that sound entirely appropriate between Hank Williams and Clarence Williams.You can count the guys who can really play in all these genres on one hand -- if you're Django Reinhardt! (Ray Charles, and Morrison as I see it).Five stars! If you don't like country, buy it anyway, this might reel you in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never seems to take ownership of the songs","review":"A key reason I have liked so much of Van Morrison's body of work is his ability to own a song, whether his or someone else's. And Mr. Morrison is entitled to record in whatever genre suits his fancy.So the problem I have with this set of tunes is that he never seems to take ownership of the songs; I tend to hear many of the tracks with their earlier, original vocals and can never quite suspend my impression that these covers are neither an improvement or viable re-creation.There is plenty of sharp musicianship in evidence but not enough of the heart and soul I have come to expect from a Van Morrison album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodic and fun","review":"Van's journeys always take me to places I wouldn't go by myself. \\"Here Stands the Glass\\" is Van personified. Great delivery from a man who can relate to the song's sentiments. It is country tunes without obvious country arrangments. True it is not as deep as some of Van's \\"mystic\\" recordings, but he is having fun and it shows on this recording.

This is unforced music, to be sure, but also seemingly uninspired. Relaxed to the point of barely seeming involved, this is a toss-off effort. Are the days of Morrison Magic gone for good? Maybe so. Efforts like this one, while not diminishing the stature of this master performer, do nothing to enhance it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Crate for a larger dog.","review":"I have a 100lbs.

Upon putting it into our CD player for the first time, we were not disappointed.Jonathan Edwards' voice resonates strongly with me. It's kind of an intangible element that is hard to write about, but when he is belting out words over his purposeful guitar, it feels like something is grabbing my spine and shaking it to the beat in a soothing manner.My only criticism would be that his songs aren't that deep. Most of his songs seem to be about love lost or love gained, or the wanting of those two things to happen. Even though the song titles may suggest something else, if you wait until the chorus it generally turns into being about a girl.So, the music sounds great and makes me feel great, but it's content isn't exactly anything you can sink your teeth into. With that said, I would strongly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"bought for one song & liked the album","review":"Sunshine-his big hit, of course.

The performances of \\"Being Alive\\", \\"Poems\\", and \\"The Miller's Son\\" are much better than the Broadway cast recordings. A wide range of material is included, including some rarely-performed stuff from \\"Saturday Night\\", Sondheim's first (but unstaged) musical.Another nice thing about this live recording is the relaxed, friendly, cabaret-like atmosphere. The orchestra is small, and one gets the impression the audience was pretty small, too.

I believe this book could be read and easily understood by any level Egyptologist, as there is a helpful glossary of people (well, gods mostly), places, and things described in the spells.

For many of us getting back to basics- growing our own food, living simply and eschewing a consumer lifestyle this is an offensive slap in the face. We have 8 children and I would guess that the majority of the people interested in simple living have all the children that God wants them to have. We see children as a blessing.

At the end of the day, I set the new combo and the lock would not unlock. I set the old combo and that didn't work either. Maybe I did something wrong?The kicker is that I got some regular wire cutters and was able to pretty easily cut through the security cable, nipping at it bit by bit for a few minutes. I was shocked it was that easy. Next, to detach the lock from my laptop I used a regular battery powered drill with a regular drill bit and drilled through the end of the lock.

It's probably because they inadvertently changed the combination because the mechanism to change it is so easy to engage.I would definitely never suggest this product to anyone (unless I really wanted their computer)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"Very difficult to lock and unlock--I have to hold my MacBook Pro on edge to get a grip on the lock while I spin the wheels.

I think Corgan really helps any work he puts his hands on (I'd like to hear him produce Paul McCartney). I'm not as impressed with the best songs on this album as I was \\"Doll Parts\\", \\"Softer Softest\\", and \\"Violet\\" but this CD is more consistent than \\"Live...\\" was. It reminds me of \\"Tiny Music\\" by STP for some reason, possibly because that was also a switch to a more pop style that worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hole is still awsome","review":"This is a great album for people who have listened to Hole before, and those who have not.

A female lead can really show a band where to find success!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CS is a good work in its own right","review":"Celebrity Skin is nowhere near as heavy as Live Thru This. I was instantly hooked on the first track because it rocked. Then, to my dismay the next couple tracks slowed down. However, I am a huge fan of Courtney's lyrics and Hole's musical talent and sound as a whole, so of course it grew on me. If you really love Hole, get this cd immediately. If you've never owned a Hole album before, buy Live Through This first. You will be hooked. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"HOLE-->R.I.P.","review":"I cannot believe what has happened to HOLE...HOLE was once my religion..i listened to them constantly their agressive loud music helped me get through some very depressing times when i was in highschool...now i can turn on the radio and here HOLE playing inbetween N'SYNC or Brittany Spears trash!!!...i go to the music store and see sorority sisters gathering around the HOLE section and chanting \\"Oh make me over\\" in there sorority vernacular....A band that was once part of my life for almost 7 years has sold out to the masses and can now be heard playing on adult contemporay stations...I know this is mindless drivel..but this album marks the end.. of what to me was the greatest band on earth!!! Any real Hole fan would obviously be appauld at this bland commercial garbage...Im sorry Hole but you have let me and many other REAL fans down...the sound of PRETTY ON THE INSIDE and LIVE THROUGH THIS is obviously dead and so is what could have been a legendary band.......:("},{"rating":"1","title":"Good album. Terrible Hole album.","review":"The album was good, but Hole is a million times better than this.

If you like hole, get a differant album."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"i really liked live through this, but when i bought this cd, i decided courtney love may not be as original or talented as i had thought. i'm a little suspicious that the band does not seem to have a consistent \\"sound\\". this album sounds like a watered-down version of smashing pumpkins, much like live through this sounds heavily influenced by kurt cobain/nirvana. i would not have as much complaint with that if the album were actually good, but it is bland and disappointing pop-rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courtney cleans up her act ... (temporarily)","review":"Between \\"Live Through This\\" and \\"Celebrity Skin\\", Courtney Love lost her husband, got off heroin, and started a second career as a (surprisingly talented) film actress. \\"Celebrity Skin\\" sounds a lot like Courtney was appearing at the time: a little cleaner, a little more friendly, but still packed with plenty of edge and unpredictability. Most of the songs are fairly melodic, and the production is filled with glittery little touches here and there. But nothing ever really gets in the way of Courtney's raw, powerful vocals. She still has rage and angst to spare, and her fans wouldn't want her any other way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!","review":"I think this album is really great! It is a complete change from Pretty on the Inside, but it still rocks. Just my oppinion...anyway. I thought it has some great songs. (Northern Star is my favorite!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring album I've ever sat through","review":"I find it hard to believe this is the same band that wrote songs with lyrics like \\"Go on, take everything, I dare you to!\\" and performed them with conviction and intensity. Courtney Love is now playing music that my parents like...hey, my mother actually digs 'Malibu', but I think it's corny.This album was a very painful experience, as I resisted the urge to hit the skip button on my CD player many times. It was quite an ordeal, and I'll never go through it again. Every song reminds me of those awful '80s love songs and groups like Heart and Fleetwood Mac. I don't hear any honesty in these songs...the oomph present in the band's earlier albums is totally missing here. Maybe they will find it again on their next album, but we'll have to wait until 2002 to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aaarghhhh !!!!!","review":"Oh, man, how can someone say this piece of junk is \\"sonically amazing, masterpice and essential modern rock...\\"????I must remember you that this a prject developed by Courtney Love, an ambitious and talentless actress, a talentless \\"rocker\\", that only achieved some notoriety due to his relationship with the late Kurt Cobain.This CD goes reasonably well until the third track, when we have solid pop-rock. Then, it all comes down real quick..."},{"rating":"1","title":"So NOT Courtney","review":"I was really disappointed with this CD. It is nothing like \\"Live Through This\\", and was not at all up to the standards of the Grunge Goddess, I am a fan of.

Excellent CD! Highlights include \\"Celebrity Skin,\\" \\"Heaven Tonight,\\" and \\"Playing Your Song.\\" This album has a well balance of songs.:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Hole at their best.","review":"In my opinion, this is one of the best CDs of the decade. Hole put out some great songs here: packed with punches and GREAT guitar hooks. Courtney Love has a unique ability to put emotion into these songs and make you feel. The guitars seem to rise and fall according to the way she is singing. \\"Boys on the Radio\\" is my favorite, followed closely by \\"Celebrity Skin\\", \\"Malibu\\", and \\"Reason to be Beautiful\\". This is one of those CDs where there really are no \\"filler\\" songs. It's all good. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't even give it one star . . .","review":"Hole is a terrible band, and they just seem to be getting worse. They need to give Love a life time supply of drugs, lock her up and never let her out. She is a terrible influence on new bands. Remember kids: JUST SAY NO to Hole . . . Courtney Love."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO CLASS","review":"I know courtney wants to be some sort of hollywood starlet. but her personality does not fit with the image she is trying to cultivate.she is NOT sultry or glamorous. she has too much damage. she would be better served trying to work with what she has rather than putting on a goofy mask. madonna kind of pulled it off... maybe a little bit... but courtney needs a new take. maybe a Herzog Fassbinder Hesher type of movie star glam. The bangles first e.p. was really dope. I wouldn't write them off for \\"walk like an egyptian\\"i like the first couple of hole records. i also like the surgery!!! money well spent! It's the brain that needs the surgery now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makeover or no, Courtney kicks ass","review":"As good as Live Through This, albeit with a more polished sound. The first five songs are as good a block of music as I've heard in a long time, especially \\"Awful.\\" Madonna-friend or not, Courtney Love still has her edge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even my parents like this CD (is that good sign, or bad?)","review":"This is a great guitar pop album and I don't care about Courtney Love's image of the week or who wrote the music. The lyrics get a little repetitive (I dare anyone to count the amount of times the words candy, tonight, drown, cold, and under my/your skin appear) but most of the songs have great hooks. Perhaps the sound of the album can best be described by my parents' reaction (they are big geeks who worship gordon lightfoot and joan biaz). My dad:'Who IS that?' My mom: 'THAT'S COURTNEY LOVE?!?!?' Now I have to suffer the indignity of hearing my mom humming 'Malibu' and my dad bobbing his head to 'Heaven Tonight'. Even my younger sister, who's a Lilith fair junkie, likes this album and has been seen air guitaring to 'Dying'. That's how catchy Celebrity Skin is. Hole may have lost die hard punk/grunge fans, but they've obliviously broadened their fan base with this little number. I like the old Hole better, but this is still great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Can Accept It...","review":"Most people think Courtney Love and Hole are just trying to go pop to appeal to a wider range of listeners. I agree, but I can accept it. Face it, if Hole went and released another grunge album in 1998 it would be a little behind the times. The CD is helped -- and hindered -- a lot by Billy Corgan. One of the songs he co-wrote, \\"Celebrity Skin\\" is the best song on the album. Another of his songs (Dying) is the sort of slow crap that plagues Hole on this album. Only the lyrics in that song save it. Best songs:Celebrity Skin, Malibu, Reasons to Be Beatiful, Use Once and Destroy, Playing Your Song, PetalsI suggest you buy it, just give it a try, and chances are you'll end up liking it, punk or bopper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the most exiting album of the year!","review":"This album makes me happy everytime I hear it( almost everyday), it is so much better than Live Through This, because it has more passion in its songs, and it's full of happiness. Courtney was really inspirated when she wrote the album lyrics, they're so cool and the songs are delicious to listen to. I love it and recomend it to everyone who still have a doubt on buying this, it's gratious and has also the hard guitars that are on the Live Through This as well. I mostly enjoy the songs \\"Awful\\", \\"Calebrity Skin\\" and \\"Heaven Tonight\\". A must hear!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Malibu\\" is the worst song on the album...","review":"This is a good album, but Courtney belongs in the heavy style of music that she evolved in. I bought \\"Live Through This\\" shortly after this album and believe me - their earlier songs were better. \\"Malibu\\" is TOO SAPPY for Hole - the group that defined angry girl rock along with PJ Harvey, Bikini Kill, L7, etc... in the early nineties. L like this album and all, but the grunge lives in Hole and it needs to released again. This album just doesn't stun like their earlier albums... Rating: B+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Courtney Love RULZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Hole has made an amazing come back which most people thought would never happen. To all of you who bring her down think about this. No other musican has gone through what Courtney has dealt with. From kurt to people saying she killed him and raising Frances with morals. She deserves some credit. Her album is proof that Courtney can do it without the help that Kurt did NOT give her. I think their new album is very good. Didn't your mother ever teach you to show some respect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really deep in the hole...","review":"THis album should have been called \\"SHALLOW SKIN\\", so false and shallow it is. HOLE was never a band, just the greedy Courtney Love trying (and obtaining!!) more money to her bank account. CELEBRITY SKIN is even wrose than LIVE THROUGH THIS (if that was possible!!)No wonder the band closed its operations recently. It already fullfilled its purposes: fast money."},{"rating":"1","title":"an incredible disappointment...","review":"what else is there to say? after 4 years of waiting I hoped for better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to throw this one back","review":"Beyond the title track, the songwriting is uneven. The glossy production seems a bit too heavy for the band to carry. Vocals and lyrics are medocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digging their own Hole.","review":"All I gotta say is this: Courtney, you cannot sing. Why try to attempt something you're just not good at? And for the rest of the band, learn to play around with some different guitar effects, get creative. Also, why don't you guys sit down and write an actual song! Good idea! instead of having Kurt Cobain or Billy Corgan write them for you. This is like the Spice Girls of alternative. All manufactured, all hyped up for nothing. Do yourself a favor and buy Human Waste Project's cd instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Job Courtney....NOT!!!","review":"1st you live off the fame of your dead husband then you take credit for lyrics that Billy Corgan helped write!

Too bad it never gets much airplay. The first Hole song I ever heard was Celebrity Skin. This album might not be a good intro into who Courtney Love was, but it is a great rock record. Wallowing in Smashing Pumpkins alternative while still holding a Nirvana like edge, Hole outshines them both by making an album with 12 very good songs on it. Neither Smashing Pumpkins or Nirvana, despite their impact can say they have made an album without a dud on it. So Courtney love, with bruised lyrics and a craving for acceptance, outshines her mentors on this album. However, there is something missing on this album. These songs have a tight finish to them, whereas Nirvana's Nevermind didn't. What makes Nevermind a classic, even with duds (Polly) thrown in, is that raw edge that Hole refuses to let come out in this CD. Even with that slight touch of credibility taken away, this is a very good CD and a great band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this what rock music is coming to?","review":"Celebrity Skin is the only good \\"Rock\\" song on the entire album. The lyrics in the rest of the songs look like they were written by Hole but they don't sound like Hole. Their music in the past was harsh rock music, and if that's what you're looking for just buy the old Hole, not the \\"new Bananarama\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never buy a cd where the \\"Hit\\" is the first song...","review":"The first song \\"Celebrity Skin\\" was catchy, the other woman in the song was nice, but after the first song... It goes downhill real fast. I would have preferred an album full of cynical fluff like the first song, instead of boring crap like the rest of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Hole is this?","review":"This is not the same Hole that stunned the rock community with their first album. Perhaps because Courtney was unable to find any more of her late husband's lyrics, or maybe they just peaked already. Either way, this disk sounds like a Smashing Pumpkins album with Courtney Love singing vocals rather than Billy Corgan, whom helped produce and compose many of the tracks on this new release.They have a poppy new sound, are a little more upbeat, and probably have a hit on thier hands. Everything the first album wasn't(Poppy and upbeat). Giving further credence to those whom say Courtney used songs written by Kurt Cobain on the first album, then needed Billy Corgans help to make a second one. Maybe thier third album will be original, and the band will have found thier voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hole is most possibly the worst band ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Courtney love is stupid stop buying this album and promoting her. She is a NO TALENT. Other than the fact she is simply a slut she would have never even had the chance to appear in the public eye she should do everyone a favor and go kill herself or go to work in a whore house where she belongs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really grows on you...","review":"I really LIKE this album, despite Courtney Love's, um, checkered past. Her voice sounds better here than on her other work, and the song-writing is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodic Angst!","review":"I used to think that Courtney Love existed as an artist simply because she was Kurt Cobain's wife. This album has made me a fan. She is just as talented as her husband. And the band is one of the best today. This album screams and shouts with a purpose. And Celebrity Skin has got to be one of the best rock songs ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Hole CD","review":"This CD is the best-it was my favorite cd of 1998, and i couldnt believe it didnt win any of the grammys it was nominated for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hole fan .","review":"It's great, but too commercial. Love has left her REAL roots and went to pop. But, on a lighter note, my favorites are \\"Malibu\\", \\"Reasons to be Beautiful\\", \\"Use Once and Destroy\\", \\"Northern Star\\", \\"Boys on the Radio\\", and \\"Playing your Song.\\" Miss Love sure has proved that she can be normal, but underneath it all...TRASH IS TRASH. And this album is not trash, just her new attitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"The title song caught my attention before I bought it. I was expecting more of the same but ended up with a bunch of corny songs with cheesy lyrics. I can't believe that this is the best they could come up with after the amazing \\"Live Through This.\\" It just makes me wonder how much Kurt Cobain had to do with the last album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I was really knocked-out by the first single, \\"Celebrity Skin\\", so I bought it. Well, Once you get past the title track, it's just a bunch of trivial songs by an over-produced garage band. Where is the angst that I used to love hearing from Courtney? It sure is missing from all but one song on this album. I guess she traded it in for all of her success. I'm a musician and there are a few songs that I would have been ashamed of if that had been MY voice. She sounds better when she screams. Unfortunately, she TRIES to sing too much. I want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your money.........","review":"ok listen here, ive had enough of this grungy kind of music, the only song even worth listening to is \\"celebrity skin\\". the rest are just a bunch of grungy scrap metal. if i didnt feel so sorry for this cd theni would put one star but just to be a little nice i put two."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I bought the Hole thing...","review":"Yawn, I can imagine teams of Kurt \\"No Brain\\" fans and Hole teeny boppers loving this stuff. Her \\"^%&ing great album\\" (her words) is hard to stay awake to. The first song teamed with its video was a ploy to get people to buy, but the rest of the CD is close to the best of Yoko Ono's melodious work. You'd have to really hate rock to really like this album. I give it 2 stars since I have bought far worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two words for you: The Bangles","review":"Well, OK. So the lyrics are a bit more profound than the Bangles, but compared to the sonic innovations of Portishead and Massive Attack, this music is really flat. And while only the most cynical moron would ever believe that Courtney had her late husband killed, the Nick Broomfield documentary leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Oops, can't say that, though. If you do you might incur the vicious wrath of Love's legal team. At least she cares about the grand American tradition of suing people. Don't fall for the manipulation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different Courtney","review":"This CD finds Courtney Love in a reflective mood following the death of her husband, Kurt Cobain. It's in stark contrast to the other Hole albums ...this one is far more polished and commercial, and it leaves behind the grunge genre. Only a few songs on this CD even hint at the anger of \\"Pretty on the Inside\\" or \\"Live Through This\\". That said, it still contains plenty of good songs to enjoy. The title track is possibly the catchiest song ever written ...you hear it once, and it never goes out of your head. This may not be the Hole that we know and love, but it's still a cut above...Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rollercoaster ride of burnt emotions and drowning images","review":"The final word from Hole(sad to say)and probably their best hour. Covered in a glossy pop polish, the album still speaks to punk fans(I would hope)with a handful of tight, hard-rocking songs and Courtney Love's gutsy vocals. It's a head-swirling collage of tide-tossed, sunburnt images, rivalling some of the best rock of the 1990's. I don't see how you could find a more fantastic piece of hard-pop music than \\"Boys On the Radio\\"(which, in an earlier incarnation, was once called \\"Sugar Coma\\" with different lyrics). I can't get enough of this record and always want to share it with those who still remember what the essence of rock and roll is(and should be)all about. (**those seeking the Japanese bonus track \\"Best Sunday Dress\\", try searching out the CD-single of \\"Celebrity Skin\\" pressed in Australia. It's fairly easy to find in import bins or on-line and features \\"Best Sunday Dress\\" and the demo-version of \\"Dying\\" as extra cuts).

The music sounds hollow and contrived,almost plastic. Really sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh!","review":"\\"Live Through This\\" was EXCELLENT - Courtney Love was angry and we loved her for that but now she's just an overly-opinionated drama queen.

Her voice sounds slick with expensive recording & coaching/lessons and the music totally calculated & formula-ic. Not only did she not write most of the songs (or none??) but she wouldn't even have made the album if Billy Corgan hadn't convinced her she \\"needed\\" to put out another one. Too busy being \\"famous\\" and so eager to be commercial, this woman is no artist; and as strong as she's perceived to be, how come she always needs the help of a man to put out music?? Critics & fans seem to love it, but maybe I'm just not a sucker for the Hype Machine like most people."},{"rating":"1","title":"There should be a 0 star or less for this...","review":"(to \\"Celebrity Skin\\") Oh buy this album...

Cliche driven formula rock that mimics all the worst moments of Sunset Strip's eighties big hair bands. I can't wait for the Axl Rose remixes! She tried, but she couldn't do it. Bye-bye Courtney, Neely O'Hara is waiting at the bottom of the pool."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Kurt....no Hole....","review":"It's obvious the Kurt Cobain was the true driving force behind the last Hole album. Courtney, although a talented performer, has never shown a true ability to write. Many music fans got the feeling the the last Hole album was Cobain throwaways or gifts to Courtney. Now she has proven herself to be the 'bogus' talent that we all suspected with this album. Finding a difficult middle ground between her new cleaned up self and the old herion whore look- she finds herself no where- with no guidence from her late husband she just flounders here with a sad tribute to nothing important."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE HOLE TRUTH","review":"Finally, the truth is revealed. It is as obvious as the day is long that the songwriter for the band Hole died right after the release of their seminal album \\"Live Through This.\\" Too bad, because Hole's lead singer can pull it off pretty well.

However, you don't have to be an Angeleno to appreciate the band's incredible melodies and Courtney Love's lyrics. Celebrity Skin is not another Live Through This and therein lies the beauty of this cd. I love Live Through This but been there done that.

There are some personal insights about the hardships suffered by American servicemen in Japanese POW camps. It is truly an inspiring tale of persistence, faith, and the bond shared the men who survived through their captivity during the war.There is definitely a lot of history here, and not simply the sterile facts, but also the personal stories of those who lived through some of the worst parts of WWII.

You can click on a word over and over to hear the pronunciation. You can also record yourself and compare your pronunciation to that of the native speaker. The software focuses on basic vocabulary like numbers, colors, greetings, travel phrases, food, etc. It has games to reinforce learning.I like the fact that they show you each word written in Bengali script which helps with word recognition when I read Bengali. I highly recommend getting this and 101 Languages of the World. I am giving it 4 stars because they don't teach as many words as I would have liked. I estimate that there are about 400-500 words.

The vocabulary is quite limited, and also not very culturally appropriate. For example, I don't see myself going to Calcutta and asking where I can buy pizza, a hamburger, and a beer. Also it would be more useful to know how to say sari, blouse, and bindi, than shorts and tee-shirt. The lessons were also too focused on nouns and very few verbs (if any?) were taught.

But where is \\"Pictures of matchstick men\\" by Status Quo? \\"96 tears\\"? \\"Western Union\\"? Also, the fourth cd is made up of mostly terrible stuff that should have been left buried in a grave of obscurity. Still, there is nowhere else to get all of these \\"almost\\" hits that are so dear and close to the heart of this listener who was an adolescent in the late sixties. I love this sound - a drum, a bass, a lead guitar, a vocalist, and maybe an organ player. A must for 60's punk rock and psychedelic fans. Is it worth the big price even with the missing elements? Yes!!! Get it and spend several weeks enjoying the 118 songs here that you probably haven't heard in decades!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying, but...","review":"The stuff on here is a little polished for my taste, most doesn't sound natural (like most pop music), it sounds like it was crafted in a studio. Though there are some great punkers on here like the Gonn track, \\"Knock Knock\\", and the Unrelated Segments. Fans of '60s pop music probably won't like it though, neither will die hard garage fanatics like me. But it is good to have, cause much of this stuff isn't available anywhere else. For me, I'll stick to the Back From the Grave series, which rarely leaves my CD player, Nuggets unfortunatley hardley ever goes in my CD player, though sometimes I need to listen to \\"Sugar and Spice\\", so it's good to have around."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-hit wonders for a reason.","review":"I wonder if we'll see a Nuggets in 2040 with \\"Oops...I Did it Again\\" or \\"Wannabe,\\" because that's basically what this box set amounts to. I saved the $$ and bought this based upon a tremendous number of positive reviews. The first listen was fantastic. Every listen since then got worse and worse and I sold the damn thing a few weeks ago. Like any other musical movement (grunge being the best example), the psychedelic genre appears to have been populated with a few true artists and otherwise crammed full of no-talent hacks. There are some great bands represented here and a few great tracks worth repeated listening (Nazz, 13th Floor Elevators), but there is not enough material to even fill two discs, let alone four. Discs three and four wear thin very quickly, especially with the dopey frat rock of \\"Wooly Bully\\" and \\"Louie Louie.\\" Lavishly packaged with wonderful liner notes, it's a shame the material represented simply wasn't of a higher caliber."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT TUNES - LOUSY FORMAT","review":"I'm a little more than ticked off that this beautiful compilation of songs were all (with exception of 2 or 3 songs) recorded in monaural rather than stereo.

Rhino has used the mono versions that were used on 45rpm recordings for almost all of these selections. Many, if not most, of these recordings were also available in stereo versions from albums. Though the 45rpm record was an inherently superior technology, the 45s that I purchased in this era were always inferior to the stereo album versions that I purchased after I decided I wanted more of a groups work. The 45s were inferior in frequency range and the quality of the mastering. Even with a fairly good system (Sony DA 3300 ES receiver) these recordings sound like what came out of a 1960s era car radio. Too bad the product description didn't indicate that the selections were mono."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant !!!! Never Listen to \\"Classic Rock\\" Radio Again!","review":"Perfect Time Capsule of the American 60's rock scene. Let's hope that Rhino puts out another collection.

Actually it gives a decent picture of the GARAGE BANDS that existed during the era, but has very incomplete coverage of the pyschedelic music scene. I suggest listening to the Technicolor Web of Sound website to get a more realistic sample of 60s psychedelia. Of course, you will hear some of this box set's more psychedelic tunes there, but also alot more.

Why anyone would want to make a movie like this, much less act in it, is beyond me. It depicts a bunch of self-obsessed and depressed people(unless they're two-dimensionally portrayed egotistical and superficial snobs to whom the depressed losers feel superior) doing stupid things and being nasty to one another. You just feel sad and frustrated after watching it, because it doesn't reflect life as it really is, or at the very least, it doesn't give a full view of life, just the small, mean, petty, grimy, sordid vision of one unhappy screenwriter who thinks they're being deep and insightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for movie buffs","review":"This film is really only for movie buffs or historians. For a contemporary audience, there is little here that is redeeming or worthwhile. The culture has absorbed anything novel in this movie and moved on.

Having been interested by some of Nicholson's work (Head, Witches of Eastwick, Chinatown) I thought, in a weak moment, that it might be good to own a copy of this.It is a film about people I wouldn't want to know relating deeply with other people I wouldn't want to know and has few other qualities which stand out after a first viewing. I give it two stars rather than one because it was, I suppose, professionally done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Overrated","review":"This wasn't very good. It wasn't very interesting.

Total waste of some talented people.","review":"I am mystified as to why so many people think this film is so great. (But then, I feel the same way about \\"Citizen Kane\\"!) Nicholson's character is a worthless, heartless, rude jerk from the beginning to the end, and all the other characters are either stupid and pathetic (like Karen Black's character and the oil-rig buddy) -- or totally boring, like Nicholson's character's family.

Hearing that his father is dying, he returns home, reluctantly taking his pregnant airhead girlfriend. (Ironically, she's into singing country-western songs that grate on Nicholson.) Embarrassed by her lack of polish, Nicholson stashes her in a nearby motel while he visits his family. While there he seduces his brother's bride-to-be, but she refuses to go with him because he loves nobody and nothing. After leaving with his girlfriend, Nicholson decides to return to his home and pursue his new-found love.I have no idea why this movie is held in such high regard."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Classic 70s Movie!","review":"Jack Nicholson plays a concert pianist who works on oil rigs and has a beautifully singing girlfriend who is employed as a waitress. Both lead drifting, not too happy lives. Karen Black, his girlfriend, puts up with mistreatment and infidelity while Jack constantly mistreats her and longs for someone else. She even gets left in a motel room for two days while he visits his family! A good story of a man with talent who can't seem to get it together and take himself in a direction which would make his life meaningful. A visit to a father who is dying is in order but the son is lost and making more mistakes along the way. His cruelty alarms people and he doesn't seem to know where it is coming from. A very good character study without obvious answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"YFT on the Kindle","review":"I am so grateful to have this book available on my Kindle.

The book also appears to be poorly proofread, as some sentences don't parse and there are typographical errors in printed code. All these stylistic errors make the book much more difficult to use, as it takes more time and effort to locate and absorb the important content.The book does not include a disk or CD with source code printed in the text, and the authors' web site includes code for only a small minority of the programs mentioned in the book.

Every other chapter was a flashback. I was very dissappointed with this and I did not feel it supported the series. I am a big lost fan and I found this to be a poorly written story.

When I got it home and checked it out I was not that impressed. It seemed very complex to set up in your car to work through the FM radio. The radio sat in my closet in the box for almost a year. Recently I bought a new vehicle which had XM radio. I loved it and being a baseball fan the ability to listen to live Play by Play was great. It got me thinking about the SkyFi3 that I had at home. I checked around the internet looking for something that would allow me to listen at home. After checking out all the reviews, etc. I decided on the Altec Lansing XM3120.I was able to pick it up on ebay for $19.95 w/free shipping. It arrived two days later and using the Roady XT adapter I set it up. Well it worked perfectly and the reviews about the volume being too low didn't appear to hold water. I was able to use both the vloume control on the unit as well as the radio remote and it is plenty loud enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Altec Lansing is a Great Item!","review":"For such a small item, it has a lot of power. It can really be loud when you crank up the volume and it does not sound like it is coming from a tin can. The sound is great!There are only 2 things that needs improvement, the radio needs an on and off button. To turn it off, you have to unplug it. Also, unless you have a clear unobstructed view from the window where you can place the antenna, you wont get good reception for your XM.All in all, it wasn't a bad buy for the price.

I was very impressed after I hooked up the system and heard the quality sound radiate from the Altec system.I decided on Altec due to its size (bigger Boomboxes are available but space hogs). Its stylish design fits nicely on my bookshelf and it's clean design goes well with any decor.One thing purchasers need to be aware of is that the antenna needs to be placed close..really close, to a window to receive the satellite signal.

It is really a nice looking unit, but it is SO light and feels cheap. Turned up full blast you can barely hear it from the next room. I wish I would have went for the bigger \\"boom box\\" style. So, if you want a docking station for your XM reciever for a small room, this would be a good buy, but if you need \\"punch\\" to deliver volume for noisy areas I would certainly go for a more powerful unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Book about Guatemala's recent history","review":"I highly recommend this book, which is both a personal narrative and an overview of Guatemala's history.

Then Dave Walker left and the band got Jackie Lynton, one of the worst moves of their entire career. (He must have worked cheap) Not only were his vocals weak, the songs he contributed were bad. Kim Simmonds probably should have quit for a while, but he got pulled back in by his brother/manager for the Boogie Brothers period. That review will follow shortly.

This book is not about Arcadia, Michigan, at all, but about an improbable, contradictory young man and his contrived 'adventures'. Reading the entire book requires a herculean effort, though it is rather like a lurid auto accident - you know you shouldn't gawk but you can't seem to stop yourself. This reader's advice: save your [money] for a few drinks at the Big Apple Bar in Arcadia. That is where you'll meet the real characters and participate in far more intelligent conversation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie??

Supposedly set in Arcadia, Michigan, I could find few references to Arcadia which were accurate. This was a disappointing purchase and I cannot recommend it to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Trackball I've ever owned","review":"I hesitated to spend $100+ on a trackball, but I've had no regrets since I've been using it. It is worth every cent.I don't use the 6 \\"quick buttons\\" on the top of it, nor the scroll button, since they are hard to reach, but the four basic buttons and the smooth and heavy roll of the trackball are indispensable.I especially like the tactile \\"click\\" that each of the four main buttons give when they are pressed. This is a minor point, but it makes using the trackball feel solid instead of mushy.I didn't like the blue plastic ball that came with it, so I dropped a billiard ball in and it is perfect. Very smooth, very heavy, very precise. (This is via USB on Mac OS X.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Feeling down?

The first time we set the alarm clock & woke up to coffee all over the counter & down the newly painted, white cabinets, ugh!

First off, the coffee reservoir is woefuly inadequate, unless you drink coffee so weak expressly to avoid it having any flavor. It randomly decides to spray coffee all over the counter with no warning, the grinder is louder than can be possibly justified, so forget early morning auto brew unless you have a a soundproof kitchen, and the most disturbing thing, the steam from the brewing chamber travels up the grinder chute, dampens the coffee, leeching it of flavor and turning it into sludge. If the best part of waking up is Folgers in your cup, this may be the machine for you, however if you actually like your coffee to have any flavor, don't even CONTEMPLATE buying this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"brewing 'defect'","review":"Great grind and brew EXCEPT that the basket component pops open while brewing and the coffee leaks all over the counter.

And YES it periodically without warning clogs up in the middle of brewing and you wind up with coffee all over the counter. We don't even use the grinder anymore, thinking that might be the problem but it still clogs. We thoroughly wash every component before every pot of coffee that we make and that doesn't keep it from clogging. We have the coffee ground in a medium grind just in case it was too fine and that might be the problem....to no avail...it STILL about 1 in every 10-12 pots makes a gigantic mess.

It is keep clean (ALL components) and descaled, yet the coffee always tastes the same to me-sub-standard. I have had various Krupps heating pad brewers (which made good coffee) and decided it was time to get this all in one unit. I have the same compliants others have about the moisture and steam creeping up into the bean holder, lukewarm coffee after an hour and finding coffee spilling from God know's where onto the counter.

Easy; people!You can't beat the flavor of the coffee. I used to brew Dunkin Donuts coffee in my old pot and it just tasted like any other coffee to me. When I grind and brew Dunkin Donuts coffee beans in this pot it tastes like the real thing! Everyone comments on how good my coffee is now!The coffee stays warm long enough for us. The less left in the pot, the quicker it cools, but we love the fact that the air can't get to the coffee and make it taste stale.I would recomend this pot to anyone who doesn't mind a little bit of clean up time...and when I say clean up time I mean, maybe, 2 or 3 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"No hot coffee","review":"If you like your coffee hot, do not buy this maker.

As the other reviewer I would also recommend an excellent book by Pratkanis and Aronson The Age of Propaganda. Similar price, but much better and much more sophisticated.

Of course, after finding godzillion digits of pi, there is no pattern; just random numbers.

Its over 100 years old and caked with old rosin and dirt. I used the cleaner and what a beautiful violin I have. It removed all of the dirt and brought out the natural wood. Took alot of buffing but it worked.I also did not get the chin cushion. I just hate to give this less stars. I probably would not have used the chin cushion anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Care Pack","review":"Giardinelli Master Violin Care Pack with Chin CushionOK, first I'm going to complain then I shall compliment.

I received the promised pouch, yellow soft cloth, peg grip drops, polish, duster, and that metal thing.

The description and the picture shown on Amazon site leads you to believe that the ET center to be off-white or creamy white. What you get is more of a lemon custard. It clashes with all white decor of my living room. If it's the soft yellow you want, this is a good bet. Putting it together was very simple, no instruction is provided since most of it is already put together for you.

What a joyful surprise. The CD is beautifully designed: you can follow not only the plot but character interactions without that frustrating sense of wondering what this song is really about.

Rage Against the Machine is an awesome band and can kick the crap out of you any time you spin one of their albums. But I scream out in frustration every time I watch this DVD. The reason? They couldn't just play their footage.For some reason, some stupid fool had to insert a large number of random little things of slow-motion and quick cuts to black and white. I was nearly screaming at the TV every time it happened. You'll be rockin' out feelin' the energy of the crowd and Rage and for some reason at some totally unclimactic and random moment it will cut to slow motion. Incredibly annoying. I would have give this 1 star, but I don't think I can do that with Rage Against the Machine on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its good","review":"but not great. The live show is excellent, and you get to see how crazy their fans get. But the slow-mo is just horrible, it really makes the DVD look bad. But besides this, you also get some information as far as where they are coming from politically, and some documentary footage with the band. Overall its good, but there are some things you will find annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"You gotta see this!!","review":"I bought this dvd just to see Testify live (my favorite song at the time), but performances like Bulls On Parade, Sleep Now In The Fire, Freedom, and Know Your Enemy, make you really notice what a talented group they really are. Just when you think Tom's at the top, you hear something even more challenging. This dvd documents Rage at their finest. Just the political message in No Shelter makes you think about if we really need those 'dope nikes'. Every Rage fan NEEDS to see this."},{"rating":"2","title":"ahhhh - a rock concert video that rocks.......","review":"Great rock concert, captured very well. Except for a few cheesy slow-motion effect edits, this DVD is fantastic. Sound is very good, (crank it up), just enough crowd shots to give the feeling of being there, closeups of the band are intense, and their playing is solid. This is one of the best rock concerts I've seen on DVD yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst music DVD I have ever seen","review":"Please do not waste your money on this [item]. The fact that every swear word is censored makes the gig unlistenable. Imagine listening to Killing in the name with someone turning the volume down every 5 seconds and you get the picture.Deeply disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with the political BS?","review":"After every song there is a political documentary about how the Mexican people are getting screwed. Who cares? If I want to hear about I'll turn on CNN. The most annoying part of this is there is no way to play just the songs so you have to sit with the remote to fast forward through this stuff. Stay away from this one. The self titled DVD is so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Rage","review":"This DVD really is Rage's best work besides their stuff from Renegades. It takes the best songs from Battle of LA, self-titled, and Evil Empire and puts them all in one concert. Here are the songs on it (in order): Testify, Guerrilla Radio, People of the Sun, Calm Like A Bomb, Sleep Now In The Fire, Born of A Broken Man, Bombtrack, Know Your Enemy, No Shelter, War Within A Breath, Bulls On Parade, Killing In The Name, Zapata's Blood, and Freedom. Before you buy this DVD though you should definetly buy the self-titled Rage CD because of Killing In The Name and Know Your Enemy. Killing In The Name's classic verse: \\"F**K you I won't do what ya tell me\\" is said by the audience instead of Zack and is barely audible. Then the part where Tool sings in Know Your Enemy is instead sung by Zack who isn't a bad singer but the part was meant for Tool. I also think they should of played Wake Up on it, but oh well, it's still an excellent DVD so get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Rage","review":"RATM is one of the greatest bands ever. It's not even debatable. I miss them, their music, and their message. This is of course a must have for any Rage fan. I can't find anything bad to say about this dvd or anything Rage put out. I highly recommend you pick this up if you don't own it.By the way, this dvd is NOT out of print. There are some sellers, here on Amazon, who are trying to rip off us Rage fans by charging $45 and up for this dvd. Those sellers should know that this dvd can be found, BRAND NEW, for 13 bucks or less. Don't believe me? Check out pricegrabber. Note to those sellers: just because Amazon doesn't carry this dvd, does NOT mean it's out of print."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live is Best","review":"RATM fan or not, the intensity and energy this band gives off in their live performances is undeniable. It is this same energy and intensity that initially drew me to them, wheich led to learning more about the substance of their messages, which led to an understanding of other views and opinions previously foreign to me. The live footage in this DVD in Mexico City is incredible, and the additional featurettes can open your mind to what they're about. Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest Bands Ever","review":"This DVD is Great...And if you are a fan of RATM then this is a must buy!!! [....] The Music is as good as ever.

Callas is good but nothing more. She is dramatically uninteresting and almost boring sometimes. Ebe Stignani and Carlo Tagliabue are past their prime and wobbly. The only somewhat interesting main cast member is the Manrico of Gino Penno. He is not the league of Franco Corelli, Jussi Bjorling or Placido Domingo, whom I consider the best in the role, but he does a good job with the role.Antonio Votto is somewhat uninteresting also. We get none of the exciting dramatic reading like we get from Karajan or Serafin. It is much more sedated.So to conclude, this performance is not recommended to anyone except those of has to have every live recording of Callas' Leonora."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very confusing and technical","review":"This book may have some examples that work but the whole context is utterly confusing. I have it because it's what I'm using for my OOP programming class and I wish they didn't use it! It gets me so frustrated just going through it that I was asking the teacher if I should drop programming altogether. In reading another post, I see that a University teacher wrote that they didn't like this book as the students start blaming themselves for not understanding the concepts when it's really the books fault. I was guilty of feeling that way but in talking with other classmates and in reading these reviews from BEGINNERS, this book is definitely not worth it! If you are an experienced C++ or Java programmer you will probably understand the book pretty well as there are experienced people posting their thoughts but for the beginner it's a no no!

There is an incredible amount of information. You will learn OOP, TCP/IP, multi-threading, some ADO.NET and a whole lot more. One of the problems is that since this book covers so many different topics, most of time you're really only scratching the surface. That isn't all bad however, as you will get a basic understanding of a lot of different subjects and from there you can pick up other books that delve deeper and you can go through them with more confidence. One other problem is that the book seems to get quite dry and after awhile it feels like a chore just to get through to the next chapter.This book packs in loads of examples, quizes and excercises that force you to really learn each topic covered. Some excersises can actually get quite tough, which is good.

In my opinion, this is what's very important. Writing Console applications is not as important as writing an application using Winforms, and the book encourages it early on. The book is *heavy*, and it has plenty of exercises after each chapter - though not as challenging (seasoned C.S. student), it's a good practice, and they require that the reader write the solution using GUI.

Even if it were only that single color's description I would not be able to use the test because of the icky energy attached to such blatant bigotry. I must also add that the positive language attributed to the conformity of selecting the four primary colors within the first five positions rings so strongly of corporate elitism and social conformism that I am not surprised to learn that human resource professionals use the test.

Unfortunately they are NOT specific to you. They are true for 99% of the planet. If you read the statements for ANY choice of colors you will see they all sound true, a bit like the astrology section of your Sunday magazine.You may prove this to yourself by doing the test to someone else but selecting the wrong readings without telling them.

Sadly, the powers that be have gutted its weapons systems to test a theory of theirs. When she shows that it can work, other PTB decide that she is an embarrassement to them and send her packing to Basilisk station, the armpit assignment of her majesties space navy.Honor, compentant as any good hero should be, cleans up house and finds that perhaps all is not as simple as the assignment would have it appear.Excellant book and well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!!

There was too much plot. I appreciate the fact that their was a women role model but still as a female I think it was way too predictable. What's this going on and on about Honor's bad looks-it wasn't from lack of personal care. Lastly, toward the end of the book I knew exactly what was going to happen and how.

I've just finished the sixth book.This first book, more than any other in the series, focuses on the mechanics of Weber's pseudo-science for faster than lightspeed travel. I enjoyed it, but I know some won't. Regardless, don't let it bog you down: after he covers it here, it is only mentioned briefly in future works.The only reason I give this book (and the series as a whole) four stars instead of five is that the heroine is a trifle too lucky. Don't get me wrong, she largely makes her own luck. But coincidence plays a hair too big of a factor for me to be truly comfortable. If it weren't for that, I would gladly label this the best science fiction I've ever encountered."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Started Out That Way","review":"I started out on this series way down the line and am now filling in from the beginning. Surprise, surprise! The first book in the series is every bit as well written as the last. When I began reading David Weber, I found his ultra detailed appproach somewhat tedious. Before anything happened you found out what everyone in the scene was thinking and had been thinking for the last 20 years and what their parents had thought and done, the color of the carpet, the barometric pressure, etc.etc. Come on! Get on with the story! But, at the same time, I realized that Weber was building a universe that I would be unable to abandon. It is a pleasant addiction. I am a fan of the Space Opera beginning with E.E. Smith, Phd. and right on down the line. Weber's version is the current State of the Art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Military SciFi","review":"I loved this book and most of the others in the series. Good action, characters with depth and actions with consequences. From a writing perspective, I think the first 3 or 4 are the best. The last two have a derivitive feel and lost the edginess of the first few books.I really like the universe that David Weber has put together here with the interplay of the technology.

I was not disappointed, in fact; Weber is officially on my list of \\"Favorites\\", along with Steven Brust (though I stay away from his Dumas retellings), David Drake, and Robert Asprin.

That being said, got very curious about the Honor Harrington novels, so gave On Basilisk Station a shot. Loved it.Thought Honor was a great character, and Weber did a great job in the creation of the universe. I haven't read any other novels in the series, but really hoping to get back to it soon.It gave me nostalgia of one of my favorite animes, an oldie space opera from the late 80s known as Legend of the Galactic Heroes.

In fact I was very pleased with this book from cover to cover. (Well, actually, I didn't like the cover, but that's the ONLY thing I didn't like.) I found the style to be intelligent, relaxed, easy flowing and yet compelling. The plot was interesting and thought provoking. The characters were VERY likable and I really cared about them.

I don't mind the details, but please at least make them mildly interesting. I found myself skipping 2-3 paragraphs at a time. Character development is also very shallow.

Just looking at them I could tell they were well read. Not your usual Fast paced SF story On Basilisk Station(OBS) builds the history and develops the character of Honor Harrington. OBS is a story that has thrills and chills and a few laughs along the way. not for everyone OBS is the start to a great series. Honor has been compared to Capt Janeway of Star Trek Voyager fame. I think this is a diservice to both characters. while Jnaeway is a strong willed and compassionate Harrington is like her TreeCat Nimittz calm and collective when need but can show her fangs when rubbed the wrong way (And She Is in This Book). a good read if you can find it( Iwas lucky to find the first five books and will enjoy reading them.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much technobabble","review":"The characterization was terrible. Only Honor and her executive officer had a little depth. Almost all the other characters had no distinguishing features except their physical description and their job duties.Too much time was spent in the battle descriptions at the end, particularly in the dialogue. Once you strip away the little characterization there is, you're left with spaceship velocity descriptions.

Perfect Honor got dishonored for reasons outside of her control, fine, life isn't fair. But it just seemed a little too set-up for me how her defamation managed to get her at an important military post just in time to save her nation from invaders. Now if she coped with her unjustly lowered status by swallowing it, working hard, and gradually winning back the respect of her peers, this would have been a very different book.However I did read one more Honor Harrington book, Flag in Exile, which I like much better, so consider this review as two-and-a-half stars instead of just two."},{"rating":"1","title":"just plain bad","review":"I was reccommended by my friend to start the \\"awesome\\" David Weber series.

Next, the literature was very direct and not very interesting. Lastly, the plot was very predictable. I knew exactly what was going to happen and how!

It was an excellent set at the time. Though, why RCA chose an unknown conductor conducting a studio/recording symphony orchestra for such a project is beyond me. Since they did, and since all that other music is out there, they could have packaged this as a budget two-CD set and include the rest (or most) of the performances that were on that three-record set.As stated above, the interpretations are straight-forward presentations. Nothing particularly individual about them like one gets from Svetlanov. Fine, no-nonsense, performances. Just nothing that really jumps out and says buy me; other than the fact that you do get all three of Borodin's symphonies on one CD. That alone makes it a good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...","review":"Kenny Rankin has to be one of my favorite male vocalist for the sheer purity in his voice.

The LEDs look nice, not a perfect match to the XBox green but that's fine with me. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the construction. Its made out of acrylic instead of the hard plastic that the factory fan is made out of. When I reinstalled the screws I noticed it put too much pressure on the acrylic, it caused one of the fans to grind against the housing. It eventually stopped spinning altogether. I loosened the screws a little bit, just enough to relieve the pressure but keep the shell housing on the console together. It has been working prefect since. The noise of the fans seem to be about the same as the factory fans. All in all, I'm very happy with the fan. I would recommend it as a replacement fan or an upgrade, especially if you plan on using a clear case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works...maybe better","review":"The fan works pretty well.

I bought this fan since it moved more CFPM of air but unfortunately it did not help my issue. My overall fix was to just mod my xbox case and install a small fan that would draw air in and blow it directly on the GPU heatsink- problem solved. The Whisper fan is quiet but to tell the truth the stock Xbox fan was quiet too.

I got it repaired at a local shop. They recommended a fan \\"fix\\" that basically re-pinned the stock cooling fan to run at its highest speed all the time rather than throttling down. Needless to say this maximizes the fan noise all the time and it's a noisy fan anyway. Instead, I bought the whisper fan and installed it myself (with some help from the Internet). I would not recommended it if you're not handy, but if you follow instructions you'll be OK. The result is a cool and quieter 360."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet","review":"Love this.

I had cracked my case many times before so it pops open pretty easily now. I used a hole saw and made a doorknob sized hole over the chipset (with an 80mm fan grill) to suck in cool air after the 3 RRD from overheat. Nice green glow from fan grill up top and out the back. Used the heat sink fix along with arctic silver and this fan and all is well again with this launch XBOX- cool air in the top, exhaust out the back. Don't recommend as an just an upgrade path, it really is the same except for green light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, Quality Upgrade","review":"My OEM fan started sounding like a cross between a jet engine and a vacuum cleaner before one of the two fans just quit. I went with the green Whisper upgrade, and it is much quieter. It whurrs whereas the old fan made a hairdryer-type sound. The green light is unobtrusive, and it does a fine job of pushing air.

This fan IS quiet and if its not quiet in your xbox you have another problem, this fan runs a nice little purr and I love the glow out the back of my 360. Very nice over the crappy original fan. Note to people installing it, this will void your warranty, and when you install it test it to make sure all of the lights and power connections for the fan are good.

Well in that case, save your money and your warranty. Whisper is just as loud. True, the sound is a little different - I'd say a lower harmonic whine versus the original fan.

It is a much better production, and more sonically interesting and challenging than this album ever will be. For some idiotic reason, the producer of this music decided that Roundabout would make a great choice to translate into classical music - and then decided to add Steve Howe and Jon Anderson.

I have tried it in several currency pairs, and it did not work.Now, on further study, I came to know WHY. Any such 'systems' do not and CANNOT work.Why cannot they work? Because, if it did work, then all the people in Wall Street will buy the book for 50 bucks and start making millions.But, as we know, Forex, stock etc are zero sum game. Some lose, only then someone wins. So it cannot be that u buy a little book and start winning. It cannot happen that way, because then everybody will follow suit, and your little trick will not work anymore.Finally the author makes many tall claims, but no where I have seen her mention unambiguously, how much SHE makes playing Forex.I don't know, but it seems to me that she also learnt the bitter truth ( that it does not, and cannot work), and thus trying to make money by writing books and taking seminars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpromised, Underdelivered","review":"Thank goodness I didn't buy the book - I borrowed it from a library, and promptly returned it within 3 days. To be fair, the first few introductory chapters were quite useful, but the usefulness stopped there. The following chapters on trendlines, fibonacci levels - these are not new terms to me, but I felt the author didn't make any effort to connect. I tried again to re-read some sections, but gave up. It was obscure, and there was a lot of rambling which totally lost me. Maybe it's me... Anyway, I found other sources online that explained the concepts a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"Before reading this book I was completely CLUELESS! I was actually afraid of Forex because I simply didn't understand it.

Glad I did...now I feel confident in putting some money into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worth the money","review":"This book is as good as any for an introduction but their are many just as good for a great deal less money. The book has numerous type o's and the author, that claims to be a teacher but should claim to be a sales person for esignal, carries on to points that seem to lead no where and forget understandable examples. The examples in this book are like Einstein saying E=MC2, because energy= mass x the speed of light squared. You just feel like well that didn't explain anything. Foget about that waste of time website that's just an ad forum and the CD, which was a reason I bought this book is just as much a waste as the rambles that fill pages of the book to make it seem like you might have gotten your monies worth.

This book is full every kind of writing error there is - grammer, spelling, syntax, sentence structure - you name it. But once I got over that, I found this book to be quite helpful. The book helped me to refocus on the basics of technical trading; namely, support and resistance, the mental processes involved in entering and exiting trades, and getting confirmation from other indicators before entering a trade. These are not new techniques, but they can be lost or forgotten in the daily grind of trading. The book did introduce me to a couple of new indicators, which I look forward to experimenting with. I am an experieced trader, and I'm not sure if a beginner would get enough out of this book to develop a comprehensive trading technique, but it would certainly help. It is user-friendly and easy to read. In short, it has had a positive effect on my trading."},{"rating":"1","title":"blank dvd","review":"The DVD which comes with this book is a blank therefore useless and there is no contact where you can get one which is not blank it seems it is a sales gimmick."},{"rating":"1","title":"smarmy come-on","review":"Have you seen the smarmy come-ons for shonky products? Sometimes advertised on TV or radio. With a free 800 phone number you can call, for free material. Sounds promising, you think. But then when the literature arrives, it's little more than a push to buy the \\"premium\\" stuff. That is what Horner's book feels like. She waffles all over the place, with interminable babble about the greatness of her method. Yet a careful parsing of the book shows little substance. All the while \\"subtly\\" mentioning her website with the hot stuff. Bait and switch.Well, you could save some money and avoid this book. But unlike some others who suggested you visit her website and drop $400, I would recommend also avoiding it. Given the vapidness of the book, it is not a good precursor."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I'm certain the author is well intentioned but she ain't no \\"master teacher\\" as the book flap acclaims.The narrative is jumbled, frequently reptitive but mostly convoluted and cryptic.The charts are so small you can't read the writing and its up to the reader to figure out what the author is trying to reference.I wish I would have \\"listened\\" to what the other reviewers had said.

It seems more theoretical then actually practiced. I think you can find much of the same information on the internet for free. It seems like it is much easier to sell a book throw in some charts then to actually trade the forex. This is certainly the feel I get. The bible of forex I highly doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book in this subject so far","review":"the self claimed 'best kept secret off wall street' got my eyes, but found it's just an almost shameless claim. the 'best' secret is just some well known trading principals that you can find in every trading book, and some charting technique that again you can get from most technical books. It takes some guts to take this junk into public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage! A Monstrosity!","review":"This author has no reason to sell you all her best trading secrets, but she does have a reason to successfully market a dream and make a killing from unsuspecting buyer's hopes and dreams. The \\"information\\" in this book is very vague and incomplete, leaving the reader at a complete loss on trying to learn how to forecast the forex market. Not only does the author tease the reader with bits and pieces of her secret strategy that do not fit together, but the writing in the book is so poor you'd think that a juvenile delinquent wrote the book on a Sunday night for a class project due on Monday. If you want to throw money away, buy this book. Otherwise you'd have better luck in the forex market by throwing darts at currency bills and investing in those."},{"rating":"1","title":"David G.","review":"This is easily the worst book ever written about forex. It's simplistic in the worst possible way and assumes that the readers have a mind of 5 year old child. The trading strategies mentioned in the book are mostly worthless and are based on standard technical indicators, but oversimplified in such a way that they can never actually work in real world trading. Save yourself the money and get a book from more mature writers. Other reviews of this book recommend several very good alternatives so I am not going to repeat it. If you know absolutely nothing about forex, this book may even be more dangerous than no information, because of the mentioned over-simplification."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...","review":"Save your money on thsi book, it seems alll her books talks of the same techniques.

When a girl enters a house and appears from a second floor window, what does that mean? I didn't know, and there was no way to learn. Finally, there are longish periods with just random images, and no audio. You aren't learning anything then.The DVD does include three languages, and in that way it is unique. But if you want to learn Hindi, or teach it to your children, buy \\"Exploring Hindi\\". You will spend MUCH less money and get a much more useful DVD.

It was apparently coming along so poorly, he got Ian Anderson and most of 'Tull to play alonside the London Symphony Orchestra. The arrangements are virtually unchanged from the 'Tull originals, which destroys the whole concept. The only thing missing is the vocals. The one standout exception: Warchild. This one track represents perfectly what the whole project should have been about...almost enough to recommend acquisition. Even Ian says he's never played this. ANY 'Tull album is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess you can't be good ALL the time.","review":"A friend of mine once said, \\"Sometimes the London Symphony Orchestra isn't the London Symphony Orchestra\\" in reference to soundtrack work, referring to the fact (?) that the actual music you hear in the film isn't always what you get on the album that IS performed by the LSO.\\"A Classic Case\\" makes me wonder if that goes for released recordings as well. While the concept of the London Symphony Orchestra doing Jethro Tull SHOULD be really, really cool, the end result is so limp it's as if one is stuck in an elevator listening to the Muzak. It's better-than-average Muzak, but it still doesn't rise above that level. The brass section is particularly pathetic.The only tracks which have any interesting qualities to them is the rendition of \\"Too Old for Rock n Roll; Too Young To Die\\" and \\"War Child.\\" Every other track is lifeless and plodding. It's almost like listening to a university orchestra with an uninspired arrenger and a tired conductor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tull and the LSO Rock!","review":"If you are a lover of rock music orchestrated, this album, \\"A Classic Case: The London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) Plays the Music of Jethro Tull, Featuring Ian Anderson\\" (1985) is a must. The LSO is joined by several members of Jethro Tull and the joint performance is about as good of a recording you will find in this genre. From the powerful opening cut Locomotive Breath, to Fly By Night, to a medley of Teacher/Bungle in the Jungle/Rainbow Blues/Locomotive Breath, to the eloquent treatment of Elegy and Bourree, the album shines. There is something for everyone from power to mellow tunes. A great instrumental accomplishment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really poor","review":"David Palmer did a lot of imaginative string and orchestral arrangements for Jethro Tull back in their early days; his work on the Tull standard \\"A Christmas Song\\" is a particular high point. But these \\"symphonic interpretations\\" of rock never really work and this album is no exception. The arrangements of Tull greats like \\"Locomotive Breath\\" and \\"Living In The Past\\" are leaden-footed and the LSO sounds like the Boston Pops on a particularly bad night. Palmer would be better served either conducting or writing some original works that don't stem from a rock background.

It has nice set of exercise problems but I can promise you that Naive Set Theory by Halmos will still be as painful to read for a beginner in Set Theory.I still stand by my viewpoint that there are m_uch better books in Set Theory than Naive Set Theory and the accompanying exercise book written by Sigler. Simply read one of those modern standard texts and you will be fine. This book has good exercises but you nevertheless need to understand the theory from somewhere. This book intends the reader to read Naive Set Theory which is a hopeless book for an introduction to Set Theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't ask, go buy","review":"I bought the DVD as a present for someone who was unable to see the Planet Green series.

I understand it is difficult to get away from some of the jargon, but I know it is possible to explain math in a more practical way.

Thinking that the same author would do something along the same lines with Precalculus Demystified - I was very disappointed. I'm not a complete dunderhead in maths but I did expect somewhat more of an explanation at each step. A word or two of WHY so-and-so is done in precalculus would not have gone amiss. This book is just another maths book with next to no explanation - just examples and problems. Some graphical illustration, for example, in Chapter 4 would have been enormously helpful.

There are many more great songs, but those are the highlights for me. Rankin's voice is smooth and effortless. I suppose the rap on this album, if there is one, is that it's overproduced and syrupy.

I have also purchased Pimsleur tapes which are excellent but which are very expensive. This course also provides grammar and pronunciation rules that are very helpful and which make this course better in some ways than Pimsleur because many of the sounds in Russian are very subtle and are difficult to pick up when only listening to audio tapes.

The reason I am saying that while this book provides hints and guidance on how to achieve good results, it will not spoon feed very detailed information. The designs and bag/wallet patterns are very nice and I made many friends and relatives happy thanks to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a hint at a great voice","review":"Others have noted that this recording was made in 1956. Of course it is not in stereo, and it sounds like an old acoustic recording. One needs to be a profound Callas-ophile to want to have this album in your collection.Giulini gets a pretty good hand from the hyper-critics at La Scala for his overture.Listening to Callas on this recording is a bit like looking at beautiful scenery through a very dirty window: you can sense the greatness of the voice or the beauty of the scene, but you aren't going to get much else out of this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe for purests","review":"I was disappointed in the recording quality. This was an early \\"live\\" recording and is reflective of that fact. For musical quality stick with either an enhanced recording or a more recent recording. The muffled sound is a definite hinderance to enjoying this otherwise fine opera and magnificent cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job","review":"It got here two day ahead of schedule.

She is the most bitter, nasty piece of toxicity. This show is so boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cinderella for the 21st Century","review":"I love this show. Bethenny is the best friend we all wish we had, and we hope we're at least a little bit like her. We relate to the fact that her childhood was far less than perfect. We know what it's like to work so hard to make your dreams come true. We nearly stand up and cheer when her hard work is rewarded. It's so nice to have a show that simply makes you feel good. Bethenny is smart, sassy and driven, and we fall in love with her new husband and baby right along with her. I can't wait for the new season to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frankie Says \\"Do a Speech on the Titanic\\"","review":"I read this book to make a speech for my AP European History class, and while I was reading it, I slept through a lot of it. Since I did not understand too much of the book, I sunk just like how the Lusitania did. In my opinion, the names of the people were too long (i.e. Wind\\"shaft\\"ston Church\\"n'priest\\"hill\\"n'mountain\\") got me all confused. But on the other hand, Simpson had some pretty good ideas and he seemed like he was a German spy, but he also had British views too. The Titanic is a much easier speech and Kate Winslet gets naked in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!!","review":"This book is a great book. It is full of great ways to think and \\"hear\\" how the Lord speaks to us. It is full of information and ways to communicate with God. I recommend it for anyone who may not know where to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece!","review":"Take your time in reading this book. Relish it. It is deep, rich, and full of insight on hearing God. He reminds us of the statement made by Jesus, \\"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\\" An analogy helps make his point on the importance of hearing God, that like skiing downhill blind, we cannot see even a portion of the future, but the Holy Spirit is our Guide.Two way communication is vital to relationships. In our relationship to God, listening is necessary in prayer. The one who listens to God and responds positively will hear even more, Lord writes. In order to listen effectively, external distractions must be eliminated.There are many practical tips on hearing God more effectively in this book. A review doesn't do justice to the richness of the content. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hearing God","review":"A must read!

This book had nothing to do with romance. It was just another erotic, paranormal piece of garbage. Yes, I did finish it. Afterall, I wasted my money on it. No more Gwendolyn Morris for me. Hopefully, she'll find an editor that will tell her the truth because this is just another example of a publisher printing anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angels","review":"I saw this and then special ordered this book since I really enjoy reading books of interracial romance and fiction , I was extremely dissapointed in this book .The writing was below what I have come to expect and wish to see from any author.The story in and of itself was not bad ..

I'm very grateful for the incredible research Patricia Monaghan put into the book and also for her personal wisdom that brings such rich understanding of the meaning of the Divine Feminine in everyday life. To have these powerful meditations with which to begin my day is a great gift. The meditations about Brigid were especially precious to me when I was in Ireland in February. This book is an awesome collection of Goddess lore and wisdom from all around the world that feeds my spiritual needs and brings me great joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Goddess Companion","review":"This meditation book offers a wonderful, inspiring, global appreciation of the divine feminine.

It is merely a bunch of mostly debunked urban legends. There may actually be some true stories in this book, but you would have to do a lot of research to figure out which ones are actually true.Read News of the Weird (which normally has real stories), or one of the on-line Urban Legend sites if you want to be entertained by such stories. This book is a waste of money. Save your time and trouble and pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had the album in the 70's","review":"Always my favorite album I am terminally ill, when you have no future you enjoy your past. I would love seeing young people to try it keep kenny's music to stay alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was just wondering--","review":"You should consider owning this disc because of the price (cheap), the fact that Joan Sutherland and April Cantelo do some fine singing on it, and because it demonstrates that the world of opera is full of forgotten moments that are quite wonderful. Now that I have listened to it a few times, however, I cannot help but wonder just who it was that told the tenor in the bonus cuts of Lucia, that he could sing. Here is some of the most unattractive singing you will ever hear, anywhere. His sound is always nasal and strangled. Fortunately, he does do diminish some really spectacular singing by Joan Sutherland. I hear that there is always a shortage of tenorial talent, but this defies logic or reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original & reverent Gregorian chants","review":"Oracle is the pseudonym for Joe Taylor who has released four albums to date (2002) of various musical styles. This is his debut and employs the Choir of Mount Angel Abbey for his eleven Gregorian chants. I listened many times but never developed a taste. Good production but I can not recommend unless you are predisposed to male voices singing reverently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I love Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum but Amie & Jason are a big snore. The only mystery here is how I got thru 3 of the five discs. Disc one was okay, although I did find Amie a bit off putting. Disc two I skipped tru every other tract & disc three I skipped thru every tract. The reason I was skipping was the constant interruption of the story for their blossoming romance. Now, I'm all for romance, love & sex but everytime these two stop moving they're all over each other, in the kitchen, the car, a closet, etc & when they weren't fondling each other they were thinking about it. This became syrupy, cloying, tedious & distracting from the story. Even though I skipped thru tracts I was able to follow the mystery line but by disc 3, I didn't care who had kidnapped &/or killed the chicken, I stopped listening. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if the CD had been abridged but, then there might not have been any mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must have missed something","review":"I certainly must have missed something that the other 2 reviewers saw. I admit I haven't read a book for enjoyment in the last 2 years because I've been involved in industry publications. I now have found time and picked this book as my first book. I've gotten about two thirds done and I find it somewhat annoying. She feels close to him because she washed his clothes, and he feels he loves her cooking, because it reminds him of mom.Maybe I haven't been around much. What is the age suggested for this book? I'm thinking maybe tweens??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"I already reviewed this CD but my review isn't listed. If I could I wouldn't have given this any stars. I found this below par for Evanovich, truly foul play. I liked disc 1 but skipped thru many tracts on disc 2 & 3. I could still follow the story, indicating this was a two disc story. Unfortunately by disc three I didn't care about any of the characters, they were silly, childish & annoying. I was rooting for the only good character--The Rooster. I'll never know how the story turned out because I couldn't bring myself to listen any more. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"foul book-","review":"hardly worth the time it took to listen to this audio booki can't believe i finished it--would not recommend to anyone at any age."},{"rating":"1","title":"foul play","review":"Not very good-not even funny! Evanovich needs stop the canned format and turn out a quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Ending!","review":"I was loving this quirky book until close to the end. It was witty, funny and made me laugh out loud. The characters are fun and the thought of a clown losing her job to a chicken is absurdly hilarious! All was going well and I was enjoying the book (probably would have given it a 4 star rating) until the end. The last couple of chapters really didn't fit well. Spoiler Alert**** If the rooster deal was enough to drive Amy away, why did Jake not tell her what really happened in the end? A weather girl - no way! The ending felt too rushed and out of sync with the rest of the book. Wish Evanovich could go back and end this one properly. If I knew the ending was going to be so bad, I would not have read the book and I am a HUGE Evanovich fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"foul play","review":"l really really love all of janet evanovich books and this one was amazing just like the rest keep them coming. she definitely is writing to slow"},{"rating":"2","title":"Foul Play, Janet Evanovich CD","review":"Another great story by Janet.

The book is a light easy read and very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughter IS The Best Medicine","review":"If the book is by Janet Evanovich, then it is terrific and a great purchase for anyone. You need to read her books in the order they have been written and plan on holding your sides because you are always in stitches. I purchase her books, plus listen to them on tape in my car. Foul Play is another winner for Janet. I would advise anyone to purchase this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This chicken laid an egg","review":"Was very disappointed in this book. There seemed to be no real subject matter or substance to the story. I am a big fan of this author but this was not worth getting or reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sure hit for Kander and Ebb fans!","review":"After hearing a bit of this musical while surfing the web, I decided it was worth purchasing. Being a huge fan of Kander and Ebb, especially Cabaret and Chicago--I was not sure what to expect, but I am pleasantly surprised to find that this little known musical is just as endearing. The lyrics are clever and the melodies are beautiful, but it's the perfect combination of both--like in songs like \\"Why Can't I Speak?/ That's A Beginning\\"--that prove that Kander and Ebb are masters of their craft, and Zorba is no exception! I especially enjoyed the revival cast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Alaskan adventure","review":"I recommend this book to readers from 12 to 102. It is a well written gold rush tale filled with plenty of danger,intrigue and wonderful descriptions of the mystical and desolate far north. The characters are memorable and I was quickly drawn into the story of 15 year old Connie (male) Morgan who traveled to Alaska after the demise there of his father, Sam Morgan. Connie soon meets Waseche Bill, who becomes his prospecting partner, mentor and friend. I didn't want their adventures to end...and that's sign of a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful program!","review":"Starry Night is the best astronomy program i have ever seen!

This product is cumbersome, not even a little intuitive, and lacks on screen pop-up windows to identify functions of icons. There is a lot of fluff included, but precious little substance. When I emailed the company complaining of the fact that menu items in my edition were non-functional or non-existent I received a luke warm response stating roughly... \\"too bad\\". The one and only nice touch is it's ability to track and present major satelites... the rest of the graphics are marginal and clutter the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"bought as gift - recipient really likes it","review":"Bought this as gift for someone who's been into astronomy for awhile. I didn't know much about it; had to rely on the reviews of previous purchasers. She told me it's terrific - no problems computerwise and it does everything it advertises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marc Anthony's uprooted album","review":"There isn't a single salsa here...just a collection of ballads and other assorted Spanish pop. Even \\"Ahora quien,\\" which is played on the radio as a salsa, is only present here in ballad form.I don't like English pop, and I don't like Spanish pop. Anybody who feels the same should avoid this album like the plague. It's sort of sad, but from my perspective each successive album from Marc has been worse than the last. This is the worst album yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Adult Contemporary lovers only","review":"This is a solid piece of Adult Contemporary/Pop from this refined vocalist. There really isn't any song I don't like. Jennifer Lopez sure sounds much stronger & better singer on \\"Let's Escape\\" than on her weaker English songs like \\"I'm Gonna Be Alright.\\" Marc really knows his stuff and it shows. Any Adult Contemporary fan should get this album, regardless of weather you understand Spanish or not. Also, know what you are buying. This album has a different cover & title than Salsa version. Plus, there are sound samples of tracks, listen to them before you buy! Recommended to Adult Contemporary lovers only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duh, which way did he go, George? Which way, which way???","review":"As far as I'm concerned, everything after \\"Contra La Corriente\\" has been a disappointment. That CD had it all: erotic as well as sublime love lyrics. His self titled album left me stunned with how pedestrian and stupefyingly bland it was. I expected something much more sophisticated, I mean - this is Marc Anthony. I love Marc's voice and talent, and I understand he wants to try different styles but it's confusing to fans and eventually dilutes his fan base. He should stick to what he does well while learning to write music. Learning an instrument (guitar? piano? a la Alejandro Sanz) wouldn't hurt either."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cat wasting away","review":"Vocally Marc Anthony should be rolling instead of still trying to crack the Mainstream here as a Artist.the cat Can sing but has some of the Most cheesy material&it takes away from His growth as a Artist.\\"Escapemonos\\" with J-Lo is a Bland track that doesn't do him any musical justice whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Que Paso!?","review":"I respect Marc's talent and ability to sing different styles of latino music. His voice is unique and powerful. However, after listening to his prior work, I was disappointed in the lack of Salsa tunes on it. He is Salsa's most visible male singer and so Latinos have come to expect Salsa from Marc. I hear a salsa version of Amar Sin Mentiras will be out as well. That will help!Que viva la Musica!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!??????????????","review":"What is it with this CD???? did J-Ho steal his latin beat!!! where's the salsa and rithmic beats that we're used to get from marc...this might be some new era for him..but come on, you cant sell a CD with ALL 10 songs being slow!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Marc, what happened?","review":"I was very excited to listen to Marc's new album, but as others, I was expecting to hear his salsa in this album. \\"Ahora Quien\\" has been marketed as a salsa hit, and I was disappointed to find it as a ballad on this CD. His other songs were sappy and unmoving, nothing like the slow ballads he has done on previous albums. Nonetheless, it is refreshing to him cover Marco Antonio Solis' classic \\"Amigo.\\" I could have done without this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick of the Drama!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I find the title for the cd Ironic... Okay, I am a fan of Marc Anthony, but come one, we already have enough Christians, and Luis Miguels, we do not need another. Funny but its the same over and over and over, he wines about how she left him, or she cheated on him. I kind of got tired of that three cds ago. Come up with something new Marc please. His first English cd was good, but this cd, is just a Telenovela on Cd. Wine, Wine.If you want a good Latino Flavored Cd, check out Victor Manuel, Travesia. Unlike Marc Anthonys Pop, which has already been done better by Jon Segada 10 years ago. Victor Manuel rocks, and brother has talent. Leave this cd, for the Drama Queens who like to sulk, and wine."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRUE LOVE","review":"I am such a dreamer and am in love with being in love! This cd is much like I am! Marc's emotions come through in his songs. He is magical. You will not regret the purchase of this cd if you want to feel magic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nada Personal","review":"This is a new direction for him, but as always a delight! Marc's voice never fails and in every song you can feel the emotion. Whom ever is a true Marc Anthony fan should pick up this cd and enjoy every second. Marc is truly outstanding! Can't wait for the next album and tour!"},{"rating":"1","title":"p@$$y wooped album no dancing shoes required","review":"If I could rate this with less than 1 star than I would , but I can't. In my opinion this is less than crappy . When I think of mark anthony I wana dance , what the hell happened to this album this seems like j-ho got to him and spoiled his latin flavor.

Then he started whining, shreiking, and turning out garbage like the rest of the talentless musicians of the time. When I first heard Contra La Corriente, I was blown away. Then I got more into his older stuff and continued to love his music even more-I mean is ther a better song than Nadie Como Ella?After his first release \\"Marc Anthony\\" woith Sony, it was clear Marc was interested in only $$ and clearly had forgotten his roots and how he got to where he is. Granted Contra is impossible to top or even replicate, however this ballad laden CD full of whiny romantic mush is an absolute embarassment coming from the \\"King of Salsa\\". Fresh off of perhaps the biggest dissappointment in my Salsa life, \\"Libre\\", this one is even worse!Face facts, Hector Lavoe will ALWAYS be the king of salsa. I never heard of Mr. Lavoe putting out garbage like this when he was alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess MARCLO is in a \\"bad\\"llad mood","review":"Let me start off by saying that there's nothing wrong with Marc Anthony expanding is artistic horizon. But a spanish POP cd...give me a break. On top of that, there all ballads. I waited this long for probably 2, maybe 3 decent songs. Number 1 \\"ahora quien\\", number 3 \\"se esiuma tu amor\\" and number 4 \\"valio a pena\\" are pretty good. Finally, people get off your high horse, there is nothing wrong with being a \\"true\\" Marc Anthony fan and being critical of his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Impressed","review":"I have to be honest. I love Marc Anthony and his ability to complete a smooth transition between English Pop Music and Latin Salsa. However, this new CD was a waste of money if you were expecting his usually AWESOME Salsa & Boleros songs. I did not like this CD and I don't think he should've even attempted to try Latin Pop. Overall, I was expecting better...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed effort","review":"I awaited this release with much anticipation. All other offerings of Marc, for me have been instant successes. I have given this CD several chances and it does grow on you but If a CD doesn't grab me in the first couple of listens then I have a tendency to set it aside in favor of something else. I applaud Marc's effort and have heard him sing other things besides salsa all with great strength,maybe he had some reservations this time out which caused for a less than convincing performance in my opinion. I accept his choices for duets but I don't feel his voice meshes with Jennifer Lopez and believe this duet along with his previous one failed. I now anxiously await Marc's next try."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Puerto Rican \\"Frank Sinatra\\"","review":"No one comes close! he just keeps getting better.

The problem is that I paid $175.00 for this junk blower & the new carburator costs $110.00 installed.So in 4 yrs. it went bad. Here's the kicker, it was used only in the fall so maybe 10 hrs/year.DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL, you'll be sorry you did.Wally"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better not Need Parts","review":"I bought this product at Lowe's at a discount with the actual blower tube missing. Since it is just a piece of plastic my thinking was how much can the tube be for a $200 blower since the whole motor and blower unit itself was intact. The price quoted by Husqvarna dealers was $130 - $150 +!!! Husqvarna Customer No Support was a waste of time. They just say (after a 4 day wait) that the dealer can charge whatever they want and I can only get the parts from the dealer. This may be a decent product - I don't really know since I have not gotten to use it. But keep in mind that if it breaks, even with a small problem, the price of parts alone will exceed what the blower is worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"What they didn't teach you at Antioch you can learn here!","review":"First, full disclosure. I went to Antioch at roughly the same time as Martha (right after Nixon invaded Cambodia and the resulting murders of protesting students at Kent State or, at least, that's how I remember it). So, in addition to the main event here, I was thrown back to my memories of arriving in a city I'd never been to on Friday, finding a place to crash (usually with other Antioch coop students) and going to work on Monday. A lifestyle made for Augusta! Now, as a parent of a sometimes ornery 15 year old, I wonder if my past, too, will intensify and become my present and/or future. But, thankfully, I was never as intense as Martha, so I continue to be optimistic. A \\"wonderful\\" book, that inspires, despite the lows this family went thru. My hat is off to you Martha for having the foresight to write this all down and to share it with us -- especially in the small community of Maine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah, Blah, Blah","review":"This memoir was painful. Painful in a \\"oh my God, could it get any worse?\\".Boring, mundane, cold, flatlined. It feels as though the author is emotionless and it got to a point where I just felt like shaking her and saying \\"oh enough already\\".Sincerely, just pass this one buy. Not even worth a library visit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Me!","review":"I heard the author on NPR and thought that she had something worthwhile to say. Her story is worth hearing but her feelings of responsibility, or lack of feelings of responsibility, are hard to believe. It is acceptable for parents to blame anyone but themselves and parents who hold this philosophy will relate to this book. It would be interesting if the daughter now wrote this story from her point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Writing, Bad Parenting","review":"When Martha Tod Dudman was a teen-ager in the Sixties she took drugs, had sex, stole cars, and got kicked out of school. In the Nineties her 15-year-old daughter, Augusta, takes drugs, has sex, steals cars and runs away from school. Gee, go figure. This gracefully written book takes you on a self-centered trip through Martha's incompetent parenting. The only times you are not frustrated with this moronic mother is when she describes her escapist treks up and down the mountains of Maine. She has no control over Augusta but she does little to assert control either. Beyond the talented writing there is little to recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, No Thanks","review":"There are many interesting memoirs out there...I did not enjoy this book. This might be of use for people that have problem children, but no thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving & Emotional","review":"When I first picked up this book, I did not know if it would be about Martha Dudman or her daughter. I found a wonderful symbiosis of both of their experiences and how it affects the author, which would be the true meaning of a memoir. Martha Dudman tells her tale in true, flowing thought; and her use of metaphors and descriptive language is succinct. I could not put it down. I was crying, laughing and wanting to give my own two cents throughout the entire book. The author does not try to analyze or offer explanations, she simply tells her story as it happened. It is a riveting tale of woe and hardship; and the reader feels the pain and helplessness of the author. I loved it and I would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the honest truth you may be searching for!","review":"Author is a fine writer but is not completely true with self. She seems to just arrive at this \\"place\\" where both her teens have become \\"screwed up by the system.\\" She has a non realistic view of teachers and a profound biased opinion of them.

Along comes this beautiful book that literally took my breath away because the writer KNOWS what it's like. She put into words feelings and fears that I have been unable to articulate. The fear, the helplessness, the guilt, the hope. For any parent (especially mother) of a troubled teen, please take the time to read this book. You won't be sorry. As another reviewer here wrote, I want to take this book and make all my friends and family read it and say to them, \\"This is what it's like!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Mainly for Julie Andrews fans.","review":"This production is okay, but it could have been better.A decent cast, but too much material is given to Julie Andrews, who is well past her prime. Attempts are made at a plot-thread, and these fall flat. Includes some material not readily available elsewhere.I am a great fan of Sondheim's music, but I really do not enjoy listening to this set at all. For an introduction to the music of this marvelous composer, try \\"Side by Side by Sondheim\\" instead; much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"SMASHING, SUPERB SONDHEIM","review":"At long last, JULIE ANDREWS sings Stephen Sondheim. Andrews is so superb at interpreting Sondheim (BARBRA STREISAND should listen and learn), you wonder why it took so long for the two to get together and put it together. Cast members Stephen Collins, Michael Rupert, and Rachel York are unnecessary. Playwright Christopher Durang (another cast member) is sharp, droll, and funny; particularly on \\"Drive A Person Crazy.\\" Julie Andrews delivers the ABSOLUTELY DEFINITIVE interpretations of \\"Could I Leave You?\\" and \\"Getting Married Today.\\" Sondheim is THE GENIUS MASTER OF BROADWAY, and JULIE ANDREWS, a versatile, perfect, emotional, classic musical and dramatic actress, is his ideal muse here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck! Go buy the individual albums!","review":"Until the 2000 revival album comes out (cross your fingers...) just go out and buy the original cast albums. This was a big disappointment for me. As other reviewers have pointed out, Rachel York steals the show while the rest of the ensemble is mediocre or worse. Julie Andrews has got a great voice, but she should stick to Richard Rodgers songs. The orchestrations are horrific (the instrumental openings to 'Rich and Happy' and 'Merrily We Roll Along' are awful--and what's more, they occur more than once!). Also, I detest any revue that changes the lyrics of the original songs, and this revue does that a lot. Further, this review neglects arguably the two best songs in Merrily--Not a Day Goes By, and Good Thing Going. Until the superior 2000 cast recording comes out, steer clear of this revue. Even Rachel York can't save this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album from beginning to end.","review":"This is one of the best rock albums in the last year.

Dada is the best band that never made it big. From their debut album PUZZLE (their best effort) to DADA, they have never caesed to impress. Inexplicably, however, the good bands (like Dada) never get the airplay. One of 1998's best singles, \\"California Gold,\\" is tremendously crafted. It is Dada at the top of their game. No doubt about it, DADA is a top notch effort from a top notch band."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Buy!","review":"What can I say? Dada is by far the best band to ever exist. This CD is their best since their debut, Puzzle. Great music, catchy tunes, clever lyrics, awesome vocals. I don't understand why Dada doesn't get the airplay they deserve.

You don't know what you're missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"They almost make me forget the Beatles...","review":"I first heard Dada in the late summer of 1994, on South Street in Philly, at a cool venue whose name currently escapes me. I saw then there again in 1995 and then for a third time in Georgetown, DC, in 1996. With each performance, I liked them more and more and more. The same applies to their CDs, of which I have four (which, I think, is all they released to date). \\"Dada\\" just may be better than \\"Puzzle,\\" which I thought was their previous best and would also give a 5 star rating. These guys are just astounding. Better harmonies or tighter, wiser compositions are impossible to find these days. For anyone that has never heard them live, DO IT! They are even better in person than on laser disc. As mentioned by other reviewers before me, it is a major puzzle and even greater shame that they do not receive more air-time nor have a much broader following. No other current band would deserve it more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"El fabuloso","review":"how could they follow up 'el subliminoso'? with this masterpiece.

You could leave a plate or paper towel on the counter and place this on top, but then you're reenacting the anal retentive chef from SNL, which is usually what I used to do anyway.Enter this product - it's nice for keeping the spoon near the pot without getting in the way. I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars because while functional, it rests on the pot a little strangely in my experience, and it's a little awkward to place the spoon in the holder.

The clip did not grip well on the pot and, worse, the spoon holder part is so big that the spoon has to be perfectly balanced, or an optimal thickness in order to perch there without flipping food all over the stove, or even falling out.While Paris I saw a Chat Noir ceramic souvenir spoon rest that cost nearly 3 times as much, but it's ten times better.

We have many \\"moon\\" books for bedtime. Unfortunately, this book is not so soothing, and relies rather heavily on a Christian theme, which is not what I was expecting from teh title. The child is going to bed and sees the moon, but on the next page suddenly she's \\"alone in a boat at sea, won't anyone rescue me.\\" Happily, she is brought safely ashore by God.

I got this CD at the library and burned but it feels like I've been ripped off. Jimi Hendrix, who is and has always been one of my favorite guitarists, would be extremely pissed about this release. There is no passion or feelings in the songs (with the exeption of Bold As Love). The songs needed to be full of feeling, just the way Jimi wrote them. There are only three good songs; Bold as Love by Steve Vai and others, Wind Cries Mary by Sting and others, and Spanish Castle Magic by Santana and others. The other songs are terrible renditions of the Guitar God's best songs. Oh well, what are you gonna do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curtis J.

The orchestral accompaniment is totally misused and drones out any reminense of what i would call rock and roll. The only song on the CD i would ever listen to again is Bold as love. In fact, Bold As Love is the only reason i gave the CD two stars instead of one. It is almost like the origional song. Other than that, the entire CD was a waist. Don't buy this. Instead buy some classic hendrix, like \\"Experience Hendrix: The Best Of Hendrix.\\" That is a great album. But as for \\"In From The Storm\\"? I think i'll put that with all of my AOL trial CD's.

Carlos Santana, Robben Ford, Brian May, Taj and whoever else is on here are very good guitarists, but they get buried beneath the orchestration and in some cases get devoured by the tunes themselves.John McLaughlin, on the other hand, does not. His version of \\"The Wind Cries Mary\\" is timeless. It's what ever cover ought to aspire to (what Jimi did to \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" and \\"Hey Joe\\") - he takes the original song, and through his own vision and personality, pushes it farther. His solo is simply phenomenal. Just the sound he gets from that guitar is a killer, sort of After the Rain (his 1995 Coltrain Tribute album) plus distortion. It really sounds wicked. In sort of a winsome tribute, he goes nuts on the vibrato bar at the end of the song.So, should you buy it? I think you might as well - if anything just for Johnny Mac.

Having been raised in California by a father who grew up in Birmingham in the early twenties and thirties, I had a desire to understand this man, my father, who seemed at times to have such radical world views. Reading Paul Hemphill's story, specifically the retelling of details of growing up in a working class family, including the bigoted views his father held, helped me to understand the world that molded many whites prior to the civil rights movement. When chosing this book, I wasn't looking for a dry detailed history but rather an insiders view of what this world of \\"Birmingham, Alabama\\" must have been like growing up. Why it created such biogtry? And How can we continue to change?

As a newcomer to the area of animal rights, I cannot think of a better place to start. This book provides both a comprehensive research tool, and an excellent overview of the many aspects of animal rights.The ability to compare the general content and tone of several books on a particular topic is very useful. Scanning through the entries is informative and thought provoking, in large part due to the author's comments and questions. Without claiming one side or the other, he challenges many traditional ways of thinking about the issues involved, and introduces alternative views. I found myself prompted to look at other aspects of animal rights that I had not considered before.

I'd give it five stars but, for me, that rating is reserved only for the true and timeless classics. Martin Sexton's singing and vocal range is spectacular. The musicianship, instrumentation and melodies are wonderful, ranging from soulful to folky and from gut-wrenching to smooth and easy. The funny thing for me is, while everyone else keeps pointing to \\"Diner\\" as the gem of the album, I actually find that song merely okay and probably the low-point of the album --- then again, I cannot stand Keller Williams and that tune has too much of a Keller-esque quality for my ear.

My tiny apartment is much cleaner--and smells better, too--since I switched to this brand. I've been using Holmes ashtrays for about 6 years. Of course, no \\"smokeless\\" ashtray can do the whole job alone, so I also use a rotating fan and two small TrueAir filtering devices withHamilton Beach Febreze 04291F Odor Removal Filter for Tobaccoin my \\"smoking lounge,\\" and this combination keeps the smoke level to a minimum.

NO! Very unhappy with the ridiculous Holmes company."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"At least I didn't waste too much money. But this product is lacking. To begin with, it absolutely eats batteries. It requires 2 D batteries, which needed to be replaced after the first 10 days. You have to keep the cigarette directly under the lid for it to absorb the smoke otherwise it just floats past the fan.

Once you put in bottom tray and batteries the fan keeps running and you cannot shut the lid. They never even tried to use it, but I can see that it is really not going to be efficient with just a charcoal filter on the top of the lid when you cannot even contain the smoke within the unit itself.

The book can help a woman understand her subordinate position at work or at home and yet can help a man understand the frustration and anger a woman would feel working in a patriarchal society. By taking the fairy tale, \\"Rumpelstiltskin,\\" Mary Loomis explains the way a woman must reject her inner sense in insecurity and of being second best. While all of this sounds decidedly feminist, the book is one of the simplest explanations of the dynamics of women working in large corporations, government institutions, and other hierarchically organized social networks. There is no male bashing at all, but, instead, a discussion of how a woman's nature is at odds with a patriarchal society. In fact, the book tells of how much of a relief for men understanding all of this can be.

My brother has every collection of Eddie Harris. The man is just electrifying as with his ablum titled The Electrifying Eddie Harris/Plug Me In. When you hear Eddie Harris you just start patting your feet and you can't stop. Me, my brother and my mother went to see him when he came to Detroit in the early to late nineties. He was bad then and he still is bad after his death. I taught that I would never be into jazz as a kid but when I started listening to this man and other jazz artist, I was just spoken for words on how good that music was sounding. My favorite songs are Listen Here, Moving on Out, That's Why You're Over Weight and It's Alright Now. I recommend that anyone who is a jazz lover get this album. The man is just awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent tunes are lost in dated arrangements, muddy mix","review":"This is a CD of the '65 - '73 period, featuring Harris on tenor sax, often embellished with a Conn multivider and studio manipulation. The Harris sound is unique -- soulful, breathy, reaching for the highest register, and wonderfully melodic. Many of the tunes are icons of the period, if not standards. Regrettably, they have not weathered very well over the past 30 years. Arrangements are dated, reminiscent of the TV themes of the '70's. Remember \\"Hawaii 5-0\\"? Creed Taylor? The arrangers on this album went to the same school. And the mix sounds as if Harris were in the linen closet while the rhythm section was in the studio.

On soprano sax, he weaves Moorish lines while Eric Dolphy adds an unusual wrinkle, a flute solo that avoids that instrument's usual hippy dippy tweeness. Freddie Hubbard adds to the Spanish feel with his trumpet, and then like two groaning sages, the bass players speak to one another in an obscure, mysterious language. \\"Olé\\" has all the yearning of Coltrane's best music. \\"Aisha\\", on the other hand, though written by pianist McCoy Tyner, speaks to his gentleness, his celebration of beauty. Inspired no doubt by a soulful woman, the ballad is reminiscent of Trane's \\"Naima\\".

The mouse is attractive and well built. I rather like the \\"heft\\" some people complain of and the design is comfortable. The problem is performance. The pointer is erractic (quivering, shaking pointer with \\"ghost\\" images flashing behind it) and the software is extremely buggy either from the CD or Logitech's site (numerous crashes that ended when I uninstalled the Mouseware drivers). Plus the CD installed Backweb Lite to faciltate online registration and updates. Little did I know that that particular program is considered Spyware by many spyware removal programs. That's really a shock from a company like Logitech. All in all I was very dissapointed with the MX500. I went back to my old MS Blue optical, downloaded the lastest drivers from Microsoft and it runs rings around the Logitech and is much more stable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Mouse","review":"Even though they keep comming up with a new design a year this to me is still the best feeling wired mouse I've ever used.

You might not have this problem if you don't need it as a button."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mouse","review":"This is almost the perfect mouse. I wish some of the buttons were a littlebit different feeling, so it would be easier to tell them apart by feel, but overall I love it and have had no problems at all.It has a great feel to it.Way to go Logitech!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mouse, wish it were wider","review":"I previously preferred the Microsoft mice, but they have either gone wireless (don't want that), changed designs away from what I liked, or the worst - the quality just isn't there.I am a tech consultant and am on a computer at the very least 12 hours a day, so I need something that will last. The Microsoft mice were fantastic, I loved their feel, but their buttons weren't made well and would break quickly.The last one I had only 2 months before it broke.I bought this Logitech as a replacement and while I don't like the way it feels as much (too narrow for my tastes, but I have pretty big hands), it does exactly what I want.I will be buying these from now on, at least as long as they keep this design and build quality.I don't play games with mine, so I can't speak to how well they work for that, and I don't care how they look - I just want it to work well in daily use for a range of applications."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Buddy","review":"This is the mouse to get. I've had this mouse with me for more than 2 years and its still working perfectly. I use this mouse intensively, from hardcore gaming to internet surfing, graphics designing, and simply moving around windows. If find it very comfortable for my hand due to the genius design by Logitech. THe control is even better. With the mouseware driver which can be downloaded from the web, you can configure all the buttons of the mouse as well as set the sensitivity. The flexibility, control and precision is simply wonderful. I would reccomend this mouse over any other mouse in the market. Wired is always better NO MATTER WHAT than wireless mouse in terms of control so if you want accuracy get this rather than cordless mice such as the 700, 900 or 1000. It is definately worth your money!The only bad thing: If you use your left hand for the mouse then this wont be suitable for you, as it is built only for right handers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best mouse I've ever owned","review":"This mouse is the greatest. I'm sure the wireless MX700 is pretty good too, but I didn't think it worth the extra money and I wouldn't like to have to remember to put it back in the cradle.Despite being optical, this mouse has a higher resolution than my old reliable IntelliMouse. It's great for just navigating around your desktop or playing counter-strike.This mouse is GREAT with Mozilla. Do this:1. Download new mouse drivers2. Configure the buttons near the scroll wheel to CTRL-TAB and CTRL-SHIFT-TAB, and CTRL-W. This will let you switch and close tabs quickly.The only thing I wish was that the new drivers let you have an application profile, that is, allowing you to have different button bindings for different games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mouse is nice, software absolutely STINKS!","review":"Seized my windows XP machine, disabled almost all of my other USB input devices and now puts me in an endless loop of files not found for uninstall.

No, this cannot be customizable bythe program. So bad that I had to return and replace itwith MS Intelli-Mouse, which is perfect.I do not recommend Logitech mouses. They always come upwith seemingly something better and more features,but they always have a huge fundamental flaw here andthere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable Mouse","review":"The placement of the BACK button and scroll backward buttons are good. Easy to get at and out of the way of normal use. However, the FORWARD and scroll forward buttons are difficult to use and pretty much unneccesary, since it is very rare for me to use them anyway. Under normal usage, the mouse's heaviness is unimportant...but I can imagine it could be hard on a gamer. I like the ergonomics of the mouse, as it decreases the amount of hand movement needed for normal use. The left and right mouse buttons are a little hard to push, but I actually like that, since I can rest my fingers on them without accidentally clicking them. Overall, it is a very comfortable mouse to hold and move around. For me, they could have easily left off the FORWARD and scroll forward and task changer buttons, which I now completely ignore after some brief clumsy experimentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I ordered this mouse 4 days ago and received it today (thanks to free shipping!). I love it! The software is a bit more complex than the macally sw i am used to (MacOSX) but easy to use. Evrything worked the first time I plugged in. The side buttons are pretty cool as are the scroll buttons next to the wheel. The change app button is a bit weird and I dont see myself using it much, but it might be useful to some o fyou.The mouse itself has great tracking! I am very impressed with how it copes with different surfaces (I had a mcally ioptinet). The scroll wheel feels like the microsoft wheels-smooth. The mouse is very comfortable but I agree with the other reviews about the lack of space where you can put your ring finger (if you have big hands).

It's really a tale of high level sex and prostitution in the 1950s and 1960s before everyone and everything came out of the closet. The book is full of sex tips and techniques that will seem old hat to anyone growing up in recent decades, but all of this was very much avante garde when the book was published. On can still read it with pleasure, as I have recently done. It is also interesting as a behind the scenes commentary on life in New York City before the sexual revolution. Sadly, I don't think Xaviera is with us any longer, as I recall she passed away some years ago.

I'm not a huge gore fanatic---I can take the Romero & Argento films alright, even Peter Jackson's Dead Alive. This film however, is an absolutely trippy experience, in a great way, though. I literally could not take my eyes off it. There ended up being some mayhem in the theatre, but I just kept staring at the screen. The gore is there alright---lots of it, outrageous scenes you could not imagine---but there's also a story, fleshed (no pun intended) out characters, and humor. A really great film if gores your thing---great writing, direction & acting.I predict you'll hear, and see, a lot more from director James Bressack, in the future. Definitely has a macabre & wild focus and vision. And by the way, this was his 1st feature! Solid entry in the gore genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extreme, crude, a must!","review":"When I got to see this movie at the American Film Market I couldn't believe what I was watching.

I thought it was really great that they came out all the way from california to talk to us even though it was a small showing. I mention all this because I met the director and saw that he actually was only 18 years old.Now to talk about the film. The gore was disgustingly shocking. I haven't seen something like this before. From the first kill to the last kill they are disgustingly shocking. The story was awesome and so was the killers mask. I really related to and cared for the character of adam.

Upon further exploration into the contents of the CD-ROM, I found no program on the CD at all! After taking the disk out of my drive and inspecting it, I found that it had been printed on a CD-R.

In last the few years, the narrative of the battle of Thermopylae has come under some scholarly scrutiny, especially concerning topographic issues. Nevertheless, Bradford's work is suitable for those who only have a passing interest and is not designed for students or historians of antiquity. A better study on Sparta would be by Jones, or Lazenby-- whose work focuses primarily on the Spartan Army. See also Pritchett for a more detailed analysis of the Greek state at War.

One minor criticism, (personal pet peeve) is the director's over-use of the \\"JFK\\" style inter-cutting of real footage with actor portrayals to illustrate some events; but this will not distract most viewers. There are also a few dubious statements made (and presented as fact);specifically, the insinuation that Tosh was the the real leader and force behind the Wailers and that Bob Marley was just a puppydog-like follower.

Although I like the BNO cd much more than I like the new MR cd. I hope this doesn't continue to be a trend (like when Senses Fail releases a new album in the next few months or so). All in all, I would recommend this album. But, in my opinion, all the songs sound somewhat similar and it is a step backwards for MR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...","review":"I went to the store yesterday to pick up the new MBR CD; I had no idea I'd get this. I definitely appreciated the screamo/poppunk of Alibis...but this was evolution at its finest. There's no more whining, no more hooks revolving around cheap power-chords...the vocals and guitars are MUCH improved. I didn't give the CD 5 stars because I think the CD could use more songs like Surrender. It's a nice change, though, the slower, more meaningful tone Voices gives off. I definitely rec it to anyone who currently finds themselves disappointed with the \\"scene.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened!","review":"Ok all I have to say for this review is that MR's first cd was way better than this one. I dont know what happened to them. The lyrics are dull, the instrument makeup is nothing new. I do give credit to the guitarists, they have improved but I dont hear anything else that is appealing to me. I had my hopes set way too high for this cd. I am sad to say that I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"they changed","review":"If you really like their first cd, don't get this.

It's so bad that I just got done checking the Best Buy policy on returning or exchanging CD's. Unfortunately for me I am stuck with this crap. I now own a 10 dollar drink coaster. I loved their first album but the follow up is just terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much","review":"Sure a band is suppose to evolve but if any of you loved old Matchbook Romance i would suggest to not even bother with their new CD. How a band can go from great song like My eyes burn and playing for keeps to this TRASH is unbelieveable. Go back to the original stuff. The best thing about Matchbook was their awsome sceam and you dont hear it once in the new CD its almost EMO but crap slit my wrists emo. Sorry but obviously my mind cant open that far when a band is willing to sell out so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm","review":"Wow i'm so unimpressed with the new album. I loved the first one so I didnt really bother to listen to the songs on the new cd cause I knew I liked the band. But I don't know what happened. I know most bands \\"grow up\\" or whatever but why ruin a good thing *cough* Thrice *cough*? I haven't even opened the cd because I plan on returning it for something good. Like someone else said, you have lost a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE WORLD!","review":"Why are all the bands doing this...a band puts out a good cd and then suddenly people call them posers so they decide to put out a heavy, more \\"rock oriented\\", all over sh^^^^^er cd...what the f^^^ is wrong with MBR!?! i put this cd in my cd player and i thought that this entire cd was one long never ending songs...is there any difference? every single song starts the same and every song ends the same...end of the go^^^^^n story...this is just like yellowcard, Story of the Year, simple Plan, GC...im sorry if u think i like poser music...i just dont like bands that try to be 'hardcore' just to think they put out something amazingly lyrical and a work of art...this cd is terrible...if u like listenin to 50 minutes of the same bland boring song over and over...be my guest....god...why?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Evolution of Emo","review":"This album is a HUGE step forward for this band. Their debut and EP albums were both kind of watered down emo music. This album, however, displays a darker and more adult side to the band. There are slight hints of progressive guitar work in some tracks. The vocalist soars on this album, in both the slower and up-tempo tracks.If you like heartfelt, creative yet accessible music with dark undertones...BUY THIS ALBUM."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"\\"Voices\\" is awesome! In June 2006 I went to a Yellowcard concert- Matchbook opened for them. I bought a Matchbook shirt (I didn't even know their music then, haha) and then I bought this CD, too. I love it! My favorite songs are \\"Say It Like You Mean It\\" and \\"Monsters.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"WOWWWWWWWW!!!!","review":"Yup. That pretty much sums up my reaction of this cd. I've heard some tracks on Stories and Alibis and thought it was very catchy and sounded good. So, naturally i wanted to pick their new effort up. Umm, darn, i said effort. To put it lightly, MBR has changed their style...for the worse. I had to force myself to get through the first 3 songs and after #6, i couldn't take it anymore so i took it out of my CD player. Mabye tracks 7 and on are better, i dont know. I do know that it wont change my opinion on this cd however. The CD dosen't plain suck, it just plain lacks.....everything. This record is awesome at being nothing. This album is at BEST mundane. The only track that was even somewhat ok was Monsters. If you're a fan of Stories and Alibis, do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this unless u want a one of a kind top quality drink coaster. It works pretty well for that. Or mabye a doorstop.....or frisbee...."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame","review":"nothing like there first album there first album was good this one they sound totally different and it sucks they sold out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough","review":"This is not THAT different from what they did last album. In my mind the only difference here is that they took away the hooks. Just because they did that doesn't mean they are trying to break away from the genre that made them popular. \\"Voices\\" is as good as \\"Stories and Alibis\\" and maybe even a little better. I can tell you one thing for sure though... the album is harder than the last one, it's just more guitar driven.. focusing a little less on vocals and more on great overall band performance. I recommend this cd to anyone who likes loud guitars and to anyone that likes ROCK music... which is what this is. p.s..... NO THEY DID NOT SELL OUT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morph is amazing software!","review":"I've been a fan of this software ever since I was able to transform myself from a relatively handsome guy in his mid-twenties into a bald guy with a comb-over!

If memory serves you well, you can parrot the few sentences, but overall you'd be better off taking a bunch of pictures of the same items and pointing and grunting when it comes time to communicate. Also, quite a few of the words they want to teach you are english derivatives, like auto, bus, telephone, cola, etc. Save your money, find another resource.

The grouping of topics is a nice feature.3. However, very clearly you will need an alternative resource for getting even basic concepts and phrases.4. Given the above limitations, certain topics, like telling time, are nice via the use of repetition.5. Most people looking for a crash course would be better suited to use an elementary text (online or book), \\"in flight\\" series for listening to and practising phrases for common situations, and a spoken dictionary (online like the Stazi version).

It just got too boring at one point and I forced myself to continue reading it. I was ecstatic when I read about Cyra and so forth... otherwise Catriona was very annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Ms. Small's characters are NOT likeable. All are like sociopaths who rationalize their bad behaviors over and over again. Fiona kills her first husband, but then this behavior is \\"OK\\", because she settles down and marries her \\"true love\\". Then she rats on this \\"true love\\" for no reason. The heroine, Catriona, is little better. Her \\"body\\" betrays her constantly (of course, her heart is loyal?). I just don't \\"get\\" Beatrice Small's books. Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not impressed","review":"I can say that I'm a Beatrice Small fan. Only, I don't care for this particular book. There were too many despicable situations that Catriona could have gotten herself out of. I understand that women didn't have much of a choice back in this era, but if there is a will, there is a way. First off, if I'm that beautiful and remotely think that the king would use his position to lure me into his bed, I would never go to court despite the laird's objections. That alone would save a whole lot of trouble. I think what really set me off on this book is that both the king and her husband rape her at her home. TOO MUCH VIOLATION!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Drivel","review":"This book was terrible. I read it because a friend was raving about it. I read every word of that horrible book. There were historical inaccuracies, the book dragged and dragged and dragged its main \\"heroine\\" through a series of unbelievable and unnecessary rapes and tortures. It was complete and utter crap. Cat was an annoyance, Bothwell wasn't likeable, and the conversations in \\"brogue\\" were just obnoxious. Overall, a true waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad","review":"I am really amazed that so many people have liked this book. To each her own, I suppose, but this is my first time reading Beatrice Small, and as a person who enjoys the work of Stephanie Laurens, JoAnn Ross, Nora Roberts and Diana Gabaldon, I can only recommend than anyone who likes the strong man with a strong woman taking on the world themes of all of the above mentioned ladies, you will likely hate this book as much as I do. I remember my first time through Outlander, being taken aback when Jamie switches Claire, but that was nothing compared to the unrepentent sexual violence this book presents with it's \\"authentic\\" portrayal completely devoid of charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missed the characters when it was finally over.","review":"This was... a really good book. I was genuinely surprised at how much I liked it. It was the story of Catronia, decendant of Janet from the first book, The Kadin. I find that, by reading some of Bertrice Small's older books I'm opening myself up to reading more of her newer books.It was at the end of this book that I fond that I missed the characters when it was over. It's full of all the tropes of the period, everything built to make a woman in the 70's and 80's embrace her sexuality and become empowered in herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always a fan of Bertrice Small","review":"Great read, stayed on track and interesting as Bertrice Small always does. However, I am partial to all her books. I have waited a long time to read Love Wild and Fair and I was not disappointed. If you enjoy Ms. Small's books and haven't read this one, it is a lovely story with all you expect from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hit!","review":"John Barry never fails to amaze me with his glorious compositions that can convey so many different moods. This is one of his most cherished and well known scores. Because of its strong following it has recieved and excellent and precise treatment here. The music has been re-recorded and extended to include more music than on the previous album. The result of this new recording is marvelous; never has this soundtrack sounded so good. All of Barry's tracks are romantic and beautiful. There is also a beautiful rendition of a Rachmanioff favorite.

Wish the pieces could be expanded instead of brief \\"movie scene\\" segments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting, Mood Setting","review":"I have listened to this soundtrack at least weekly for the last 12 years. I never tire of it. I find this Barry score to be the best thing he has ever done. If you need to set a mood of romance, love, or just remembrances of good times you spent with that special someone, this is the one I choose above all others.A visit to the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island combined with this music is almost more than a weak heart can take. The inspiration Barry must have felt from Rachmaninov's opus seems to have set the mood which he carried throughout the whole score. Every song is special. A must for everyone with any amount of sentiment and romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"An fabulous piece of music from John Barry!","review":"Along with \\"Dances With Wolves\\", \\"Chaplin\\", and \\"Out of Africa\\", this is one of Barry's greatest pieces!

It is the story of Sylvie, a politician's wife, and their two daughters, Lizzie and Diana. Syvie has just discovered that her husband had an affair and she realizes that she has given up her entire self to look after him for all of those years. She leaves and tries to rebuild her life and her self-esteem. Her daughter, Diana, is a physician trapped in a loveless marriage and carrying on an affair with a resident at her hospital. Lizzie is the former addict trying to piece together her life and ends up in a situation she was not planning on.While the premise of the story is strong, I felt the characters development was not thoroughly hashed out, nor was the ending.

I don't want to give away spoilers but many of the story lines were very predictable and even a little dull. I didn't connect, or really care about, any of the characters. I was especially frustrated of the treatment of Lizzie, the just-out-of rehab addict. Her family drinks around her? And hires her as a nanny of her 6 year old nephew? And I'm no prude but it seems a little irresponsible of the characters to sleep around with no concerns of getting pregnant or STD's. Also Jennifer Weiner has one crazy/irresponsible stereotyped sister and of course the other is a perfectionist/good student stereotyped sister, just like in \\"In Her Shoes\\". In real life we are not all one or the other!I wouldn't waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out okay and then went downhill","review":"Predictable summer read.

Plus I think I'd enjoy it as a movie, but the book didn't do it for me. Makes me think of a modern day Danielle Steele work. I ended up skimming through the pages, reading all the dialogue, but it bored me too much to read each and every word. I got the whole story, except I didn't even care enough to read the last chapter. For me it just felt like it was whipped out due to the references of current infidelities and the mentioning of Suri Cruise a few times. I found that to be a turn-off like the author was trying too hard to make it current. I think I prefer classics and quirkier novels more. I'm sure it would be entertaining at the beach or the pool since missing pages by distractions would not result in losing the storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely tale about motherhood and sisterhood","review":"I can truly relate to Fly Away Home especially the character Lizzie. I have a sister exactly like Diane and mother mother like Sylvie. Like the Woodruff clan my relationship with my mother and sister can be rocky at times and we all try to live our separate lives. But in times of crisis we do come together and try heal each other fears. I'm glad that women in this story were able to stand up on their own two feet when there men had done them wrong. But Lizzie was the one I was cheering for. To survive rehab, deal with her sister 'nit-picking\\", her nephew's behavior pattens and still find someone special to share her life with is really amazing.

This one was no exception. The character development was lacking for the two daughters. The only character that was followed in depth was Sylvia (and she was the most boring of the three of them). I think too much was going on in the story and not enough was explained deeply enough. I think fewer, more concentrated story lines would have been better for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!!","review":"I really wanted to like this book.

I have read other Jennifer Weiner books and liked them all, but I found 'Fly Away Home' to be quite slow and boring. As others stated in their reviews, I too kept waiting for something to happen, for there to be something funny, or for me to actually care about the characters - none of which ever happened (for me). I found it hard to beleive that Sylvie didn't talk to her husband for months and then suddenly started talking to him every day, that Diana would actually marry a man who by every discription in the book was totally wrong for her, and that Lizzie did a full 180 with no slip-ups. I found myself wishing that there was some happiness and at least one reason to root for the main characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even satisfyingly mindless","review":"A bit depleted from reading dark literary fiction, I bought this book for my Kindle, thinking it would be some good mindless summer reading fun. Wrong. Cobbled together from the tired stories of every politician's sex scandal we've been subjected to in the last number of years and a cast of characters you know you're meant to care about but just can't, this uninventive and humorless tale had me questioning why I was spending my time reading it at 35% and bailing out altogether at 53%. Beach readers deserve better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a Jennifer Weiner Book!","review":"I've read every one of her books because I love the humor and banter she seems to so effortlessly create and maintain throughout her stories. \\"Fly Away Home\\" could have been written by any 2nd-class romance novelist. It's simply dreadful. Ms. Weiner, please stick to what you know. Or write under a pseudonym."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...Predictable AND factually inaccurate","review":"I loved previous works by this author; \\"In Her Shoes\\" and \\"Good In Bed\\" were great reads. This was extremely predictable and bland. Further, there were aspects of the book that were simply not plausible; one example being the circumstances behind Diana's release from the hospital. I understand that not all authors have insight into the workings of other professions, but some background research or just calling a friend in a profession can lend much more plausibility to a plot line. In fact, I just stopped reading after that moment because the whole book just seemed pointless.I'd like to see Jennifer Weiner write a book without the usual character she employs - maybe a book without an affair as a central focus for a character. Her previous books demonstrate her talent; perhaps she just needs take her writing along a different path."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book won't make the Best Seller list!!","review":"I bought this book because there was such a great review in my local paper. What a waste of money this was for me along with my time. If you enjoy adult books then this one is up your alley! I was so surprised that I even finished this book. I can usually read a book in a day or two. This one took me almost two weeks to read. I was hoping that the trash in this book would end. I guess there should be ratings on books now too. If there was one I would say this book should receive a triple \\"X\\" rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect Information","review":"Very sad to see that there was repeated incorrect medical information relating to Type 1 Diabetes. The information presented in the book could actually cause the death of a person with Type 1 Diabetes, not treat them. How come there has been no public acknowledgement of this? I contacted the publisher and author and never heard from them. It is mindboggling to me that a bestseller can have completely inaccurate and dangerous medical information. Weiner and Hendricks should acknowledge their mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read!!","review":"I started this book thinking I had wasted my money, but the more I read the more I got into it. I found it to be both inspiring and full of hope. It was nice to read a book without a perfect ending. Instead it showed the evolution and growth of each of the three main characters. I'm glad I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites.","review":"I really enjoyed this book; despite what others said, I was invested in the characters and found them very relateable. One of her better works, I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought it was great!","review":"I thought this book was great! From the first chapter, this woman had me. I am a bit surprised the previous reviews were not better, but when I checked more thoroughly I realized that Jennifer Weiner usually writes about younger women. I am a 57 yr. old woman and this author has hit the nail on the head in this book. I can't begin to tell you how many marriages fall apart when couples age into their 50's and it happens much like the author describes. There are affairs, worries about children that never end and life changing events that affect entire families. Few \\"chick lit\\" books are written for older middle aged women, so this was a real treat. I suspect many of these readers will come around as they age. And what a talent this writer has that she can go from writing about young motherhood to older women and their lives falling apart. Good for her! This is the first book I've read that Jennifer Weiner has written, but I will definitely be hunting down more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy to connect with the characters","review":"Pretty disappointed in this one.

Usually, when I pick up one of her books, I can't put it down, it's so entertaining. This one was just the opposite, for me. I kept laying it down and going back to it later. I didn't like the way the chapters were laid out, for each character, going back and forth - made it difficult to follow IMO. I highly recommend all her other books; they are fabulous! Not this one. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"MIDLAND GXT600 Best of its class.","review":"I have owned many brands of FRS radios previously including Motorola, Cobra Uniden, and other Midland radios. I found all of them to perform poorly. Prior to purchasing the Midland GXT-600 radios I considered the available FRS radios too unreliable for many trips. However, the GXT-600 is definitely a cut above. The fit and finish of the product is good and sturdy. The radio gets nowhere close to the 18 miles advertised, but it does transmit the farthest of any FRS I have owned. Think 4-5 miles at best. Reception is clear. The antenna, while little better than a dummy load, does radiate the transmitter's 5 watts better than most. I have been very pleased overall with the GXT-600. Finally a FRS radio worth packing."},{"rating":"1","title":"transmission distance is lousey","review":"This unit bareley transmits one mile between cars on the highway in all kinds of terrian conditions.It does not make any difference if you have it on the high power channels or the low power channels.I have a Uniden set that I paid 24.95 at wal-mart and it transmits further than these units also for that price you got a rechargeable unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Television Talk a lot of fun to read.","review":"Television Talk was fun to read.

Laurie Riley and Leslie McMichael did a wonderful job arranging these traditional Celtic harp pieces, in addition to including information on how each one should be played. They also note the \\"difficulty level\\" of each tune, (i.e., \\"moderate - advanced\\"), and include some lyrics as well. The last three tunes are offered for wire-strung harp, but can be played on a regular folk harp as well...A great find!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Celtic harp at it's best.","review":"This harp book reveals a little of what excellent advanced masters of the harp, like Riley and McMichael, can etude.Makes great listening, if you can figure it out.

Crown's portrayal of Marshall leaves something to be desired. The book comes off to me as a quick money-making scheme that's purpose is not to discover the \\"real\\" Penny Marshall, but to deliver some juicy gossip that will hopefully intrigue the reader. I found the book to be informative on behind-the-scenes Hollywood, as well as on television and film production, but overall it was a complete waste of my time. If you're looking for a personal account of Penny's life/experiences, this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shlemiel, Shlamazel","review":"This is a book that needs to be read as a companion piece to her brother Garry's autobiography In fact, you learn from this book that she had a big ego, very little formal training in acting, and a body of work that lent itself better to television than the movies. She got lucky with having her brother give her a major foot in the door to her profession as well as making two movies that did well at the box office, if not great works of art. These are points that Garry seems to also concur.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor camera-work and shadows obscure view","review":"I was all set to love this video due to the excellent work I had seen in my previous purchase of the \\"Mastering Chair Massage\\" video but I ended up getting very frustrated with the Integrative Massage - Earth video.The video was set outdoors under the strong sunlight and many times I found that due to the camera-man's position the massage therapist would end up casting her own shadow over her own hands and I couldn't get a good view of her hand/finger position.I wish I could give this video a better review but the strokes being obstructed due to the shadows annoyed me greatly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for all ages!","review":"I ordered this book for my 14 year old daughter and I ended up reading it, too.

I would recommend to any reader who likes a story with a slight sci-fy touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Science Fiction Gem","review":"Once again Ellen Davidson has given us science fiction which is both a joy to read and thought provoking. The setting she creates may be exotic, but her characters are very close to home. Miri's ability to transcend the limitations imposed by her upbringing are an inspiration, and Ms. Davidson's fertile imagination creates such fun that the reader hardly notices that there is a lesson to be learned."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating and suspenseful tale","review":"This book kept me on the edge of my seat. It made the hair stand up on the back of my neck. Ellen Davidson is not only a master of suspense, she also creates characters I care about. The world these characters inhabit is fascinating and vividly portrayed. Stolen Voices is a remarkable story, remarkably well told."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psycho-Biography","review":"This was the first (and as of yet, only) book by Ms. Goodwin that I have read. Having seen her many times on television, I expected a somewhat deep historical perspective. By the time I was 25% through the book, I wasn't sure if Ms. Goodwin was a professor of history or psychology. She jumped to an extreme amount of conclusions about LBJ's thoughts and motivations, all based upon her \\"unique\\" ability to delve into the deeper LBJ through her amateur psychological training. The parts of the book I found most interesting were LBJ's monologues, during which you could listen to the man's self doubt and frustration. But most of the book read like a doctoral thesis from a young psychology major. After a while, it got very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I am (was?) a great admirer of Doris Kearns Goodwin's work. \\"No Ordinary Time\\" was a masterpiece of historical writing. But this early biography of Johnson just doesn't stand the test of time. It's MUCH too theoretical and lacks narrative drive. Johnson was an immensely interesting figure. It says everything that this book makes him dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Team of Rivals but good","review":"Dorris Kearns Goodwin is a great history and a marvelous writer. She is a little to close to her subject in this book. That being said I think Lydon Johnson and the American Dream is a great read for political and historical enthusiasts. I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars because it truly covered his life from start to finish, connects at a personal level, and its well deserved. I'm currently reading a bio on all of the presidents and this one provides an interesting perspective so I would recommend this one on Lydon B Johnson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good LBJ biography","review":"I liked this book and learned alot about 'the man' LBJ that I did not know. Is it over analyized from a 'psychology' standpoint - I dont know. I think it is important to understand the inner workings of a persons mind - even from that persons early childhood - to fully understand how a person will act later in life, especially in very difficult situations.BTW I did not see anyone write in their review that this book was originally published in 1976 - only 3 years after LBJs death. Im not sure if the 1991 edition is revised. Interesting as well in the original 1976 edition the author has her name as Doris Kearns (not not Doris Kearns Goodwin) although she was already married to Goodwin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, though a little too much analysis","review":"When I bought this book, I was warned by a cousin of mine, who teaches history at GW, that the book would contain a lot of phsycology, and he was right.Now, this is still a very good book, second only to Master of the Senate in terms of biographies about LBJ, but I found the phsycology a little bit boring. That is the only thing that prevents me from giving the book 5 stars.There is a lot of interesting insight, helped along by the fatc that Goodwin knew LBJ, and interviewed him repeatedly. I would advise everyone interested in LBJ, the Presidency, Civil Rights, or Vietnam to read this book. It is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream","review":"Interesting but repetitive. Glad to have read it. But Doris Kearns Goodwin could use an editor.You need more words: bla, bla, bla."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyndon Johnson was a brilliant, but coniving man who would control and manipulate people for his own advantage","review":"I've gotten halfway through this book, but had to put it aside for a while. It's a sad story of a man who became president, a man who learned early how to control people and force his will on people for his own advantage. All the while, the people he controlled never knew it and were so skillfully manipulated Johnson made them think it was their idea. This book is not as well written as Kearns later books, but still, she gives a detailed story of LBJ and the man he became."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psychobiobabel","review":"At best, the author is conflicted between being an historian or psychologist. She fails at both. The book skims historical events superficially and then provides a deluge of the author's amateur psychoanalysis of LBJ, vacillating between Machiavellian and Freudian insights at an embarrassingly sophomoric level. If you've exhausted the gamut of LBJ biographies and still want more, then and only then would I recommend this work - the few reliable new insights are not worth the filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodwin and the American Dream","review":"I wanted to like this book. Goodwin is a respected author (Pulitzer Prize winner, etc). But I didn't enjoy her writing style. Her tone is arrogant. She repeatedly psychoanalyzes - or, rather, psychoBABBLEizes - LBJ. Too often, her subject matter is herself - HER thoughts, HER feelings, HER background. Who cares about her? This book is supposed to be about LBJ. What was Goodwin ever the President of? The President of boring, if you ask me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as Other Johnson Biographies","review":"Remember this: Just because one is first does not mean one is the best. Kearns Goodwin's book has nothing on the Robert Caro books or the penetrating study Jeff Shesol did on Johnson and Kennedy's rivalry."},{"rating":"2","title":"LBJ Lived the American Dream","review":"This is a really wonderful book. It brings the political excitement of the 50's and 60's right back. I always admired LBJ because of his personal belief in Civil Rights, and willingness to bring the Civil Rights Legislation into law, regardless of the personal cost. And it did cost him. Too bad he wasn't aware that the advice he was getting on Viet Nam was terrible. Those decisions were at a cost to all of us. Personal opinions aside, this is a facinating read, about a boy born dirt poor, who becomes one of the most powerful people in American History."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best presidential biographies i've read","review":"An amazing biography of a man who might have been one of the best presidents in our history had he not been seduced into the disaster of Vietnam.Goodwin had unprecedented access to Johnson and weaves her personal insights into a well told story about a fascinating man."},{"rating":"1","title":"A puff piece.","review":"By a former aid who still has stars in her eyes.The good news is most of Johnson's women have other ways to make a living than shilling for his reputation, and if you can believe it, her own."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOORRRRRIIIINNNNNGGGG!!!!","review":"Dull, dull, dull.This author spends so much time babbling about the inner workings of LBJ's mind, you'd think she was his therapist.Not a serious historial work."},{"rating":"2","title":"While I was alive!","review":"I was alive when the events in this history were taking place and I was not aware of much of the behind-the-scenes activity.

A barely-there plot combined with pretty, yet flexible women equals a decent way to spend 85 minutes. Ahmo Hight doesn't get as flexible in this movie as she does in Hotel Exotica, but she's good to look at anyway. Once again, Monique Parent steals the show. This time around she's a primary character instead of a supporting character like in the first \\"Club Wild Side\\" movie.

Otherwise, you will get ripped to shreds.

This game isn't that bad but the interaction and alot of the controls of this game are alittle too hard for most players. (I had no problem but many of my friends were using words to describe it that isn't worth mentioning.) The storyline is alittle dry with no real mission laid out and only through dry humor can you advance in some points. It would have been nicer to have a list of choices-maybe in the next version. It was too easy to beat and did it in less than 2hrs. So if your bored and renting a game-this is for you. If your a hard-core RPG'r......then you want something more to sink your teeth into.

Watching all the episodes from both dvd sets brung back memories for me. My brother and I grew up on watching \\"Jem\\" when we were kids coming up in the eighties. Besides Jem being my favorite character of course, I have to say that my second favorite character was Raya, even though it seemed like she was the most overlooked character in the series. The reason why Raya is my second favorite character is because she reminds me so much of myself, of how she was shy and sensitive, and to me she seemed different from the other girls who were members of the holograms. I can't wait for Rhino to come out with the other half of season three on dvd with the episodes with the Stingers."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY!!

To my delight, she gravitated to Coltrane -- especially this recording -- as if she had been grooving to it from the day she was born. I would say that I was surprised, except that I too think \\"My Favorite Things\\" is something special, and then some. You won't regret one measly cent. Get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete mastery","review":"Buy this if you are even thinking about picking up a Coltrane CD. Coltrane's range and intensity on this demonstrate what can result when a man becomes a perfect musician in complete control of his instrument. His eastern influenced runs are endlessly inventive and after 100's of listenings I still get blown away and discover something new in this. McCoy Tyner's voicings are equally incredible. If this was Tyner's record with a different horn player it would still be worth owning for his playing on this is stunning. Everything I just wrote pertains to ONLY the title track.....the rest of this CD is as wonderful. This is a highpoint in jazz recording and a must own for anyone who enjoys this style of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Masterpiece!!!","review":"This is genuine music that soothes the soul. The album consists of 4 songs (all of which are beautiful). My favorite tracks are \\"Summertime\\" and \\"My Favorite Things,\\" but the entire album sends a feeling of achieving a sort of soul- filled nirvana. Great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most haunting experiences in jazz","review":"This, as many have observed, was an important and richly fertile record in Coltrane's career, with impressive new personnel, and the introduction of his soprano sax, as well as offering much other great musical innovation. The \\"rhythm\\" section subsequently came to be identified with him, and was a great asset to his music. So was the use of the soprano sax, which is used to great advantage here. \\"My Favorite Things\\" is one of those interesting themes Coltrane used to employ totally to his own, and highly original, advantage: he turns it inside out, rings the changes on it, and soars exploringly and mesmerisingly all the way. \\"But not for me\\" shows a similarly original but very different handling of a well known \\"song\\". This is, quite simply, one of the best and most \\"classical\\" of Coltrane's recordings. It is not necessarily the easiest one to access, and requires intense concentration, but deserves every bit of attention one gives it. - Joost Daalder"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not my favorite","review":"John Coltrane / My Favorite Things (Atlantic - original 4-song album on CD): These are very nice versions of popular songs and the album is very enjoyable, but it's not a classic. This is a nice Four Star album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A landmark in jazz, but...","review":"Compared to the other Coltrane recordings I have, this one seems to fall short of the mark. While the title cut is adventurous, has some impassioned sax playing, and has a beautiful rhythmic flow, it seems that McCoy Tyner (who, incidentally, is one of my favorites) spends his entire solo section trying to figure out what to play, killing time by plinking some octaves, or vamping while waiting for Coltrane to come back in, which doesn't happen for too long a time. Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye is a beautiful first-rate rendition of a standard ballad, and Summertime and But Not For Me are very enjoyable uptempo pieces. Try as I might, I still feel like I'm waiting for something to happen when listening to the title cut. Maybe I'll get it a few months down the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This is a wonderful CD in so many ways. If you are not a lover of jazz, this would be a great introduction to the genre. Coltrane is one the greatest jazz musicians of all time and Elvin Jones is arguably in the top two or three greatest jazz drummers. Really a perfect CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favourite saxo player","review":"Mr. John Coltrane had(still has) the unique ability to disrupt any previous concept you may ever had about bebop, and inmediately make you an addict of his rich, polimorphic, sensuous sound. \\"My favourite things\\" is an easy listening record, with inmortal tunes that are remembered every now and then(ever heard Björk's version in \\"Dancer in the dark\\"?) and give you the insight of a deeply spiritual man who was in pursuit of his way of expressing love through music. This is not his most emblematic record but definitely a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miracles is definitely worth reading!","review":"I think this book would definitely help non-believers to realize that Jesus is real and is the Messiah.

I think that most Christians do not realize that they have the authority to do these things and by reading this book, it can really open our eyes to what Jesus has already done for us and help us understand that we need to have a closer relationship with God.

There are really *three* proofs: Isaac Newton's, Richard Feynmans, and the authors distillation of them. It's hard to imagine a mathematical proof making a fascinating science book, but this one does.

It was given the next year as a filler to another class. Feyman derived this geometric proof of eliptical orbits based on scattering work by Fano, but the postscript says the same proof goes back to Hamilton. It's of some interest to hear Feynman answering students questions at the end. But based on their questions it's clear he didn't do a great job even if you could see the blackboard. So, really, you should only buy this book if you want to learn the proof as presented by the authors. If you can get ahold of his Messinger lectures they're much more well organized and more entertaining, and cover the basics of planetary motion (equal areas/time, and the period/radius relationship) but not the orbits being eliptical. There was almost no humor in this lecture. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucid explanation of Feynman's proof of the law of ellipses","review":"The book first walks you through the works of Copernicus, Galileo, Brahe and Kepler. Then it gives a brief account of Feynman's life and his work. Then, through numerous diagrams, the authors clearly explain Feynman's ingenious proof of the law of ellipses. Finally, the book presents Feynman's lecture \\"The Motion of Planets Around the Sun\\".It is amazing how Feynman, starting on the lines of Newton, and then not being able to follow Newton's reasoning, devised a different but elegant proof of the law of ellipses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"When I saw this book in the book store I thought, \\"What a great idea! A simple geometric explanation of planetary orbits\\". Then I read the book's supposed proof of why the lines from the focus points of an elllipse to a boundary point make equal angles with the tangent line. The argument was both long-winded and completely invalid! By way of comparison check the elegant proof given at the beginning of *Geometry and the Imagination* by Hilbert and Cohen-Vossen.

It came in a very nice cherry-colored finished wood, and it was nicely standing next to my entrance door until 8 months later one of the base started to crack on one side. It was standing on 3 wooden parts that you had to slide in. I had some wood glue on hand and started to glue the broken part and then suddenly another base started to crack as well. I realized from that point that even though it looked superb when first assembled that it was all junk. There was definitely not too much hanging for it to break. Horrible bad quality for it to break in 8 months!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Base Snapped Almost Instantly","review":"This rack has a great look to it but the quality of the wood that holds the legs in place at the base is extremely poor. It splintered while I was in the process of setting it up which means the leg no longer slides into the base. Also, the three pieces that screw together to form the upright pole do not have a flush fit. I will be seeking a replacement part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cherry Finish with a nice Twist","review":"With the New England winter season right around the corner, I had an entry way that needed a place to hang coats, jackets and hats.

I thought these would make good running headphones, but no they actually suck pretty bad. The \\"sportclip\\" in the name is pretty misleading. They will not stay in place period, their bulkiness is annoying, and the sound quality isn't that great(no bass). These are adjustable yes, you can bend them to fit around your ear however you like, but what happens is I end up spending my entire run fidgeting with these things until I find a sweet spot(which I never do). These are just to bulky to stay in place, they are constantly slipping out. I DO NOT recommend them for running or any other such activities. On the other hand if you aren't going to use these for running and just want them to look good and deliver average sound go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"I thought this product would allow me to listen to great music while running.

I found this book to be of rather limited use to anyone seeking information on materials in use today. Almost all refererences are very dated and may be considered useful if a study of yesteryear's practices are intended.It appears to me,that information on various metals and their processing in particullar is more or less imprecise and in some cases wrong altogethrer-for example:to aneal common aluminium alloy to \\"pink\\" heat means going past melting point!To sum up,if you intend to learn current practices, go elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Benefits of Hammered Lead?","review":"I have to say that I was disappointed in this book. Toxic materials are given a lot more play than they deserve in the text (lead, mercury, etc.). This book is dated and shows it age (when atomic fission-powered planes were thought to be a good idea). Sure, basic sculpture techniques haven't changed much since that late 1940s, but materials have, and in a big way. This book should either be updated or characterized as art history.

He's an engineer, so I figured that this would be a book that interested similar minds. :) It turns out to be really facinating - our extended family and friends have enjoyed sharing it, and the photos are beautiful and interesting for all ages. My only wish is that it still was easy to find in hardback, as I think that would be nice.The book is written \\"story-style,\\" which makes the information a lot more palatable to those who don't have a geology background. The historical and environmental perspectives are woven together with very thoughtful writing. There is a lot of data in this book, but I don't think it reads like a textbook, which is nice.Overall, this is a great book.

Second, the super smart motor is like having a giant rock stuck to the bottom of your shoe, oh and I forgot the batery cover, under your insole come up, turns on its side and it's like stepping on a quarter that is on it's side that has no intention of moving.

The beauty and precision as well as the power of Steber's singing are phenomenal ...\\". Equally high praise is given to Di Stefano and Merrill and to the conductor Antonicelli.Welcome bonuse tracks of Steber, in rather poorer sound quality than for the opera, include a duet version of 'Will you remember' with Bjoerling.Listeners will immediately become aware that these are not high fidelity recordings - but, what magnificent singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Historic Recording","review":"This is Callas' only studio recording of LA TRAVIATA. She gives a stunning performance of one of the great operatic roles. She is in fine voice and \\"lives the part\\".

The sound on this Warner reissue is infinitely superior to any previous incarnation. A must for Callas fans.PLEASE NOTE: MOST OF THE REVIEWS POSTED FOR THIS ITEM ARE ACTUALLY OF OTHER PERFORMANCES.

The Metropolitan assembled the greatest singers in the prime of their careers. Pavarotti, Sutherland, and Milnes are the golden trio and sing gloriously throughout. Von Stade has a very small part; but for someone who loves her voice (as I do), this should have been a notch in my belt in my attempts to collect her entire discography. However, the consumptive Violetta must have been in the audience if the amount of coughing caught on the tape is any indication. It is a shame to have to listen to all of these hackers as the cast spins their magic vocally. It absolutely ruins the recording, surely someone's best effort at pirating. Even the magic of the vocalists couldn't overcome this annoying audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not again","review":"Just to make sure it wasn't just that book, I did order two and have come to the conclusion that they both suck equally as much.

The best part of this Qur'an compared to most others is the commentary and notes that accompy the text.

This commentary is an excellent source of information and a huge help when trying to understand the enviroment at the time of the verses were reveled and so forth.

Before moving to Santa Fe I purchased this book and was given the impression that there wasn't much great riding to be had. When an author includes a paved bike path in a mountain bike guidebook you have to figure there isn't much out there. Since living here, I have found so many outstanding rides that were not even mentioned in the book. That is what often happens when an out of towner comes to write a guide.

How could I go wrong buying a case expressly listed for my Vaio model from Sony?I'll tell you. This \\"case\\" is nothing more than a thin wetsuit material slipcover for the laptop to prevent scratches and keep out dust (but it has a nifty Vaio logo for the vain)!

If you are really familiar with this score, you'll agree that this version does not do justice to Bernard Herrmann. Many of the cues are off-tempo and downright ponderous (check out cue #19, The Cave).The liveliness that distinguishes this score is virtually lost on John Debney's interpretation. Why wasn't the original soundtrack resurrected? Varese Sarabande did release a CD version of this album about 10 years ago; believe me, it's a magnitude better than this re-recording. I'm sure the master tapes are in the Columbia vaults somewhere (and in stereo!).For a really faithful rendering of a Herrmann score, 'Jason and the Argonauts' conducted by Bruce Broughton, is simply magnificent.

The set up guide on the install software has it right. I upgraded from a corded intellimouse Explorer. The switch program and scroll buttons are nice. When Im working I have a cluttered desk the cordless mouse is a must. Have not had it long enough to seen any problem with the recargable batteries. If your worried just keep a corded mouse in the file cabnet. I bet you would never need it if you have the habit of docking the mouse when you shut down at the end of the day. Don't forget to plug the mouse docking port into a unswitched plug."},{"rating":"1","title":"great while it lasted","review":"and it lasted only for a yr and half before the laser started jumping around, the charge would not hold, and the tracking became sloppy. not really worth the money you spend on a mouse you want to keep for at least 2 yrs."},{"rating":"1","title":"erratic mouse","review":"The...Logitech USB Optical Mouse with wire tracks hand movement so much better than this MX700 wireless that I retired the wireless MX700. The MX700's software doesn't allow enough slow speed selections but gives many fast motion speeds that are impractical to use. I've run the MX700 on a Mac under OS 9.1 and on Windows XP with the same poor results. Had the same problem with Microsoft wireless mouse even though tried every driver configuration possible for all mice. The by-wire Optical is the most accurate mouse I've used so I bought one for my Mac and Windows machines. When using the USB port on my Sonnetech add-on board on the MAC computer the Logitech software control is lost, but the click button and good tracking still work, Kensington software, according to Sonnettech support, does work for Kensington mouse products.

Everything seemed great in the beginning. After three months the mouse would not seat properly in it's cradle. I would have to reseat it 8-10 times before the light would start flashing letting you know that it was recharging. I am not being rough with it at all before anybody assumes this.I contacted Logitech about this and they sent me a canned response directly from the manual that didn't even really have anything to do with the problem. Then they stopped answering my emails. After reading on forums that other people were having the same problem I learned to live with it by just changing the batteries.Now after one year the thing has gone haywire all of a sudden and no longer moves smoothly. It moves really slow and the buttons double and triple click for no reason. I have updated the driver with no results. So here I am looking for a new mouse. I guess it will be a MS mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable, programmable","review":"Been using this mouse three weeks now with my 17\\" 1.25 ghz iMac and I love it.GOOD: Reliable and precise tracking, great buttons that program so easily with \\"USB Overdrive\\" (macintosh program @ macupdate.com...

It will last about a week on a charge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Mouse","review":"I never thought I'd pay this much money for a mouse, but I got a gift certificate and couldn't find anything else to buy. I have to say that I feel I made the right choice. I've used this mouse with my old Win ME PC, and I'm now using it with my flat panel iMac running OS X. I downloaded the OS X control software directly from the Logitech web site (the mouse worked through USB without the software, but the software makes it a little more configurable). The design and feel are great. Battery life seems good--I usually keep my Apple mouse nearby in case the low battery light starts to flash. Action is smooth and accurate. The mouse is expensive, but if you use the computer for hours each day, it pays for itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible battery life, more cords than before!","review":"I've had this mouse about a year and have come to truly hate it. The only reason I'm still using it is cause it's still somewhat serviceable, so I keep forgetting to buy a new one. Anyway, why it's a piece of junk:1. The battery constantly runs out and you have to keep putting it back in the charger. Always just stops working when you're in the middle of something.2. The fact that you have a charger in the first place. See, the mouse itself is cordless, but the charger, which you must keep on your desk as you need it all the time, HAS TWO CORDS - a usb to the computer and an AC cord! I've used battery powered mice that use a usb dongle - now those are truly wireless (and the 2 AAA batteries last 6 months or a year). Or stick to a corded mouse and that way you'll only have one cord, not two!I strongly advise against purchasing this product. Buy a battery-powered mouse that doesn't use a charger."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't get it to track","review":"I've tried this on five surfaces - a soft foam mouse pad, a textured pad, a smooth plastic pad, a dark wood table and a light wood table. I have four other Kensington and Logitech cordless optical mice that work on all of these surfaces. The MX700 lazily lags behind (at best) and skates off across the screen (at worst).It's a little too narrow for my hands, too. My pinky has to go a long way to grip it and it leaves my hands sore after a few hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite","review":"This is a must have mouse.

This may not be a problem for desktops, but for laptop users (and especially for people wanting mobility and be truly cordless) this does not offer a complete solution. I have seen other true cordless, optical mouse out there, but I believe they are running on bluetooth.With that said, I like the extra fancy programmable buttons on the mouse. I have one setup to open Mail, one to open the Application folder, one to perform the Hide option on my iBook. So that's really sweet. Also, the optical system has been improved from the older generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME MOUSE","review":"The Logitech MX700 does NOT disappoint.The installation was a snap. I set it up, let the included batteries charge overnight and I was good to go. The batteries last quite some time. It was a bit of a change to place the mouse in the recharging cradle nightly, but once you get used to it, it's a no brainer.The mouse works well on all surfaces, including solid black. My MS Intellimouse Optical refused to track on my black desktop. Performance is second to none.If you are looking for a full featured, realiable wireless mouse, you will find it with the Logitech MX700."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best mouse I've ever had","review":"I have to say, this is by far the best mouse I've ever used. It's the first cordless mouse I've had, and I never realized how much nicer it is not to have that darn cord in the way all the time! I never realized how much of an inconvenience it was.I was worried at first that I would constantly have to charge the mouse, and that if I forgot to stick it on the cradle at night it would be dead in the morning. So far, hasn't happened! I am really bad about forgetting to put it in the cradle too, but it stays charged for a LONG time.As far as performance, it is just as good - if not better - than any mouse I've ever tried before. The size is just perfect for my hands, the buttons are all perfectly situated. I haven't used the side buttons much, but I constantly right/left click and use the roller. I highly recommend it to anyone, I just bought one for my fiance for his birthday - plan on giving them as gifts whenever possible! Really, it's a fantastic mouse - well worth the cost!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mouse!","review":"This is a fantastic mouse. I play many FPS's and it works great with every game I've tried it on. The software allows you to map all the buttons to keystorkes or even combos with alt-, shift-, and ctrl-, so all 8 buttons can be used in any game. It is smoother than my previous Microsoft Intellimouse, and the cradle/charger/base station is a great solution to changing batteries often. It fits in my large hand well, and the extra weight of the batteries feels nice. Overall a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice","review":"The mouse is wonderful, very comfortable in the hand, buttons easy to access and use, recharges quickly and never had a problem with range if within 6 ft of computer.

Many of them had a concern about the mouse battery tends to wear off completely if not place back into its charging cradle overnite. This is completely true. When I opened the box, I immediately notice the rechargable batteries that came with the unit is cheapo generic unknown brand type. Those batteries looks like those you would find in a 99cents store. I didn't even bother to put them into the mouse. Instead, I replace them with a better known brand (Sony). The result is noticable. Had left my mouse out of the its cradle for a nite, and its still working on the following day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Mouse","review":"This mouse is incredible with precision, and control.

Perfect ergonomics for a right-hander, and it goes a LONG time between charges. The numerous conveniently located buttons are fully programmable, and the software monitors the battery level and gives ample warning when it needs recharging. The only problem is the finicky charger cradle--the mouse has to be in just the right position to make contact, and it's not the position it naturally falls into. I'd have given 4-3/4 stars if I could, but I can't give 5 because of the annoying cradle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent control and features","review":"Describing this mouse requires three words, but they're all good ones:OPTICAL ... no more scraping grit and crud from the innards of your ball mouse.CORDLESS ... finally you can use your mouse further than three or four feet from your machine.RECHARGEABLE ... none of the waste, expense, and hassle that come with a battery-driven cordless mouseAdditionally, the control is excellent and the programmable buttons are nice if you're a power user or compulsive system tweaker. As others have said, the MX700 is ideal for casual use, graphics/image manipulation, programming IDEs, and games of all sorts (and I've used it in all of these applications without complaint). It's not the lightest mouse in the world, but I don't mind that ... it never bothers me even after several hours of work or play.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good...mostly","review":"The accuracy and speed of this mouse is great! It works perfectly...mostly. My only complaints are with the software. Many of the special keys don't work properly in some applications. For example, I use Mozilla as my browser and the scroll up and down buttons (not the scroll wheel) don't work correctly. Also, scrolling is terribly jumpy and jerky unless you set the scrolling to MS compatible. But then the scroll wheel doesn't work in some programs. Overall this is a good mouse though and well worth the price. And it will only get better when Logitech updates the software for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost a great mouse, but one big problem","review":"I love this mouse in every way except one. And unfortunately it is the most important thing. The mouse will work fine about 90% of the time then it just jumps across or up the screen for no reason. I have followed the installation directions and I have it 8 inches away from any electrical device and it is only about 8 inches from the mouse and it still jumps. I would move it even further away from electrical devices, but the cord is too short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking, but...","review":"I regret the money I spent in this mouse. Yes, it does have some nice features, but the performance is poor, moreover in high memory-consuming applications, like games. The performance is jerky, and the worst is the scrolling wheel, that is simply uncontrollable. I am replacing a Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer (corded) and there is simply no comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cusor problems","review":"With unit fully charged, the cursor seems to have a mind of it's own. Most of the time it will go where it's suppose to then other times if I move the mouse to the right, the cursor goes to the left. E-mailed Logitech tech support but all I ever got was caned answers. Did the things they suggested, like check distance of mouse to reciever and unit is always put back on charger when not in use so I don't think battery condition has anything to do with it. Overall I would say a trip to the trash can is in order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Mouse on planet Earth","review":"This is without a doubt the best mouse on the market. I've had it for 11 months now and have never had to replace the batteries. The mouse is also just as fast as a cordless and tracks flawlessly.I use the mouse without the Logitech Software - every button works except the very top one, which I find very difficult to reach anyway.I could never go back to a corded mouse (eww- a cable?) or my old MSFT cordless (lag CITY!). Thanks Logitech for such an awesome product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock Solid","review":"I had a problem with my first one and had to get a replacement, but it was after I switched batteries and it could never get connected to the base again.But if you leave it alone it works like a gem. It's a bit heavy in the hand, but not uncomfortable unless you play games for hours on end without a break. I absolutely LOVE the scroll down/up buttons. I haven't even installed the Logitech software that allows you to personlize the mouse and I'm positive that makes this even better. A very positive 5 Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well executed design, but too heavy","review":"I used to think the mark of a good mouse was a heavy, solid-feeling mouse. For me, this mouse is too heavy. In my opinion, it just takes a little too much effort to move the mouse across the desk. I tried using a mouse pad, and that helped somewhat, but part of the beauty of an optical mouse is that a mouse pad is not a necessity. I know most people have good things to say about this mouse, I'm just really picky about something I use day in and day out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Mouse","review":"Though I have not had my mouse long I have no issues with it. It works at a very high speed so that is nice. The feel of it in your hand (if you are right handed) is really nice, it just fits. The mouse works at a good distance from the base station with no problem. Also it is very cool with all of those buttons on there. However, because of the hi price I would only recomend this mouse to high end users who spend much time every day on their computers for work/school, or in my situation lots of college homework and for my job."},{"rating":"1","title":"It killed my laptop","review":"I have one major warning - DO NOT instal the software on the cd - in fact do not even put the cd in your computer. The mouse itself is pretty ok. Its smooth and comofortable in your hand with some nifty extra buttons. BUT, when i installed the enclosed software it killed the software on my laptop. It broke my virus sheild and replaced my on board mouse setting with its own - permanently!. Had to re-instal a lot of stuff before my on board mouse settings came back. That was just the begining. I am still dealing with the aftermath of this mouse a month later. DO not beleive the box - most of the extra buttons will work without the cd - especially if you are running XP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Logitech installation program froze my computer - BEWARE!","review":"I have Windows XP, but the installation program for the MX700 froze my computer. After hours on the phone with techs, they told me the only way this mouse would work on my computer would be if I didn't install the features the extra buttons provide.

Got it to use while walking but I can not put in in a carrying bag but have to carefully hold it. Very frustrating.Also the power button is held in place by a thin narrow piece of plastic that flexes each time the Rio is turned on or off. Shortly after the warrenty period was done the plastic broke from repetitive use. Rio will not repair it, but offered to exchange it for a considerable cost. I now use pen or pencil tip to turn it on and off.When it works it is OK but I would not buy another Rio unless the controls were protected from accidental use and there was better quality design and materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, but not well made","review":"I thought that this was the greatest electronics item since the television- until I dropped it. As another person mentions here, the control buttons are not well placed on the unit, particularly the on/off button. I also now must use a pen tip in order to shut in on and off. I realize that dropping it was my fault. However, it should have been designed to resist a \\"light\\" fall. I have subsequently purchased another one, because I found one at a very low price.

By the third month the player wouldn't link to the computer at all. After numerous conversations with RIO, they informed me that my player needed to be replaced and offered to send me a replacement for the low low price of $100. As I payed just $150 on sale 3 months ago, I politely (!@$# NO) declined. My IPOD nano works well everytime, is smaller, more user friendly, and has a 1 year warrantee vs. the 90days for the RIO.

The interface with various Windows versions (I've gone through several since buying this) is very poor, the actual software program that comes with this Rio is rudimentary and that is almost a compliment. The unit itself is prone to fits of all kinds including restarting without reason, not shutting off, taking very long to turn on, etc. For any problems that you may encounter, don't count too much on the Customer Service. It's free only for the first 90 days and even during that time, it's pretty much useless. There is not much else that they can tell you that is not already written on their website which is meant to say, the several serious problems that this player encounters point in only one direction - it is, by nature, unreliable.

This guy had his chops from an early age and wasn't afraid to run with them. Those of you who grew up listening to Ferguson's edgy jazz-rock (Chameleon, Primal Scream) or pop (\\"Star Wars\\" theme, et al) should give this a listen even if you don't think you like the more traditional big-band music. Just hearing Ferguson take control and blast out his solos will be worth it. Who knows, you might decide that Stan Kenton's worth listening to after all.Sound quality here is surprisingly good except for a few radio recordings that just weren't preserved well. Although most of these songs are top-notch, \\"The Band Ain't Draggin'\\" and \\"Wow\\" are, well, kind of dorky. \\"Draggin'\\" does feature some nice trumpet work, which makes it worth listening to.

What could have been an otherwise decent fighting game is loaded with glitches, bugs, horrible controls, blocky graphics, and a lame fighting engine. Not to mention that since the game's license, based on the book by Chuck Palahniuk and the revolutionary film, is the main selling point of the game, if you took away the license this would just be a run of the mill fighter that is a wonder it ever got approved for production. None of the fighters, save for Bob, look like their movie counterparts, which isn't surprising, but it would have been nice (you can only beat up Fred Durst so many times). Also, each fighter's moves are so generic and similar to each other that it seems like not much thought had been put into the game. All in all, fans of the book and movie who may have wanted to check this out are better off leaving this on the shelf where it belongs, it's not even worth renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst online fighting game ever.........","review":"I knew when I got this game that there was something about it despite that I did like the movie. this game really has nothing to do with the movie. the production and the way this game was put together was poor. the graphics, sound, gameplay all factor in why i have generously gave this game 1 star. I figured I didn't like the fighting style of the game and gameplay and desided to go online......... like a ghost town. nobody plays this online?? that's weird that this was just released and nobody uses the online option, could be because people are getting rid of these. stand clear of this game. This is a BIG joke!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This Game is horrible i wish i came on here and read other reviews before buying it...Givin the fact i bought i from EBgames for $10 i'd have to say it wasn't even worth that...there's nothing good i can say about this game..Story is very short and easy if you try to play anything else it's the same thing over and over again..They put Fred Durst in this game like He's a bad ass or something...When we all know he's just a lil bitch..i put this game on easy and noticed that the game didn't get easier they only gave me less points for beating people...All and all i can tell you like the rest have..Skip this game not even worth $10"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHYeeeeeeeeee!?!","review":"That was my screeming little girl voice you heard the other night after playing this game. I was excited to see a fight club game coming out! I wanted this to be at least an ok game. Here's whats what. The story mode is too short. The \\"make your own fighter\\" is extreemly limited. Control is a bit off. They put a nice dent in the movie making this. I hope Chuck P. (The guy that wrote the book befor it was a movie) urinates all over this in a public place for everyone to see. I don't know if he actually cares if this was a failure, so I think I'll take this to a public place and do my thing on it for him. Read the book. Watch the movie. Skip the painful game."},{"rating":"1","title":"First rule of Fight Club.......DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!","review":"I read all the reviews and thought...\\"how bad could it be, I mean it's Fight Club\\" well, let me put it this way, I only paid $7 for this game and was still pissed and felt like I was ripped off. I hated it so much!!! The moves suck and are way to hard to do, and the game is just real boring...and they sure talk about \\"Fight Club\\" and \\"Project Mayhem\\" quite openly (two things they are not supossed to talk about at all). I hope by the time you read this and all the other reviews you take our word and decide not to waste your time or money like we did...If you love the movie, you'll hate the game..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another horrible movie to game adaptation","review":"This game is great...if you have never played any of the Mortal Kombat games for Super Nintendo. There's supposedly a 'story' mode, but it's just fight after fight along with some retro frozen screen River City Ransom translations. And, the story mode is ridiculously short...I was able to beat the story mode in a little over a half hour.I am Jack's annoyance at playing this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible game from one of the best movies ever...","review":"I'll make this short and sweet...This game blows from clunky bad controls to the \\"obviosly showing\\" unfinsished gameplay and desighn. Save your self from playing this garbage..Get the film it's excellent..Lates"},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"I couldnt be more disheartened, I expected a game where you get to be part of project mayhem or maybe one where you play out the story as tyler-- this game did not deliver on that at all. You fight like eight people and the whole story mode all you do is fight and watch videos. The fighting is no good though, you cant do any combos or anything because either the AI is too quick or the processing is to slow to put it together. I beat this game in a matter of two hours. Dont waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay.","review":"i bought it for my son and he says it's okay. he says it's not a keeper and that he'll probably trade it in to a used game store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but entertaining","review":"I find this game simple (in terms of graphics, plot, character selection, etc.) and yet I continue to play it. Something about the game has appeal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fight Club should not be a game","review":"The idea of making the movie Fight Club into a game is obscene.
