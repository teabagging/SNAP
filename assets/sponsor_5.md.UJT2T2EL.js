Very solid, heavy and well made. Seems to give accurate readings, based against readings of other gauges. The needle stays at the tire pressure until you push a button to release the air trapped in the gauge, so you don't have to crook your head in exactly the right position to read the gauge before you take it off the tire.

It seems to be made of quality materials.I used it on a Toyota Echo and a Subaru Forester. The cap fits easily onto both vehicles, and will fit onto almost any car with standard valve stems. It is very easy to get a good reading, even though the cap does not pivot. Because the pressure reading is held until you press the release button, it doesn't matter if you have to turn the dial away from you to make the cap fit the orientation.I found this unit to be more accurate than the stick type analog tire gauges also.

Although she is not as irritating as Tess, she is still clearly flawed in that Hardean way, and claims unnessary casualties in the process. However, this makes her quite real and believable. Presented as a strong and wilful character, except when it comes to the evil escapades of one single man, she manages to secure a happy future by the end of the story. As always, Hardy is incredibly descriptive and wordy, which can sometimes be a bit slow for a 21st C reader, but beyond that is a solid and compelling narrative. For me, this character was more honest and likeable than any other Hardy character I have met so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardy's Classic Wessex Love Story","review":"Having rediscovered Thomas Hardy only recently, I am simply entranced by his excellent prose, his keen powers of description and observation and his spellbinding characters. This is a classic love story about Bathsheba Everdene and her three suitors. A tale which will delve into tragedy before Bathsheba finds salvation at the hands of one of suitors. Many regard this as the first great novel in his \\"Wessex\\" series, which includes the \\"Mayor of Castlebridge\\".

We do the lighting maintenance on a large condo property that has over 400 of these. They are cheaply made, sealed plastic. When one quits working, if replacing the bulb doesn't work, you have to replace the whole light. There is nothing to open up and repair. Inside is a little circuit board. Some last years, the newer ones not so much. The light it puts out is great. The bulbs last a long time. Walmart has the bulbs for half Home Depot's price. HD no longer carries this light, so I have to order online. I found them cheapest on Amazon.com. Really fast delivery. I will continue to order more through them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"I purchased two of these lights about one year ago and they recently both stopped working within a month of each other. Make sure you save your receipt because the company will do nothing for your without it. That is if you want to go through the hassle and expense of shipping it back and waiting 30 days. The mounting system for these is very flimsy also and it does not seem very durable. What a shame because it looks like a great light and is efficient. I am looking for a similar alternative but will probably replace with a double spot and some flourescent bulbs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality of photocell and bulb","review":"Have gone thru 2 of those fixtures in 4 years.

I called their phone number to check the part number for my computer because Amazon doesn't clearly state which models work with which computers. However, the first module didn't fit into my computer. Amazon takes no responsibility for Viking's errors, so you must enter Viking's web site for returns. It took two web visits and a phone call to convince Viking to pay for the return shipping.

Bender DOES capture what seems to be Simpson's \\"real\\" personality (or at least, persona), as well as the shallow show biz and celeb world. But this is counterbalanced by the overall effect coming off a little thin and sketchy. This also makes for a quick read, which helps. But there's no knockout.F.

I was not expecting to find this a-level type of detective fiction in this book. Admitedly, Bender does not have any prior knowledge of these characters. The imagination and character development is truly skillful I would highly recommend this book to any reader willing to take a chance in losing themselves in the \\"what if?\\" Having lived around the LA milleau for over 15 years, I was very pleasantly suprised by Bender's grasp of the Show and Sports worlds as the collide.

This book has a great future"},{"rating":"2","title":"A NOVELSIST'S FREEDOM TO TELL A REAL TRUTH","review":"David Bender has written a remarkable book here, one which I sailed through in a single attentive sitting. With the freedom of a novelist, the freedom to speculate, the freedom from debates and arguments and political positions, Bender has written more human truth about the Simpson case than most other books on the topic. I was a consultant for the prosecution in the Simpson criminal case, and then for the Golman family attorneys in the civil case, and I know the case very, very well. I also came to know the man, the batterer, the murderer O.J Simpson, and no matter how you feel about his guilt or innocence, David Bender's book paints a picture of the fictional Simpson that is far clearer, and with more delicate brush-strokes than you'll ever likely see of the so-called \\"real\\" Simpson. Read the book for the pure enjoyment of the novel. If it adds some light to your impressions of the case, all the better.- Gavin de Becker, author THE GIFT OF FEA"},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad I'm embarrassed to have read it...","review":"This is bad writing. I knew I was taking a risk when I picked up the book for $1 at a local book sale, and I'll admit early that I usually read nonfiction. If this is a sample of what I've been missing, giving me a dictionary over books like this anyday.The author took a storyline, filled in a few holes with typical crime-writing, and expected accolades for his creativity. Instead, upon finishing the book (an easy hour and a half read) one is left feeling the story was incredulous, light, and offensive to the memories of two victims and their families.It is a shameless ploy to gleen money from this tragedy, and I am embarrassed and ashamed that I wasted my time with it.This might very well be the worst book I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks","review":"Really stinks.

These were short, quite readable works that discuss some of the plots and themes of the authors, shows where the work fits into the author's overall work, and provides an introduction to the academic discussion of the work. This reader's guide is groundbreaking in being one of the earliest book-length discussions of the work of Philip Jose Farmer, and covers Farmer's work up to the late 1970s, including such works as \\"The Lovers\\" and \\"World of Tiers\\". The book will be of interest to Farmer fans who are looking for a reference and bibliography of his (early) fiction and an introduction to academic thinking and images in the work, and is likely to be indispensible for academic researchers who are interested in Farmer.

Milligan does a fantastic job of juggling the humor and the tragedy without overwhelming the reader with the events of the times. His sad nostalgia isn't as pronounced as it is in DOWNFALL, but it is there, as he does take time out from reminiscing to hammer out a paragraph about how he longs for the old days. His writing makes those who never experienced it long for it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"These work great!","review":"I have read several reviews that speak of these cut-outs being too small or they can't remove the letters from them without damaging them.

The vent system doesn't work well. To get air to flow into the bottle, you frequently have to loosen the cap and this can lead to a messy leak. Dr Brown makes bottles that are BPA free, cost much less, and don't have venting issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bottles but they leak","review":"I have used these bottles since my daughter was born and now 8 months later, the glass bottles have started to leak sometimes. Compared to some other bottles, there aren't as many parts to wash and they work well with reducing gas. They are pricey but so are the Dr Browns which my husband didn't like because the tiny tube needs it's own separate pipe cleaner. They have started a green version which you can send in to them to be recycled and are a few dollars cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad customer service","review":"I did not have any leaking problems with these bottles as long as I used the valves and nippleas they provide. The problems started when I wanted to replace valves and I can't buy them and I do not get any reply to the messages I send to their customer service. I started to use Avent nipples with the bottles and it is leaking while I shake the bottle to mix the formula. While the baby is feeding, there is very little leak.Born Free would have a great product if theie customers service would be more helpful and if they would use Avent type nipples. I don't understand why they won't sell parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of annoyances","review":"I felt a little trapped into buying these since there are not that many BPA free options. I quickly figured out that they leak really badly unless you buy the inserts. Bottles that leak are miserable as the last thing you want to be doing- while exhausted at 3:00 am is dealing with leaky bottles. Gets all over the baby and then you have to change them, waking everyone up more.... miserable. They worked fine for me after I figured that out but that is not acceptable for such an expensive bottle. I also am annoyed to have to clean the extra parts for absolutely no extra benefit. Very dissappointed. I used Avent bottles for my first and if they had a BPA free option I would do that first. Maybe they will soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"what is going on here? this bottle is expensive and therefore needs to work properly. first it leaks unless you are prepared to really tighten it like a plumber would. second, the valve \\"system\\" doesn't really do anything. there are many other bottles that are much better. i got my money back but this is a waste of parents valuable time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many pieces","review":"I have several different bottles and sippy cups that are BPA free. I will not buy Born Free again. It works just fine but there are just too many piece to put together.

It only has a bottle and nipple but it's still BPA free"},{"rating":"1","title":"A parody of bad design","review":"Way too many parts to these bottles, and all need to be handwashed.

Their venting system is not good. I can see lots of bubbles come out when my baby takes his milk. The worst part is when I first screw the nipple on, and test the milk flow, the milk will actually gush straight out, which could potentially choke my baby. I have to unscrew them, and then tight the top part again. Do it at least three times. You can imagine there is no fun doing this with a hungry baby in your arms crying for food. In fact, my baby got mad so many times with these bottles that I have to stop using them. Dr. Brown is way way better, although it is not BPA free. I am not sure about BPA part, but I am sure my baby does not like these \\"Born free\\" bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safe Plastic??????","review":"They don't leach, but they could be melting into your baby's food.These bottles developed hot spot bubbles in the plastic that looked as if it had been set up against a hot pot and were worse inside. This was a result of just microwaving! I don't get it. I did switch to glass but an additional complaint is that when the nipples get warm (from the milk, not heated with bottle) they get so soft that the milk shoots like a fire hose. If I'm lucky enough to get it in her mouth before spraying her, she is nearly drowning. The sippy cup is the worse, she has an easier time drinking out of an adult cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"higly overrated","review":"I've had these bottles for almost a year now and know everything about them.- They are solidly constructed of good materials and last- They are annoying clean because they have five parts and are difficult to disassemble.- They are annoying to assemble because they have five parts, and if you don't take care putting the bottle together just so...- They LEAK!If you don't get everything *just right* then the bottles LEAK. They leak upside down on the baby, right side up to leave rings on tables, and in general are just a total mess. Just think of how often you're going to be holding the baby in one hand and trying to assemble the bottle with the other hand, at 2am in the dark of night, with no sleep for the past week."},{"rating":"2","title":"safe baby bottles","review":"I am very pleased w/the born free bottles & nipples.

I just hate washing all the parts. I suppose it is no different than Dr. Brown's or similar bottles with parts, just not as easy as the Avent we came from. The safe plastic is worth the hassle to me. Also, the number 1 nipple is very slow which works great for a newborn."},{"rating":"1","title":"melts when sterilized","review":"I sterilized these in the Medela bags as I have sterilized other bottles and they melted together!

Unfortunately due to health problems I had to temporarily switch to bottle. It was a great disappointment when the bottles simply didn't work, as my precious breast milk started leaking away when the bottle was turned up side down and back! We thought, perhaps a faulty one came our way and gave a try to the second from the two-pack. Same result: more breast milk lost. Luckily, a friend of mine had given me her Dr. Brown's a while ago. We are using them now."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's everyone else's problem!?!","review":"I don't know what the people who are complaining about them leaking and the nipple collapsing are doing to their bottles but mine are all just fine and I've been using them for 3 months now.

These bottles purchased from Amazon are not of great quality, three of the six nipples that came with the bottles did not have holes in them. What a disappointment for Mom and baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!!! Leaks after one year!","review":"I have many Born-Free bottles and after one year, I've noticed that over half of them (about 7-8 bottles) have started leaking. When I took the bottle apart to find the cause, I noticed that the rubber part of the ventilation system was torn. I've always carefully washed the bottles with a bottle brush after soaking them. I knew that it wasn't from mishandling them. I called Born-Free and they told me that it's common for that to happen after a year and that they could send me a one-time replacement of two vents, but I would have to pay the shipping and handling. Really? For a $10 bottle? I told them that for $10 I would expect to be buying a quality bottle and that I'll be buying a 3 pack of Dr. Brown's BPA Free bottles for $10 instead of paying $6.99 for each 2 pack of replacement vents. At the time that I had my daughter, Born-Free was the only BPA free bottle with a ventilation system and I feel that they took advantage of that with concerned parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bottles!","review":"It's comforting to know the Born Free bottles are safe for my infant. The best part is they don't leak! My 9 month old loves the bottles and adjusted fine with no problem at all (previously used Avent). I would highly recommend you buy Born Free bottles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive, leaking bottles","review":"I bought these bottles, along with glass ones to get away from ones with BPA. I love using the glass bottles, but I thought these would be easier when I am out, as they are lighter to carry in the diaper bag. They are terrible! They leak constantly, yet I keep trying to use them and tighten all the parts. The nipples also collapse. In all, an expensive item that is not worth anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safer bottles from what I've read; good use for us","review":"Been excellent to use. My infant daughter transitioned easily from breast to these bottles (makes it easier for others to care for her). Much easier to clean than Dr. Browns from which I switched since more controvery over the exposure of bisphenol biproducts. I feel better about the switch knowing that they are safer to use for my baby. The only downside is the larger size, which makes it harder for me to warm up frozen or cold breast milk in the hot water filled thermos when we are on the go. To resolve the problem, I usually leave the breast milk in its Lansinoh bag to warm up or reuse it to rewarm the milk when we are out and about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Bottles","review":"I love these bottles. I started off using Born Free glass bottles and then bought a few plastic ones for traveling. I've noticed that my baby now 3-1/2 months, is starting to use his hands to either hold onto or try to move the bottle away. Therefore, I'm opting for plastic Born Bottles right now. The 9oz will last a long time. My baby is drinking about 4oz right now. As for hand washing all the parts, you'll get use to it as time goes by. It's part of my nightly routine now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad I can't give anything less than 1-star","review":"1) The valve system is absolutely ridiculous. Our baby became very fussy because of colic after we switched to these bottles.2) The price is expensive.

Don't make your baby suffer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Brown 2.0","review":"I used Dr. Brown for my first child and Born Free for my second.Born Free bottle design is comparable to Dr. Brown, the next design generation. The bottle has nice \\"dents\\" for easier grip, the \\"funnel\\" is shorter and can be clean with the normal nipple brush, unlike Dr. Brown. Leaks only happen when I forget to include the \\"funnel\\" system or when I did not twist the nipple on correctly.It's expensive!! But I'm paying for made in Israel body and nipple. The nipple is overpriced. But you can get a cheaper Dr. Brown nipple that's made in Germany. BTW, I believe Dr. Brown bottle (non-niple) is made in China.Avent bottle is made in England. But they didn't make non-BPA bottle until much later and the reviews have not been that good.Bottom line: I recommend getting Born Free but buy Dr. Brown nipple for replacements."},{"rating":"2","title":"BPA Free- Excellent","review":"I love this bottle! It blows doctor Browns.Easy to clean, use and my daughter loved it.Most importantly it's safe!As my baby got older I just had to change the nipple size from 1 to 2.The 3 hole was too big even when she was older. It leaked too much.The size 2 was perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"If the bottle is upside down or on its side baby is soaked","review":"Awful.

Sometimes they leaked for no particular reason. The larger size nipple (we didn't use them much when we still needed the smaller nipple) leaked (or sometimes shot out) milk if our daughter tipped it over. We didn't care for all the parts either - they were easy to misplace and took longer to get a bottle ready for a hungry infant. Other than those concerns, though, we found them to be sturdy and to hold up where the Thinkbaby bottles were in tatters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many parts","review":"These bottles are not much different from any other bottles out there. After using them for some time I have to say that I spend more time cleaning them than using. What parent has time for it? If the insert is not put in place tightly, there surely will be leakage. You can't use these bottles without the venting system. If a child is really hungry, there is no way to warm these bottles under hot water; it will take forever! I totally agree with other parents who mentioned that these bottles are overrated. If you are just thinking of buying them, get something cheaper and with less parts. These are not worth spending that much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great look but problem with nipple collapsing","review":"I bought this bottle because of great reviews, bpa free and looks great. I love the eco friendly bottle with the green collar. The problem is the nipple keeps collapsing. I remedied this with using dr. Brown's wide neck bottle venting system and it worked. I also prefer Dr. Brown's nipple as it's softer and cheaper, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I doing something wrong?","review":"Ok, I just brought the born free BPA-free plastic bottles and I made sure that the slit was open before feeding, that there was no space between the venting system, and that it was over tightening the nipple and I was very disappointed & irritated that the bottle did leak!! whats going on!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky System","review":"I registered for these bottles because everyone raves about them however I too, found that the nipples collapse AND I have had so much leakage around the white ring that holds the nipple in place while feeding my son. I thing they are highly overrated and expensive when there are so many other less expensive BPA free bottles on the market now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky bottles and collapsing nipples","review":"I've been using born free bottles (glass and plastic) for 8 months now. When I first started, I noticed that the nipples would collapse at every feeding. I emailed the born free customer service and they told me that the silicone venting slit can stick together when sterilized. They recommended that I massage open the slit when putting the bottle together. This worked 50% of the time. When the bottle collapsed during feeding, I would have to unscrew the bottle and let air enter. After using them for some time, the nipples no longer collapsed but the bottles started leaking. It seems to me that the silicone venting system needs to be replaced every few months. I bought new silicone vents and they're not leaking now. I'm not going to buy another brand because I already invested so much money in these bottles. If I had to choose again, I would not buy born free again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bottles, happy baby, happy parents!","review":"We have used these bottles since our almost 1-year-old was about 6 weeks old. He has slowly moved up through the different nipple stages, and now loves his Born Free sippy cup. We originally started with these because he had such a gas and reflux problem, and these bottles with their weird little valves really seemed to work for him. It was an added bonus that they don't have the \\"bad plastic\\". The little valves are kind of annoying to clean when you have to do it by hand, but really only add a tiny bit of cleaning time overall. We have never had issues with mold, and the nipples held up through some terrible teething episodes. We have been super happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nipple Collapse","review":"I am very disappointed in these bottles. After reading reviews, they seemed like the best option for BPA free bottles. At first they worked ok with my newborn, but after less than 2 weeks nearly every nipple collapses during feedings, and my baby keeps on sucking in more air - you can actually hear her sucking in air. She gets very gassy and uncomfortable after feedings and I blame it mainly on these bottles and nipples. I switched to the new Dr. Browns BPA free bottles and they seem so be working great so far -- AND they are not as expensive as the Born Free. Some people seem to love the Born Free bottles, just didn't work for us. Good luck!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to say the least!","review":"I bought these Born Free bottles and nipples, switching away from Avent, mainly b/c of they are bpa-free. The Born Free bottles and nipples are so diappointing in every way. First of all, they are harder to clean (extra 2 piece valve). The bottles leak from the screw on neck. The nipples collapse consistently. Nothing could be more frustrating than dealing with these product issues when you have a hungry baby to feed. Finally, I switched back to the Avent nipples which work on these bottles. If you do buy this product, DON'T invest in the nipples- just use Avent nipples. I am sorry I invested so much $$ in this system..and would just like to warn others on the disappinting performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"BPA Free but poor design. Better BPA-free options if you look","review":"My wife bought a bunch because they were (for a time) the only BPA-free bottles she found (frankly didn't look that hard)They are decent bottles yes, but there is this extra pair of pieces which you have to assemble. I don't see that they do anything for reducing swallowed air or anything else, but they're fidgety and just extra pieces to clean.It might not sound so bad but it more than doubles the amount of work to fill a bottle, and at 3 AM when you have a screaming baby, you don't want to be diddling around with the extra pieces.BE WARNED - Replacement nipples are $7.50 a pair and they last only a month or two before they need to be replaced (The holes enlarge and let too much flow out) There are MUCH CHEAPER and simpler / better designed bottles out there - you just have to look.The sippy cups are another story entirely. They are a disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks like crazy and has annoying extra parts","review":"These bottles, which are obviously selling well because of the Bisphenol-A issues, leak like crazy. All you have to do is tip the bottle sideways and the milk comes gushing out like crazy. Makes a huge and annoying sticky mess. My advice, if you must absolutely have these, is to use the Avent nipples on these bottles. They fit and they don't leak at all, even upside-down. The silicone nipple is not implicated in the Bisphenol problems. The Born Free bottles also have a silicone gasket and a plastic insert, making cleaning and filling the bottles very frustrating and unnecessarily complex. I am hoping someone else comes up with a better BSA-free bottle because these are just not working for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"With my first child I used Avent bottles, but decided to go with Born Free for the second. I was holding a grudge against Avent as I purchased them in the past believing they were BPA free when they weren't. I wanted to support Born Free as Avent has been slow to jump on the BPA free bandwagon. Now that Avent does make a BPA free line I am letting the grudge go and switching back. My daughter has been using the Born Free bottles for the first three weeks of her life. She doesn't seem to be able to latch on to the nipple very well. She makes a loud smacking sound with every suck which leads me to think she is taking in a lot of air. Now it seems she may be having some nipple confusion as she is having a tough time latching on while breastfeeding and isn't creating a good seal. She was doing fine, but it seems that the more bottles she gets, the tougher it is becoming for her to latch on to the breast. Also, the Avent bottles are smaller and more comfortable to feed with."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is good","review":"I bought for my babay though she/he is not born, maybe i will review after i used it.But it seems good, the package is also completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Customer Service","review":"I ordered these directly from the company and to their credit, they delivered them very quickly.

But we switched to Born Free after learning about the bisphenol-A scare. We used the BF bottles for 2 months with no problem but now the silicone vent is broken. The middle tip of the vent (the part that points downward) somehow has a slit in it. This makes the nipple collapse and frustrates the baby. So far, I cannot find replacement vents.

I thought well why not just try them. I tried them- threw them in the trash where they belong. Nothing compares to these bottles. Never have i had any problem with the nipple collapsing my guess from reading reviews is there baby probably needed to go up a level in the nipple for more of a flow- (baby sucking to hard) My son is now 5 months and i just bought more 9oz bottles they are expensive but i will save them for our next baby.

We always bring the bottles with a paper towel wrapped around the neck, because it's almost certain it will leak. Hugely disappointing, and of course the customer service, as per other reviews, is terrible. They suggested we were overtightening the bottle, which we were not and continued to experiment with every combination of tightness, part combination, etc. It's very telling if ALL of their models leak, and alll 6 bottles -- obviously it's not a one off case.I hope they have improved their design in the meantime.

I don't think I would have paid for them if I had to buy them all brand new at once, but since I was getting credit, I decided to try them.I don't think the one extra valve piece is really that big of a deal - they're still less complicated than Dr. Brown's! I haven't had any leaking problems or melting problems (even in the dishwasher). I did have one crack when my daughter dropped it on a tile floor. I was lucky enough to be able to exchange it, but I would like them to be a little more sturdy -- especially now that my daughter is old enough to throw things she doesn't want! :)Overall, I'm happy I made the decision to switch, and they've worked fine for our family.

They are teething now, the new nipple is much softer and more comfortable for them. About cleaning, it doesn't bother me at all, for me it's easier than cleaning cleaning Dr.Brown's bottle because there is no tube. I love this bottle, I wish I found this sooner. Safe bottle, no leak, easy to travel with, easy with mixing formula and it fis my Avent bottle warmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After researching baby products, this came to the top of my list as it is BPA free. I also liked the concept of reduced pressure in the bottle from the venting system.Sadly, these bottles leak... a lot. They tell you not to tighten them too much or you lose the \\"venting\\" benefit. I'm a big guy and I really have to crank them down to prevent leakage. Then, I notice that my 2 month old son cannot seem to get milk out of them like he can from a standard no-frills Medela bottle. I tried them a month ago and thought to try them again. Leaking... reduced milk flow, all the same problems.This is a very disappointing product. I love the BPA free concept but if you can't use the bottle, what's the sense. It makes for a fancy storage container. The venting concept is also great... if it actually worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Born Free BABY!!","review":"A close friend told me about these bottles and after trying the Advent bottles, which leaked profusely, we decided to try them out.

There are more air bubbles, they are wider than the standard size Dr. Brown bottles which makes it difficult for my baby to hold them, they are harder to clean, and for us the biggest problem has been that the nipples collapse all the time. This is frustrating because nipple-collapse avoidance is mentioned in most of their on-line product descriptions!My son hates these bottles.

(it seals itself sometimes).I would rate it as 5 star, if not for the price of the nipples. i think they charge way too much for nipples, and they are just standard silicon nipples, nothing special. i have been using dr. brown's nipple on these born free bottles without problem. they are much cheaper, and better quality.their glass bottles are great too. i would stay away from their training/drinking cups if possible. it leaks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best in bottles!","review":"We tried several types of bottles (Avent, Dr. Browns, Gerber) and these are the ones that worked the best.

I love these bottles, we went through 4 different bottles before finding this one. everyone had a diffrent suggestion on what you need to use and why and it all doesn't matter it is going to be what works for your baby.The only thing i dont like about these bottles is the Price if u catch them on a sale there not bad, but i still think they are a little expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOTTLES","review":"Love these bottles. I know they are safe and they are the only nipples my daughter will use. She is mostly breastfed, except a couple days a week when mommy is back at work. Getting her to take the bottle was a HUGE challenge but she ended up getting the hang of it, although she still prefers the breast to the bottle:) The only downside that I can think of is there are a lot of parts to wash/sterilize, but I also bought the microwave sterilizer and a dishwasher container so it makes it a little easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bottle, easy to clean","review":"Bought it for two months. Good performance. Worked well for baby-feeding. Very easy to clean.The only shorts is the vending system.

We had 3 glass bottles, 2 of them cracked in the milk warmer machine, the third one is still good and not leaking.Then I bought 4 more plastic bottles, 2 from Target and 2 from the local grocery store. All these 4 bottles leak right now. The 2 from target started leaking after one month of usage, the other two right away. I feed the baby and then I stop half-way through and I put the bottle down on the coffee table/couch and the next time I pick it up there is milk everywhere around the bottle. I opened the cap and there is milk inside the cap, between the thread lines. These will be the last bottles I buy from this company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bottles","review":"These bottles cut down on the amount of air the baby was getting from another brand therefore the baby is more comfortable"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them","review":"These are the only bottles we use!

Each have their own good and bad qualities, so if you're comparing the products before buying I hope this helps. First, I have never encountered a leak with a Born Free bottle, which is such a plus!! Avent bottles leak ALL THE TIME! Second, Born Free nipples are not as sturdy and occasionally collapse. I've found that this occurs most often when the baby is ready to \\"graduate\\" to the next flow stage. I find this is the worst aspect to this bottle, as you have to interupt a feeding to allow air back into the nipple to restore. Third, you have to be careful mixing powdered forumla in these bottles. Just swirl first before shaking in order to prevent powder \\"chunks\\" from getting caught in the vent system and not dissolving properly. And lastly, yes it has more parts which can add some time to washing them, but that never really bothered me. Overall, I prefer the Born Free over Avent."},{"rating":"1","title":"It leaks and does not vent well. Wish Advent makes a BPA free bottle.","review":"The only reason we got this is for BPA free. It is complicated with many parts to clean. It does not vent when you screw the nipple on too tight. However if you let it loose, it leaks!!! We think we are pretty good at fixed things, but these are hard to use compare to Advant bottles.It will take Advent nipples, but it will leaks too. However Advent nipples vents much better. If only Avant makes BPA free bottle, we will swiych back in a second. It did not get one start becasue of the BPA:("},{"rating":"1","title":"Nipple collapses all the time!","review":"I just got this bottle because they are BPA free, my son like his milk warm. The problem I have is that the nipples collapse all the time, I use th Y nipple. I love the Avent bottle ant now they have BPA free bottles that you can combine with your old nipples. BornFree nipples are very expensive. I have tried everything and I think Avent is just the best. Dr. Browns are difficult to clean and time consuming to assemble. Avent is simple , nipples never collapse, and those who say that they leak it's because they are not closing it properly. Mine have never leaked. I also was very disappointed because I bought a 9oz three pack and when I got them there was only one vent valve included for 3 bottles. I have a coupon to get the other 2 vent systems for \\"free\\". Why would they not include it in the package? I have been at the store to redeem the coupon and they are always out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"I bought these bottles to replace our Avent bottles, due to BPA concerns. These bottles are ok, but I like Dr. Brown's better. I use a Medela breast pump and the Born-Free bottles, like the Avent bottles, do not fit on the pump. The Dr. Brown's bottles do fit the Medela pump connectors. Like other reviewers have stated, the nipples on these bottles collapses and there are extra parts that seem useless, just more stuff to clean. It is easier for my son to hold the Dr. Brown's bottles also. I would not recommend these, there are far better bottles out there, we also use Momo glass bottles, and I am very pleased with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bottle","review":"My son who is mostly breast fed likes the bottle. No problems using it. I wish the nipple were more like the breastflow bottle, but he just puts his lips around the very top of the nipple which is wider. Of course we love that it is BPA free. It does have a lot of parts to clean and keep track of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!","review":"I bought these bottles for my newborn and initially found the vent system to be working but after 2 weeks all the vent systems on the 6 bottles we had stopped working simultaneously and the nipples were collapsing. I had to keep pulling the bottle away from my hungry baby to allow air in bottle. These suck. Don't waste your money when other companies offer the same BPA free products for a fraction of the price. I returned these to Babies R' Us for a credit and bought Playtex Drop-In system bottles (liners are BPA free) and they have been great. Gas my baby had been experiencing also seemed to decrease after switching as he is not sucking as hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST venting system","review":"Truthfully, we have only tried two different bottle types. We registered for Born Free bottles and have been using them from the start, and when we wanted to try something new we were disappointed. The BF nipples have NEVER collapsed and our son is an avid sucker. :) We have also tried NUK because of the pricing (BF are VERY expensive) but we have to remove the bottle from our son's mouth every few seconds to prevent the nipple from collapsing...their \\"air vent\\" system does NOT work. I've come to the conclusion that the BF bottles are worth the price and am planning to buy more soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive, Expensive- not worth the money","review":"I was using Avent for my daughter until the whole BPA issue came up.. bought a couple of born free bottles.. Its the most expensive and they come only with stage 1 nipples.. the extra nipples are $7 a pack.. so over all we need to spend about $14 per bottle. After all this, the nipples start collapsing just around the 8 week mark and so have to be replaced.. They must be kidding! I contacted their customer service and did not recieve a response.. well we finally ended up buying playtex nurser which is only 1/3 of the cost.. I switched and my daughter is doing fine..so, I would say think twice before investing in this bottle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE EXPENSIVE BOTTLES!","review":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! These bottles are HORRIBLE! The Level 3 nipple is so fast that my 8 month old son chokes on the liquid. I actually had to replace them with level 1 and the nipples collapse. I ordered the sippy cups for my 2yr.old - not realizing they are NOT SPILL PROOF -My son likes to play with the cup and now I have to worry about spills. $140 down the drain! *****If you want bottles w/out BPA just use Evenflo - these bottles do not contain BPA. I found this out AFTER I purchased & used the bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safest bottles","review":"We love these bottles! They are bpa-free which makes us feel better about heating the milk in the bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Durability a disappoitment","review":"We bought a bunch of bottles and sippy cups from this company due to our concerns about the potentially harmful chemicals found in ordinary bottles. After less than two months many of the bottles have broken or are useless due to ripped nipples. If a toddler drops a full or partially full bottle/sippy, particularly from the height of being held by a standing adult, you can count on the bottle/sippy cracking open. Not only do the bottles crack easily, but the bottle nipples rip easily too. This makes the rest of the unit useless until you spend more money and time replacing the nipple. These bottles are probably fine for infants, but they have not endured the test of toddlers in my house. They do not demonstrate the durability of the standard plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst bottles EVER!","review":"My wife and I used these bottles for about 2 days and tossed them in the garbage. They might be BPA free, but that is really all that is good about them. The valve system for taking air our for colic doesn't work well. The nipples are fragile and weak, the hole on the nipple kept getting bigger and bigger by the hour. STAY AWAY FROM THESE bottles, go with Adiri or Madela, you'll be much happier!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate these bottles!","review":"I have never used such a tempermental bottle before.

It was great fun and we were constantly improving our codes to thwart the efforts of others who wanted to read those \\"important\\" messages. Had this book been available back then, we would have devoured it. Written at the level of a middle school student, the basic codes are thoroughly covered, yet not at a level beyond the child of the early teen years. No mathematics beyond simple arithmetic is used.As befits the original publication date of 1975, computers are not part of the codes, which I found to be an attractive feature. Writing simple codes is an exercise in thought, a process that computers sometimes interfere with. This is a book that can be read for enjoyment, and it can also be used as a book for class work designed to be fun. It should be in every middle school library."},{"rating":"2","title":"better bandage","review":"The nexcare comfort strips knuckle & fingertip bandages are the best because they stay on even in water.

Miller, a student of David Donald (2 time pulitzer prize winner, \\"Look Homeward Angel:Bio of Thomas Wolfe\\", and official Lincoln biographer) at Harvard University, gives the reader a complete picture of an author who has been forgotten in time.

These things crank out the sound. Loud with enough bass to shake the house. I couldn't be happier with these speakers. I've had them for over 6 years and they still crank. I have them hooked to a Dell PC with a Creative 5.1 sound card. They fill the room and shake the walls. You'll need some space cause the subwoofer is pretty big and the speakers wires are the long enough to place them in 5.1 configuration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good set from Logitech","review":"Very good speakers, but I must agree with the others here with the comments about the control being hard to use, and feels kind-of cheap.Decent bass, though due to the bandpass kind-of thuddy and when the cone is moving too much, you do notice a slightly louder thump sound.Good treble and midrange responce, though compared to the 680s, they are slightly less clear.I still recomend the 680s since right now you can get them for only about $100 more than these.Still, Logitech has yet to disapoint me with these speakers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding, especially for this price","review":"As the midway set between their budget/entry level Z-640 and their top of the line Z-680s, this set is a lot closer to the high end than the lower. My only gripes are the fact that the remote is wired to the subwoofer and the fact that you can't get \\"true\\" 5.1 off a game system like you can with the Z-680s unless you have a seperate decoder (which does make sense because the Z-680s are more expensive). However, the pseudo-5.1 effect that comes with these speakers works pretty well if you don't have that.The subwoofer is a little bulky compared to other sets similar to this one, but other than that, you can't go wrong here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"This system is my first one and I think it is awesome. The subwoofer is pretty powerful and the satellites are handsome and powerful, and capable to be mounted on the wall, they are capable of being rotated. The digital remote control is cool. Easy installation. I have an Audigy 2 ZS Sound-Card and I think the speakers work great with it.

I would choose this over the z560 anytime if you're wondering about what you should get at this price range. The z560 is a discontinued product anyway.My only rant that keeps me from giving it 5 stars: How are you supposed to stick the center speaker on the wall? A LOT of people will mount these speakers on the wall. The 4 other satellites have holes in them to screw onto the wall. I had to rig the hell out of the center speaker to mount it on the wall. I contacted Logitech about this, and normally they answer my emails, but they ignored this one.My opinion? They forgot about this particular aspect of the center speaker.Otherwise, great speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"I'm surpised by all the high reviews of this product. The speakers are pretty nice, but I think the design is horrible. The wired remote is poorly designed, ugly and well, wired.My center speaker arrived defective -- lots of static.My biggest gripe was with the subwoofer. There is simply no way to turn this thing down. The remote supposedly gives you a way to turn it down, but even at the lowest setting it is very loud -- too loud for me, or rather too loud for my neighbors.Long story, short: speakers - decent, wired remote - bad, quality - defective, subwoofer - uncontrollable.I would not recommend this product to anyone. If I had seen the remote in a store, I never would have bough the system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery Woman","review":"I loved this series when it was a TV years ago.

I had to sand by hand instead.I am working with Cumaru, which is brutal...but I don't think that should render the tool useless like this?The Fein Multimaster is 0 for 2 so far.I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Else Like It!","review":"I bought the Fein Multimaster for detail sanding on my boat. It does a terrific job, saving me hours of hand sanding. I use the hook and loop pad, and bought a box of Fein sandpaper, 50 count - for a reasonable price on Amazon. The single speed Start version works well for me; the cord length is ample, and I've had no need to vary the speed. I did have to buy a carrying case, though, to carry the few accessorries - it's about $28 or so. I've also used the saw blade that comes with the Start to cut holes in the back of a kitchen cabinet, and it worked like a champ - It saved me from having to purchase a close quarters drill.

The tool was in no way abused and used minimally for the time I owned it. The point I'm trying to make is that repair service for this product is not cheap and the tool should be considered disposable if something should happen to it out of warranty.

The flush blade is good for so-called flox corners and other flush cutting situations. The sanding pads cut almost as fast as the blades and are good for more complex shapes. It is really amazing to see the glass curl off from the sanding pads.One caveat: the first one I bought failed after about 1 minute of use...the bearings came apart.

This product now saves my skin from the dry, windy weather. My husband even asked me what I was doing different to keep my skin so soft. The smell is subtle and not overpowering. The shimmer is nice, especially in the middle of winter.Unfortunately, the local Target stopped carrying it, so I'm stuck buying online and paying shipping, but it's worth the cost. This works much better than slathering up with lotion every day only to have your skin still dry a few hours later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judge it on it's own merits","review":"And it still isn't as good as the MST3K version. Anyway, as someone else noted it's not the same cut that MST3K has. Abby isn't seen in flashback in the 2nd half, Buffalo Bill's song at the Pit Stop is cut out and there's a whole backstory to Sam's invisibility at the beginning. But there is more of \\"the elusive Robert Denby\\". My guess is MST3K was a cut for TV (where you have to clear time for commercials and clarify things quickly) and the commercial release may have been a cut for foreign markets to introduce the show or pass it off as an actual theatrical production."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Director's NIGHTMARE!!!","review":"This flick was so CHEESY and BADLY DONE that it has surfaced in my favorite Sci-fi channel show, Mystery Science Thteater 3000; poor Mike Nelson, Tom Serbo and Crow had to endure this turkey of a movie.

It isn't the writing, even though that is worse than the acting. No, it's that the cover of the video displays a \\"crashing plane.\\" There isn't a plane in the entire mess - let alone a crashing one! Sure, there's a semi, a race car, and a helicopter (it doesn't crash, either). Where's the crashing plane? They make it look like \\"Riding WIth Death\\" is one of those airport disaster films by the cover, but it's worse - Ben Murphy in a couple of episodes of a failed 70s tv show!Perhaps the crashing plane on the cover refers to the movie in a more metaphorical way. Films have been called train wrecks before, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just riding with slight abrasion...","review":"I agree with everyone else. This movie is HORRIBLE. I saw it on MST3K also.

The flashbacks, dubbing, voice overs, Jim Stafford's singing--not to mention the clothes and hairstyles--make you want to change channels. Hard to believe the lame plots--one for each episode of the pilot--were concocted with the help of Steven Bochco. This must have been aimed at NBC viewers when Fred Silverman was in charge. Maybe a little Tom Wopat driving by in the General Lee would have added some excitement--NOT. The only thing missing was a touch of Joe Don Baker for that authentic malaise flavor.

I have already purchased a Porter Cable sander as its replacement. I have suggested to the Makita regional repair manager (in Chicago) that this kind of treatment was unacceptable, but with no results. I beleive that they should have replaced the sander with a new one after it failed the second time. It is unreasonable to expect me to pay for this sander, two trips to the service center, three long distance phone charges and a replacement sander so I can continue in business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Box!!","review":"I bought this set in USA and lugged it back to the U.K. so i can say it's a big box. As for the tools... The blower is absolutely useless...well...actually i found a use for it...blowing cobwebs out of the corners of my rooms. The torch i haven't used much..doesn't seem like anything special. However..the main tools of the set i have found excellent. The jigsaw especially seems very powerful for a cordless. The drill is lovely to use..not to heavy and the batteries go on and on. Only one gripe..the chuck has some play in it straight out of the box. I built a large deck in 3 weekends just using these cordless tools and the only sticking point was trying mitres with the circ saw. No Chance...had to drag out the Ls1013 another excellent makita tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crisp, clean and clear...","review":"So, a few days ago I decided to upgrade my Mac Pro speakers from a Bose Companion 5 set I've had for a few years now, to a real nice upgrade. This time around I decided to go with my favorite audio brand: Bang & Olufsen, and I got the BeoLab 4 set. Even at a very low setting the sound is crisp, clean and clear by comparison to the Bose is night & day. I love the looks, the design and more importantly the sound, I definitely recommend these speakers, not only for a Mac (or PC) but also as a nice minimalist main stereo system. I'm listening to my favorite crooner: Billie Holiday, I almost feel transported back in time and imagine sitting with Billie at the bar....amazing how good speakers can get you in the perfect mood!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmm","review":"Bought this battery for my bro-in-law in Argentina.

Interestingly, the Panasonic battery that came with my similar camcorder crapped out long ago, whereas the aftermarket spare battery I bought is still going strong...4 stars because it is probably a good battery, but not the best value (overpriced)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always buy the official battery","review":"This official Panasonic camcorder battery also works for the new VDR-D300 and VDR-D250 3CCD DVD camcorders. I had checked Panasonic's website to confirm before I bought it for my VDR-D300. It works very well.As a gadget expert (if there were such a thing), I highly recommend getting an official battery. Sure, the generics can cost 1/3 as much, but you run serious and real risks of getting an explosion or other undesirable results. I don't say this because I work for Panasonic; I don't work for any electronics company or any electronics store. I say it because I believe 1) a real battery is a worthy long-term investment for your expensive camcorder, and 2) your life and well-being are worth more than the price difference. You also save yourself lots of hassles down the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will last a lifetime","review":"Great product. This battery never leaves you short!

The second is a history up to the creation of the park in 1872. The early history, of fur trappers and explorers, is the meat of the book and is fascinating.

Well I decided to brave it and purchased it. Well all in all it took my husband 2-1/2 hours to put togther with minimal foul language and a few games of basketball with the directions into the garbage can. The only major problem was that the middle support bar on the bottom is about 3\\" too big so I am going to have to ask for a replacement for it. Other than that, I LOVE the swing!! Oh and P.S.

Only thing is that I ordered the green one but got a blue one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great swing at a great price","review":"The instructions were fairly easy to decipher. There were no missing parts. It took two of us about 2 hours to put the swing together. Seems very sturdy although the mesh seat material could probably use some reinforcement and the cushions were a bit thin. We put extra patio furniture cushions underneath the one provided. The adjustable awning makes it perfect for any time of the day. Any water brushes right off. For us, it was a great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody loves it","review":"I bought this because it was a bargain at the price, and was very pleasantly surprised by the how well it was made.

It appears to be good quality (but will not know the rust factor until it stays outside for a while). Cannot beat it for the price.One little drawback, make sure you can put things together and it helps to have your own tools (but they provide the tools). In my opinion the directions are not real detailed and a little hard to follow. It takes a while to put together as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Boring","review":"I really do not know what everyone is thinking. AMG loved it. The other people on here loved it. This is the most boring album I have ever heard. The first song is essentially someone holding down a key or two on the \\"strings\\" setting on a keyboard for 30 minutes with minimal change. The other tracks may add wind chimes or a dog being near a mic, but it is the same bunch of nothing as the first track. Call it subtle and brilliant all you want, but the only time I even bother to put this on is when I am going to sleep. I give it two stars because it is nice to fall asleep to, but really has no other applications.

I've been trying to avoid eating foods containing artificial dyes and these were a great replacement for the popular candy that has dyes. I find them to be a little less sweet but actually prefer that. The candy shells are quite brittle and most of the candies came with cracked shells. i.e. The bottom of the bag had quite a bit of chipped candy coating. This didn't really bother me as I like these for the taste, not their appearance, but I could see how others may be turned off by this.

The strings never seem obtrusive; instead, the backing seems to accentuate Desmond's solos. He weaves melodically over these standards, lilting over the strings, and trading solos with the always-incredible Jim Hall's. When Hall takes the lead, his guitar work echoes Desmond's understated leads. \\"I Should Care\\" and \\"Late Lament\\"(one of two Desmond compositions) are two of the strongest offerings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Stuff!","review":"This is one which my dad had on LP, but which got lost in the shuffle, years after my dad passed on.

Rusty Cundieff's songs are incredibly deft (not def, although they're that, too) in their mixing of parody, verbal dexterity and even some internal rhymes that put the average busta to shame. The movie, of course, is brilliant as well.A personal favorite, from \\"Come Pet ...\\": \\"It's our job to educate, infiltrate or shred 'em/So c'mon, let's spread 'em ...\\"The only thing that keeps it from five stars is the idiotic \\"White Cops On Dope,\\" which isn't in the movie and shouldn't have been on the CD.

The tracks are very reminicent of the early stages of hip-hop but it's meant to be that way. The lyrics are hilarious and even more so if you have experienced the movie.

I love listening to this cut as I am driving. Yeah, its kinda childish and stuff, but the songs they parody (My FAVORITE is the PM DAWN parody 'I'm Just A Human') are actually quite good. And, to be honest, the best song on the album, which is kindofa political statement about the Rodney King beating and race riots in LA, is 'Guerrillas In the Midst', and its not humorous at all, just really good and politically potent.

Even though these books are based on talks given by Master Yogananda in the early 1900s, they are still relevant today. Paramahansa Yogananda gives us useful information about how to live our lives so that we can experience God first hand and how to find happiness. It doesn't matter what religious/spiritual path you follow. You can gain much from reading this book. One of Master Yogananada's teachings is that all religions are seeking the same truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Insights by a True Master","review":"This book is an amazing collection of talks and essays given by the Master Yogi, Paramahansa Yogananda, back in the early 20th century. In its pages you will find many remarkable insights about God, self realization, the nature of reality, and help with daily living. I have read many books in this genre and found this to be one of the best I've ever read. I would highly recommend it to any spiritual seeker of Truth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get Better","review":"If everyone read and followed this book, this world would take a 180 degree turn.

Both me and my friend (who was scheduled to leave for an overseas trip) had some tense days until the book arrived."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best book for the new seeker.","review":"Having spent the past 6 years of my life in the study of the Purana's and Hinduism I have come to find Paramahansa Yogananda a well rounded and polished soul. I say that he is great for the beginner for the fact that his many speeches are easy and clear in there understanding. This is a book that can be read piece by piece and the reader will come out with better understanding after each story. This will give you a little back round into Hinduism. But please note that Paramahansa Yogananda tried to attach the teachings of Jesus into many of his works. This is fine if you are not a person who is strict to doctrine but Jesus will not pop up in any of the Hindu epics such as the Ramayana,Mahabharata or any of the major Purana's. If you are looking for Straight Hinduism look elsewhere or pick up one of the many epics. I would suggest Ramesh Menon who has translated many major works into English."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality Bites...","review":"Mr. Roberts' rise as an entrepreneur is nothing short of phenomenal. \\"Action Has No Season\\" is a candid book about the machinations of the world and how to traverse its trappings.

Given the weight of the thing, I assembled it in the mobile base. I finished it and easily rolled it to it's new home, which was 1/2 inch off level (front-to-back of saw). While there are two holes for the wheels in the base to afford front-to-back leveling, the bolt is not accessible with the saw in the base. So I had to jack up and brace both ends of the saw to level it, cussing the engineers the whole time. What should have been an easy, safe, 5 minute job turned into a cumbersome, dangerous, 2 hour effort. The wheels on the front and back of the mobile base should be redesigned and placed on the left side to afford leveling while the saw is in the base. I also found the finish of the cast top inferior to that of a couple Jet tools I bought at the same time. The mill marks in the Delta saw make it hard to wax. I hope that I see these as minor inconveniences 10 years from now... we'll see."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE SAD TRUTH ABOUT THIS BOOK!","review":"In my opinion this book has very little to do with heavy metal guitar.The author places heavy emphasis on the blues,and blues influence in modern rock music.The fourth chapter titled\\"The influence of early rock and blues\\" which is 33 pages long tells the reader all about people such as Robert Johnson,Otis Rush,Buddy Guy,B.B. King,and mike Bloomfield.The author goes on to tell the reader in chapter six entitled\\"Early heavy metal lead guitar\\" about such people as Jimmy Page,Jimi hendrix,and Eric Clapton.There are some exercises and other lessons that are covered such as basic power chords,\\"whammy\\" bar exercises,basic rock/blues scales,and some other stuff.There is NO mention of bands like Black Sabbath,Motorhead,Metallica,Slayer,or any of the other great metal bands that(for me) come to mind when I think of heavy metal guitar.This is a great book if you want to learn about how the blues influenced rock,and learn a little blues guitar while your at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This a poor attempt at writing.

Wealthy men don't want gold diggers, they want a woman who can be a true companion, and Ms. Johnson shows you how to achieve that in her book. Ms. Johnson's book should not be panned because she is not married to a millionaire or taking money from one.

Thankyou Lisa Johnson!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Basically Improper","review":"If you have had little or no exposure to North American culture or media, this book would provide you with all of the fundamentals of the upper class. Beyond that, Lisa Johnson's advice seems largely based upon common sense or on how to not be lower class. Very little useful specific information is given. I also disliked the author's approach to meeting people. In the unlikely event that one does see a millionaire in the 7-11, it's just not the sort of place that one socializes and properly meets people. Yet that's just the sort of thing that is suggested by the author. The general lack of propriety in her methods is what makes this book poor instruction unless you really need the basics. Try Ginie Polo Sayles's book for something a bit more useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are looking for the rich boy, this is not the place","review":"When I bought the book, I thought it was a satire or parody (like \\"The Code\\" to \\"The Rules\\") and was expecting some good laugh. Boy was I wrong (about the content). Apparently the author is not being frivolous and the subject is taken quite seriously. Imagine, for only $5.99 you can learn to marry into the top 5%! Not only the whole idea that someone who is still single can write a book about \\"snatching\\" a millionaire is suspicious, but the enomorous amount of contradictions in the book embarrassed me, an avid reader, for reading such incoherent and inconsistent piece of writing.See for yourself if you are so inclined. Maybe you will pick up some good tips I intentionally overlooked. All the good advice only costs you 6 bucks and hurry up before other readers take up all the goods!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good reference to snare a millionaire","review":"This book provides no details to show you how to snare a millionaire. It shows you how to get a man or how to keep a relationship going; but no suggestion as how to get a rich and good looking guy of your dreams. The authour may have dated a lot of guys with money; but if she could not get a rich guy for herself then why you want to listen to her advise on this subject matter?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"I have bought Ginie Polo Sayles books on how to marry the rich and they were ten times better than this one. This author gives advice like: don't wear pantyhose with tennis shoes, and proper table manners that everyone should automatically know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother- The Rules are Better","review":"This book is drivel. The author teaches you to approach men, chase after them, research their lives and backrounds, etc. I thought it would be an interesting book, but she actually fills the pages with advice like: give hints to let him know you'd marry him if asked, men don't like white shoes after labor day, and she even has recipes and word lists! The fact that she herself has not managed to snare a millionaire and her mother is divorced because her own father was cheating tells you just how effective her advice is in getting a rich husband and happy marriage. If you must read it, get it at the library, but don't pay for it. I wish I hadn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid - faulty","review":"I cannot tell you the disappointment when we were half way through Jamaica Inn and the film suddenly skipped to the end. Useless.

They are clean, sometimes hilarious (Littl-e Heroes), and always teach good morals. The bad guys lose and the good guys win. Simplistic? Maybe a bit, but yet they give you glimpses of how significant life can be without all our gadgets and busyness. And the movies value the lives of their characters so that you start believing that it is important to prefer others above yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish writiing at its best.","review":"Case in point: (Pg. 236) \\"'Good day to you', James said overly formally to the woman, and stopped her in her tracks, he thought.

My hope was to find sources which would provide broad factual context for the current crisis.Unfortunately this work is no more than a diatribe on the total culpability of Israel for the conflict which leaves no room for shared responsibility in the Arab community. To accept the argument of this work the middle east was an eden of peaceful coexistence prior to it's invasion by Jewish aggressors (who also initiated all of the Arab-Israeli wars according to Mr. Wright).I reject the argument that Israel does not bear it's share of responsibility for the conflict in the middle east; however, Mr. Wright's one-sided approach is totally unsatisfactory."},{"rating":"1","title":"anti-Semitic diatribe - good propaganda!","review":"As has lonnng been said, when Israel is held to standards that no other nation is - or that no reasoned comparisons are made with - then you are reading anti-semitic diatribe.

A Belgian man was also torturously murdered by El Presidente at the same time. When Arafat was through, one could not tell which one was black and which one was not.Gotta love them \\"Facts and Fables.\\" Arab fantasy ideology lives!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Near Death","review":"I've been reading books about the beneficial effects of near-death experiences, so when I read The Country Life, I saw the main character, Stella as a person fluttering on the brink of death. She was a woman with a death wish much stronger that her lust for the life given to her.Not that she wanted to die completely. What she wanted was to die to an old self, a self defined by her parent's desire for upward social mobility. When, in the first chapter, she made the bold step of cutting off from them, as well as her parent-approved male partner, I knew I wanted to read her story.If she could somehow die to the old self, maybe she could attain more than a brief taste of happiness. But to do so, she would need to mourn -- it is the mournful who finally are comforted. Instead of mourning, she flirts, she fantasizes, she says yes when she wants to say no. This reader mourns for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"Gosh I was disappointed by this book. The characters were two-dimensional and unconvincing, there was the suggestion of an interesting subplot involving disgruntled locals with a grudge, of which we heard nothing more, ditto the hinted at marital infidelities and the background to Stella's flit from london to the countryside. The first-person narration was plodding and dull - Stella's observations were pedestrian and her problems (sunburn, hunger, an insalubrious suitor) uninteresting. I've seen lots of glowing reviews of this book on amazon and honestly can't see why. Avoid at all costs, life is too short for dross like this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and haunting","review":"\\"The Country Life\\" is one of very few contemporary books that has really captured my imagination, and, I hesitate to say it for fear of sounding corny, my heart. Something about this very awkward and self-conscious narrator will resonate with anyone who has been a dork growing up, and the central relationship rings true, if for all the wrong reasons. I wanted to reread it almost as soon as I finished it--I felt there was some kind of treasure there that I wanted to find again. Not for everyone, but if this books works for you, it will make your day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prozac, anyone?","review":"Stella is a thoroughly dull and neurotic woman. The other characters are equally bizarre and unappealing. There is no discernable plot. There are a few well written passages, some funny, but not enough to warrant slogging through this dreary tome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious, over-written style ruins it","review":"Clearly this is a matter of taste, but I find Ms Cusk's prose almost unreadable. She seems to think that using an endless catalog of long words and exploring every nuance of the action (relevant or not) is what makes LITERATURE. She never stops trying to show off, like a third rate academic on an ego trip. This, for me anyway, is not what good novels are about. They're about being evocative, vivid, visceral maybe. Ms Cusk wouldn't know viscera if she found it on her doorstep. I can't comment on the plot, if such there be, because after 100 pages of this I was almost climbing the walls. (I'm giving a second star for punctuation!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an imitation of Stella Gibbons's Cold Comfort Farm","review":"If you like reading books about city types who go to the country, a much better, funnier book is Stella Gibbons's Cold Comfort Farm. Ms. Cusk must have been thinking of writing a 90's Cold Comfort Farm. Even her heroine's name is Stella.While reading The Country Life I kept remembering the dialogue of Cold Comfort Farm, and I certainly missed it in this poor imitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Stella a break","review":"Okay, let's be honest. It is pretty fair to say this book does not have an exciting plot, and it is not humorous. On top of that, the writer is somewhat showing off through the style of writing. However, I have to say I found this book very realistic, unlike what most think. I have to admit that when I read about the way Stella thinks and acts ,I found myself completely--and I mean really completel--fit in her character. Yes she does \\"spent minutes of her life worrying about whether the door to a grocery store had a bell attached, which would ring when she entered, and then people in the grocery store would notice her walking in, and that somehow the presence or lack of a bell on the door would be symbolic\\" (quote from a review here earlier). But so what? You don't think that way doesn't mean nobody does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Gifted Writer","review":"I adored this novel. It wasn't just the likeable character of Stella or the complex Martin, it was the whole package: the prose, the humor, the plot, and I could go on. This is a novel in which there is unbelieveable love and gratitude, and I found it almost the perfect book. The only way it could have been better if I'd read it while on vacation. It is definitely and escapist novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the story?","review":"I can only guess that this author got into print because she was well connected and looks beautiful in the book jacket. Half way through this book I threw it across the room, not from laughter, but from frustration. Where's the story? Where's the character? I am a big fan of British fiction, but this book's style is dated, derivative (lamely, of Stella Gibbons) and without context. My reaction to the character from page one was, who cares, who cares, who cares? These eccentric observations are very old, and with no plot no characterisation and no back story, I don't know how the reader is expected to care enough to keep reading. Please note, I am NOT one of those Oprah freaks who is on the lookout for meaningful literature, but someone who likes to be entertained in the manner of the comic novels of Evelyn Waugh, E.F. Benson, etc. This book did not come near the kind of British humor it was billed as delivering. It was aimless -- typing, not writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"If you're hoping for a charming story of a nanny learning the in's and out's of country life, this is NOT it.

I am not an English major, but certainly not uneducated either, and found The Country Life a most difficult and disturbing read. This is English humor? Gees...I used to love Benny Hill, but this book didn't have me even cracking a smile. Just as Stella seems to have difficulty separating fantasy and reality, I kept asking myself if I was really reading a novel this bad, or was just imagining that I was.Maybe I'm just not sophisticated enough to appreciate truly great fiction. Naw, I believe I can recognize good writing when I see it, and this wasn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Reading about Stella's mistakes made me feel better about some of the stuff I've done. I came away thinking, gee, the stuff she does makes my blunders look good! The part where Stella learns to drive is absolutely hilarious. It's a good read if you're looking for something not too serious and not too deep. There is a little bit of mystery about Stella's past but it adds to the story, in my opinion. The only caution I have is, make sure you have a nice, handy dictionary close by. Some of the words Ms Cusk uses are not part our every day vocabulary.

Not because it broke or anything of that nature. It sucks because of the details, and when you decide to spend this much on a toaster, it seems to reason, you're interested in the details.I have two primary issues with this machine:1) Its not possible to turn off just one side. I generally prefer not to toast both sides of a sliced bagel or English muffin.2) The 1\\" slots. This might initially seem like a good idea; it is one of the features that initially drew me in. But a crucial flaw lies with the implementation of these wide slots. There is not a self-adjusting, centering carrier for the bread; not a carrier of any kind. It's just a big void. So if you insert a normal slice of bread it has to lean to one side or the other resulting in, of course, uneven toasting; absolutely unforgiveable in a toaster of this expense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelmed","review":"I found that this toaster got rave reviews by different sources (cooking.com, etc) but I must admit that it is not much better than the $30 toaster that I purchased 15 years ago.

The critical difference for Christians is in how we perceive God. Is He our co-pilot, or is He THE pilot?

On page 184 he says, \\"This love communicates loudly and clearly, 'You do not have to change in order to maintain my love for you.'\\" This statement is fundamentally true. We are commanded to love our neighbor as ourself. However, our prayer and desire is that each person we know DOES change into the new creation God wills them to, through the cleansing blood of Jesus Christ! And not just a basic, one time change.

The fence I received would not sit flat on the table. It was about 0.016\\" high on one side. The aluminum fence face supports were properly ground perpendicular to the high side of the casting. It was thus unusable as delivered since variations in tightening down the casting onto the router table would cause variations in the alignment of the fence faces to the table. Because the casting is made of aluminum, the screws stripped out when I tried to shim it. So it went back. Maybe I just got a bad one. But the bottom of the fence should have been ground flat as well. That would have eliminated the possibility of the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea poorly executed","review":"Bought the SH-5 to outfit my newly made custom router table.

There were no installation instructions, nor contact information for customer service. Then, after working with the unit for awhile, it became evident that I needed the ALEPSH-5 extension plate to make it work with my insert. Good luck finding one. I was unable to find any information on Freud's website, and when I called them, they directed me to a dealer in Florida. They didn't have one, didn't know when they could get one.

The adapter broke the second day I used it.Second problem, the main one is, the product just doesn't work. I have to wait anywhere up to an hour for a picture to appear on the screen after I turn the unit on. If I put it in standby mode it can still take several minutes of recovery for the picture to reappear.

They sent a replacement hose. The third time, the hose burst again. I have never had any other hose burst in my house, so I don't think its my water pressure. I will say that the customer service is very good and they have sent out replacement parts. On top of the problems, the mechanism just doesn't work very good. I've had to adjust the tension so it won't rewind leaving about 5-10 ft left with no where for it to go. Even after adjust it, it works better if you leave the hose end open so the water is not in the hose. Of course this then leaves water everywhere as it wind up.

You can focus on a person's good points while acknowledging their shortcomings (which we all have), or you can do the exact opposite and concentrate on the subject's fault's while only giving a casual nod to their contributions.This book is an example of the later. The authors latch on to a set of peeves they have with Stan Lee, and never let go.

As a woman with petite wrists, I appreciate how easy it is to adjust the Skagen mesh wristbands; this may be done at home.

I had to use two of my own, larger, screws to hold the plate as the holes for the original screws were stripped. Then, they give you a 'whopping' 3 or so feet of hose to attach to your compressor, like that's EVER going to be enough. So, every single person that buys this has to go out and buy another stretch of hose, with all the right fittings, to attach their compressor to this reel.

Now I know that the alarm time has to be corrected too. The only other feature I would like to have on this alarm clock would be to be able to set a separate alarm time for weekends only.

However....I got this clock radio a day or two before New Years and it worked fine until the first week of February. Suddenly, almost none of the features work. The alarm no longer functions in either the radio or alarm mode, the radio no longer works and neither the sleep nor nap functions work.

(I.E., the officer's valise, info on binoculars, and different manufacturers of clothing and web gear.)

He is/was extremely economical in his approach to film making and this is both a strength and perhaps also something of a weakness. Additionally, I hope all his films are not as humorless as this one is.As I watched this filmed I was reminded of Fellini's classic, Nights of Cabiria. Keiko and Cabiria are very similarly circumstanced, as another reviewer has noted. The scene about two-thirds of the way through the film when Keiko is pictured briefly standing before a bar named Cabiria in Tokyo's Ginza district appears to be Naruse's way of paying homage to Fellini. But this film and Nights of Cabiria are not in the same league. Where Fellini was more willing (and able) to show rather than tell, Naruse's treatment of this material, spare though it is, is also almost wholly lacking in nuance."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unjustly Neglected Master","review":"When a Woman Ascends the Stairs is not one of Mikio Naruse's best films, but it is quite good enough to show anyone unfamiliar with his work what a sensitive and uncompromising filmmaker he is. Just as Ozu devoted most of his work to the disintegration of the Japanese family, Naruse concentrated almost invariably on the lives of women in Japanese society. His films are often sad and his 'endings' are somewhat less than uplifting, but when you watch, in When a Woman Ascends the Stairs, his heroine (played beautifully by Hideko Takamine) betrayed by the men she turns to for help and/or salvation, it becomes clear that Naruse was a great director - not as versatile as Mizoguchi, but unjustly neglected."},{"rating":"2","title":"No words to describe the great experience of reading this book...","review":"I love the whole Elric Sagaif you love fanasy books...

That being said this is the greatest record the Polecats ever put out but I do not think it has aged well at all. The early Stray Cats are very timeless to me and still sound fresh, this does not. I love the extras on this from the EP that came out, but I still hate the cheesy \\"Make a Circuit With Me\\" tune that most people remember them for.

The struggles Sonea has with being the poor girl in the rich-kids school is realistic and the description of magic, as well as the duel between her and her nemisis (or at least I think that was in the second book) is awesome.I read through the day, which is unusual, but it means one thing: this book read fast and had at least something i was expceting to happen in it. Normally, only the young adult books I read like this: psitting in my chair, subconsiously doing something else.I give this book its four stars. It is more original than the first book (which made me think that Canavan has read a lot of Raymond Feist's works) and has more action and less drama. If you liked the first book at all, you will not be disappointed in any way whatsoever........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest of the trilogy...","review":"The whole trilogy is just ok.

As a result, I held no great expectations for this story, however, I was still dissapointed. I have never read a book with an established protagonist and storyline that devoted so much page space to the development of the relationship of sidecharacter and the progression of a marginal subplot. If the author wishes to espouse tolerance of alternative lifestyles, there are other more appropriate pulpits from which to preach. While the overall story still manages to be coherant, it lacks focus and impact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darn Good Read","review":"As Bildungsromans go, this is a good one. Sonea grows a bit here and acquires more of a conscience. The other characters are expanded more and the tale is told from 4 separate viewpoints. There's some serious bullying, a good fight at the climax, a mystery or two, a red herring, tales of adventure as the story moves out of the confines of the city into the greater world and a little romance.All in all this is a good successor to the first book in the series. Also, as the middle book in a trilogy, it has a suprisingly satisfactory end, with just enough plot hooks to keep the reader interested without being too much of a cliffhanger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the First","review":"I found the first book in the series to be a light, enjoyable read. The characters, however, were a bit flat and the plot too predictable.In this book, we start getting some dimensionality to the characters: Sonea finds that passive resistance is not as effective as active response. Rothen begins to show some of his weaknesses, including the errors of believing \\"if you ignore it, it will go away.\\" Sonea gains two new guides: one that encourages her to take control of her situation, and one that can control her.The plot also is a bit more complicated in this book, and begins to show the ties and the weaknesses of the political world. The plot is still a bit predictable, but lends at least a few dark mysteries that probably won't be revealed until book 3.Overall, an enjoyable read, and an improvement over book 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing sequel","review":"I enjoyed the first book. I wouldn't call it great literature, but it was mostly a fun, light read. The second book, however, was dull. The lengthy and repetitive moralizing about gay rights seemed out of place in this book, and the subplot about Dannyl discovering his true feelings for his handsome assistant took far too much time. But, sadly enough, when the plot switched back to Sonea, the novel did not improve. Her continued hiding from the rest of the students, led by the school bully, coupled with her fear to fight back and unwillingness to call the Administrator or other friendly adults for help during the many vicious attacks, made her character far less appealing than in book one.I picked up the first two books half price at a local bookstore that was closing. I doubt I'll buy the third, though I might borrow it from the library if possible just to see how the tale ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating continuance of a promising series","review":"I do not know wether it's the author's own bias or not, but the pacifism of all of the main characters is grating. The protagonist resolutely accepts victimization by her peers and superiors, which is presented as a good thing. Of the three main magician professions, all Warriors are described in negative or at best neutral terms - while all Healers are presented as near-saints. I found it an unpleasant read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisless but not Troublefree","review":"I like the fact that it's truly silent which is why I ordered it.

Additionally, the Toshiba set I received had a flaw in the tube where the top 2\\" of the tube was constantly brighter than the rest of the picture.

I hope not","review":"What this book needs most is a continuity editor to keep the physical descriptions compatible. It would help if the characters had plausible motivations for their actions. It would help if the basics of every day life - the manditory duties of the priest, the caring for the sheep - were in the general vicinity of accurate. It would help if the book had a cohesive view of the magic, ritual, hallucinagenic substances, reincarnation etc. that make up the core of the plot.It should be obvious that I don't care for this coming-of-age, gay masochist novel. What makes it most frustrating is that here and there one reads flashes of excellent writing - enough so that this book may have an historical place in gay erotica.

Enter Brave on the Rocks. It's a great book-- fun and quirky-- but it's not quite Spilling Open (SWH's first book). I love Sabrina's style and crazy wit, but Brave on the Rocks lacks the soul and intimacy of her earlier work. I'm hesitant to say anything critical of Sabrina's work because I admire her in so many ways, but I think both the art and the writing in Brave on the Rocks fall short of the author's potential-- as we saw in the AMAZING Spilling Open. Nevertheless-- Brave on the Rocks is still a daring work with few books that can even compare. Please support this wonderful, adventurous artist!

I'll look like a chump, then.I was happy to find Spilling Over hidden amongst the books I browsed at the bookstore. The art was cool. After purchasing and reading the book, however, the project as a whole made me a little nauseous--there was an abundant amount of egotism to swallow and a not-very-unique story told.Some artists and some authors develop an overbearing ME on the success of their work, which then becomes rather unpalatable to some people. And, I feel like Harrison is guilty of that sin in Brave on the Rocks. It's like...get over it, already. Evolve, already. Brave is just more pages of the first book.I don't mean to completely knock Harrison. It's that this art is just not -that- worthy.

I thought the first an interesting journal, with a delightfuly childish approach, for a woman in her early 20's,even though THAT concept was difficult to swallow-- so I then at least expected this new book to be something new, something different but instead she choose to stay a pre teen having a pity party and so self absorbed she draws her own face over and over in this Brave On the Rocks.

Gunaratna's book helped me in understanding the threat as it exists in the world today.

Rated 4 because it is constantly jumping around chronologically, making the history difficult to understand at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"publicity stunt","review":"This book is very disappointing, as is most of Gunaratna's work on islamist terrorism. It's the sort of stuff governments and many of the public want to hear, ie. bin Laden and AQ are everywhere, responsible for every terrorism attack and all regional terorist groups (such as JI) are AQ franchises - total bollocks. The book lacks solid and verifiable reserach and is written by a \\"scholar\\" who spends most of his time doing alarmist media commentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Book, Not the Best Writer","review":"There have been some informed and insightful commentaries on the terrorism problem. This is not one of them. Gunaratna has no real background in Islamic studies or the Middle East and it shows. It might impress people who have no real knowledge of the terrorist problem, but it is likely only to mislead them. Gunaratna is a former intelligence officer for the Sri Lankan Government. With that war largely over, Gunaratna has jumped on the counter-terrorism bandwagon and is marketing himself as an expert on international terrorism.

The welds are okay but the overall design leaves much to be desired. The casters are sure to be troublesome as they do not have ball-bearings in the wheel hubs but bushings instead - that will make moving anything heavy a greater chore. The extension tubes do not mate with the corner brackets very snuggly and have lots of slop in them. And the real kicker - if this is the model that is capable of carrying 1200# then what the heck is the G7314 made out of?

When I was attaching the second long side I used a box and a pillow to prop it up until I was able to secure it in the proper place. All I needed was a Phillips screwdriver for the main pieces and a hammer for the back piece. Instructions are easy to follow and the assembly is not complicated at all.

David mixes wonderful self-storyline with historical home computer accuracy and creates a book that reads more like an entertaining novel than a traditional book about himself. While I am year younger than David (I am 30 now-12/98), I can relate to almost everything he talks about in the book. How early home computers captured my interest where nothing else could. I can honesyly say this is the first book I have read, cover to cover, in many years. Most books about computers, be it reference or history, usually tire by page 100. This is not that book. I ordered the book from Amazon less than a week ago and read it in less than 3 days. I could not put it down. David has done an excellent job putting this diary and story down on paper.

He was almost a hacker except that once a real hacker dissed him. Later he turned his best friend over to the school authorities for social engineering access to a password file. He went to Harvard. And Microsoft turned him down for a job because every time they offered him real work he didn't want to do it.Before writing this book he was living off his parent's business connections, using hardware leftover from his step-father's business.

After 3 months of discussion they replaced with 920. After owning a little over a year I had issues with the sub on this system also. There local certified repair company told me there was an issue with the design of the circuit board on this system. Different problem from the 900.

Swivel? I don't think so. Move? I don't think so.I cannot imagine how any of the other reviewers got this thing to work and gave it a positive review. My conclusion is that it is a quality issue and you either get good castors or get junk? My table saw has not moved in months, since my neighbour is too old to help me push and my friends are busy.I like my table saw, but this 'heavy duty base' ain't so heavy duty.Looking around the market, nobody seems to sell a real heavy duty mobile base.I am guessing this base will work OK until around 150-200 lb's?Another reviewer made an excellent point about the stress being in on the bolts, so I am hesitant to invest in decent castors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"Total piece of junk.

Casters do not turn easily.Do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!!!!","review":"I bought this for my new cabinet saw and was completely disapointed. It does not move. There is no way this base is mobile. It almost tips over when trying to move it and it does not budge. Waste of money!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shop Fox Junk","review":"The casters on this base are cheap junk. I have four of these bases under various Grizzly shop tools. The caster wheels failed after very little use. The outer layer of rubber peeled off the casters causing them to slide. DON'T BUY!!! THESE ARE JUNK! I have several Grizzly shop tools and they are good equipment but not the Shop Fox mobile bases!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"The casters have been gritty since day one. Best of all, some genius designed the caster brackets too short, so that when the wheel swivels towards the frame, it binds, meaning the stand only works in one direction. Pay the extra $20 for the HTC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need a rough terrain version","review":"I think the biggest deviation in your floor you can tolerate with this is 3/8\\" in 4 feet. Maybe 1/2\\". It's a low rider to be sure.So if you've got a clean out sticking up some or a crack that rising on one side, or just plain lumpy, bumpy concrete, this one is probably a no go for you. I would advise you check your floors. You might be surprised how uneven that \\"flat\\" concrete in the garage really is.The feet, by the way, are pretty ingenious. Otherwise, it's strong, assembled easily, and is probably great if your floor is really flat.They get two stars as I think this is a really common problem that they can fix. Yo, Grizzly, fix it! Please. :-) Seriously, make a rough floor version. If my floor was flat, I'd want this one, low is good. But a whole lot -o- floors are not that flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad casters","review":"This seems to be a fairly solid stand, but beware of the casters. The center portion is hard plastic covered with a hard rubber. I have one for my table saw and one for my shaper, about a month old and with four of the casters the hard rubber cover has broken off. I don't expect the other four casters to last long either. Unfortunately, the only casters I have found so far with the same hole distances are the same casters. Now I'm looking into replacing the wheels but need to determine the correct hole bore. I wonder if I can roll it around on the hard plastic wheels. With a 500 lb saw on the base, this is not the time to have to deal with replacing the wheels. Look for a base with solid rubber wheels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well designed","review":"The side bars are about 3/16\\" smaller than the corner pieces that they fit into so ALL the stress is bourn by the two bolts that hold the sides and corners together. The bolts are just held by threaded holes in the 3/32\\" thick side bars so they strip out easily. At the full 29.5\\" extension, the side bars are only held by two bolts, 3/4\\" of an inch apart, screwed into a thin soft metal. The engineering term for this is \\"scary\\". The unit would be much better if the side bars fit tightly in the corner pieces and the bolts just served to keep the bars from sliding in and out. This base should only be used is situations where a sudden short drop of the load won't injure the user or cause the load to tip over. The base holds the load about 1 inch over the floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money -- Buy Something Else or Make Your Own","review":"Junk for sale here. Bolts and screws were neither English nor Metric. Many bolts stripped in crudely machined threads, and I had to order replacements from Grizzly (which were different again in size from those received with the order). Parts fit poorly and are very poorly machined. Soft metal in threaded \\"inserts\\" (which support all the weight, and which are merely threaded holes through steel stock -- not inserts). This base is advertised to hold up to 1,200 lbs. My jointer/planer weighs 700 lbs and within moments after placing it on the base one of the mobile base wheels literally disintegrated under the weight of the planer -- it looks like they took small diameter wheels and encased them with a ring of a rubber-like compound. Avoid this poorly manufactured product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality all around","review":"Unfortunately I spent an hour assebmling before realizing how poor quality it was. The caster mounts are all bent to different angles so it wobbles a good 1/2\\" or more. I'm afraid to bend it as that will weaken it. The bolts are such poor quality the heads are not standard sizes and you have to go at it with several wrenches because you don't know what will work for each bolt. There was a good bit of rust on mine out of the box. ALso, one of the rotating casters hits a bolt so it will not turn all the way around. I'm trying to get this returned as fast as possible and will most likely make my own base. Sigh..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk!","review":"I bought this to use with a G0593 jointer. Installation was pretty straight forward and the base looks good. The problem is it just does not work! The only way you can move this base is by pushing it hard enough so the casters will slide on the surface. The swiveling casters always tend to lock to prevent the base from moving and the other ones don't rotate very well anyway. The base seems pretty sturdy for the 400+lbs jointer but the casters are just of cheap quality. Of course it's hard to return now that a heavy machine is on it. I would NOT buy this or recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their caster wheels are junk","review":"Bought this base from Woodcraft; usually I find their stuff is well made and durable. HOWEVER, this piece of junk is an exception. I have a Jet Gold Series band saw mounted on it -- there's not a lot of weight to put much wear and tear on it, but so far, two wheels have crumbled, and it looks like a third is starting to go. While it's possible to replace the wheels, it can be a bit of a pain when you have equipment already mounted to the base. I'm going to keep an eye out for metal wheels, and replace them all so I don't have to keep dealing with the problem.If you're considering this base, save your money and time...go with an HTC or just replace the wheels on this one BEFORE you mount any equipment to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recapped casters","review":"I have owned this product for a while, but decided to weigh in on the quality. Perhaps this will keep someone from making the same mistake. The rubber rim on 3 out of the 4 casters broke off. That resulted in a wheel height insufficient to raise the legs off the floor. I corrected the problem by replacing all casters. Assembly was difficult as the mating holes were poorly aligned. The outrigger caster plates have sharp corners which can do a job on an ankle. Somewhat dangerous. A possible candidate for recall by our overly protective new consumer protection government. Just look for a better product and save your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs better casters","review":"This base sits under my 12-14\\" Delta Tilting Arbor Table Saw, which weighs less than 500 pounds. It is a real chore to move the saw around my shop. I probably will buy better casters for it at some point. I wish I had returned it, but like the G7315 I bought and was unhappy with (see review), the base was assembled and the machine was already on the base. I'd already lost a few hours and was not thrilled with the thought of spending more time on it. I figured that I'd get used to it or improve it later. Buy an HTC or have a local welding shop make a base for you.These casters are the same as the ones they put on all of their bases. The metal is thin and the hardware is metric. The last time I checked, I still live in America. You need to have two wrenches or a wrench and a socket the correct size in order to install the casters. Adjustable wrenches won't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Table Saw","review":"I purchased this for use on my 360lb. grizzly table saw. The caster bent and the wheels rub making it difficult to move. DO NOT BUY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed, Painful.","review":"Grizzly gave themselves such great reviews on this mobile base that I was fooled into purchasing one. (I usually purchase HTC bases). I hate this mobile base, it's really bad. First, compared to HTC bases, this Grizzly base has big, obtrusive outriggers for the wheels, that you are constantly tripping over. (On HTC bases the wheels are close set to the frame.) Second, they left the outriggers sharply square, and you WILL catch your ankle on one sooner or later. Man is that painful! If you buy one, be SURE to round the corners on those nasty square wheel mounts with a grinder. Finally, the magnet system for the leveler pads is weak. The leveler pads will fall down during rolling, obstructing your ability to roll over even the smallest unevenness of surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with shipping and quality","review":"First, the shipping: UPS left a clearly damaged box on my doorstep. If I had been home, I would probably have refused it. Opened the box and found one corner bracket bent (I was able to straighten in a vise) and didn't find all of the nuts, bolts and washers as the bag had broken and scattered them.Second, the base: Although it flexes some, the rails and brackets seem to be ok. The casters are junk. They bind every time I move the jointer I put on the base. They will need to be replaced with quality casters or I will need to quit trying to move the jointer."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST SAW I EVER OWNED","review":"I am NY framer and my number 1 tool on the job is my circular saw. That saw doesn't stop from 7:30am until 4:00pm. I've owned a Bosch which I despised and even the DeWalt 369CSK which was a great saw just TOO MUCH PLASTIC. The Makita weighs a bit more but for the love of GOD, I've never used a more powerful saw. This thing rips through CCA like it was 1/4 inch plywood.

I bought it from Home Depot for $90 plus tax (price matched Lowes plus 10%). It cuts like butter and it is so smooth. I wanted one with a brake, but nobody in my area carried one and I had to have it that day. I really don't miss the brake and it is one less thing to break, so it all worked out for the best. The Makita 5007 series is a great saw. I chose this saw over Porter Cable, Milwalkee, Bosh, Skil,Dewalt, etc. I am a big Makita fan (I have the 10\\" sliding miter saw as well). I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy","review":"The good: the saw goes 'round and 'round like any other saw. The Makita blade they send along cuts very smoothly.The bad: once you drop this delicate piece of 'construction' equipment you might as well cut the cord, remove the blade and give it to your 6yo for a play toy. The base bends--making it impossible to make a square cut or use the rip guide. The track guides one uses to set the depth bends & twists and makes raising/lowering the blade depth nearly impossible; the bevel angle gets knocked out of plumb (this is from a 30\\" drop onto soft grass!)Let's face it, people drop saws! And one minor drop shouldn't render this saw useless (for all practical purposes); but it does...Also, it's not balanced very well and the mitre settings are difficult to read.Next time?

The handful of elderly residents all have wonderfully quirky personalities - odd, but realistic. Combined with some unique camera angles (the back of a car, listening to a discussing by looking through a door window), it has visual appeal as well. The whole thing feels very organic and genuine.A note of warning: this isn't a comedy by any stretch of the imagination, even though several reviews have described it as \\"hilarious.\\" It actually comes across as a bit melancholy at times. Don't rent it thinking you're in for a big laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel Good Movie with a Message","review":"This movie is another example of whether it's BBC Victorian dramas or independent UK productions such as this movie one finds the acting, directing, music, script and settings superb. As a counterpoint, why America produces so many junk movies with so much money is a mystery. The pace of the movie builds and is perfect for the transitions that take place within the retirement home from individuals moving selfishly nowhere toward becoming an active and compassionate family. The only criticism worth mentioning is the introduction of a bit too much marijuana to these retirees - a bit far-fetched but a nice touch anyway. If you know someone facing the retirement home stage of life you will find this an entertaining movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice story, but too much profanity","review":"Would have been a much better Christmas tale for me with out all the profanity.

You also have no idea how many staples are left or what size they are. A better window would help and is easy to do. Plus a lot of miss fires happen.

However, the book attempts to be both scientific and academic and it fails at both. Historical facts, mytholigical reconstructions, and scientific studies are all clearly misunderstand at the best and falsely presented at worse.

Bob Beckwith is not a very sharply defined protagonist - he seems to be always reacting to others' actions than initiating any on his own. But Sheila Beckwith is much more appealing than her counterpart Jenny in 'Love Story'. The characters of the Beckwiths' two precocious daughters is also well drawn.The dialogues are vintage Segal - crisp and memorable.

I recommend finding another version of Graham's work, unless you're an economic historian researching the early 1970s.By the way, Graham's comments on the tape totally failed to foresee the big energy crisis and runaway inflation of the mid 1970s (as did 90%+ of investors then, including most other experts)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insomniac's Must Read this Book.","review":"I realize that Graham is the dean of Fundamental Analysis. I read his book Security Analysis in Graduate School and still find it very useful. However, the audio tape of the Intelligent Investor is horrible. First, the underlining book needs to be undated. The audio version focuses on events that occurred in the 1970s, which is when the underlining book was last updated. Second, the audio version fails to provide any key insights for investing. Everything is overly general. Finally, the audio tape is verbose. In sum, STAY away from this tape, unless you're having a problem with insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"No real value here","review":"I got this book because of a Lou Rukeyser panelist who recommended it for understanding the latest milieu in the stock market.

It has no bump fire mode, but thats not a big problem for a brad nailer. But this gun has a very major flaw for anyone that uses it a lot: the driver rod is very low quality, so after a little while the tip of the driver will get ground off or bent or chipped or something. This in turn leads to ever increasing jamming, because the driver isn't hitting the brad exactly square. Unjamming this gun is a major pain, you have to get a 3mm allen wrench and take the whole front apart. And then, sooner or later, the driver will just snap. you can replace it, but its not really worth it, becasue you will end up with the same series of promblems. the Hitachi brad nailer has more features and better reliability, and senco is senco, it will last forever and a day.

It jams and won't fire their own (Stanley) 1 5/8\\" nails - there are grooves in the magazine where the heads of the brads sit and there is no groove in the nailer I have for those brads.

I shoot about 1500 nails a week through each gun and they don't seem to last very long. After between 3 to 6 months is all I get out of one. The weak link is the driver pin. It breaks where it is attached to the piston. If they could fix this problem it would be an awesome nailer because it is so balanced and never misfires and is very consistant. I hope Bostitch updates this model soon because I love it when it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent results.

This surprised me since I own other Bostitch nailers and am quite satisfied with them. The Bostitch would not throw the nails consistently slowing down my work flow considerably. Additionally the PC seems to be able to tolerate different types of nails more easily. All in all the PC is just simply better.

I had seen a lot of publicity in trade magazines and was excited to see how well the gun worked. The first problem I ran into was trying to load 1 9/16\\" 18 ga. porter cable brads. The clip jambed and wouldn't close. So the gun doesn't accept any brad up to 2\\". Then I loaded the 2\\" brads that came with the gun. Once I hooked up the air, I noticed that the trigger leaked air. Then I began fireing the gun at different air preasures within its working range. I had a miss fire of one out of every five shots. I bought the gun with a litte scepticism because I had problems simular to these with bostich staplers. I returned the gun and got the porter cable.

The depth would not remain fixed, I had two misfires and I was having two hit marks left on the wood. I took it back ... the store tested it ... no double hit marks ... but it did misfire and the depth would not remain fixed ... I received a refund. Yes ... I now own a SB-1850BN ...

In the meantime I bought a Ridgid oilless brad nailer - NICE GUN!!! The Bostitch guy replaced the whole body on my gun and then my first day using it I broke the narrow orange cast part at the rear of the gun. They were nice enough to send me a new body for free but I'll be doing the repair myself and selling the gun cheap when I've repaired it because I love my Ridgid gun and I'm tired of the Bostitch downtime and shooting so many holes in my work. I also don't beleive in having to use Bostitch nails only in a Bostitch gun. Ridgid didn't specify any nail because they don't make them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never has worked right","review":"I've been using this for about 4 years now and am about at wits end with it. I had all kinds of misfire problems with it in the beginning, after analyzing what might be wrong, I put a metal shim in it and it seems to misfire (drive the nail 50 to 90% in leaving you reaching for the pliers hoping like heck you can extricate the offensive little nail without dinging up your finish work too much) less often. Lately I can't seem to get the gun to fire when I hook it up after it sits over night. Without the air hose attached, I need to put the gun on a piece of scrap or something, squeeze the trigger, then hook up the air hose to get it to fire, once it starts going, it usually does OK. I like the light weight and small tip size, but if it doesn't perform, what good is it. I like my Bostitch N88RH Framer and N62 15 Gauge a lot so I'm not a Anti-Bostitchite, but this BT200K-2 is not worth anything in my world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great, Ridgid is superior!","review":"I had this Bostitch BT200K Brad nailer for a little over 2 months.

I ended up selling it on eBay and buying a Ridgid brad nailer instead. My impression of the Ridgid nailer are, it is superior! Every detail seems to have been carefully thought out with it, fit/finish is superb, no jambs (yet!), tons of power, just as light as the Bostich, and it has a lifetime parts/service warranty!

The nailer is powerful, and has consistent depth of drive. If the devil is in the details, this gun is exceptional - a spare no-mar tip on board the gun, an allen wrench on board the gun, a nice integrated dust cap for the air supply nipple, a red indicator when nail supply is low, a magnetic stip to hold brads while you are loading, and a very easy to use thumbwheel depth of drive adjustment, all in a plastic case with real locking latches.I have a Senco 15 ga finish nailer and a Paslode framing gun; the Bostitch compares favorably with both."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality control - buy a Senco","review":"I purchased this tool based on rave reviews that I'd seen.

No luck.I returned the tool and got another which had even worse problems - the trigger leaked air and the drive plunger wouldn't retract. It would drive 5/8\\" brads OK but anything longer than 1\\" wouldn't go because the plunger wouldn't retract.I finally gave up and purchased a Senco FP25XP for a lot more money cause I didn't want to chance buying another dud from Bostitch.

Then pulled the trigger again. The gun shot but the nail didn't come out. I reloaded the gun, same thing happened. I read the troubleshooting guide, and after taking the gun apart, adjusting about 14 things, and reoiling it I could shoot about 5 nails before this happened.

I do have to say though, the book does end with a bang, that being the sound your brain makes as it stuggles to figure out the horriblely written ending to this un-masterfull piece. As the title states, I tried to burn the book in my fire place and the book seemed to last hours in its firey death. Even trying to get rid of the book was boring. Worst book ever as comic book guy from the simpsons would say. One star is not a low enough of a rating for this work of trash....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like","review":"I am a fan of horror, suspense, but this book just didn't do anything for me.

USED IT ABOUT 10 TIMES AND THEN THE VARIABLE SPEED DIDN'T WORK. TOOK IT IN TO THE DELTA FACTORY SERVICE CENTER IN DAVIE FLORIDA. IT TOOK THEM 6 WEEKS TO REPAIR THE UNIT. I TOOK IT HOME AND USED IT ABOUT 4 TIMES,THEN THE SPEED CONTROL BROKE AGAIN. I CALLED DELTA HOME OFFICE. THEY TOLD ME THEY COULD SEND ME THE PART AND I COULD TRY TO FIX IT MYSELF. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY FROM ANOTHER MANUFACTURER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for woodturners","review":"I bought this grinder to use to sharpen my woodturning tools. The left-hand platform that comes with the grinder has a slanted v-groove in it which gets in the way of balancing a tool against the wheel in any other position. It is not interchangeable with the flat, right-handed platform. Also, the base of the grinder, unlike other grinder designs, sticks out under the wheels. This makes it incompatable with grinding jigs. I want to use a jig, and I now have to buy another grinder. I do not recommend this grinder for woodturners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, funny, touching","review":"This is the latest in a series of wonderful books by the talented author, Mark Winegardner. Mr. Winegardner, with a deft touch for dialogue, captures a sweeping hisotry of the decline of a classic midwestern city. He brings the famous back to life and gives us a glimpse of a number of different Clevelands. Though this is about Cleveland, it could really be the story of any of our great midwestern cities in the past 60 years. Mr. Winegardner makes us care about his story through his wonderful use of the language. He weaves a tapestry that one cannot help but embrace. This is a fine piece of fiction, and one worth owning and reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE DISSAPPOINTMENT","review":"Crooked River Burning is an astonishing disappointment. The narrative drags amid endless footnotes and self-conscious attempts at brilliance that miserably fail. The author's affection for Cleveland rings loud and clear but so much so that it borders on parody. There is very little to recommend here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I trudged through this book while asking myself why I was reading it. It is fragmented with branches that seem to be taking you somewhere but don't. I finished it and regretted the effort. Not a good read. Not worthwhile. It is like a compilation of cotton-candy stories that each read well, but leave you wanting something mentally nutritional by the time you get to the next chapter. And honestly, I don't care about Cleveland!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgic, proud, just like the city....","review":"This is a lovely (and loving) tribute to a city that has been much aligned in print over the past few years. The narrator, omniscient, yet not unbenevolent, dignified, with just enough cynicism to be believable, was a wonderful creation.As someone who now lives in Cleveland but only for the past two years, I cannot emphasize enough that this book is approachable by any reader. Like the city itself, the voices are neither midwestern, nor eastern, but just their own selves.A wonderful contribution to the ever expanding literature coming out of the rust belt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something old, something new","review":"Jack Driscoll deserves credit for taking a tried formula and making it compelling. Archie Angel is not unique; he had a suspect upbringing,his mother grappling with mental illness and cancer, his father struggling against emotion and uncertainty. Archie has survived only to find himself at the critical junction between a life of his own and a reflection of his past. He wends his way through the tangles of uncertainty, buffeted by the memories of his troubled parents and a failed marriage. Archie is sustained by hopes for his son Rodney. In typical Driscoll fashion, Angel must also confront his troubles in order to demonstrate to a beautiful woman that he is worthy of her attentions. Rhea is beautiful, she adores Rodney, and she rides a Harley. Together, Archie, Rhea, and Rodney embark on a tender journey toward discovery and action. Driscoll pulls it off by keeping his characters involved, his settings simple, and his storyline tight."},{"rating":"2","title":"JOY","review":"It's a joy to read anything by Jack Driscoll. This is a writer who cares about each word. If you like to read a book that is NOT a page turner but one that invites you to savor and reflect, then read any book by this caring and masterful author.Jack Ridl"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"Jack Driscoll is an original for the ages. How Like an Angel is the most compelling novel I've read this year. I simply could not put it down. The main character, Archie Angel, is as achingly human as any fictional character I've encountered in a long time. Angel has my highest recommend. Don't miss this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one problem","review":"The only problem I've found with this stroller (we've had it 2 years now) is that the buckle that goes across the chest is too high and not adjustable in the right direction. The strap goes right underneath my daughter's neck (she's 2 and not small), not over the chest. Other than that, the stroller holds up really well and is very easy to control. If it had a swivelling front wheel, it would be nice... but for this price, it's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sibelius distilled","review":"These remarkable and lovely symphonies do not follow the conventional development one might find in Nielsen or Sibelius, Dvorak or Brahms. They are more a stream of consiouness that evolves and flows, more subtle, less obviously dramatic, less colorfully orchestrated particularly less use of the woodwinds, a more subdued use of brass, more a feeling of being propelled forward toward an inevitable conclusion. More like Bruckner in tone but without Bruckner's somewhat contrived effort to make an epic statement while maintaining it's own seriousness and gravity. These works are like musical essays. Very attractive and appealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Music","review":"If you can't read music (i.e. the bars, lines, and notes just get in your way), this is the book for you. There is no written music, no time to set the tempo, nothing. Just words with the chords written above. If you don't know the song, there is not a melody line to learn it. As long as you are familiar with the song, you can wing it and get by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource for those new to guitar","review":"After just recently picking up the guitar, this book allows me to enjoy traditional christmas carols with my family"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Doctor's Guide to Murder and Mayhem","review":"Although designed for mystery writers, Dr. Lyle's book is an exciting discovery for mystery readers and forensic experts. The material is organized and accessible for someone needing a reference with specific forensic questions and answers but personally I read it cover-to-cover, nonstop.D. P.

The price is fantastic, isn't it?

A glance at the graphics and then at the features list show it's more or less identical to Warcraft III. What's more, there's no Norrathian flavor to be found -- this game isn't EverQuest, it's not Warcraft ... who is supposed to buy it, I have no idea.Enough with the relentless spinning off of new products, Sony.

The box of this game depicts massive armies slugging it out. I don't know how this is possible when you can only create a maximum of 28 units in this game.. Thats pretty sad when compared to todays standards. The AI is also nonexistant. I had only purchased this game because it was an Everquest product and I know that they are popular. This is definately a game to be left on the shelf of the store and regarded as nonsense.

Lords of Everquest is basically a Warcraft3 clone. The concept, the name of the buildings, even down to the sayings the characters say. Granted, the animation is better and Sony did improve on a few things from W3, but it is a clone. The interface is easier than W3, but I haven't seen any story scenes so I can not judge the climax footage vs. W3. Basically, if you already own W3, getting this game is pointless since it is the same thing. It is nothing like EQ, Sony just slapped that name on it trying to get sales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginers book","review":"As a mother just begining to teach the \\"birds and the bees\\" this is a terrific help.

But when the word God shows up at least twice on each page I have a problem. Am I supposed to feel good that I don't need to explain anymore since God did everything? I am not against religion but I am also an educated person and I believe that telling my kid that he was created by God is just as far from the truth as telling him he was brought by the stork!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing performance and sound","review":"Pollini's recording of the late Beethoven Sonatas (28-32) is outstanding in every way, full of verve and confidence, with a realistic piano sound. This recording of early sonatas pales by comparison. It sounds like he was having a bad day (as were the sound engineers). Performances are cold and rather uninspired, almost rote, while the piano has a strange remote muddy sound as if the microphones were badly placed according to the room. Schiff's live recording is better although the piano sound is barely above mediocre, Brendel's live recording of the 90's perhaps better still (but you have to put up with applause). Kovacevich's Philips recording of Nos.5 and 8 (available in a box set of sonatas and concertos) has the most realistic sound, but there's no 6 or 7. His EMI recordings are too trebly, lacking the warmth that the Philips engineers gave him. Then there's the older recordings of Kempff and Arrau with whom you can never go wrong on Beethoven."},{"rating":"2","title":"NY Times Top Pick for 2004","review":"Selected by the NY Times as one of the top 25 classical CDs of 2004.

While it is inaudible, and it has reduced the temperature inside my computer case about 5 degrees Celsius vs. no fan at all, it doesn't have enough power to do an adequate job. Had I been smarter, I would have never have purchased it, because there was no specification listed about air movement. At the store where I purchased it, there were plenty of 80MM and 120MM models, but there were only three different 92mm fans, and this was the best of the three. I have since ordered a ThermalTake 92MM fan from Amazon to replace this one. It is much more powerful, but it is audible. That's a compromise I am willing to make, since my computer's environment is not as cool as it should be, especially during the summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"No beauty here","review":"On the surface this seems like a great book - all of the topics in a Discrete Mathematics course are covered, the information is cleanly laid out, and the quality of the binding is excellent. At closer observation, though, this book has some serious flaws that should keep it from being considered from any universitie's curriculum.Discrete math should be the class that introduces students to the beauty that can be found in math through proofs. Proofs are the foundation of mathematics and - especailly in an introductory text - should be comprehensive. This book leaves out important steps in a good deal of the proofs, making the proofs themselves hard to read. This should be an easy, clear class for anyone intrested in math. If you are struggling, you owe it to yourself to find a real text on proofs to see what mathematical beauty really is.My advise is - if you have to use this text - buy a good book on proofs and another good book on number theory. There are plenty on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not a good textbook","review":"Attention, students! Don't be fooled by those words like \\"best book in the field\\", \\"unrivaled content.\\"This book contains lots of examples but NONE of them is interesting. Really. The explanations are too vague. Mr Rosen must be thinking that an \\"obvious\\" example needs no further explanation.I've read a few math books and found a lot of fascinating applications but the applications in this book are just too theoretical rather than practical.The stuff about Logic (the very beginning section) is more confusing than really useful, especially the section about how to translate between English sentences and mathematical statements.I believe there are much better books out there. Before you buy this book, think carefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"I like this book and use it for teaching my students. As a teacher, you have the opportunity to select similar problems for class activity and homework assignment. Also, you can find not only simple and middle-level problems but also high-level problems to provide a good source for active students. Unfortunately, the author uses the letters \\"F\\" and \\"T\\" in the truth tables instead of much easier and perspective \\"0\\" and \\"1\\", which correspond to the real needs, e.g., in computer science. That's the most essential lack, which I've found by this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to understand","review":"I had to use this book as a student for my discrete mathematics course. I hated it. I found this book hard to understand and follow. The ideas weren't clearly explained. There were lots of problems at the end of the section that were barely or not at all explained in the chapter. There were only a limited number of examples in each chapter, and most of the examples finished with \\"the proof to this is left as an exercise to the reader.\\" If this is a book designed to teach discrete mathematics, I would assume the reader wants something that wouldn't leave every example as an \\"exercise\\" to the reader. I want a book that gives examples, lots of them, and finishes each one. This book could use a lot more of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Poor Text On Discrete Mathematics","review":"Any professor or department which recommends this book to students as the primary, or only text of the class is doing a dis-service to students. The text provides examples and explanations which are incomplete and contain errors. In many of the proofs, key steps are omitted by the author who takes for granted that students will know of his mistakes and make corrections. Any prospective students who see this book as the only text of a computer science discrete mathematics class, should imediately change from that class, saving themselves many hours of aggrevation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good textbook","review":"This is probably the worst textbook I've ever had to use. If you don't already know the topics, the book does little to help you learn them. It simply spews theorems and then shows examples (with little explanation). A few simple step-by-step explanations would go a long way to understanding the subject material."},{"rating":"1","title":"book is good enough for me to fail my class","review":"<pre>if you know your instructor is going to use this book in his course, stay away from this class. If you are really good at math, and had some programming experiences before, go ahead buy this text and spend mega hours in your life.

There are 54 pages of actual work pages, and only three pages on division. That is not nearly enough to teach division, let alone practice it. Some of the pages are way too simple, but on others there are a lot of 3 digit problems, which would not be a bad thing if they weren't crammed into small geometric shapes that the child is supposed to color afterward. 3rd graders should be too old for that. If I wanted my child to color, I'd buy a coloring book. I gave my child scratch paper so that he wouldn't have to try to fit his work into spaces barely able to contain the problems. This book is full of busy work for a child who already knows all the stuff in it. I will not be buying any more books from this series. Yes, you can teach from it, but expect to supplement heavily.

I can't believe he was able to pull this together and record it in six weeks!Amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good start...","review":"I notice that on this CD, the tracks that Taylor Hicks either wrote or co-wrote have a very different flavor(Give Me Tonight, Soul Thing, The Deal, and on the version with the bonus track, Hell Of A Day) than the ones he didn't write on this album. I like Taylor's songwriting style better than the other writers on this disc. Hopefully on his future albums, we'll see more of Taylor's own personality and material, more than just 4 songs like this album. That's what won over America last year when he won American Idol. Some people have complained about this CD not being very good, but when more of Taylor's own material appears on his later albums, we'll hear the flavor we're used to getting from him. Not a bad start! Listen to those 4 tracks listed above to hear the Taylor Hicks flavor. Don't let the rest of the songs get you away from him if you don't like them."},{"rating":"2","title":"You did not disappoint us Taylor! Thoroughly enjoyable album...","review":"i don't know why but taylor is the first american idol which i actually bother to listen to the album...and it did not disappoint me at all... thoroughly an enjoyable and fun listening album...;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic ! Music at its best","review":"A gem of a CD from an amazing singer/songwriter. Taylor Hicks & team have put together a wonderful collection of songs, each one unique. The fact that Hicks wrote some of the songs himself shows what a talented and versatile artist he is. The only problem with the CD is picking a favorite song !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"Bought it for my wife. She thought she was a big fan until she listened to it. We never played it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"He is Ok","review":"so finally Taylor Hicks Album hits&it's pretty much what was expected. the Personality that worked on Tv doesn't come through on the Disc. Hicks has a Husky Whisley voice that works in places,but He isn't that deep of a Vocalist to truly make the material he is presented with sound more than a Hired voice on top of the Production basically.his material will work better on Adult Contempary,but He doesn't have that \\"IT\\" Song from this collection. he has the makings of a JourneyMan Artist. He might have some Hits,but on a whole if this is gonna be how he is presenting his work then Idol will more than likely be His Musical high."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed by this album. I felt the songs were very pedestrian and that Taylor's singing was sometimes weak. On the first track it sounded almost like he was being drowned out by the band. I got no sense of any of the excitement that Hicks generated on his Idol appearances. He's a decent singer but I feel that the songs on this album weren't good enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this CD because I fell in love with Taylor Hick's soulful voice. I was disappointed with the song choices and predictable arrangements. I hope Taylor had no say in the selections because that would lead me to believe that perhaps his next CD would be better. I'm not sure if Taylor's personal song genre is soul or R&B but that's what I fell in love with on American Idol and his CD prior to A.I. Listening to him do anything but, I guess I'd have to get used to."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked him on idol","review":"I liked him on american idol, but dont like this cd as much-hes sounds totally different and not the guy i voted for. and his cd isnt selling that great also-so i think alot of folks agree with me! sorry taylor maybe your next cd will be better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel Good Music!","review":"I was very excited when Taylor Hicks' debut CD was released and I was not disappointed! I bought it on that day and have enjoyed playing it ever since. There is such a good mix of songs on the album, including three (on the Wal-mart edition) that he himself wrote. You can tell that he put his heart and soul into these songs and the best is yet to come! I can't wait for his second CD and the release of his DVD, 'Whomp at the Warfield\\", which will be coming soon. Rock on, Taylor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"I love this CD. If you are a Taylor Fan, you'll love it, too. My favorites are Runaround, Just to Feel That Way, The Deal and The Right Place. I'm really starting to like Places I've Been, as well. I was a big fan of Paul Young's version of Wherever I Lay My Hat, Taylor's version is different, more hip for today, though Paul's version is 20+ year's old. I think personally, I would love Taylor a little more \\"soulful\\" than mainstream --- but wow, what a talent. Love his style and that he is such a unique individual and has a style all his own. I hope that his next CD will have a little more of that blue-eyed soul -- but wow, what a great CD for his first effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Soul Patrol Didn't Show Up","review":"I was so looking forward to Taylor's first CD - from his first audition on American Idol, I became a fan for his individualistic style and the fact that he nails it on my favorite genre of music - The Blues. I am disappointed with his CD because it does not have the edge or the hard-driving rock/blues that I was hoping for. I enjoyed the taping at [...] more than the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"If you like Taylor's voice or if you are a Blues fan, you will like this CD! He aims to please and is right on the mark. His song choices are awesome and I really love the entire CD. THis is money well spent! He adds a soulful sound to these songs that will please any blues lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great first CD","review":"Taylor Hicks won American Idol season 5 for a good reason. He was the most seasoned and professional singer in a great bunch of performers. With this CD he proves he deserved the crown. Every song is enjoyable and entertaining. In an age where so much manufactured drek, here's real music from a real musical talent.There's something here for everyone. A good time for the price of a cheap dinner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A legend in the making.","review":"Mark my words,Taylor Hicks is a legend in the making. There are those that don't \\"get\\" Taylor. For those of us that do \\"get\\" him, it is beyond us how anyone can not \\"get\\" him!! However, as time passes, we have witnessed the nay-sayers flourish into \\"gray\\"-sayers. The Soul Man has arrived, so prepare your taste in music to become Whomp-a-fied! I compare listening to this cd like eating a Lays potato chip,you won't be able to stop listening to it..you will want to hear these songs again and again and you won't be able to get them out of your head! What is my definition of Taylor's Whomp; It is that \\"make you feel good\\" music. Thanks Taylor,we've been starved for this kind of music-you've given the world a true gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"No brainer!","review":"If you are into stir your soul, get up and dance, happy feet kind of music Taylor Hicks is your guy. Total package. Just To Feel That Way is the stand out for me, but there is something here for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taylor Hicks has a winning debut !","review":"This silver haired Southern comfort, all of 30 yrs. old, has a timeless vocal style, which most of America was lucky to hear on American Idol last season. While maybe not the top choice of young teens, Hicks is definitely a tonic for we who are adults. This CD did not disappoint, in fact it is quite good. The Runaround has hit written all through its dynamic arrangement and Hicks delivery. The great music doesn;t stop there though. The vast number of selections on this CD are great listening, singing, and even dancing songs. This debut CD comes on the heels of Do I Make You Proud, an endearing single which I recently heard dedicated by a women at a local Washington, DC club to our brave men and women in the military. Once Mr. Hicks starts gyrating to these songs during his tour, we'll see even more value from this CD. Hicks is a double delight- he sings beautifully, AND he dances quite naturally well. Well done, and well worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern \\"Whoomp\\" indeed!!","review":"This isn't Taylor's first album, he has two indies before he joined the show.This the debut album of Taylor after he won the AI competition, and i can feel that this CD is compiled to suits the music industry today.It consist of variety of genre in the album, such as, pop, soft rock, and little jazzy genre music..As you listening the song one by one, you will slowly realize that Taylor really really had put his efforts to create something that called \\"modern whoomp!\\" ..Mind that Taylor's music has his own genre rather than follows today's trend.., but this album proves that he can combined them both.A must buy for Soul Patrol, and give it a try if you are not a one too.., because, Taylor really sounded so good in the album!Love his voice, Soul Patrol, this is TOSPsoulsurvivor-Ian here, wooo! lol!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Platinum-Bound!","review":"Back in the days when I was a kid (and Elvis releases were on 45 rpm's), artists released their \\"good\\" song one one side, their \\"so-so\\" song on the reverse...better to have a big hit with each release. This was why Elvis had so many Gold and Platinum hits... And if Taylor Hicks had released each and every song on this album as an individual single, he'd have many Gold hits...and at least 3 platinums from this album. IT'S THE BEST RELEASE OF GOOD MUSIC in 35 years or so. We already know Ray Charles would've loved the h*ll out of Taylor...I believe so would \\"The King\\". KUDOS TO TAYLOR HICKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very good debut CD from Taylor Hicks","review":"Most of the songs on this CD are about falling in and out of love, and that is okay with me. I just hope Taylor will include more of his personal experiences in his music in the future though. Having said that, I think this is a very good debut. The drum beat and the trumpet playing sound really good on this first track The Runaround. It is a very fun track to start off the CD. Soul Thing is another fun uplifting track here. The Right Place is another highlight here. This track shows Taylor's romantic soulful side. The piano playing on this track is beautiful. Dream Myself Awake is another nice track. The electric guitar playing gives this song a nice pop rock edge. Give Me Tonight is a groovy sounding track. This is a good song to play at parties and dance to. Places I've Been is a very touching song about how a special individual can change another person's life. This is a very enjoyable debut CD by Taylor Hicks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend this album","review":"I purchased this cd in December and it continues to be one that I listen to on a daily basis. It is very rare that I like every song on an album, but this is great. The first listen through I liked some more than others; however, my favorites now seem to change with the mood that I am in. There is a song for everyone on this cd; Taylor mixes it up and offers a banquet of different styles and moods, making me smile, soothing me, and making me dance. Groove on, Taylor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Taylor Hicks, the American Idol","review":"I was glad he won because he sings from the soul. His music is soulful and better than the rest. He plays harmonca and guitar and writes some of his own music. Buy this cd, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much anticipated....but predictable","review":"I'm a huge fan of Taylor's. I know the whole AI process so I didn't expect his first big-money album to be stellar. Those producers throw it all together and use a standard formula for every artist who wins. They try their best to make a mainstream pop album that appeals to everyone but in the process they lose the individuality that made the artist so wonderful to begin with. That being said, I thought the album was pretty good. I loved that they included some of his original work! He's a great singer/songwriter and I believe his original songs were better than most of the others on the album.For fans of Taylor, be patient. We all knew his first album under the AI cloud would be generic. But his effort is better than most and I truly believe he has a long and successful career ahead of him. I look forward to it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hicks","review":"I thought all the songs sounded a like. I really liked him on Idol and wish he would have shook it up some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was hoping for a litle more.....","review":"This CD is not what I expected from Taylor, someone whom I enjoyed on American Idol. While he was very enjoyable to WATCH on American Idol, his voice is nothing special to LISTEN to. I'd hoped for a little more originality and stronger vocals, but this CD was a bit of a disappointment for me. Taylor is a performer NOT a singer. I'm sure he is fun to see in concert, but I won't buy another CD because his voice just doesn't grab me or hold my interest. There were a lot better singers on American Idol this year, which is usually know for producing great singers. Taylor doesn't measure up to his predecessors vocally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland music","review":"I thought the cd was terrible. The music was bland. His vocals were good but the song choice was bad. I found the music to be very boring. On the positive side I did like his songs better than the covers.

I realized one thing. TH's Stage antics, definitely made him win AI. This CD is okay, almost sounding a bit karaoke at times. First Single Runaround was not the correct choice, imho. I really wa slooking forward to this cd (as well as Daughtry's). I keep listening, hoping to like it more, but honestly, I can't see myself picking this cd out of my collection in a few months, and saying \\"oh I haven't heard that in a while.\\" He should have looked at someone like MArc Broussard for inspiration. His voice is suited for cajun style blues pop.Good luck next time TH, you deserve better than this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't sing","review":"Like I've said before, the dude can't sing. His a very entertaining entertainer when he's on stage, but when he's not on stage putting on a show, he just can't sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loves good music","review":"What a relief to listen to an album that is full of songs and good music. Unlike so much of today's music that contains feeble attempts at poetry and a beat!Taylor Hicks is replete with the type of music that has been in short supply for many, many years. His best writing from a self-produced album (The Deal, Hell of a Day) are overwhelmingly beautiful and The Right Place is a jewel. The only recording of WILMH I could find was by Paul Young and Taylor's is far superior to that one.Listening to this CD is a pleasure. I give the work a STRONG 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MESS","review":"The \\"soul patrol\\" skids to a dramatic halt as the idol winner Hicks stumbles through a forgettable mess of material on this c d.....Taylor, I wish I could write a review that justified your win on American Idol but this c d is full of weak material,forgettable lyrics and lacks any hooks that would keep it in the charts.The fact that this release has sunk to the bottom faster than the Titanic says it all.....need I WRITE MORE!!!???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected!","review":"I was very disappointed with this CD! Taylor Hicks does not sound at all like he did on American Idol! The song choices do not reflect his soulful \\"Joe Cocker\\" sound!

Where I Lay My Hat is absolutely my fav!!! This is make you feel good music. Ya can't help but tap your toes or jump up and dance. Its a good mix from a few poppy songs, which I actually love, to very soulful songs. I love the brass and driving drums on this cd. The musicians on this cd are superb! Taylors growly delivery is wonderful. Buy this cd people, its different, refreshing, and soooooooooooo wonderfully good. WTG Mr. Hicks, the record company came through for you, unlike some other talented idols they just didn't get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"I love,love,love this CD.

This is a definite winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hicks Nails It","review":"I've followed this artist for almost a year. I purchased Taylor's first two CD's and I have to say as much as I liked those... this one is the best! Taylor Hicks is a legend in the making, in my honest opinion. There's a little bit of everything on this CD. I promise you'll find something to love on here. I'm looking forward to watching Taylor sing these live in concert next year! Buy this one. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I expected, Great!","review":"The voice and personality that Taylor has now is what I enjoyed most watching him on Idol.

No. But I enjoy a vast majority, and therefore, feel it is well worth the investment! Runaround is simplistic in its lyrics, but I find that I cannot listen to it without singing along and tapping my toes. The Taylor I love is missing in Dream Myself Awake, but luckily resurfaces in the fantastic Heaven Knows, which is really where the album starts for me. Stellar covers of Gonna Move and Wherever I Lay My Hat follow. For me, the album is worth the price for these three songs alone. Taylor takes a wrong turn (IMO) on Give Me Tonight. Just to Feel That Way is a decent, totally listenable power ballad. The Maze and Places I Have Been are unoffensive filler. Then Taylor finishes in true Taylor style with his two original tunes, Soul Thing and The Deal, and the remarkable The Right Place. Why 5 stars? Because I can't remember the last time I purchased a CD that I enjoyed so much. A great freshman release!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Taylor Delivers!","review":"Taylor is a one-of-a-kind artist who will be with us for decades to come.

I was huge Taylor fan when he was on Idol, but I wasn't sure how I would like his music without seeing him perform.Overall I was pleasantly surprised. The music is mellow and easy to listen to. I was disappointed not to hear him play his harmonica though.Some of the best tracks are Dream Myself Awake, Heaven Knows and Just to Feel That Way. (My fave) The Runaround is a catchy tune too.If you are a Taylor fan you will like this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anxiously awaited CD","review":"I loved Taylor as soon as I saw him sing Elton John's \\"Levi\\" on Idol and couldn't wait to get my hands on his first CD.

I will definitely be looking for Taylor's next CD to hit the market!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart and Soul","review":"Taylor has self defined this sound as \\"Modern Whomp.\\" Somewhat eclectic in influence, this is the first American Idol winner with a definitive point-of-view musically. Stylistically Taylor has a perspective which will make him an force to be reckoned with in modern music. A true performer, Taylor's drive and integrality shine through in his debut, remarkably accomplished in only 6 weeks of recording time.

He has a voice that is sure to stick around. He's a very talented artist and I think this CD reflects that. I've noticed it's slightly toned down on here as compared to his live performances, but it's still worth a listen. Notable tracks to me are The Maze and Give Me Tonight (I'm surprised that most don't like this one) Overall, very good debut and Taylor didn't disappoint. Nice work, Taylor. :) On a side note, I'm glad they didn't put Do I Make You Proud on here because the more new tracks, the better. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This CD","review":"Loved him on AI, went to see him live, pre-ordered the cd and waited impatiently for its release.

The fans of that idol think that the competition is still on so they come on here to give dazzling reviews and 5 stars no matter how bad the thing is. At the same time, the fans of some other idol also think the competition is still on so they come on here and bash the heck out of the thing no matter how good it is. ;) I see that there is only one of the latter so far and 14 of the former. What this really is is a competition to see which fan group has the most number of bashers. From this we can gather than non-Tayor fan groups do not have a lot of bashers. Keep this in mind when someone else who shall remain nameless's CD comes out soon! And even though I am a phan of hers (oops!) and I haven't even listened to Taylor's CD, I'm still going to give it 5 stars because I think anyone who has endured a season of AI and the summer tour deserves whatever success they can get. Thanks! Peace be upon you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also Ran...","review":"\\"Dream Myself Awake\\" is a great track here but overall I am disappointed with this effort. Why have remakes on a debut, especially when you are supposedly a decent songwriter? Stick to the originals with the remakes. Paul Young's \\"Hat\\" is the perfect remake of that song. This one is not. I expected more. Should this cd have done better than it did? Probably not.

This is the true story of a royal bastard who became a celebrated novelist and early feminist, winning the right of women to inherit property and helping promote the concept of \\"Women's Suffrage\\" in England and the U.S. I've owned an original hardcover edition for years and marvel at your ability to own your own copy at such a bargain price.

The theological view the author holds is process theology, which arose out of Alfred North Whitehead's 'process metaphysics'. According to this theology, God is not the omnipotent father-like figure of traditional theology, but rather more like a creative force that subtly influences everything towards the good, but cannot force anything to just do good. God is therefore an intricate part of reality, enmeshed, and suffers along with us.However, this theological view is combined with recent approaches in counselling psychology to create a really useful book for the pastor, chaplain, or just interested Christian looking to be a better helper to herself or others. The book can be technical at times, but there are also examples that are accessible if you just skip through some of the technical stuff and go back to it later.

I never noticed it before I bought the CD but once I owned the CD and listened to each song a few times in a row I realized that they are all about something negative. Or at least most of them are. I am the type of person who appreciates meaningful lyrics, but these are not meaningful to me. They are all a bit depressing, really. I love Alanis' voice and I think it is very uniquely beautiful, but I am just disappointed in what she is singing ABOUT.

It presents the \\"best of the best\\" songs Alanis ever made, without including a lot of junk I've never heard. ------ It's also perfect so I don't have to waste a ~$100 going out and buying all the separate albums.

It is marketed toward gullible parents and bad little league coaches (of which there are many). If you are serious about teaching your child how to hit you should approach your local high school or college coach. There is too much misinformation out there. Also, dont waste your time at batting cages or \\"hitting instructors\\" who force you to pay for 12 weeks worth of lessons. Half of these guys know just enough to sound intelligent to desperate parents. Get out with your kid, throw soft toss, bp, work out in the off season, make it fun but work nevertheless.

This year, he moved up a division and has struggled at around .250, even though he has a fairly nice swing. Using this device for two weeks, he suddenly can't hit anything. I pitched him hardballs today and he swung over the top of every one of the first 60! The problem with this device is that the ball doesn't drop like a pitched ball, so it actually trains them to swing higher than normal. I'll be putting this away for the season and trying to recover my son's swing and confidence. Don't get me wrong, the kids love it. The entire team lines up before every game and begs you to throw fastballs with it. It's great for use around the house - just tie it to a tree and you can take swings that you couldn't otherwise. Beware if you intend to use this for much more than casual practice and don't let it replace live pitching. Fun-factor is a 5, but as far as a training device, I have to question its value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money, but a quality a little iffy","review":"I bought this for my son when he was 9 years old. We attach it to the baseketball hoop and go to town! It REALLY helps warm up the swing and hand/eye coordination. The cord can fray pretty easily, we replaced ours after about a year. Comes with a second cord though.I can't pitch to save my life so this was a huge help to me. And I didn't have to run after the ball when it was hit.This also helped my son from dropping his back shoulder too much. If he swings below the string he knows he's dropped his shoulder.The only thing I don't like... You really have to hold the string TIGHT so that your knuckles don't get smacked with the ball. That's a little bit of a problem for my little ones to use it together."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD HISTORICAL NOVEL","review":"I really liked this novel. It was well written and It's about the conspiracy theory of Aaron Burr against Jefferson. It was a little long but well worth the reading time. A must for history buffs.

The Guangxi Province scenery is spectacular, and the folk songs are a real treat to hear. The movie does reflect the time it was made. It pits the heroine and the villagers against the evil landlord. But it is also unusual for the time in that the heroine and villagers are not dressed as Communist Party members and in that there are no Chinese national flags to be seen. I might add that the real translation of Liu San Jie means Liu's Third Daughter, not Sister.If you want to see something different, without lots of action and explosions and noise, buy this movie.

The premise of a near-future world dominated by China is plausible, intriguing, and extraordinarily well-executed by the author. The characters are also believable, deep, and emotionally engaging. The settings they find themselves in, from a goat farm on Mars to death-defying hang-gliding tournaments over New York City, are imaginative and interesting. I quickly grew to care about them and their world, and was really disappointed that the disjointed, almost random plot sequence gave them so little opportunity to do anything of real consequence. The ending (was there an ending?) has a twist, but so many threads are left unravelled and so many characters left hanging in limbo that I ended up mad at the author for botching up what should have been one of the best books I ever read. If this author learns to craft a plot and pull together a satisfying conclusion, she may be one of the great SF writers of our time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a classic!","review":"I have read nearly all the great sci-fi classics (and certainly everything that has ever been awarded a Hugo or Nebula) and for 200 pages or so China Mountain Zhang was up there with the best of them. However, with 40 or so pages to go I knew something was wrong. Call me simple, but don't all novels have to have an ending? Even novels that are intended to be a series need an ending. China Mountain Zhang has none. Further, a number of the sub-plots following the lesser characters in the novel are never adequately tied into the main character.Ultimately, I suspect a sequel was intended. But if so, where is it? CMZ was first published in 1992 so if a sequel ever does materialise I suspect many of us will have to re-read CMZ to make sense of it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great start got lost somewhere along the way","review":"Love science fiction - always thrilled to find something out of the ordinary, like a sci-fi story with a gay protagonist. McHugh does a great job describing a future world where China has become the one and only power, with all other cultures falling in its wake. Her take on the cultural customs that would emerge from such a scenario feels right on. The themes and obstacle experienced by Zhang are recognizable as concerns alive and well today - making the story believable and relatable.Unfortunately one can only take in-depth descriptions of surreal forms of architectural design so far and McHugh went a little past that. Still, I look forward to reading more from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"China Mountain Zhang","review":"I was wowed by the narrative voice. First person present tense gives it immediacy, while the style has a Zen-like quality, as though directly translated from Chinese -- very effective, adds tons to the book's tone. Quirky, interesting characters are superbly developed, involving the reader in their stories with graceful insight. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and am looking forward to Mission Child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good world, weak plot","review":"McHugh has a gift for character and world-building, but the rotating points-of-view contributed to burying an already weak plot. While a writer like LeGuin can marry sociological observation with a thrilling story, McHugh succeeds in only the first of these, and I only made it halfway before setting this one aside."},{"rating":"2","title":"We don't need no stinkin' plot!","review":"This was a good read. It had an engaging style and believable characters. I read through the whole thing, enjoying it thoroughly, before it even clicked that this book doesn't have an overall plot. If you decide to pick it up trust me, plot or no plot, you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Report from a Mir on Mars","review":"In a style reminiscent of Jan Myrdal's \\"Report from a Chinese Village\\", McHugh has collected tome tangentially related vignettes of life in a future world dominated by China and Chinese culture, complete with its bigotry and socialist ideology. One set of characters interacts in a somewhat terraformed Mars, but the principal characters are mostly in NYC, occasionally in PRC, once even on Baffin Island. Generally well done, but the writing and editing could be tighter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud exclamations from my reading room disturbed my cat.","review":"Highly enjoyable character portraits painted with a fine camelhair brush. Within a few pages, I was 'jacked' into this book much like the groupies that jacked into the experiences of the gladiator-kite-cyborgs that raced to live. The scenes and the science are painted carefully but not so completely as to dilute the reader's curiosity. Ms. McHugh is in danger of being sent to Mars to tend goats by the distinct-plot-demanders. But the tapestry of this plausible future populated by plausible beings is quite plausibly complete in itself. This book succeeds and that bodes well for my reading future."},{"rating":"2","title":"SF As High literature","review":"For the first time since I sturted to read SF (20 years and houndreds boks ago), I encounter a book in which the SF is but the media through which the writer expreses.

I decided to read it because I liked \\"The Lincoln Train\\" , a story that originally appeared in the Magazine of Fantasy & Science fiction, a great deal. However it didn't even readd like a novel since the different threads of the story only tenuously connected. Strangely, though I can talk longer about what I liked then what I didn't like. The part about the Martian goat farmer I loved. That's partly because it had the only likeable heterosexual male I can remember. I also loved the insights into Chinese culture. Even the parts in Canada were interesting. The book is quite real yet somehow ,for me, the book is less then the some of its parts. I can't say why it struck me that way, but it did.

Harlan is well known for his enthusiasms, but something is missing here. I don't know if he and I read the same book because he's much smarter than I am and I didn't like the book at all. What's extraordinary is that the book has no plot and it has two graphic male... \\"love\\" scenes that serve no point other than they fill space. They certainly don't advance or enhance the story, what little there is of it, and it tells us nothing about the character of China Mountain Zhang other than he likes boys and not girls.

This recording is not for anyone who understands the French language and its musical traditions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"I was worried that i wouldnt like this. but its fantastic! its the most modern music Belinda has ever done...She is in great voice and sounds like she has not lost a note since Heaven on Earth (1987).

But one doesn't need to comprehend the idiom to instantly recognize the tinny vocal styling (pure Piaf thievery), her clunky French diction (moving to Paris hasn't helped the argot) or dizzyingly ditzy arrangements (e.g. \\"La Vie En Rose\\" as Euro-gay camp disco? Mon dieu!!). I surmise this could all be a lot worse (it could be \\"Heaven On Earth\\" or \\"A Woman And A Man\\" or \\"Live Your Life Be Free\\" or, worst of all, heaven-help-us, \\"Runaway Horses\\") but rather than Chteau Lafite, we are left with escargot on the breath.

Still, I was looking forward to hearing \\"Merci Cherie\\", which was originally sung by an Austrian (Udo Juergens), winning the annual \\"Eurovision\\" chanson contest in the late 1960s. What a disappointment Belinda's rendition is- I wish she'd stuck to English songs! I love her solo work from the 1980's. The only thing I like about this album is the cover art. She continues to look marvelous! Try Mireille Mathieu, Francoise Hardy, or France Gall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ill advised project","review":"This cd is the Titanic of Carlise's career and listening to it makes you want to walk the plank rather than wait for inevitable death by drowning. I will say that the French pronunciation is surprisingly good but trying to make a Celion Dion record just don't cut the mustard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Merde!","review":"I was looking forward to this CD and it's just awful! Her American accent was grating, the arrangements other than the first track were dreadful.Isabelle Boulay's \\"Avec le temps\\" is a haunting, lush rendition, Belinda's was NOT. Jacques Brel and Edith Piaf must be rotating in their graves with their songs being butchered too. \\"La Vie en Rose\\" in disco tempo?? Mon Dieu!Belinda needs to be Walking Like An Egyptian - right out of this realm!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MASTERPIECE!!!!!","review":"Belinda Carlisle is back - Boy, is she ever! \\"voila\\" is the absolute best CD of her career! I was leary when I first heard her new CD was sung entirely in French, but I was wrong to be uneasy! From the moment you put this disc in the player, it is a wonderful musical adventure! Belinda's voice is pitch perfect! This album is getting outstanding reviews across the board (as it should!). Belinda deseves a Grammy Award for her work on \\"VOILA\\". I hope she will not be overlooked for this accomplishment. I LOVE this CD, and loved it from the first moment I heard the songs! Belinda sounds great! She looks fabulous on the cover too! The best songs, in my opinion, on \\"Voila\\" are: \\"Ne Me Quitte Pas\\", \\"Pourtant Tu M'Aimes\\", \\"Bonnie Et Clyde\\", \\"Avec Le Temps\\", \\"Contact\\", and \\"La Vie En Rose\\". Everyone should own a copy of this CD --- If you do, you will play it over & over & over & over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart sutra explained","review":"Any Zen student could benfit from reading Bernie's analysis of the heart sutra, which is the subject of the first half of this book. Bernie throughly analyzes the sutra somtimes going as far as to analyze every syllable of a word. This may seem like it could be very dull. 70 or so pages of analysis on a 24 line sutra might seem a bit excessive, but Bernie some how keeps it interesting.Considering the importance of the heart sutra in Zen practice it seems to me this book should probably be considered for required reading for all beginning Zen students. All of that withstanding there is still the second half of the book in which bernie offers more of the same insights on the identity of relative and absolute and the bodhisattva precepts. This is good stuff and a pretty easy read so I'd highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would help if we knew what songs are in the set!!","review":"How about putting a list up of the songs that are in the cd set.

I cannot imagine doing any kind of woodworking without one. I have been making maple butcher blocks out of S2S 4/4 maple stock. Some of my glue joints have been spotty at best and the average board height has been off considerably. With the Delta, I can get perfect joints and uniform height on all my rails. Now I am moving into full sized maple countertops. The 22-565 chews 6/4 maple and spits out a perfectly smooth 1 3/8\\" X 2\\" X 60\\" rail with no problems. Snipe is no problem at all and the depth guide was right on. Assembly was basic and straight forward. Dad and I unpacked that planer and were using it within an hour.As a side note, as stated before, buy adequate hearing protection. When planing wide maple or other hard wood, it is deafening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"I've been using my new Delta for about a week now. Right out of the box it's performed flawlessly. The only thing that required adjustment was the height indicator. It was out about 1/32\\". This was quickly and easily remedied by resetting the indicator. Other than that, the setup was quick and painless, instructions are clear and concise. The bonus stand is a plus. I'm going to order the dust chute immediately and should have done it at the same time !! Strongly recommnend dust collection as this piece can sure create a pile of debris in a hurry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"The stand is good. That's the best I can say. After purchasing this planer and using it maybe 3 times it stopped feeding the stock. I had to push on the boards to get them to move through the tool.

They nick very easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very impressed","review":"I just fired up this planner for the first time. everything worked fine for the first 10 1 X 6 cedar boards. then the feed roller stopped. turns out the drive sprocket for the roller is in about 8 small pieces; after only 10 boards! not real impressive to say the least. will see what delta has to say tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading group's reflective","review":"This book was a odd parallel to the book group I'm part of and then I realized it captured a snapshot of life reflective a groups in a time capsule. This story is about lives that will remind you of people you know and the author does a very good job in telling it to us. There is lots to think over and talk about in the book. A good choice for reading groups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy it for what it is.","review":"This book is an easy read. Fun at times, sleep material at others. There are too many characters and it takes awhile to keep them straight. It's rather frustrating because you lose so much of the story when you have to consult the \\"cast of characters\\" to remember who is who. It's a good read if you want to clear your mind of a stressful day and don't want anything heavy. I'd be disappointed if this book were recommeded for my reading club, but all in all, I enjoyed it for what it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same Theme...New Perspective","review":"The dim prospect of reading yet another in the \\"group of close women friends\\" genre kept me from reading Elizabeth Noble's The Reading Group a lot longer than it should have. Although it took some time to become acquainted with all of the characters (thankfully, there is a character listing at the front of the book), once I became familiar with these women, their friends and families, I was hooked. Perhaps it was the absence of the requisite dramatic illness that drew me to these women, each of them just trying to get through the day and cope as best they could with the challenges of life.The introduction of the reading group's choices during the year's span of the novel prompted many thoughts to try to compare titles I have read and piqued my interest to search out those I have not. (Reader beware--the group's discussions do reveal significant plot details of the books discussed!)I am happy I finally plucked this gem from the TBR pile!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I don't understand all of the rave reviews.There were too many characters. Several chapters in, I still couldn't remember the names of every single person featured in this book. It seems these women have no lives besides pregnancies and bitching at their husbands. Stereotypical and trashy, unflattering and slow. For being older women, they act like their daughters: high school girls who only value immaturity and superficiality. Seriously, I don't distinguish between the two groups.Besides that, everything else is just predictable and cliche. Would not recommend to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for a light beach read","review":"This book will keep you reading pretty much all the way through. I read it in two sittings, and I would have read it one if life hadn't called.The characters are interesting, at the very least, but I couldn't bring myself to care about any of them. Some of the characters that have the most drama/trauma in their lives are the ones least psychologically exposed to the reader, so it's really difficult to give a darn. Kind of strange given how long this book was.I think that this book was also cleverly written around book club suggestions, but would have been much more intelligent and fun had it really linked the novels to the characters' lives in a more meaningful way.Still a fun read. I wouldn't pay the B&N; $15 price tag, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Desparate Housewives Are Very Engaging!","review":"I loved this book! From the very first page, I found the characters to be engaging and very likable both for their strengths and their weaknesses. I was fascinated at how the author weaves their stories through the monthly book club meetings and also by how the characters's lives become intertwined. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown!","review":"I really liked the premise of a reading club, with the themes in the books interwoven into the lives of the readers. But a few pages into the book, I began to feel disappointed. First, the voices of each of the characters - Harriet, Nicole, Polly, Susan, Clare, Cressida ... sounded exactly alike to me. Each uses the same adjectives to describe their thoughts and feelings - a couple of times, when I went back to reading after having forgotten to bookmark the page, I'd realize that the page I'd turned to wasn't where I left off - it just sounded very similar. And then after a couple of hundred pages, I completely lost interest in the characters, as I began to see Noble preparing to neatly wrap up the plots. I'd probably otherwise have given this book two stars, but I felt so let down after a promising plot in the first three-quarters of the book, that I think it deserves only one star, if that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down...","review":"Yes, it took a few pages to get all the characters straight. But they were all so compelling & real. It was a well-written, thought-provoking book. It looks a little long, but it's so hard to put down, it goes quickly! This is what keeps me reading chick-lit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I've read in a while","review":"This is a wonderful book of friendship, hardship and relationships.

Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book Club reads The Reading Group","review":"We choise this book for the following reasons: One member is from England, We wanted a change from the \\"heavy reading\\" we have been doing and We thought the titles they had chosen to read were interesting. Six of us enjoyed the book. It was nice to have our English friend help to translate, but most of us figured out the new vocabulary using context clues. The characters had as many problems as our \\"Desparate Housewives\\" television show, but we felt the English contingent was a bit more realistic. We definately had mixed feelings about the tie in of the lives of the characters and the books they read. I personally never did see a clear connection."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree a booklover's dream!","review":"What better than women and friendships, and discussing books! The characters in this book went through life, having ups and downs. Starting out as strangers for the most part and ending up looking forward to their discussions about books and sharing their lives.I loved this book. I don't think we have to like all the characters to love a book though! Since I live in the US, I am unaccustomed to some of the English phrases. Thank goodness I have some friends that are English!Enjoy this book. I look forward to more books by this outstanding author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a soapy boor","review":"I am an avid reader and it takes a lot for me to pan a book, but pan this one I will. It was like reading a bad soap opera. I didn't care about the characters-they were fake and dopey-and certainly didn't care what happened to them. The best part of the book was the last page-it was over!!! I only gave it two stars because someone actually took the time to write this stuff-albeit badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many characters-weak women","review":"This book was a chore to get through, there are 25 characters in the beginning to keep track of, had to keep flipping back to the first page to keep track of who is who.

Am taking this book to Goodwill, not a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"not terrible","review":"I had just finished 'Angry Housewives Eating Bon-Bons', another 'reading club' novel, and enjoyed it very much. I saw this in the store and it looked similar so I decided to read it. To be kind, it was not nearly as good. I did finish it, and it did get better as I continued, but I could have easily misplaced the book and not missed not being able to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You call this a Biography?","review":"This isn't a biography at all in the truest sense of the word. What it is is an in-depth analysis of his discography and studio habits. We get very little of his personal life in these 500 plus pages. He barely mentions some of his girlfriends or his only daughter for that matter. He seems to have written this book with an obvious bias against Van Morrison for whatever personal reason. He never misses an opportunity to reiterate ad nauseum to let us know he is difficult and moody. We get the picture already, move on. I'm sure people in the music industry might be able to comprehend all of the technical studio jargon and keep track of the endless stream of musicians and managers but not the typical fan. He did not address the fact or rumor about \\"Brown-eyed girl\\" originally being titled \\"Brown-skinned girl\\" and unexplicably he doesn't even mention Bert Berns in the Dramatis Personae. I give him two stars mainly for the interviews and quotes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not reveal the man","review":"I'm a long time fan and was well aware that Van Morrison is not a very likeable individual. However, this bio seemed a compilation of public information about Van Morrison with nothing really revealing about the man who has written such great music. There's no way to reconcile the despicable person presented in this bio with a guy who writes the kind of great, humanistic songs that fill the Van Morrison portfolio. Unfortunately, Van isn't talking and given his apparent desire to paint a distorted picture of his past (one of the few good revelations in the book), we'll probably never know the real person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Don't bother reading this book. It offers no insight into Van Morrison the man, and very little into his music. The author's negative bias is obvious on every page. In every instance, he seems determined to put VM in the worst possible light. He cobbles together quotes from some musicians Morrison has worked with, and since Morrison did not authorize this biography, some obviously very important people's voices are not heard, yet he seems to give the impression that these people offer the last word on Morrison. He couldn't even come up with some interesting photos for the book. Equally annoying is the pompous tone Heylin adopts when discussing the music. In all, the book seems to offer only a timeline of when various albums were recorded,along with some boring business details. If you want to know about Van Morrison, listen to the music, and relegate this book to the remainder bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good vibrating cushion -- not \\"massaging\\"","review":"This product is a good vibrating cushion, but it does not do any \\"massaging.\\"My chief complaints are:-Does not massage-Straps used for securing to the chair are too short for a normal office chair, I had to use rubber bands to extend it.-The leg vibrator was uncomfortable.

It consists of a series of slides while Greg talks over them. Some of the pictures are nice, but as far as a useful preparation DVD for your trip, forget it.I thought it would consist of some reviews of equipment, views of how to prepare for the trip, highlights to look for, recommendations for places to go and how to get there, and at least a little useful info. Instead, it is a slide show with a narration over the top. Save your money and just buy the book.

A must for any fan's collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"obnoxious, almost thoroughly useless","review":"If your child is already talking you may like this book as an info update for every few months. If your child is over a year and not talking, this book will make you feel like a rotten parent. It doesn't matter that ignored children talk and children who are doted over may be late talkers. Today, and the author is on board with these diseased thinking, if a child is a late talker, he/she (especially HE) is autistic, aspie, ADD or PDD. It's absolutely absurd. For everything a child does late there is some type of therapy. I don't know too many children who don't talk and I watch my child evolve daily so he will do it on his schedule.

This brush has all wood handle, it feels comfortable in my hand, and feels solid. The bristles are made out of a mix of boar bristles and nylon bristles. The bristles are relatively stiff, but not as hard as metal bristles of some brushes, and I find it pretty gentle on my scalp. I like that the bristles have no knobs which I found tangle and tag on my hair.Passing on a tip I got from my hairdresser: she told me to never to brush my hair when it is very wet. It is better to wait a bit until it just slightly damp. When hair is plumped up with water it has an ability to stretch like elastic, but it if you pull it too far it will snap. She told me to use a wide-tooth comb if I need to comb it right out of the shower.I really like the results I get with this brush, I recommend it!Ali Julia review"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Brush","review":"I bought this brush because the boar bristles are supposed to distribute oils and grip hair better for blow drying. Sure enough, it works. I blow-dried my permed hair straight this morning in a matter of 50 minutes ( i have thick shoulder length hair that is semi-coarse). I was very pleased by the performance of this brush and I LOVE the nylon bristles. Some people may not enjoy their scratchy feel, but I am accustomed to brushing my hair with a metal bristle brush so I really liked it. The reason why I gave this brush four stars is because I question the quality of the brush...I had some little black bristles all over the floor after I was done blow-drying my hair and I know that another reviewer has had the same issue. I have never used another boar bristle brush before though, so I guess I can't really compare the quality to other brushes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice product in general","review":"I have less hair, and I found the boar bristles fairly helpful in shaping my hairstyle. But the nylon bristles are a little bit too sharp on the tip, it hurts when they touch the scalp by accident."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable","review":"Hello everybody. I bought this brush a couple weeks ago, and after reading the reviews, didn't find anything to bad about it. After using it, I found that it was a great brush. It styles very well. The only problem I found with it, this being the reason I gave it only one star, was that it smelled terrible. I didn't notice this for a while, but I did, it was awful. I tried washing it, but nothing worked to get the smell out. I am not able to use it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short hair.","review":"I have a short hair, and this brush hurt my skin when I brush with it. Maybe good for some people have long hair, not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring","review":"If you know the exciting music from Prokofiev and then theway how Boris Berman plays all the piano music from Prokofiev.Just one word.Boring!!!!!!!Please listen to Bashkirov,Eteri Andjaparidze,Horowitz,Argerich,then you will be excited by this fantastic composer and performers."},{"rating":"2","title":"great trio achievement","review":"There's always a risk in going back to standards. In the beginning I was suspicious : I've always preferred originals or deconstructed standards with new ideas and creative urges... Of course here, you won't find Uri Caine or Kenny Werner, but it's all the same very very good.Finally I decided to get this set by veteran pianist Zeitlin and the result ? Well, I was amazed and I'm still. It's a very good piano trio achievement. Never boring, which is rare nowadays... No mawkishness, no shooting line. Buster Williams on double bass is what we already knew (listen to his great&long-time team up with Kenny Barron): Amazing, and always fascinating (listen to his bass-lines on \\"Wishing on The Moon\\"). The whole album is fresh, cool, and it swings great. A real surprise for me. One of my favorite tune is \\"Every Which Way\\" (a very groovy track 3 that you can hear on Amazon).Enjoy yourself !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad but compelling independent film from China","review":"Zhou Xun is one of the most compelling actresses working today and she grabs you right from the start in this film. She plays a young woman whose parents, intellectuals from the previous generation, have abandoned her for the most part, shuffling her off to live in near poverty with her granny and aunt. Then she's accepted into university, raising her class status momentarily, but falls in love with a truck driver, gets pregnant and her life unravels. There's subtle and deep social commentary embracing this extremely sad tale of family, love, and one woman's struggle to survive in modern China. I was very surprised by the script. It's softly brutal."},{"rating":"1","title":"HP Media Drive","review":"I fell into the same category as some of the other writers. The HP Media drive failed and I have tried just about everything listed on the internet to get it restarted. It is gone. Seems to me like this device should last more than a couple of years. I decided I would not try another so I purchased a couple of WD external. Lots more capacity and thus far both are working fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Like the other reviewer of this product, I too had a Personal Media Drive fail well before the 12-month warranty ran out. Calls to HP yielded no less than 12 transfers to different departments, none of whom were able to assist in getting this defective brick repaired/replaced. The unit worked flawlessly to backup important business data (along with music files), but when it failed, it failed miserably. I purchased this to go with the HP Media Center PC I purchased a few months before (w/ built-in drive bay to handle \\"the brick\\").Will positively NOT purchase another, and urge others to consider a more reliable product before handing over your $$$ to HP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst product - crashed in 2 months","review":"Don't buy. I bought one, loaded it with movies and it crashed. I lost 2 months worth of work. Tech support even worse, each call lasted over an hour and was transferred at least 3 times. When I finally did get help and a replacement was sent, it too was defective. So back through the \\"support\\" line.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Round up the usual suspects","review":"Ah,yes. It's all the fault of those nasty patriarchal corporations (again). And the solution is so obvious! Live like a third-world peasant! I love it when first-world academics who enjoy all of the priveledges of high technology (medicine, air travel, food surpluses) advise others to live at the subsistence level. How terribly condescending to all of the REAL third-world peasants who desperately want to escape the subsistence-level life...the ones who vote with their feet by immigrating in hordes to first world, hi-tech capitalist countries. If the authors weren't so deadly serious, this book could be mistaken for a satire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much more violent than you would be led to expect","review":"Unless you are the type of nature lover who enjoys the Trials of Life videos, there is nothing at all to recommend this movie. There are some truly brutal scenes which both my husband and I found horrible to watch. I wouldn't let a child see this in a million years. It's so disturbing that I would worry about scarring them. In addition, all the scenes are extremely staged-looking with ridiculous sound effects and jokey voice-overs. I had really looked forward to seeing this (based on the title) and it was a disappointment in every way imaginable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good grip, easy storage, simple design","review":"This product does the job well. Unlike cheaper models, it stores the fish tape neatly and easily. The dispenser is comfortable in the hand and the case is convenient when you are up on a ladder and need either the handle or to hook your hand through the center comfortably."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT MADE IN USA!!!","review":"Part of the reason I purchased this is because I was led to believe it was made in the USA. The technical details section of the product listing clearly states \\"Made in USA\\". The fish tape I received looks the same as the one pictured but says it is made in Taiwan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earth Retention Systems Handbook","review":"A good practical handbook. It is a good reference book for both geotechnical and structural engineers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delta 50-446 DUMB Collector","review":"Without a doubt, the worst accessory that Delta has tried to push on woodworkers. The slit opening clogs easily and often no matter what material is being planed. Overpriced and underdesigned, it certainly does not live up to the quality that Delta has been known for in the past. I can only hope that the new owners, Black & Decker, will try to come up with a real accessory that works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly poor","review":"I'm surprised that so many reviewers think this is a good accessory. It's absolutely necessary, and every Delta planer owner needs one.... but it's a poor design. Boards hit it on the outfeed. You also can't lower the head all the way if you need to plane really thin stock - instrument makers beware! The other problem is that a standard 4\\" slip fit connector doesn't stay on well. This is only a problem if you move your dust collector hose from machine to machine. But, a lot of folks do that, and it's just absurd that this chute isn't correctly sized to fit well.Finally, it's annoying that the dust chute isn't included with the machine. It's not really optional - you have to extract the chips from a planer, or the machine's rollers press the chips into the nicely planed surface of the wood.I like the planer pretty well, and this thing is necessary.. but poorly executed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delta 50-446 Dust Connector for Delta Model 22-580","review":"I am very pleased with this dust chute. It does what it is supposed to do and I haven't had any problem with it clogging. I do recommend it to anyone who has the Delta 22-580 2 speed finish plainer and a dust collector to hook it to. I am a professional contractor and it works great for the work I do (I also custom build cabinets)."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTE NECESSITY","review":"Works extremely well with my 2 HP dust collector. I believe it to be ABSOLUTE NECESSITY. It was back ordered and I did not get it until I had my planer for two weeks. WHAT A CHIP/DUST GENERATOR!!!!When the collector arrived, WHAT A DIFFERENCE.It is easy to install, remove two screws, lift up the plate, put in collector, replace screws, hook up and plane. You do have to remove it after wards in order to close up the machine.Get one with your planer. You'll quickly be up to your *#@ in wood chips and sawdust if you don't.I won't use the planer without it. Neither will you."},{"rating":"1","title":"DESIGN FLAW","review":"I was disappointed to learn, upon mounting the Delta 50-446 Dust Connector that it sags down into the outfeed area. The method of connecting doesn't allow for any correction of this problem. Boards passing though the planer will always rub against the dust connector."},{"rating":"1","title":"I spy...........","review":"This Romper Room was B-O-R-I-N-G!!!!

So Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok movie but not close to being great","review":"Cecil B. DeMille can bring big flashy expensive movies to life and he dose it in this movie. The acting is ok but not great but mostly becouse of the bad dialoge and the early-career of most of the actors like Charlton Heston as the circus manager, then there is Betty Hutton as trapeze artistes who is the best thing about this movie then there is James Stewart who steals away allt he sence he is in as he plays a clown who--for mysterious reasons--never removes his makeup. This is not a great film but has moments that are good the best part is the last 15 minutes. James Stewert and Betty Hutton also save this movie with great acting.

He lives in Chicago so he can't always go out when it's too cold so this is great for him to have something he can practice with indoor (given enough space).

He loved it - but the ball won't stay in the straps. The product has four velcro straps that you use to secure the ball. He uses a size 4 soccer ball and I have spent time carefully strapping the ball in, only to have it come loose as he practices with it.

Every time I set down the book in the middle of one of Jackie's wild dates, I felt like I was missing out on the fun.Sarah Mlynowski is byfar my favorite author, and the only book that I've found since Milkrun that kept my attention is As Seen On TV, and I can't wait to read Fishbowl as soon as I can get my hands on it!I definitly recommend this book to anyone and everyone, especially if you're single or fresh out of a long-term relationship.

The main character is a neurotic twenty-something bent on having a boyfriend. And you guessed it... she works in journalism as an editor. She isn't entirely happy with her career, so much of her life revolves around finding a boyfriend. The book does have some humorous moments, but it just wasn't captivating.

Why bother setting the novel here? The first glaring evidence of this was the name of the \\"bar\\" the protagonists visits on Newbury Street. Would NEVER happen. Boston is nothing if not stuffy & conservative.My eyes also started glazing over at the thought of these groups of \\"working adults\\" going into bars and simply downing shots.

Once it got to ingredient number 5, however, NEUROTIC MOTHER, I thought, this is WAY too much of a cliche for me. I admire that Sarah Mlynowski wrote about Boston instead of London or New York, and I admire that she had the energy and dedication to sit down and write a book.

I'd rather do ANYTHING then be forced to read drivel like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech.","review":"I've read a few chicklit books in my time, so I'm not particularly surprised when these turn out to be formulaic and derivative. But what really set me off in this book was the fact that the main character was a copy editor -- and the book was rife with misspellings and misused words!

It's a chick lit book so what do you expect?? \\"War and Peace\\"???I enjoyed the writing style ~ funny and sarcastic. As a 40something, I didn't find it too young. The character is very funny and I felt at times I was sitting next to her with a glass of wine and listening to her go on and on (but in a good way!).Yes, there are typos ~ very ironic given what Jackie does for a living."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for all 20-something females!!","review":"I think that all women over the age of 20 need to read this book!

Sometimes it can be a little bit awkward to read her stream-of-conciousness style, but she is hilarious and truly tells it like it is.

Definitely recommend to friends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lactose intolerant....","review":"Run from this book--even if you aren't lactose intolerant! Disappointing and trivial heroine, this story has been told a hundred times and a hundred times better. Totally predictable, boring and annoying.

It was entirely predictable (the only chicklit trope not trotted out for our delectation was the fabulous gay friend), clunkily conceived, poorly edited (as many others have pointed out), even more poorly imagined, and the writing was just bad. There's no other way to say it.I loved See Jane Date, and I really admire RD Inc for publishing young female authors who might not otherwise get the chance, but you've got to think--there are reasons they might not otherwise get the chance. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terriffic read!","review":"This is not my first venture into Chick Lit, nor will it be my last, but Mlynowski is bar far one of the best writing in the genre right now. She has great character development, and some of the moments will literally have you laughing out loud (I would know, I got some weird looks on the plane while reading it). Sure, the story is familiar, but when is it not with these kind of books? This is Mlynowski's first novel but she already puts herself leaps and bounds above some women writing in the genre, such as Clare Naylor.

Simply said; it's a fun book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jackie the Crazy Dating Girl","review":"This is Mlynowski's first book! It's a quick read and I absolutely loved it. Some negative critics are saying that Jackie is too self-centered, but aren't most 20-something females? Believe me, I know plenty- and I can be one at times too!Jackie gets dumped via email and swears she will bounce back. She tries dating but isn't having any luck. Her life doesn't get any easier when the EX returns and when her roommate also splits from her longtime boyfriend.

Her methods of getting over her relationship: buying knee high boots, dating ridiculous men, shopping for men in bookstores, getting a belly button ring. All very funny.Jackie is likeable and down to earth. And her self-absorption makes the book even funnier.A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick read, entertaining, & humourous","review":"This was a really cute book that was a really quick read. I read it on vacation in a couple of hours at the beach/pool. The only part I was a little disappointed with was the ending - it skimped a little and didn't take us to a conclusion - perhaps there might be a second installment?!

I was bummed that I spent the money on it. If you are choosing a book club book, this isn't it. It is very short, predictable and you'll be done discussing it in about 10 minutes. While I agree that the dating stories were funny and relatable, I found the stream of concsious writing style a bit confusing. There were times when you had to reread pages because you couldn't tell if the character was speaking aloud or thinking.Also, a bit of a pet peeve, there were at least three places where incorrect grammar and words were used.

The plot was uninspired with a totally predictable ending. The characters were unsympathetic. But the poor editing (misspellings, etc.) was almost humorous in light of the fact that the protagonist is a BOOK EDITOR!I am accustomed (and expect) to non-American English language from novels based overseas, but in this book, it made no sense... i.e., \\"University\\" instead of \\"College\\", \\"Call Display\\" instead of \\"Caller ID\\" - a minor nitpick, but I think shows the attention to detail the publisher used when getting this book on the market.Pass this up - there are more than enough good books of this ilk to occupy your time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I really enjoyed \\"Milkrun\\" and its premise -- guy leaves girl to find himself, etc. Girl picks herself up and starts dating again. And dating a lot. It reminded me a little of \\"Heartbreaker\\" (Corum) and also of \\"Bridgett Jones' Diary\\" (Felding) in that while the character was just getting through a bad situation, she wasn't about to let that stop her in her quest for \\"the one\\" It seemed as though she was having fun while she was doing it, too. I really enjoyed it very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this get published?","review":"I'm sorry, but this is sooooo BAD! I couldn't get past the first two chapters. The characters go on and on and don't really say anything. Overall, just very immature, and downright boring. There is no real story here, just a bunch of scenes about shallow people drinking or obsessing over every little thing. After reading the first Red Dress Ink, See Jane Date, I was looking forward to this one, but save your money. (...)This is a wannabe, that just doesn't come close unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!

Looking for Mr. Right.After being dumped by her boyfriend she makes it a point to go out and find someone who care for her and be there for her. But with her luck she just find men who aren't her type.What I love most about this book was her friendships with Sam and Wendy. Sam was a riot with her neatness type personality and her boyfriend Marc and her many other dates with men.

I thought some light chick-lit might just be a relaxing change of pace. I forced myself through it, but only painfully.It is written in an open style, but not adeptly, so that it comes off reading like something a pre-teen girl might write... The attitude and shallowness of Janie, the protaganist, only reinforces the whole idea.I found the book boring, and insulting to women in the negative stereotypes that it perpetuates.If you are the type who obsesses over marriage and wearing the right thing-- hey, this book might be up your alley. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and go pick up some other book to scratch that chick-lit itch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good first attempt at a book","review":"I agree with \\"how did this book get published\\" (Dec/2001). Through the beginning of this book I thought I was going to die. The writing style reminded me of the first short story I ever wrote (when I was 8). There was not enough content, and way too much babbling.Luckily, the author's writing style changes at some point & then the book is just a cute story. If I'd been the publisher, I would have demanded the beginning be re-written, but hey, I'm not them.This book is a 20-something Sex in the City / Bridget Jone's Diary wanna-be. It does an ok job at doing that too, but is not extremely original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Jackie is working at Cupid but still did not meet with Fabio.

It supposedly took place in Boston - all of these supposed bars don't exist - which being a resident of Boston made it very frustrating. It should have just taken place in Springfield, USA. It was very generic and ruined the story. For all Bostonites its easy to know that no DQ exists in the city nor parking anywhere! I hope no one who reads this book thinks any of these places exist. I recognize its a ficiton book but there have been many books that take place in Boston (ie. Living Single) that use actual places. Tsk tsk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even a little bit enjoyable","review":"I had low expectations going in- I was just looking for a fun and lighthearted book, not a Pulitzer Prize winner.

Although it does make you believe that publishing a book must not be so hard after all..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chick lit!!","review":"This book entered my life unexpectedly.

Readers looking for a breezy romp of the Bridget Jones variety won't regret giving Milkrun a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harlequin romance with a cuter cover","review":"Bad writing, lame characters, just a horrible book for anyone with half a brain!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not a copy editor, but...","review":"Plot-wise, Mlynowski's novel is cute, a typical entry in the single-girl genre. The only thing that stands out about it is the INCREDIBLY shoddy editing! I find it ironic that a book with a protagonist who is a copy editor is so full of errors: \\"you're\\" used for \\"your,\\" \\"their\\" used for \\"there,\\" etc. Frankly, I just couldn't get past the errors to enjoy the story. Maybe if the story had been stronger, something more than just \\"cute,\\" it could have overcome this major hurdle...but I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money and time","review":"I purchased this book in an airport bookstore over the weekend. I wasted my money. Yes, it was an easy read, but as others have mentioned, the editing was horrible and the main character not very interesting. Actually, none of the characters seem to have any personality at all unlike Bridget Jones, who was brimming with the stuff. To even put this book in the same catagory as the above mentioned novel or \\"The Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing\\" is an insult to their authors. Red Dress Ink has a great concept, but there is more to being a 20-something single girl than great boots and dating. I'd like characters with a bit more substance next time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating cover art; refreshing storyline","review":"Jackie is an editor at a publishing house specializing in romance novels.

The one male voice of reason, Jerry's best friend, Andrew, suddenly becomes more appealing to Jackie as she continues her quest for fulfillment... then Jerry re-enters the picture, and she is in a tailspin all over again.Yes, Jackie is very self absorbed. But that is one of the things that makes her mis-adventures so humorous and poignant. The author really manages to capture her manic and emotional behavior.The ambiguous ending, left me wanting one just more chapter. But I am finding this a common practice in the Chick Lit movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"milkrun for another book","review":"I must admit there were a few instances in \\"Milkrun\\" when I laughed, but for the most part I was disappointed. Jackie repeatedly describes herself as \\"intelligent,\\" yet I didn't see any actual proof of this in her behavior. For instance, how could she not guess that her copyeditor-superior (I forget her name) had written a book she had Jackie review? Perhaps Mlynowski was trying to give only subtle hints to the reader, but to have Jackie act so obliviously makes me think Jackie is kidding herself when she thinks she's smart.My advice: Run for another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Jobst Brand Instead!","review":"These stockings are not as durable as you would think.

It is so bad the leveling screws for the plate vibrated completely out and the guide pin that I use when using bits with bearings vibrated out (twice) and over into the spinning bit then shot off into my yard. I never could find the pin. Also in order to use the height adjustment through the base plate you have to remove one of the handles because the screw holding it in is too long. No big deal if you leave it in a router table but a pain if you take it out to use it by hand. This router has some neat features but I wouldn't recomend this router until they solve these problems.

The vulnerable Julie, the exiled Pete, and the thoughtful Linc were so cool. We bought this set to see if we would enjoy it even now and still do. Clarence Williams III's (Linc's) perceptive, thoughtful, and athletic portrayal are especially enjoyable. We have found it a vehicle for discussion of drug use, Hollywood's portrayals of certain points of views, of history (ancient since there were no cell phones) with our twelve-year-old daughter. Most of the episodes are high quality, feature good photography, and demonstrate a well-written story. The acting, especially Clarence Williams III's, are excellent.

However the details of his career are full of fiction. Although he did rise up high in the Marshals Service, he ended his career in disgrace when he was arrested by the FBI for extortion. (a subject which he just glossed over at the end of the book). He was convicted of that crime and did time in the federal prison system. As I read this book years ago, I got disgusted with his twisting of the truth and his self-glorification, because I knew better.

That is only because I blanked out the fact this book was written as non-fiction. As a dime novel, this book was only lacking good artwork! I'm not sure if this book was written in Pascucci's own words, or ghostwritten by Stauth. For Pascucci's sake, I hope it was simply embellishment by an enthusiastic co-author. Phrases such as, \\"I like to blow big holes in bad people,\\" had me cringing. This guy should be writing scripts in B-movies. Unfortunately, the cartoonish dialogue detracted from what might have been an interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"He was good but.......","review":"Basically Pascucci was one hardcore marshal, and did things most of us will never do. He went into great detail about his adventures, but he also tried to B.S. his away around the reasons he was kicked out of the Marshals Svc. Other than that the book was a decent read.

This enchanting concept album revolves around a ghost who longs after his wife, and haunts her for leaving for another. The heavy riffs and Mikael's demonic, beast-like growls are unbridled in their deadly and destructive power. The acoustic sections on the other hand are a beautiful contrast and offer to the listener the more gothic, romantic side of this album in particular. Destructive in the listener's wake, yet gothic and moody enough for the listener to relax and bask in its inner most beauty, Opeth's My Arms, Your Hearse is an absolutely essential album to any metalhead or progressive rock fan's music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good...But Not The Best From an Amazing Band","review":"After many years of trying to accept this album in the ranks of Still Life/Morningrise/Orchid or Deliverance I have to sorrowfully admit I it does very little for me.

I don't understand why this group is listed as a black metal band-it seems to me to be closer to death metal, chock full of beautiful classical guitar sections. Trust me, this is no Emperor! MA,YH is a concept album that deals with a man who has died, now a ghost, trying to communicate with the lover he left behind.

I highly recommend this album to anyone who can appreciate music."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy 5 stars","review":"I have to disagree with the comment that this is not on the level of Morningrise. The production on this CD is far better: the guitars are thicker, but I wouldn't say muddier, and the vocals are recorded much better. I find the songs more coherent than on Morningrise. Plus the new drummer shreds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Black/Death Metal","review":"unlike most black metal, the vocals on this album are not grinding on your ears like alot of black metal tends to be.(Emperor, Rotting Christ) Instead there are very impressive death metal like vocals and crisp clean vocals. The music is incredibly complex undergoing key changes and time changes many time within the song. Also, many of the songs are over 8 minutes long, yet it feels as if though 2 or 3 have passed. Furthermore Opeth's lyrics are much better than 99% of the bands that I have ever heard. The CD is based on one epic poem that unfolds as the story of a dead man, now a ghost is hoping to be able to experience the love he felt in life now that he is dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The last interesting Opeth album...","review":"I know some people are going to be very displeased with this review but hey this is my opinion so respect it as I do yours. Truth is, I never got into the next albums they released. Still Life and Blackwater Park were one of the same while Deliverance was forced and entirely uninteresting to my ears. I just hoped they would return to the greatness of the first 3 albums so I decided to review this one. \\"My Arms, Your Hearse\\" is by all means a brilliant album. Everything Opeth fans liked in the first two album is here. This time Mike sings with a slightly different style which he will adapt in the next albums (I kinda prefered his singing in the first two albums) making his growls sound very raw. The album is supposed to be a concept album and the storyline flows really well. Nevertheless a very interesting album. Still waiting for their comeback..."},{"rating":"1","title":"i had enough...","review":"the first thing i heard from akerfeldt was his vocals in Katatonia's brave murder day. i was impressed by his powerful yet desperate voice (the best growling vocals ever!!!), so when i discovered his band opeth, i bought orchid, morningrise and MAYH without hearing any of it... so this review (and the star)goes for those 3 works. in either of those works akerfeldt's voice has the magnificent, despair and greatness of brave murder day... so that was the beginning of the end.I don't care if opeth's music is complex and delivered by great musicians, for me sounds very artificial and bored... opeth reflects virtuosity but that's not enough, they lacks attitude and soul.When i have insomnia i put opeth in my cd player..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 3rd Opeth extraction.","review":"This cd is amazing! It's all that I would have expected from Opeth. It's dark, mysterious, and well written.

I'll be pretty angry if Panasonic doesn't step up and cover this, considering the problem is widespread with this system.Otherwise, I've been pleased with it.

I chose this router over a cheaper one that had the same power, but required that one turn the body to make height adjustments - in router table use this would irritate me each time I used it. One comment in another review was that the depth adjustment stuck and gave the owner a lot of grief. Mine responds flawlessly, and is perfect for table use.It doesn't come equipped with a base plate that will accept 1 3/16\\" template guides and this was a complaint someone had. The connection pattern on the bottom worked with a third party baseplate I already had that is drilled to fit a wide range of models. I haven't tried it in a dovetail jig because buying this router allowed me to dedicate the old one to that use, but it might be a solution for others.

The film is mostly about the relationships of the women, not the gay sons. It was confusing having so many similar-aged women, stories swapping back & forth, constantly having to identify which mother belongs to which son. The situations were far too ridiculous, without being funny. Three of the women are having sex with people that are extremely unlikely to happen in real life. Just not believable. The gay guys are portrayed as weak shells.Clearly this film concentrates on the mothers and could easily have been about straight children getting married. As a gay man, I feel insulted that the writers think writing the children as gay instantly makes the situation something to be laughed at.

I thought the plot was better developed than the others I have read in this serise (Books 2&3). It was amazing really, the plot kept thickening and thickening until I thought she would never be able to pull it out but she did manage remarkably. Only the fate of Jennifer's family was left out. I enjoyed the main love interests in this one as well. I do tend to go in for tortured lovers but they were really a solid pair. I thought that the superstions of Cornwall made a nice background to the story and were a pleasent change from her usual settings. This book also answerd some questions I had after a previous book.

I waited and waited and waited for the UPS man to drop this new floor mirror by my doorstep. That never happened. I then looked the crazy routing it went through, having never made it to my town or my doorstep, then promptly sent the seller a kind email, explaining the possible reason that it was sent everywhere but to my doorstep.

The diaries are a gem in themselves, displaying Babel's immediate response to the situation at hand, later to be transmuted by the writer's alchemy into the gold of the stories. It is a little slice of history in the raw, viewed through the eyes of a great writer, a writer who refused to conform to \\"socialist realism,\\" a writer who 20 years later would be executed by the State Security Apparatus of the USSR."},{"rating":"1","title":"surprisingly not very good, unlike previous four seasons","review":"I own the dvd sets for all five years of the Dead Zone, and I am a big fan. However, I was really disappointed with this set. First of all there are only 9 episodes (3 dvds x 3 episodes each) as compared to maybe 16 episodes in the other years. Second, is that the stories suddenly quote weak and far fetched. It seemed like the show got better and better from years 1-4. But then suddenly its not believable. Also, there must have been some contract dispute with Sarah Bannerman because she almost never appears in any of the episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Zone Season 5","review":"It's a lot like the other seasons, but with a darker plot and an even more unsure Johnny Smith.

The writing is so abysmal it's really quite funny, and ludicrous episodes like \\"Panic\\" (which make no sense whatsoever)kept us laughing for 30 minutes until we couldn't take it anymore and turned the DVD off. The Great Conspiracy Plot is a no-brainer and rather dull, the assassinations just plain silly. Who wrote these scripts??

If they aren't performing up to my standards, then I won't watch the program. I've always felt that the actors performances in this series was outstanding.

By the end of the books, the reader feels like a Ryan family member and a White House Staffer who bleeds Red, White, & Blue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ryan's Rise Up","review":"The two of these books show the steep political rise of Jack Ryan. Debt of Honor is a book about war with the Japanese due to a dispute of land. The book itself is fair, but it sets the scene for the second book, Executive Orders.

Like the other reviewer stated about FPS games the left 3 (the click down button on the analog) only works in the center, or may also work up or down, but moving from one to the other cancels out the function, which makes moving in some games a frustrating nightmare. Particuarly in FPS and games like Mech Assualt. It basically renders the controller useless. I almost didn't buy it, but the reviewer above stated it works great. Not... Other than that, if you don't need this controller to operate the way Microsoft intended, or if you don't need to use the left 3 button it's a solid, well built controller.

What a wonderful way to spend an hour, and remember what is was like when the milkman delivered to your door. Life today seems so fast paced and hectic that we've forgotten or never experienced life in at a slower, more trusting pace. If you want to see a slice of what life was like before WWII then take a look at this program.I think older Americans will feel a tinge of familiarity in this program and younger folks will get a window into the past lives of our older relatives.

She also has the Busy Buddies Football - another good sturdy toy that challenges her to earn her treats.My ACD uses the Chuckle like a hockey stick to bat her toys and balls around like they are hockey pucks. She uses it as a \\"pole vault\\" to raise her front legs off the floor. It occupies her for hours.The Chuckle and the Football both last for several months - which is highly unusual. Most toys I've gotten her last for 5 minutes. The noise maker in the stem of the Chuckle doesn't usually last long - but I'm not a fan of the squeaky noise anyway!

When cutting it down you can easily go from no food coming out to all the food falling out too easily. Obviously, there is no way you can then increase the length of the tines.

Her book is a close analysis of this struggle, spanning all of the early Middle Ages until 843. If your knowledge of the issue of iconoclasm is vague, then Judith Herrin's book is the one to buy. Her narrative is engaging, coherent, and thoughtful. It is a good synthesis of the developments of the Oecumenical Councils too.

That track is one of my favorite pieces of music ever. One comment on the orchestra that is playing it all: They are great. They play really clean, stay on the beat, and I am sure that they play the music just like Sir Malcolm Arnold intended it to sound. The London Symphony Orchestra is doing a great job on this Cd. This Cd rocks and well deserves five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Copyright Issues","review":"Tremendous music. But the glory of the Kwai music was the counterpoint of Colonel Bogey and Arnold's March. We are told on recordings like this, that because of copyright reasons, this arrangement can only be heard in the context of the original film.What kind of obstinate dog-in-the-manger philistine situation is this? Who is responsible? The Kenneth Alford estate? Whoever owns the film rights?Colonel Bogey should go into the public domain soon, so I hope we will then be able to hear Arnold's tremendous arrangement and blending of the two marches."},{"rating":"2","title":"hunsolo","review":"Assumes nothing-does the job nicely Aside from the title(You could wrap it in brown paper): This book assumes nothing about the readers knowledge.

Even with very careful use, the outer cord covering detached and opened up where it entered the plug that attaches to the iPod.My iPod Nano battery seemed to loose capacity too quickly and died about the same time the charger's cord split. I did not frequently top-off the Nano's battery, but followed the recommended protocol of charging only when the battery was fairly low. Total life span of the Nano's battery was under 15 months, and it was not used heavily. I suspect, but do not know, that this rather short battery life might have something to do with a charging voltage that is a bit too high. This charger is probably best suited as a secondary charger for occasional use.I suspect that Apple chargers do a better job of maximizing the life of the very expensive iPod batteries.

Also the Niji brush screws on in the standard righty tighty way unlike the Sakura brush which is reversed. Also the Niji brushes have a flat brush option. It is very convenient while painting to be able to just squeeze the brush to add some water and thin out the paint well you work.

It's low budget shows but they make the most of the European locations and Ken Clark (Dick Malloy) is a very active performer in the fight scenes and other action. This film is the first of a trilogy featuring this character and, although I haven't seen the other two films, I understand they improve as they progress. I admit I have a weakness for this film as I remember seeing it as a kid and when the chance came to see it again, I was smitten with nostalgia. Anyway, the DVD is reasonably clear although it's low on extra features. For fans of the genre, this is a good addition to the DVD shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Zoom!","review":"Great Zoom Binoculars for the money.

For one, the book is 109 pages with 16 full pages of pictures for a price of $15. Second, the man acts as if taking care of your family is the most important thing in the world, yet he abused his wife, he wouldn't get a job to take care of their bills, he specifically talks about how to \\"manipulate the system\\", by using students loans to purchase a Land Cruiser, jewelry, and electronics. Finally, his boasting takes on a ridiculous level when he talks of being one second off the World Record time as a freshman in high school in the 400. Oh, did I mention R.Kelly was watching from the stands! I believe that DCFS is a flawed system, but does the best it can with what it's given.

It worked great for that purpose with a bit of eyestrain on my part but that's understandable. It will likely end up in my kid's room in the very near future.The reception and image on this TV is excellent. Heck, it doesn't get much better. I had digital TV in my small apartment and this LCD provided an awesome picture. It even doubles as a computer monitor or is great for game platforms for which it is currently being used in my home.I would highly recomment this unit if you have small space and need a TV or want to put this in a child's room or a kitchen.

This product was for people who have never seen a salsa move in their lives. There was hardly any music backround, which i find helps to learn steps. The DVD is just a variety of steps, shown once or twice and then they move on. It was poorly done, and memorizing all the steps they showed, is imposssible with the combinations (like 3 steps in 3 different combos) that they show in the end. This was a very poor buy, I know basic salsa, and I was very disappointed with this tape. I learned nothing, and I have learned more from watching free videos on youtube.

The consensus of instructors who knew and worked with Pascucci is that there are three types of information in this book, \\"Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics.\\" While I found many lies and damn lies, the only statistic I can verify in the book is that Pascucci was a Deputy U.S. Marshal, and that may even be questionable. This book IS NOT an accurate representation of the U.S. Marshals Service"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pascucci's picture is beside \\"egomaniac\\" in the dictionary","review":"Pascucci was a pompous egomaniac who lived in a fantasy world. He was summarily fired from the Marshals Service after being convicted of using the U.S. mails to try to extort money from a married businessman he had videotaped having sex with his (Pascucci's) girlfriend. He served time in the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and is now a convicted felon. That he attained such postion within the Service remains an embarrassment to Deputy U.S. Marshals everywhere.His book is his own weird view of his significance to the cases he discusses, and much of it is unabashed lies.

Restaurants that were one fork ended up being the most expensive (and in most cases had the worst food for the price). Some restaurants listed were not even there.-At least one \\"typical dish\\" called Rondon that was listed in the book was not known by any locals.-Maps were inaccurate.

They are good for games and movies, but not so much for music (unless you have an equalizer, such as that on WMP9). The X-220 is brighter, and I love the sound balance.They have two minor problems, though. The satellites have a slight hissing noise that you I noticed when I turned my PC off. Since I put it in my bed room, I cant just leave it on like I do my Z-340. The sub woofer has a magnetic shielding issue. It affected my monitor a bit when I put them too close together.

I would have been more disappointed had I paid full price. The knife blade and the scissors were very dull. The knife blade appears to be too soft to be used as a cutting tool. It won't hold an edge. The mis-alignment of the scissor blades prevents them from making a clean cut. The flashlight that came with it had switch problems out of the box and spontaneously came open (unscrewed) in my pocket. <br /><br /><br />The Phillips screwdriver is very good and the pliers are fair. I bought this to replace a small Swiss Army knife that I lost. I'm going to get another. The $10 Swiss Army knife (Victorinox) does fewer things, but the blade and the scissors hold an edge and cut very well.

After I pasted it on, it is very good.

Nevertheless, this is still a supreme work, Prokofiev at his most bombastic.The excerpts from The Stone Flower are somewhat superfluous, and with the exception of the Ural Rhapsody I wonder why they chose this segment of the ballet.

Articles & letters about teen pregnancy, being sexually active, Dad/Mom is having an affair--the list goes on. If it was just one article I would have ripped the pages out, but that wasn't the case. My opinion is that this magazine is completely inappropriate for any pre-teen, and depending on your own daughter, 14 or 15 may still be the wrong age group.

The editor's note is usually funny and nice, but this time, she was saying how all other magazines are bad, and that they are the only ones who care about you. Whatever!

It's got all the fashion, make-up, and boy stuff like all the other teen magazines, but it also features stories that are really important and relative to our daily lives. Some of the issues have been obesity in teens, anorexia, and dealing with your period. The only problem I have with it is that the clothes and make-up they feature are usually quite expensive and have to be bought at a website or ordered over the phone instead of just being able to walk over to the drug store.

I thought maybe this issue was a fluke so when the next one came I did the same thing. I had to confiscate that one as well, and every one that has come since then. I am saving them all and when she gets older I will give them to her, maybe. She is now 12 but I would still not let her read this garbage. So many of the q and a's are girls desperatly wanting attention from boys, and asking how they can get it. And the answers...

True, some parts of the article could've been done without, but in general, it was a well thought out article worth reading. After that issue, however, Girls Life went downhill from being focused on friendship to being boy, fashion, and beauty oriented.

There is also a letter from Karen(an employee) in every issue. Also there are stories from girls, topics about how girls feel about things like cursing. Also another one of my favorite parts of this magizine is how they have at least 5 contests in an issue. There are writing contests and raffles.

That comes much later.Girls who act so mature, kissing and dating boys when they are so young, are doomed to a life of divorce and unhappiness. THey will think that every cute guy who comes along actually cares about them. Girls that age have more important things to worry about than catching a cute guy. I am very disappointed...I thought this magazine would deal with issues such as grades, building better relationships with your parents, dealing with your raging emotions. But GL is all about cute styles, bikini-worthy bodies, little blonde girls, and boys. Yuck.That said, it does have some cute quizzes. But again, totally useless entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good.... only way too much stuff on getting guys!","review":"I'm (...)and I have been reading GL for a couple months now and I love it!

We will not be purchasing this magazine again nor recommending to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone Downhill","review":"I got this magazine for 4 years. I agree with others reviewers when I say that with every issue this magazine just goes downhill. I stopped my subscription last year.

Don't waste your money on this magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much information for a 9 to 12 year old!","review":"This magazine is is too old for my nine year old. One of the articles discuss Breast enhancing cream. I do not want my daughter obsessing about her breast size at this age. Theres too much pressure on young girls as it is about how they look.

First of all, an article on how to be an amazing kisser?! Excuse me? If this is a magazine geared for girls around 11-15, why should they even put that in a GIRL'S LIFE magazine? All the girls my age that I know have never had a real kiss in their life. No, I don't have stupid or unpopular friends (not that it really matters), I have NORMAL friends. And second...the GL Cuties? What the heck is that about? Every single boy I see in this magazine is just about the stupidest, geekiest guy I have ever seen in my life. Overall, don't waste your money on this piece of mindless wannabe crap.

My daughter told me about those girls that spoke up, that actually got in the magazine, I felt sorry for a moment but then I realized that they had a good point!

Just to let parents know, even though I subscribed to the magazine at eleven doesn't necessarily mean it's made for that age group. In fact, I found crude language, older fashions and relationship advice in it. Still, I never told my mother because I wanted to continue subscribing. The good part is, if you have an older daughter around 13 and up, I recommend this magazine to you. It's great with the makeup tips and life advice. It also has true life articles that I find inpsiring.

This magazine is not geared for 10-12 year olds like the magazine claims, more for young women in their teens. It's just a normal, old fashioned teen magazine like Seventeen and CosmoGirl!.

Maybe you should have read these reviews if you are that cautious about magazines. I have been reading girlslife for over two years now, and I love it. I'm 15 year old Christian girl and like most of my friends and people at my school, I can relate to what they talk about. The magazine DOES talk about fashion and boys (because many teens are ontrested in those sorts of things) but also crafts, books, movies, sports, workouts, conquering jealousy, funny stories, and more. Should you buy this for your ten year old? Probably not. I'd suggest grades 7 and up. If you want a \\"tamer\\" version of Seventeen I would recommend this magazine.

This is the first one I've read, and it was pretty enjoyable.Except...it seemed to me that Francesca's first experience with Gabriel was forced. I enjoy power plays between men and women, but this appeared to me a throwback to the old 'rape me and I'll love you forever' scenarios so prevalent in the early 80's.Francesca was a character I liked, though I wish she'd a bit more spirit where Gabriel was concerned.Gabriel wasn't too far from the typical romantic hero trope, but he was likeable just the same. His concern for his twin Lucian was believable.Basically, the Carpathian males are just the way romance readers for the most part like their men--strong, silent and protective."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-nightrer despite the familiar plot","review":"I have read the whole dark series by Ms. Feehan and although I must admit that the characters and story line areall somewhat similar, I still couldn't put the book down. Mainly because it's such a great twist on the concept of vampires and the deep emotional response her books evokes on readers. I really can't wait to read about Lucien's story. If there's one thing I would like to see on the next book, it's for the female character to be a bit more easy-going rather than the standard \\"strong/stubborn/unbending yet vulnerable/weak\\" type.

It was supposed to take place in France, though you'd think they were in Ohio for all the description given...none. The \\"hero\\" was so one dimensional it was painful. The heroine could have been interesting if she wasn't such a wimp. The teenage girl is an almost interesting addition to the non-existant plot, but even her storyline was made childish by the amount of unrealistic coddling and her wimpiness. A girl who has been through that much is NOT that wimpy, or she wouldn't still be alive.

It's not. Big tough he-man sees girl, takes her against her will and forces her to be his regardless of what she wants (and it's for her own good. Thanks, Dad). Same old bodice-ripping garbage that I thought this genre had shed.Repitious writing and escalating violence make this book hard to endure. The rules of the world are ever changing (meaning the writer needs to to start writing down what she tells us because in every book she seems to forget what laws she made about her world in the previous book) while the characters are not. Same hero, same heroine + graphic violence + no setting = BORING BOOK. As for the surprise ending? So lame, I'm still in recovery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh..","review":"I am a fan of most vampire and paranormal fiction but this is the first time I have read anything by Christine Feehan.

However she is almost as weak as a kitten, and she walks in day light.So...Feehan broke all her rules in order to make Francesca fit into her trademark heroine mould of a independant and strong woman who is then reduced to a defiantly, pitiful creature by the Carpathian male.NEXT...it makes no sense that Gabriel didn't know his lifemate when she was near. Hello?? All her other books are based on them knowing right away.It is also the same repititive descriptions that don't differ from book to book. Her books are less about the romance of the characters (except in the very beginning of every book) and more about the man protecting his helpless female who constantly gets into trouble because she won't accept his control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can she not write any faster","review":"I cannot get enough of this author and this series, as soon as you read one novel, you immediately want more.

Readers are in for quite a ride as Gabriel hunts his beloved twin and try to convince Francesca, his life mate, that she should take a chance on him. Twist and turns abound as Ms. Feehan spins yet another unforgettable tale in her continuing saga of these masters of the dark, and the extraordinary women who give them back their light.

It was TORTURE to get through. When I'm in the mood for a happy little vampire romance, I pick up one of Feehan's books; but this book was excrutiating! It went on forever. I'm serious -- about 60% of this book was one of the 2 main characters professing their undying love, admiration, lust, or tormented desire for the other. The plot sounded like something someone came up with in about 5 minutes -- \\"Quick -- in 5 minutes or less come up with a plot!\\" It was stupid and made ZERO sense. The sad part was it started out with promise -- that was probably the one and only thing that drove me to finish this book.

I loved PHAEDRA then, and love it now.But more enticing than the erotisim Is the psychological interplay of the characters. I went from being a virgin teen to a seasoned psychiatrist during the interim 50 years since first seeing this film. The film is psychologically dead on (no pun intended).

The Logitech looked similar, and had the same basic functions - even tho I didn't like the button under the thumb grip ... but it started to input a slight right turn (X-axis) on its own after a week or two. I tried setting a dead zone but that didn't work, and I resorted to decreasing axis sensitivity within the game.

You may need to clean the gunk 'round the buttons from dirt, grime, or dust ever-so-often but so far it hasn't given me any trouble.

As soon as the joystick arrived I installed the CD that came with it, plugged the joystick into the USB and it was ready to go. The joystick has a nice sturdy base so your not sliding around on your desk and the controls are nice and smooth. When playing BFBC2 I had to set the keys for the joystick myself, which I was worried about at first, but it turned out to be a lot easier than it seemed.

Then it had interfacing problems that required me to disconnect and reconect it numerous times while starting and exiting the game I was trying to play so that the throttle would work properly, it wouldn't go in reverse. Lastly, which made the controller unplayable, the downward drift exceeds the upward pull, so you can pull it all the way back and still be looking at your boots.

I then went to the Logitech website, installed the latest drivers, and downloaded their pre-configured game maps. I still got the same errors. It had this mistake on over 5 games, both old and new. I even tried it on 2 different computers with no luck.It's a shame it has this fatal flaw because otherwise it was very decent for a cheap joystick. When I asked for help from Logitech, they kept telling me to \\"download the latest drivers\\" over and over, which I had already done.I must give it 1 star because I used it primarily for flight/space sims.

No drivers to install, no need to even bother with the included CD.* Throttle control is very smooth and precise.* Pitch, roll, and yaw (rudder) are also very smooth with great feel. This is not a sloppy flight stick in any way.* All the buttons are well-positioned, assuming you are right-handed. The buttons on the base are extremely handy in a flight sim, for setting things like rudder trim, or for toggling various features on your aircraft.I got this stick primarily for use with the X-Plane flight simulator, and it works extremely well. The base is very stable when used on a desk or lap, and the joystick as a whole has a solid, smooth feel.

For about 5 weeks it performed as advertised, and then both the x (roll) and z (yaw) axes started to register only 20% of control input in the 'right' direction. Attempts to recalibrate using Logitechs DXtweak utility restored the input range, but left these axes extremely spiky/twitchy, and hence useless for piloting where it matters (landings, and when he's in your crosshairs).The ergonomics are nice, but from my experience, its poorly engineered, and doesn't withstand normal use. I've since replaced it with a Saitek Cyborg Evo, which is more comfortable, responds MUCH more smoothly than the Logitech did out of the box, but has awkward throttle and joystick base button placements. Nonetheless, I wish I got it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Lifespan","review":"Buy a Saitek.

With stick at dead center, no twist, plane on runway wants to steer hard right. As with 2. above, no way to calibrate so that no twist is straight ahead.3.

I tried several things and the only thing that seems to work is if you unplug it and plug it back into the USB port several times, then you might get it to work properly.Even then it can lose calibration in the middle of a game.Not recommended at all.Do a google search for Extreme 3D Pro problems and you will find forums that discuss this same issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good joystick, but some skip after a few months","review":"I have an older one from three years ago. It is strong and works good.But, I did have some trouble. Apperantly because the potentiometer's lube got dry. I got some tuner cleaner spray and sprayed the sensor pots, from the wire ends, and it seemed to fix it. I did have to take it apart and put it back together, though.It is likely that the newer units have better lube.Note that these joysticks self-calibrate when Windows is started. So, if you have your computer on all day, re-start Windows before starting the game. Otherwise, it might be drifty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loses Calibration about every 2 min","review":"I will admit I am tough on Joysticks. I picked this up about a year ago and I have just ended up trashing it because it has gotten worse and worse with keeping calibration. I have even noticed that when setting the calibration in Windows the stick no longer does full movements all around the box and the Twist axis also will not max out to both sides. I also HATE the throttle control on this thing. I have had more problems trying to keep the throttle perfectly centered so I am not moving planes, Choppers, and vehicles in forward or backward direction. If you are like me and tend to max out the different axis on you joysticks and tend to push a little harder than normal this stick will drive you nuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good","review":"An exceptional feel for a cheap stick, very stiff very precise.Im playing IL-2 Forgotton Battles and the precise aiming is a terror.(i am replacing a MS sidewinder precision pro 2)and this stick is far superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful product and seller.","review":"This joystick looks like a work of art and feels like one, too ... and as online merchants go, Amazon can rarely be topped in any category.Always pleased, and thanks from a most satisfied customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this controller","review":"No complaints about this joystick for Battlefield 2.

After all, this is a pretty darn good collection from a guy who writes & performs a romantic country ballad as well as anyone. Practically every obvious choice is here, as well as a couple of great inclusions that weren't so obvious. Like \\"When Something Is Wrong with My Baby\\", Travis's duet with Patti LaBelle from the RHYTHM COUNTRY & BLUES collection. He dusts off an oldie & turns in a definitive version of \\"Only You\\". All of his romantic radio hits are here, as well as some album tracks that are equally as good as the hits. In fact, there are so many great songs here that it hardly seems worth quibbling over one tune. Still, I find it hard to imagine they could have omitted \\"Worth Every Mile\\". A great ballad & an obvious choice given the theme. But if romantic ballads are your thing, you won't find anything wrong with this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"original approach","review":"How happy I was to get a new perspective on the gifted parenting issue. Instead of a book merely listing the characteristics of gifted kids and the problems they face, this offered some new points. The included \\"Gifted Children Speak Out\\" section at the end of every chapter was very insightful and put everything I was reading in perspective; all the advice in the world can't substitute for honest feelings given directly from the children themselves. I also really enjoyed the chapter on giftedness in adults. It was helpful both as a way for the reader to reflect on and remember his or her own gifted childhood, and as a reminder that our children are going to grow up, with characteristics that continue to affect them in adult life. Finally, the resource section at the back was full of schools, journals, web sites and other places to find additional information and support.

I guess the textbooks don't lay out every detail step by step--students need to take a certain amount of initiative for the learning process (like reviewing vocabulary on thier own time, participating in group work, and so on). These might not be the most appropriate textbooks for independent study though since a lot of the material is based on group activities, in class listening and videos, etc. Also, the guidance of a teacher (preferably a good one) goes a long way when attempting to create an excellent or great learning experience while using a good or even great textbook.

I found that although it was adequate, it went at a pretty slow pace.

There were a good amount of nouns (although not as many verbs), and they were grouped somewhat coherently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor","review":"I found this book to be very poor in the teaching of Spanish. Most of the teaching relied upon vague references and much guess work. Many key areas of the spanish language were very briefly covered and had little to no explanation for the usage of words. Most of the teaching was with examples that didn't seem to follow any rules. Ultimately, I disliked this manual and the course using it. The ONE good thing about it is it teaches numbers very well and basic greatings. However, I wouldn't expect anyone using this book to ever learn how to converse in long conversations. Ultimately, if it wasn't for a few saving factors, this would be at the bottom of the barrel.- Travis"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Organized","review":"As a student, this textbook was really difficult for me to learn from.

It has now become one of my favorite recordings. While the symphony was more a work by Taneyev and Bogatryrev than by its originator, it does sound very Tchaikovskian, with overtones of the 5th, 6th, and Manfred Symphonies. I agree that the use of a snare drum late in the closing movement sounds a bit odd, but I still like the work. Jarvi's tempi are not always perfect, being sometimes too fast or slow, but the orchestra plays well and the recording quality is very good. Having the related piano concerto on the same disc invites comparison, and Tozer plays well.

Sometimes they perform their roles with some feeling, but this is usually in the style of the original cast. The original cast album serves as the basis of this album. The singers are just dubbed over the original, while playing to a kareoke style track. The instrumentation does not match the original, synthetic instruments are used, and piano is very prominent. You can frequently hear the original cast member singing underneath the new singer. For example in 'Springtime' when the orchestra is added back in after the Judy Garland segment you can hear Bart singing his lines.

Just know that if you don't have HD cable or satellite, it isn't going to look much different from your old set (aside from the aspect ratio). Still, we all know that soon all TV will be in high definition, and regular non-HD TVs will be irrelevent. This is a good transition TV because it will keep up with technology, and it won't cost that much more than a regular TV (at least on amazon.com). I give it 5 stars not because it is the best HDTV, but because for what it is, a low-priced transition TV, it is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsolete text -- don't waste your time","review":"Once upon a time this book may have been useful, but now this text is more than 20 years old and badly in need of a revision.

China is a country that is changing rapidly as a result of these changes the book contains a lot of inaccuracies. For instance, the Kunming-Dali and Kunming-Lijiang travel times mentioned in the book have been cut in half because a highway has been built since publication and has been operational for a couple of years!This is not a good book to use for planning your trip.

The winner, the powerful, and the wealthy usually write the history.

As a reader, you must understand the history and the context in which it was written, in order for you to comprehend the dangers of the present and to predict the urgency of the future.The tragedy in this book is in the Narcissism of Quigley and his oligarchy, and the vanishing hope is in the faith and the hands of the determined and decent people............"},{"rating":"2","title":"High level historical \\"WikiLeaks\\" on the Ruling Class","review":"Lengthy (1300 pages).

I'm going beyond the obvious--the fact that both characters live on boats and do \\"favors\\" for friends. Specifically, I'm drawn to Knief's combination of action and introspection, so typical of John D. MacDonald. An illustration can be found early in the first Caine book, Diamond Head, when the older Caine must defend himself against two young attackers. Caine carries the day, but he gives close examination to his reactions and to his motives, once the dust clears. This is typical McGee. And this is the thread which runs through all 3 Caine books.

Maybe the author should go back and spend some more time talking to those guys. I'll never buy another one of this guy's books. Comparing Caine to Travis McGee probably has John D.

I'm not at all sure how I managed to finish it, in that it seemed terrible in every possible way: I found the characters artificial and a lot of their actions and dialogue terribly contrived. For example, what sysadmin would allow an unknown computer to freely interface with her system, which is the main computer controlling all aspects of a space station? At several points the characters seemed to be simply giving speeches of the author's own views.

The main \\"plot\\" of the book was only indirectly dealt with by any of the main charecters.

After about 1/2 an hour of reading through it I was done for good; whereas with the other books every time I open them I see something new that I didn't notice before. I was extremely disappointed with this book. I would not recommend it to anyone. And it shouldn't be called an \\"encyclopedia\\"-it only explains the MOST BASIC of scrapbooking techniques. I mean, it takes 4 pages just to show you how to tear paper!!! PLEASE don't waist your money on this-instead, try some of the other \\"Creating Keepsakes\\" books. This one is the worst of the bunch.

False assumptions(Sunnism is devoid of warmth, women's emancipation means \\"emancipating\\" them from the Sharia(Divine Law)run throughout this book.Love and emotional feeling for Allah and the Prophet(saws)are at the root of Sharia:this is what compells people to submit their wills to Allah.The only way women's due rights(the ones in Qu'ran and Hadith) can be guranteed is through Allah's Law(Sharia). Interesting information that this book gives us on recent and previous \\" Islamic Fundamentalist\\" governments and groups is the highlight of this book.

This is the only Rollins book I have read to date, so maybe I am putting unfair judgment upon his writing, but I was not able to develop a bond with any of the characters or really get into the story. While the story itself was intriguing, some of the other plot points I found to be too \\"out there\\" compared to the rest of the book. I can believe in a lost, sunken city that existed thousands of years ago and I can believe many of the other archeological aspects, but the turning back time thing didn't sit well in my stomach. But if you're bored on a Saturday, it's an easy read for a day. If you like this book, then you'll love Clive Cussler. He writes along the same level, but with a more realistic and historical appeal, plus his characters are more appealing and you become attached to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rollins is on a Roll","review":"Having read Rollins other books, with their alternate realities, I was eager to read this one. I was not disappointed. The plot is straight forward and the action fast-paced. The characters are standard without too much depth to them but enjoyable.The use of disparate bits of info, like rongorongo, a real undecipherable language found in Micronesia, the Devel Sea, a region of the pacific similar to the Bermuda Triangle and the mysterious megalithic buildings scattered throughout Micronesia and the legend of MU is interesting. Rollins weaves them together into an very enjoyable, entertaining book.But why does every modern hero have to be a ex-Seal? Why not Marine Recon or Ranger, both of whom have beat Seals in Armed Forces competition. But, since I am former Marine Recon, I'm biased.Anyway, get the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"I love reading James Rollins books and this one was great.

They were still fun and like a Clive Cussler novel, you didn't mind how improbable the story was because it was well written. But when you read a novel that has you laughing at the incredulous plot, TV-Movie-Of-The-Week characters, villians derived from saturday morning cartoons, and then told at the end that everything is fine folks because we went through this time warp, (hey, how about the 'It's only a dream' storyline instead) something is wrong. Other Amazon.com reviewers have summarized the plot here already so I will not repeat it. I'd just like to say that Mr Rollins has done better and I hope will make up for this very bad book with future efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Dreck.","review":"Unlike most, I found Excavation to be much better than Deep Fathom. Rollins' strengths are in plot twists, engaging premises, and strong, stock characters. Unfortunately, he leaves all of this on the surface for Deep Fathom.In all honesty, I did not finish the book. I couldn't. It was simply too awful. Too many details rang untrue. Many of the stories premises were beyond the scope of believability. The characters were uninteresting, and the tensions between the characters was simply laughable. You can enjoy a book for what it is, but only if it is true to itself. This book came up empty on all counts.I have no problem with suspending disbelief. However, a book of this caliber has me running, not walking, back to better crafted novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Fathom Deep Adventure","review":"Jack Kirkland, an ex-Navy seal, ex-astronaut with a guilt laden past is now the owner of a deep sea salvage ship Deep Fathom. Returning from a failed dive on a wreck, he surfaces to find the Earth burning and totally annihilation just over the horizon. In his attempts to find a solution to the imminent catastrophe, Kirkland finds himself immersed in an adventure that takes him and the reader on a most thrilling ride. Rollins again manages to present a mixture of political intrigue, mythology, linguistics, quantum physics, and ancient religion to bring about the story's denouement. A highly recommended read for anyone enjoying a good novel, and especially Rollins fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good read","review":"I enjoy Rollin's books and this one was just as good as his last one. Rollin's likes the 'impossible' scenarios, but the hero always triumphs in the end.

Kind of a Dirk Pitt, Indiana Jones, with a sci-fi twist"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much make believe","review":"This is the second book of Rollins that I have read, I was hoping that it would be better then the first one, \\"Amazonia\\". I was wrong, follows same style, too much science fiction. The books are well written, and have some interesting parts that keep you interested, but the story line just gets too sci fi for my taste. I was given multiple Rollins books for Christmas, hopefully one will be a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously...buy something else.","review":"This is one of those books that actually inspires me to write a book of my own sometime. I have no formal training as a writer, but I know I could do better than this one.Other 1 star raters have mentioned to lack of character development, poor plot and other problems and I have to agree. When your main character thinks that all his friends and life posessions are gone and that deeply affects him for about 12 hours, after which he's just dandy again, you have a big problem- just to name one big problem.I'd write more, but I'm going to get my manuscript off to Harper/Collins."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fairy tale","review":"Definitively this book is a very bad fairy tale. For instance: The prologue has three chapters and the only one that matters is the Air Force One's chapter. So you can skip the other two chapters as well as the epilogue.Once you just skip those three chapters, the book goes fast paced until the persecutions began. How many persecutions can you read in a book? So to keep this review short. After the third persecution you'll start to bore of reading.But the book's finish is utterly preposterous. I don't know if there is or not a lost world -myself wrote a book about that- but traveling in time is just distraught."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT book. . .","review":"This is the first Rollins book I've read.

I kick myself for not just giving up on it, this is not a book thatflows at all, it is like riding a wooden roller coaster up the clanky track! I prefer my books to be like theride down, smooth with well executed turns and surprises. This was not. There are many other booksout there, take a pass on this one. Two on my reading list; The Breach by Patrick Lee, and BeneathDark Ice by Greig Beck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great adventure from Rollins","review":"This is another great adventure from James Rollins, who's the Jules Verne of our days. Full of action, it is a non-stop, chapter after a chapter adventure tale. Natural catastrophes occur one after another, bringing the world on a brink of destruction and nuclear threat. The secret lies at the deep bottom of the ocean, left by ancient civilization and if it isn't solved, world will cease to exist. Very well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising start-ridiculous finish.","review":"I picked this book out of desperation for something to entertain me while on vacation. The book did not grab my attention at first, but at least the premise sounded plausible. However, as the plot unfolded, it grew more outlandish by the page. Mr. Rollins clearly does not have a good grasp of technology and science and therefore should refrain from writing about those topics. He is no Michael Crichton. He falls back on the lazy plot device of a supercomputer with artificial intelligence to fill gaps in his story. It is so convenient to ask the computer to do any task or find any information much like snapping your fingers or rubbing Aladdin's lamp. The climax was just plain dumb and made me angry. Skip this stinker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"James just keeps the good reads a coming.

This was the first book I bought by James Rollins. I have to admit that it was the cover that drew me in and the fact that the story takes place primarily in and on the ocean. But as I started to read I found myself engrossed in both the story and the characters! Well paced and beyond enjoyable! This book hooked me on the rest and I always look forward to something new, be it in the Sigma series or a simple stand-alone novel. Thank you Mr. Rollins for something so entertaining!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep Fathom","review":"I am a huge fan of James Rollins, however I couldn't get into this book after reading about a third of the book I just put it down and went on to the next book. This is not the norm for me and Mr. Rollins' books. I've loved them all, and look forward to the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent novel by Mr. Rollins","review":"While similar in nature to his two previous novels (Subterranean and Excavation), Deep Fathom is still an easy and entertaining read. While all his novels require the reader to suspend some belief, he does provide ample reasoning to support the events occurring. I won't go into details to avoid spoiling any of the plot for future readers.All his books have a little Cussler (adventure), Ludlum (espionage) and James Bond (hero avoids being killed). Of his three books published in paperback, this one is the best of the three. All grip the reader from the start (eclipse, earthquakes, etc. in this one) and don't let go until the end. The major knock on this one, and a reason I gave it four stars instead of five, was the somewhat \\"hokey\\" resolution at the end/prologue. Aside from that, this is a excellent novel to fill some hours of reading time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proud to be Italian","review":"So much of this book helped me to understand my family.

Immediately after setting up the thing on my speedlight, I was already expecting the worse. I had to boost up my speedlight a couple of notches stronger and I got some really bad looking shots. Thank goodness I shot in RAW because what turned out to be \\"okay\\" soft light from this getup, turned out to give me some really ugly lighting resulting in some really bad shots.

This harness is velcro and is VERY easy to put on. I was a little skeptical at first of the hold so I lifted her up by the connector part and the velcro held up. I was a little disappointed as she wears XS in everything, all harnesses, collars, shirts, etc. This XS was too big. I had to pull the velcro tight which left excess velcro hanging. It's not a big deal, I just added extra velcro to the ends. That is the only reason I only rated it 5 stars. It is very cute and functional! I would reccomend to anyone. BTW my chihuahua is 5 lbs and the XS was too big for her in case you wanted to use that as a guage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Cute!!","review":"First thing though. These run big.

Among other things, the book is badly written as the author repeatedly goes off on tangents; One moment we're with Bob on Broadway, and then we're suddenly on the set of one of the \\"Road\\" pictures. Quirk seems to have an agenda with regard to sexual interests, suggesting that many stars thought to be completely heterosexual were, perhaps, not. However, these claims are attributed to no one and seem to be tossed in on a whim. A badly edited book (typos and contradictions about) I can think of nothing to recommend The Road Well-Traveled. I await the publication of a definitive Hope bio. I suspect that will come following the passing of the legendary comedian"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Quirk work for the Enquirer?","review":"Like many I am happy Mr. Hope made it to 100. Like many, I grew up watching his specials - like many I wanted to read more about this man. My mistake was getting this book. Naturally, it does cover his career; albeit, I think Mr. Quirk really couldn't find any true \\"dirt\\" so he implies alot. I think Mr. Quirk is more hung up on the homosexuals of the industry and how hard they had it that he makes out Mr. Hope to be some homophobe. Not a very good read, not really enjoyable. I do not find that I am a fan of Mr. Quirk's \\"writing\\" style. In all fairness he does make some interesting points, but they are not worth the read in what could have been a potentially good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"If you want to read a really good biography on Bob Hope, read 'A Life In Comedy' by William Faith.

Quirk seems to have choosen a star who was connected to many people and then dug up every piece of gossip possible on them. The book has all of the bad things about Hope, the people surrounding Hope and the way Hope lived his life. Nothing is less satisfying than spending your money on a biography and getting a gossip column about stars and producers sexual preferences, which is probably the things most promintently described throughout the whole book. If you want to get the real, true biography about Bob Hope, by the A&E video biography, legions better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific,, Insightful, Juicy","review":"Don't pay attention to the other reviews; this is a really great read. Quirk is very knowledgable about Hollywood and the performers of the period. I found his asides about the foibles, both sexual and otherwise, of the secondary subjects of the book refreshingly honest and highly amusing. Like who else is going to tell you about such supporting player prissies as Edward Everett Horton, Franklin Pangborn and Eric Blore? \\"All gay as bitchwolves\\" to quote arch bitchwolf George Cukor.If you're looking for some tedious, warts removed biography of Bob Hope then the book may not be for you. This is a straightforward and deliciously rowdy look at Hope, his mileau and many of the other clayfooted \\"icons\\" of twentieth century entertainment.

I recently used an Astro Pneumatic 5820 Engine Support, which was a huge mistake. The base of the AP5820 was slightly rounded and spiral-wrapped with cheesy nylon, to keep it from slipping. All of this made it somewhat unstable. New rubber feet had to be fashioned. Additionally, the cables provided were way too long to be useful. They had to be considerably shortened and re-looped, using a Fastenal 43383, 1/8\\" x 5/8\\", Aluminum Hour Glass Swage Sleeve. It takes a swage tool to properly crimp the sleeve--such a pain. A chain would have been so much better. To make matters worse, the middle support arm was shaky and had to be reinforced. Needless to say, this is not a professional piece of equipment, in my opinion. I realize not many people change their own clutches--this may help someone, however, avoid making a mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Tool for great price","review":"I bought the tool when I was rebuilding the transmission in my Escort. The tool worked well for holding the little 4 cylinder in place during transmission R&I.; It comes with some cables to hold the engine to the support that were way too long to be of any use in this application. I just needed a short length of chain to attach the lift hook to the engine.I would have given this product 5 stars if it had come with some short lengths of chain and a small assortment of bolts/washers to attach it to the engine.

This is a great story of the bravery, spirit, and ultimate sacrifices of some members of our parents' generation. The crew who crashed in Antarctica in 1947 were there, not for the commercial endorsements or riches, but like Sir Edmund Hillary at Everest, because it was there. Their lack of knowledge of what they were getting into was amazing in today's context but that some survived at all was ultimately inspiring. This is a good story well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting narratives about fathers and sons","review":"If you are a student of history, or you are into family dynamics, or you just like a compelling story, this excellent read is for you. The author interviewed father and son pairs who are World War 2 and Vietnam War vets about their lives and experiences. These stories are riveting and moving, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes horrifying but always vividly descriptive. If you were alive during these wars, or if you weren't, you will also get a thoughtful historical perspective from the narratives and from Takiff's excellent commentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a celebration of our troops","review":"I read this book with great interest, having just finished Mike Jackson's exciting and inspirational Naked In Da Nang. This book also features Lt. Col. Jackson's story as well as his father's (Edmund Jackson served in World War II, hence the father/son connection). But I was terribly disppointed. Brave Men is disjointed and awkward and it seems to play to those who want to believe that veterans are semi-dysfunctional, given the horrific acts they experienced. Instead of humanizing our fighting men, Mr. Takiff's book seems hell-bent on showing only the grim and disturbing side of military service. While Jackson's book doesn't sugarcoat the realities of war, it maintains a very optimistic stance -- one that leaves the reader proud of our men in uniform, not concerned about sitting next to them on a bus!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A useful, insightful book on the wisdom of the body-mind.","review":"Mr. Heckler clearly and precisely summarizes 5 steps of growth and change.

The late Bryden Thomson did neither, and the result is one of the most clear-eyed, tough-minded, and convincing VW cycles available--comparable to Adrian Boult's almost-complete 1950s series. Paradoxically, that sharp focus actually heightens the sense of mystery in passages such as the opening movement of the Eighth Symphony and the enigmatic final pages of the Sixth. Only \\"A Sea Symphony\\" is less than a total success, and even there the expansive final movement impresses. This 5-CD set omits the shorter works that served as makeweights in the individual issues, but Chandos has reissued some of those recordings elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got bad discs - TWICE!","review":"I've bought this complete set twice and BOTH TIMES there were discs that skipped or would not play through.

This book begins by working on listening and developing an ear for tonality and jazz phrasing. This is a feature I have not found in other tutors, and I think it works very well. Another feature is a homework section where the student is encouraged to work with others in the call and response process - again this is a feature missing in many other texts. The lessons are parsed out so that one can learn something well before going on, and the CD backing tracks are at a reasonable tempo for the beginning learner.While there should be other books in a learner's tool bag, I give Laporta's high marks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A","review":"I was not entirely familiar with the historical, musical and religious connection of these Judaic love songs. Nor was I familiar with the singer Shirona. But I was absolutely astounded by the beauty of this CD. Every song is a gem and Shirona certainly has the ability to deliver them so they all are like some classic art songs. To me, this is a very rare experience to respond to an unfamiliar music idiom so strongly and so wholeheartedly. This seems to be Shirona's only album. I'd hope she will release more soon and I will not hesitate to purchase everyone even if they are only half as good as this one.

It did not last through the end of the month.Original review:This product pushes more air into the unit and you can actually feel the hot air being pushed out and away through the back of the unit. An intercooler is especially important if you have the PS3 in an enclosed area such as a wall unit. The installation is easy, no tools required, simply align and push into place. The design compliments the PS3, it puts the power button in front of the unit and it has a knob to adjust the speed of the fans. This unit does increase the noise level but after a couple of days I got used to it and it's a non-factor. As you know, when you turn off the PS3, the PS3 fan also turns off; however, the intercooler fans keep running until you turn off the power button. Once I turn off the PS3, I leave the intercooler running for a couple of minutes to allow it to completely cool down the PS3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not fit the system","review":"I purchase and when I get to install it, all the connections in the back are covered by the Intercooler.....That's really lame.....I strongly suggest the guys at Nyko to redesign their product.

I makes too much noise during use.That being said. Shame on Sony for making a product that needs this additional device. I have had to buy this just to cool the product so I could use it safely. Turning off the PS 3 without the intercooler is almost like cooking the electronics. A redesigned PS 3 or intercooler would be a marked improvement.

Although the cabinent has an open back the PS3 was still running hot and you could hear the internal fans kick into high. It was surprisingly loud. I found if I left the cabinent door open while I was using the PS3, it wasn't a problem, but it tempted my kids to mess with it.So I grabbed the Nyko Intercooler to help out. I read the reviews saying that I didn't need it, but none of them mentioned that the PS3 will get loud when it gets hot. I installed it two weeks ago. It worked OK from what I could tell but it was really really loud, even at the lowest setting.Then it happened. It went nutz. The Intercooler's fans started to vary speeds on it's own. It started to freak out all by itself. I wasn't about to let this piece of rap mess with my $600 PS3. I repackaged it, and it is going back.Total let down. I guess I will just leave the cabinet door open when in use.Good luck if you buy this..."},{"rating":"2","title":"PS3 Intercooler Works","review":"I find it hard to believe that this Nyko Intercooler would damage a PS3 like some people are saying, first you need to use it correctly in an open enviroment, not in a cabinet shut closed.

The PS3 has one of the best cooling systems ever put on a gaming system or computer. It has a huge 8\\" fan, liquid cooling cables, and an enormous heatsink that takes up most of the bottom of the unit. It has been out for a year now and there have been no reports of the unit overheating. There is absolutely no reason to buy this or any other external cooling system, and this company is simply trying to sell you a product based on consumer's fears that they will overheat their PS3s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very sleek piece of garbage","review":"AVOIDThis fan is insanely loud, only makes a noticeable difference on the highest setting, borrows power from the consoles power supply which forces you to physically turn it off when the console goes into standby.

Stay away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nyko Intercooler does not fit new Playstation 3 40GB","review":"Just a word of warning to anyone who has recently purchased a new Playstation 40GB the Nyko Intercooler does not fit anymore. Playstation has redesigned the air slots on the back of the Playstation 3 and the clips on the intercooler don't line up properly. We called Nyko and they are aware of the changes and in fact informed us as to why it would not work. They are in the process of redesigning the Intercooler and said it would be another 3 to 4 months before they had a new one ready. So my recommendation to anyone looking to purchase one would be to call Nyko and find out if the new one is on the market before purchasing if you have a new Playstation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessary, causes more problems than it solves","review":"This actually came bundled with my PS3; I certainly wouldn't have bought it.This cooler is loud, prevents you from really using your controller to turn the console on and off (you can, but the fans run all of the time if you do that), and it might even be causing more problems than it solves. Personally I would rather not have extra dust being blown into my PS3, especially since it doesn't seem to have any overheating problems to start with.I advise saving your money and not buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"noisy but effective","review":"it really groans when you power it up for about 30 seconds, even on the lowest setting, it is loud enough to hear over the tv as background noise.but it seems to work pretty well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a 1 star because there is no 0 star rating.","review":"Absolutely awful.

I have a Bose surround set, seperate receiver, all and all a pretty good setup and would have to constantly have to keep turning it up to get over the fans. I ended up taking it off and custom mounting entertainment center fans I got off of eBay. They work tons better and you can't even hear them. The loss of wireless turn on and off is annoying too. It's not bad when you change out your game each time, but you lose convenience when you're playing harddrive games. The quality of the kit and fit are great, but I would look into one of the usb powered intercoolers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Mine worked 120 days running 24/7 and then quit. Of course the warranty is only 90 days. It did however run good when it worked. I can't comment on the noise level as I have a lot of other computers and fans running so it was barely noticeable to me.Another drawback is the lack of clearance between the unit and the network cable connector. No room for fingers to squeeze the little tab to unplug it. You have to use a small tool, knife blade or credit card. It can be done but not all that easy, just a minor annoyance because normally you do not unplug this cable all that much.I can say however the unit looks sweet. It matches the color and contours of the PS3 so it looks like it came as part of the unit and not an add-on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a gimped chainsaw","review":"I naively bought this product as I had heard rumors about the next-gen consoles overheating. Well it turns out that it is only the 360 that overheats and while the ps3 may run hot, it does not melt down. The Intercooler is noisy, even on the lowest setting. It effectively disables the power control via controller/remote, and it doesn't seem to draw heat out very well anyway. On maximum fan speed it sounds like someone is about to kick through the door with a chainsaw, on minimum speed it sounds like a lawnmower that wont shut-the-bleep up.And, attaching the thing to your ps3 can actually break the ps3 case (says so in the installation guide), and that isn't covered under warranty as it is not a sony product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intercooler","review":"This Intercooler does not fit my PS3 the back is designed wrong and will not work with my PS3.

The large fan on the cooler was making noise like a bearing was going out.Suffice to say, don't waste your money.EDIT - Talked to Sony Repair about these things based on what I had heard at my local Gamestop.

While it will be very hot on the side where the disc tray is the system itself will remain cool. This Product displaces that heat and draws it back over the CPU and GPU which are why the fans are needed in the first place making it counter productive to say least and is the only way this machine will come close to over heating unless you put it in a box, or cover it in a blanket. If you are smart and you want your PS3 to last then do not buy this product. It's not as bad as their 360 intercooler apparently but still a waste and more likely to do more damage then good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and MONEY","review":"I bought the Intercooler with my PlayStation. I'd heard they put off an incredible amount of heat and was concerned about it. However, the Intercooler is disturbingly noisy. The bearings in the fans go out quickly. and then you have an annoying useless shell encasing your PlayStation. Topping this all off I discovered that while the PlayStation does put off an incredible amount of heat, this is because it's pulling that heat safely off the 8 processors and venting it. Just don't keep your PlayStation in an enclosed entertainment center and it'll be fine.

The Playstation 3 has passed very extreme environment testing well outside the suggested temperature operating range, and doesn't need an external cooler. Using this product will likely cause problems instead of preventing them.If you want to protect your console ensure you are using clean voltage ( avoiding spikes, sags, and surge ) by using an approved surge protector or Uninterrupted Power Supply. Also dusting off your console ever so often ( as you should ) for any other electronics device. If you keep the outside clean less particles will be sucked inside.

This has a few interesting moments but I could never sit down and listen to this from start to finish without being bored out of my skull."},{"rating":"1","title":"No progress","review":"The early work from Staind was more aggressive and progressed into more positive and somewhat lighter music more recently. But on all of the previous albums, the mood felt honest. You really got pulled in by it. This one feels contrived, almost as if they didn't know how to move forward, so they went back."},{"rating":"2","title":"A step up and a mix of everything, which is very very good","review":"This cd is great. I am really happy to hear staind put out a great cd after \\"14 shades of grey\\" which I honestly hated (yes hated). This is the redeeming cd for them. It is more like break the cycle and while some songs are very soft, some are heavy as well. Its a real mix of everything they've done, starting off with a typical staind sounding song \\"run away\\". \\"Right here\\" has really great verses, but the chorus reminds me of nickleback and it annoys me. I'm quickly sucked back into the music in \\"paper jesus\\" which instantly brings \\"Dysfunction\\" to mind. Its very heavy. Other songs I love are \\"falling, Devil, Please, and King of all excuses\\". Although those are my favorite songs, the whole cd is very good. Break the cycle is my favorite staind cd, but this is a close second. If you were dissapointed by 14 shades of grey, fear not this time around. No complaints really."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Triumph By One Of The Best Bands Out There PERIOD!","review":"well, what can i say, its a great album filled with songs that are both depressing, heart lifting, powerful, and just overall \\"cool\\". i think one thing i really hear in this album versus some of their older ones is they just \\"sound better\\" the riffs, chorus', guitars, singing, it all just sounds better, i dont know who they used to produce this album but they did a great job. im sure you have all heard the single Right Here, well that is just the tip of the iceberg, this album is chock full of great singles, you should definately purchase this album, you wont be sorry, trust me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Staind?","review":"The only song thats any good is right here.Ive listened to the cd over and over nothing really grabs me.

And to the people who said \\"what happened you guys used to rock\\" or something similar to that I will tell you what happened. They got exposed for the complete frauds they really are. They made their sound alittle heavier in the beginning to draw in everybody, and then came out of the dark.They don't have alot of talent so they were forced to put out a pop record in order to still be played on trl and corporate radio. I don't care how you much you tune down your guitar, you can't hid the fact that you have nothing but a bunch of rock ballad crapola on this record.

It's uplifting, really, which is quite strange to say, considering the lyrics.This album is amazing, Staind never ceases to come through!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There is a reason why these guys are popular, great album!!!","review":"This is a great fifth album from this boston based band. I have all of their albums from tormented to this one, and this one is really the most coalesced and solid album from them yet. There are many hits to be released on this album, like right here, schizophrenic conversations, falling ect... This band may have been part of the \\"nu metal\\" movement, but they continue to release good music that many people have chosen to like. Sure, it's not in the same class of metal as Iron Maiden, Neurosis, and Megadeth, some of my all time favorite bands, but it is great in it's own respect.

I don't know what made Aaron Lewis sad enough to make him ruin his music career but whatever happened he REALLY needs to get over it and make more records like 'dysfunction' and 'tourmented' because those records were some of his best workIf U agree with me press 'yes' under the thing that asks if U found this review helpful"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHATEVER HAPPEN TO THIS BAND?","review":"Aaron lewis has some amazing growls that are not used at all anymore, such a shame all these bands tease out of the gates and never look back lol just look at how \\"avenged sevenfold\\" and \\"sevendust\\" have turned out ha!!!

Unfortuantly, I realize that the band I love doesn't exist anymore. At least I still have Tormented, Dysfunction and the memories of the times I've seen them live. Now, this isn't an awful album but there's nothing that can separate them from the rest of the sludge you hear on the radio.

Ive been a staind fan for a long time and i dont understand what they where thinkingon this record.-------------------------------------------------------------I just finished this album and I have to say that this is a huge disappointment. How can you guys compare this to dysfunction or break the cycle at all? (especially dysfunction). Dysfunction Is definitely their best work. In Chapter 5 he keeps singing about the same exact things over and over again. I don't just mean compared to other albums, but I mean in the songs themselves. I thought he got all his whining out in break the cycle. What happened? This album is more like 14 shades of grey, which also wasn't that great, but it was still better than this. How many times can he say DEVIL???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did they go wrong?","review":"What happened? Staind used to be all hardcore and everything and now they are soft rock and on this album they are stooping to soft high pich voices (don't know what I'm talking about? listen to 'Right Here' from this album) I don't know why they changed from hardcore good music to this soft crap but all I have to say is that I would like this band better if they made more albums like 'Dysfunction' and 'Tormented'. I have Dysfunction and I have a friend that let me borrow their rare but first record, Tormented. I think that Tormented is what introduced Staind's TRUE talent and Dysfunction is what proved Staind to truly to be hardcore and the rest of their albums they are all just get more soft and slow as more albums are released. The more they change themselves the harder it gets to like this band. Do you want to hear Staind when they were good? Listen to Tormented and Dysfunction"},{"rating":"1","title":"How bad is this album...DON'T RECOMMEND BUYING","review":"I just want to make this short and simple...I used to like Staind till I listened to the new album and basically the whole CD sounds the same, it needs more of the anger that \\"dysfunction\\" and \\"break the cycle\\" had and a little of 14 Shades.

Staind offer us this 12-track album, Chapter V, a fantastic mix of pulse-hammering guitars and incredible vocals. Tracks like \\"King Of All Excuses\\", \\"Cross To Bear\\" and \\"Paper Jesus\\", deliver insanely heavy guitar riffs combined with the awesome vocals of frontman Aaron Lewis. Meanwhile mellower songs like \\"Everything Changes\\" and \\"Trippy\\" are thrown in to slow the momentum down. Every song on this album scores ten out of ten, as I just can't find any flaws in any of them. The best track, I think, is \\"Cross To Bear\\". Excellent chorus, great guitar riffs and a chilling opening are only a few of the things that make the song so good.But don't let me describe every song for you, find out for yourself and go out and buy this album now."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"It is very rare that you find a cd that has really good music throughout.

Or please serenade us with another ballad, since each album you must put on more and more ballads. \\"Right Here\\" sounds like \\"So Far Away\\" or any other song from Chapter V/14 Shades which are basically the same album and are interchangable. Or you can listen to \\"Everything Changes\\". Too bad you already heard it on 14 Shades and Break the Cycle.Staind really has turned to garbage. I am ashamed to say I used to work promotoions for them back in 1999. They have truly gone down the sewer hole. Even the supposed hard songs like \\"Run Away\\" are garbage.

The second story, a generally humorous and wry commentary on the bureaucracy, specifies, in an apparent attempt at humor, that it was a Jew who acquired the books purchased by one financially over-extended bureaucrat.Only if Spanish literature was, at the relevant time, profoundly anti-Semitic do these stories provide a fair and representative sampling.

It would be nice to see some added extras with this set, though.Among the best episodes in the set are \\"First, Catch a Tiger\\", \\"Episode in Laredo\\" (first two of the season), \\"The Unforgiven\\" and \\"Return to Fort Benjamin\\". The season wallows a bit in the middle but picks up steam once more with some finely crafted stories in the final 7-8 installments. Many fans feel that the show more or less peaked with this season and began to wane in quality thereafter. That's to be expected when you consider that 117 episodes were made over the first three years(!) I'm very pleased that sales for the first two seasons were strong enough to warrant another release for this excellent western series.

You play as Ram, an ex-con who is given a second chance by his brother Tommy, a DEA agent, who was injured while trying to expose a drug cartel. Ram takes on the tasks set forth by his brother and sets out to expose the cartel.The game plays just like a combination of Max Payne moves, a free-roaming enviornment, and offers you multiple ways to take down drug dealers/lords. The story will keep you entertained as you learn what happened to your father, who is responsible for betraying you and what is in store for Ram. Furthermore, the music is some of the best that I've heard for a game (the intro alone will have you coming back to the game just to hear the music).

He provides interesting case studies to show how objects evoke emotions.

I felt that, although the most expressive, the movie recording wasn't as musical as I wanted it to be. The singers (besides Tevye, of course) in the original cast didn't suit my style. So when I found this recording of my favorite musical, I was estatic. Although I believe that Tevye in this one is not as expressive in his other couter-parts, he does suit the role well (well, I like him at any rate).

The author and publisher should be embarrassed. I plan to send in my marked-up copy to them (the text is useless, anyhow). However, I don't expect that a second edition will ever be printed.

The author seems to ramble on about all of his travel problems, things that have happened to him. That's great if you show us an example, but not a third of each chapter. Also, there is a lot of redundent info.

Much of the advice is, in my opinion, questionable.

Try it if you don't believe me. Also, the ancecdotes tend to suggest that being confrontational with gate agents and airline stewards will somehow get you better service.

When these loopholes were new, it worked because literally nobody knew about it. Now, it was so widespread, the companies closed every open loophole.Greenberg's strategies are actually risky.

There's also a bizarre jump from an abbreviated pet-friendly lodging section (a whopping two paragraphs) smack into the middle of a discussion on how to get the best deal on a hotel room. Clearly, whoever edited this cut a big chunk out, and deprived the reader of who-knows-how-much information.

Greenberg also sounds a little too snide and know-it-all for my taste. This may be just a personal taste 'thing'.There is some good detail (good 'hidden' seats for example) but it seems to me that a lot of this information is already available or is easy to figure out on one's own.

What I know for certain is that this book is completely unrealistic and by following this advice you are certain to end up paying more for your travels. Today's travel environment is such that airlines and hotels are not putting up with those who try to manipulate their systems. More specifically following these TRICKS will result in losing your frequent flyer accounts, club memberships,or even air tickets-resulting in the need to pay a full fare to continue on your trip as well as, any number of sanctions that the travel industry can impose.

His travels bring him to a confrontation with a \\"living budda\\" whom he must assassinate, but first he must pass through the gateless barrier. Koike & Kojima's brilliant and definitive ronin epic continues to deliver with complex and dramatic story arcs combined with the beautiful and often breathtaking artwork that have become synonomous with this tale of feudal Japan. Lone Wolf and Cub is a must read for anyone interested in the Samurai period of ancient Japan as well as comic and manga enthusiests."},{"rating":"2","title":"All of them must die.","review":"This is an excellent series. The artwork could be a little better to my mind. But that is very much a personal thing. The story is what really draws me in. Strong characters and a very interesting veiw into Itto's idea of bushido. I love the new format and they look really nice all lined up on a bookshelf. These I have out. All my normal comics go into plastic sleeves and into a folder. I am really starting to like the graphic novel format.If you like samurai then you will love this series. The second book is not as good as the first. But it does have some interesting concepts. Well worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graphic SF Reader","review":"At the end of the previous volume we find out why Lone Wolf, if you want to call him that, left the Shogun and his official killing job to become ronin, and wander around the place taking assassin jobs for money from whoever will pay.In one of the stories in this volume the kid actually manages to get into a bit more trouble than usual, as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Candy","review":"My son and I ate one each and they were so old and hard they had little to no taste so I set that box aside and was very disappointed.

The story was not too complex, the romance between the protagonists flowed smoothly but not completely believable. I found the character of Rexana not so pleasant. Too prone to defiance, even when she professes to be in love with Fane. She senses Fane's internal turmoil and doesn't do anything to help him or to gain a closer knowledge of his past. She strikes as a selfish, self-centered personality, focused only on the needing of her brother, totally ignoring Fane's reasoning and his feelings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply horrible","review":"While the idea was great, the book was confusing, lacked direction and shallow.

There are no treble/bass controls, just a Mega Bass button that doesn't make much difference. Has a useless Mode button to switch from stereo to mono (why?). Has a headphone jack but no other output ports. Sound quality is not impressive, with or without the Mega Bass.It does have a nice Sleep button with preset shut-off intervals of 10, 20, 30, 60, 90 or 120 minutes.

It is a good buy. The CD plays fine and the digital radio tuner makes it much easier to locate the station you are looking for. It is excellent for recording from the radio or CD player to cassette tape. It is quite sturdy and the instruction manual is complete and easy to understand. The only drawback is that it does not have a built-in microphone and so can only record from its own radio or CD player. But for that, I would have given it 5 stars.

The sony S-350 I received as a gift worked (CD) only a bit longer (the tape does not a loud sound when it stops). My previous combo player had lasted five years, considering it does light duty, a more impressive performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"sony cds01","review":"I purchased this unit because I needed a cassette player FM radio and CD.Sony use to make great products this is not one of them. For starters the cassette player will only play Type I cassettes.There is not difference you you push the mega bass button. The FM receiver is very poor. I could not tune in the local in town 50,000 watt FM radio station that I like to listen to it is the only Golden Oldies Station in town. The speakers are not that good either I played a CD and was not happy with the sound. Needless to stay I will be returning this unit. Also digital tuning is for the birds give me the old slide rule tuning. They just do not make products like they did fifteen to twenty years ago and sadly you cannot find parts to fix those better machines. P.S. I did not purchase this through Amazon. Just wanted any potential buyers to know not to waist their time of having to ship it back if you purchase through Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with this unit","review":"I purchased a refurbished Sony CFDS01 CD Radio Cassette Recorder from a well-reviewed Amazon retailer and it has proven to be almost a total failure. I tested it on battery power initially and it worked but after a few weeks (in which time I was using it on AC power) the batteries, which had not been used, entirely drained themselves apparently through some sort of short-circuit within the unit. Unfortunately we needed this thing to operate on battery power from time to time. Intermittently it refuses to play ordinary music CD's (that play perfectly on other devices). The FM reception is very poor, even switched to mono mode. (FM is excellent on other radios in this location). This is not a reliable unit and its performance falls far short of what I expect from Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Radio Ever","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewers that this is the worse radio reception ever. At first I did not believe the ratings thinking that it couldn't be that bad or the other reviewers just got a defective item, but after testing I am convinced. Most of the stations, even the FM, were filled with static and trying to search for a station is a real pain. I returned mine for a refund. Don't waste your time and money on this item. I can't believe Sony would allow their name on something this bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"No 'boom' in this box!!","review":"Sony, this is a joke, bought this and returned it, I heard better sound out of a Fisher Price radio.

Their music is very elegant and vulnerable. Sometimes it sounds a bit too much like Radiohead, although they very much have a style of their own. I definitely like it, and it grows on you every time you listen to it. The only problem with the album is that you really have to listen to it from start to finish.

Mr. Dudamel seems to have learnt all the theatrical elementsand gestures of Leonard Bernstein, but without holding the musical elements in shape or presenting the musical argumentsin a coherent manner. Bits and pieces, they may sound exciting and may at times shock and awe. Unfortunately,the whole is much less than the sum of its parts. If this is what real Mahler would sound like, I would have abandonedMahler years ago. The most shame of it all is that the sound of the orchestra was excellent but the conductorwas not able to mold it into a convincing whole.(One of my favorite versions is Rafael Kubelik's on DGG.)

There's being flawed and then there's being a character on \\"Rescue Me.\\" There's not one person I would want to spend five minutes with. Everyone is a liar. Everyone is selfish. No one is loyal. No one is kind. No one is happy. If I were a NYC Firefighter I would be angry at the portrayal of firefighters. And what's with the attractive 90-lb. female firefighter? I'm sure she's lovely, but she couldn't lift an overweight man out of a burning building. And what's with all this 9/11 stuff. I'm sure they're haunted by it, but it doesn't excuse having no character. These characters were likely horrible people before the towers fell.

If profanity and visual obsenity was what these writers were going for, then hooray, well done, three cheers, they almost made the people of Deadwood blush. What is it with Americans filling other nations screens with filth at the same moment they claim to be a Christian nation with Christian priciples? Where have all the 'Homicides: Life on the Street's gone? All we have now is boring Law & Order and CSI's or offensive 'OZ' or 'Deadwood' or 'Rescue Me's to contend with.

So we bought the first season on DVD so we could catch up. We like the show very much; however, it does get a little graphic and vulgar at times. And the Denis Leary character is hard to like, unless you are pre-disposed to like his work (such as his unfairly canceled cop show \\"The Job\\" from a few years back). However, if you like shows that are a little rough around the edges (like the Sopranos, for instance), I think you would like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Show On Tuesdays","review":"This is one of the most funny, realistic and entertaining dramas around currently (2005-2006). Watch it from the very first episode and see how each firefighter has a background and a story. See how well the firefighters get on as a team get on from day 1. See how September 11th has affected their lives. I especially love Denis Leary's character's brother who works as a New York Cop. Such a cool guy.Anyway, definitely worth an hours watch every week! And, of course, Denis Leary has written and acted yet another brilliant piece of work again just like his 2001-2002 show called 'The Job'. My Score = 10/10. Let's hope this one doesn't get cancelled folks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rescue Me","review":"It is nearly inconceivable that Denis Leary has not been nominated for an emmy for this fantastic series.

I have to say I thought this would be rubbish, I am the first to admit right now that I couldnt have been more wrong, it is absolutely fantastic!!

If you're not a fire fighter then get it anyway, you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Show","review":"Rescue Me is far and away the best show on television right now. While The Shield, Deadwood, and even Nip/Tuck garner more praise, Rescue Me is consistently more captivating, more dramatic, and ultimately more entertaining. Even the shows potentially gimmicky hook, in which the main character Jimmy (Dennis Leary in what is obviously a role very close to his own mold) is \\"haunted\\" by the ghosts of friends and victims that have perished in front of him, is so well crafted and astutely acted that it is totally beleivable and seemless woven into the more realistic elements of the show. This is one of those shows that oozes beleivability. It is obvious that the show and its characters are important to the writers and the actors. Resuce me does not pull any puches with gore and hero sentimentality, which so often pervade lesser firefighter lore. It feels and looks true, and that is rare these days. I can't recomend it enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rescue Me - Season 1","review":"A great set.

This multi-DVD package is worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkly Humorous","review":"Dark, dark, \\"Through A Glass Darkly\\" humorous ... a black humor unlike any I've seen on TV. The show itself reminds me a little of \\"The Shield\\" with its vulgar amoral characters alternating between heroism and self-abuse, a little of \\"Oz\\" in its unbridled vulgarity, and a little of \\"Six Feet Under\\" in its effective juggling of characters who change and adapt before our eyes. But it turns into its own beast after a handful of episodes here, a funny show unlike anything else I've seen.Dennis Leary is good, especially at selling a joke, and the guys who play his co-workers are mostly outstanding as are some of the other supporting players. This is one cool show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denis Leary at his best","review":"If you like Denis Leary or some of the other parts he has played in movies or on television then you need to get this disk set.

The writers of this show have got it down so well, I know what they are going to say next. Ladies, this is as close as you are ever going to get to seeing the real male dynamic in action...my wife gasps at what she sees as cruelty, and I have to explain that this is just the pack, constantly shilling out weakness in it's members and trying for the momentary alpha position. This is writing that I haven't seen since ***, and it deserves all the accolades it gets. The dynamics of the firehouse crew are equally spot on in their actions and reactions.This is a \\"Guy Show\\" for sure...but the gals may find it a fascinating peek into the world of testosterone."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the few programs that can rescue TV!","review":"This show is really good. Its grity, raw, and very realistic. The main character is a really complex, heroic, and at times funny and aggressive. THE Show is about a crew of firemen who struggle with their personal lives and the burden of keeping the burning city of New York from going up in flames.

The stories are cute, light entertainment, with appealing characters but no surprises.

The biggest problem here is the sloppy editing which eventually gets very intrusive. Commas missing everywhere but put in where they don't belong, words misused (in the narrative, not in the character quotes)and overused. A few examples: \\"...and a jolt of electricity jettisoned through his body.\\" \\"It was a patient's right to sign themself out of the hospital and there wasn't much he could do...\\" \\"He hung up the phone, debating for half a minute as to the veracity of calling her at home, but decided to go with his gut.\\" if the author doesn't know the meaning of \\"jettison\\" or \\"veracity\\", surely someone else on the publishing staff ought to?"},{"rating":"2","title":"True Love","review":"True love has got to exist after reading 'Big Girls Don't Cry'.

That's nearly 70% higher than the western EU per-capita income.In other words, US per-capita income will actually increase relative to even the most advantaged western European economies.

It is both hopeful and sad to know that many of our Red-Blue problems are decades old, and were seen by her in the 1940's. It is all here--divorce, jealousy, violence, sex, racial attitudes, and also the more hopeful virtues of American life--community spirit, faith and optimism.

I own their first two records and I've heard all of the new one. I'd have to say The Dead and Dreaming is their \\"crowning\\" effort. Now first off, nothing about this band is really original. There were already so many metal bands out there playing these same old riffs for over ten years so by the time DKL came around it was already old. However, the crushing energy and agression cannot be ignored. The mellower parts are very boring and when he sings it sounds like Linkin Park-esque vocals. Nothing special there. So anyway, if you like your metal loud and angry, but low on the technical and originality scale then Dry Kill Logic is for you. This is their heaviest album and packs a punch. Better than Limp Bizkit, Korn, Hatebreed and all that mess, but I'll still stick to my Slayer, Opeth, and Testament albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"You can tell they spent a good deal of time and energy on this album, the new members add a distinctive sound that was missing in TDSON and sets them apart from other acts in the same genre. Only thing missing from this album is the song \\"HindSight\\" which was not released with the US version. Rocking album none the less!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real guide","review":"This book differs from the rest of the getting started in HR books. This book is not a how-to resource for running an HR department, but a real framework for pursuing an HR career. Most others sort of talk about what HR is and give generic advice for students. This book has some of that, but also looks at real-world people who by accident or design choose HR, or are chosen by it, further alon in their work life and need to build a career path in the discipline. Along with the content are chapter endin interviews with real, successful HR professionals that bring the subject of the chapter into focus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow instructions...","review":"I could see where the author wanted to go, and it's a good concept, but the ironic thing is that the first lesson of Level 3 is, \\"How to follow instructions\\". I'm 37 years old with 4 college degrees, and I had to re-read the instructions several times over to figure out what they wanted.We didn't start this curriculum from the beginning and dove into Level 3, so Maybe if you start with Level 1 it Might help?Also, it seemed that the instructions were a bit... sarcastic? Or, maybe it seemed that the author was \\"talking down\\" to the student. For example: [Not a direct quote, because I swapped it on PaperBackSwap.com...] \\"Now, if you didn't get that, go back and re-read the last paragraph 3 times till you do.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Less pain in learning to write","review":"The Writing Stands course has been less painful for me than my son. The first few lessons were on following directions. This proved much more difficult for him than the actual writing assignments. The lessons placed the responsibility for their accurate completion on his squarely on his shoulders. Once those lessons were complete, things settled down to a relatively easy way to teach creative writing to my son."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i hoped for","review":"This book has a few good writing helps and techniques, but overall did not come close to meeting my expectations.I planned on using it for home schooling, but there are only a few exercises I will use from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't get it","review":"I don't get what is supposed to be so great about this series. My daughter did level 3 and four before we decided to call it quits. We both found it a pain to follow the instruction and methodology. Level four consisted of assignment after assignment doing things like making lists of items in rooms and describing where everything is located, such as the south wall, north wall and so on. We both found them very boring. It was very difficult also to see where all this list making and organizing of information, which didn't really feel like it fit us or would be our style of doing things, was headed. There was no feeling of having really learned something valuable or sense of accomplishment on having finished the books. We have switched to Saxon Grammar and Writing and are liking it much better. My daughter has written some essays that I have been proud of in just the first few weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Ginsberg","review":"The totality of this book results in a Ginsberg manifesto, delivered in his own unique prose style, and bursting forth with great honesty and impassioned integrity. Invaluable as a document of the times (roughly late 40s thru early 90s), as a sourcebook for things Beat, as a reference source to Ginsbergian Mind Speak, this book is a major addition to Ginsberg's published work. My only criticism is that it is presented topically, not chronologically as nearly all Ginsberg's published work is, but that is a minor point. This book stands with his best and is certainly his most important publication since 'The Fall of America' in 1972, maybe even since 'Kaddish' in the very early 60s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Book","review":"I bought this book thinking it will show my daughter about colors. I do prefer hardcover over paperback. The quality of the pull tabs get stuck and my 2 year old daughter has trouble putting them back in. There is no color learning in this book.

Perhaps they've changed the leather recently, and maybe it's not as durable, but I've never had issues with the leather flaking or being hard to clean. It has held up remarkably well, and I've got it stuffed to the gills. It works well as a clutch, but I made the mistake of putting my phone in it a couple of times in the outer snap pockets, and caused the leather to completely separate from the metal. So, note to anyone - don't put your phone in it!

I ordered the black patent leather belinda hobo wallet. I was very disappointed when it arrived. There was a small area on the fabric for one of the pockets that was damaged.

Not because I am wearing them out - but because I love it and have ordered different colors. I like that I can carry it in my purse - but able to take it out and carry into the store without my heavy purse to keep up with. The only drawback with this wallet is that it will hold alot of change and if you aren't careful - your wallet and purse will become very heavy. I always make sure to have as little change as possible. But I love this wallet - it is the best one I have ever had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice but too small!","review":"These are beautiful clutches, but just too small to carry as a purse alone. Seems too large for a \\"wallet\\" unless you plan to carry it inside a huge tote bag. The quality is great, very well made and just lovely but you can forget trying to use this as a day to day bag. The magnetic closure will not stay closed if you have more than a few cards, cash and maybe a set of keys distributed through out. Cell phones, lip gloss and the smallest digital camera will not fit in this bag. Sadly, had to return it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic excuse for a nice wallet","review":"To be honest, I should have known better by the price. Hobo markets itself as though it is good quality leather and higher end products. What a farce. The metal part is peeling off, so that means it is coating over something crappy, and you are only suppose to clean the leather with a damp cloth, no conditioner. I've had enough leather jackets and shoes to know good leather and this isn't good. It isn't durable and is difficult to clean. I would recommend not buying this product, unless you only buy dark colors or are looking to replace in 6 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still not shipped","review":"I put in an order to this company that was received on the 21st of August as a birthday gift to a friend of mine.

But I have been using it for several months and the fabric is completely unraveling. It's as if some kind of coating on the shirt is peeling off -- entire sections of the shirt have this yucky white stuff peeling off, and the space where the peeling has occurred is much thinner, stretched out of shape, and almost see-through. It looks so bad now that I simply have to throw it away and buy another swim shirt -- after less than one season of use. I have been using it in pools and the beach. I wash it gently and always line-dry, so I don't think the problem is my care. I regret buying this shirt and definitely do not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"One of the best books ever written on the specialized function of PR!

The information it the text is both timely and timeless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"These other reviews must be paid endorsements","review":"I bought this book based in part on the rave reviews. I did not see much value in the book -- It reads like a couple of friends got together and said, \\"hey, since we're good at this, we should write a book about it!\\" But the text is scattered, and the instructions are not at all useful. When an example is given to illustrate a point, it's hard to see the relevance of the example, or how it relates to something you might do yourself. There's an old adage, \\"Those who can't, teach.\\" The reverse is true here: \\"Those who can, should stick with what they do best, and not try to teach unless they know how to teach.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Oddly written but an intriguing ruleset","review":"Ars Magicka is one of the more unique role playing systems I've read in that it isn't a lot of any one thing. It encourages multiple guides, as well as experiences. There's a wealth of information here though and I think you'll need to read it several times before getting the gist of it. The layout is strange and I found myself more than halfway through asking the question, \\"Yeah? But what do we DO?\\" There are plenty of rules but the structure is very vague, purposely I think, but it may be a blessing or confusing challenge for beginner groups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!

Nuts! Easton gives us all the revenue numbers.
