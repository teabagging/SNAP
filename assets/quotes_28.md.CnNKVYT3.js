The holes for crayons and markers are also rather shallow; the crayons and markers stay in, but it would be more useful to have deeper holes that hold a larger number of supplies. The tiny shelves in the table legs can hold only very tiny items. The actual play surface is also small, and the 'storage area' under the desk holds only a few sheets of paper.

This game turned out to be one of the hardest games I've ever played. It was harder than some of the mature rated.Its control scheme is rather simple, but the actual in game control is way too difficult to master for little children. The graphic is impressive, but sometimes it's too hard to control the characters in that pretty 3-D underwater environment. And also the game gets too confusing in some levels, and there isn't any in-game help.If you are looking for a game for your kids to play by themselves, skip this title.

That took me almost a year as I took very long breaks. Now I'm doing the same thing, I don't know if I'll beat level 13. Basically, there are 26 snails shells that I have to jump on top of and make sure all 26 are all down in the dirt while I only have a minimum of 12-17 seconds which I read alot of walk-through and alot of people where stuck on this level too. It seems that one jump for all 26 is all you can do, and I can't seem to do even one jump, in fact I keep doing 3 or sometimes 5 jumps at a time, I can't seem to get just one jump.

The watercolors are soft and appealing, many of the illustrations are black and white. Disney's Bambi was around 1942, this book came out a few years afterwards. (The novel Bambi is from the 1920s, and is more or less R-rated in terms of violence and a dab of incestuous sex. Disney's movie is described as one of the top 25 Horror movies of all time from Time magazine). This book is a true \\"Bambi\\" movie, without the violence. It is a wonderful book for children and deserved the award it received. It has lasted as a top seller for over 50 years. (Just explain to kids that the ground hog shadow story isn't real, part of the conclusion of this book)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Captivating.","review":"The beauty of this book lies in its simplicity. A simple plot (winter is coming) with simple characters (sweet woodland creatures) create a charming story. The illustrations are realistic, but not too realistic for a child - there is a softness, a roundness to them that makes them \\"cute\\" too. I like that the authors didn't automatically assume that realism is boring to children - on the contrary, it can be fascinating, and is an almost forgotton element in todays children's literature. I read this when I was a little child, and, 20 years later when I looked at it again, it was like coming home. Please buy this book for your children or grandchildren.

However, it also has the least color depth of these -- only 256 colors. This does make a difference if you store color pictures on your Palm.Speed is decent, especially with the Afterburner hack to overclock.The only major problem is that the IIIc tends to have very specific hardware.

With the included plastic flip cover in place, I can put the IIIc into my pocket without much worry of damage (as long as I don't sit on it).

I've tried playing with it to see if different things will even it out but when the fish come to eat, they move it a little and everything shifts around anyways.The underside of the product is hollow so air is trapped underneath the entire ring causing it to float. In the packaging it came with a styrofoam insert in this gap.. I'm assuming you're suppose to take it out because I personally wouldn't put styrofoam in my fish tank (although that would probably solve the uneven floating, that doesn't seem safe for the fish).

I don't have any problems with positioning it. A couple of times it has tilted but doesn't take even a second to tap and straighten before putting food in it.

Like many other reviewers, I find that the keyboard is a little flimsy, and I would like to be able to use it on my lap. Neat little accessory though. Got a lot of looks when I opened it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Palm Keyboard you can get!","review":"I know that you might think, \\"hmm, the best part of Palm is the graffiti and we should stick with that\\". I can write 29 words per minutes but there were times when you want to do faster, e.g. during a meeting and you need to take minutes and so on. That is when the Palm keyboard comes in handy. This keyboard was nicely designed (yup, you can flip it to the size of a Palm), using really \\"high-tech feel\\" material and it's full size key is great! There is one thing I really want it in my wish list. Currently the keyboard is similar to a notebook keyboard which doesn't have the \\"feel\\" of the keyboard of the desktop PC, I really want to see this to be improved as I don't like the feel of notebook keyboard. Am I expecting too much?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gadgets","review":"I love this keyboard. It is the coolest thing I have ever seen in the world. I wish I had one for a palm pilot. Heck, I wish I HAD a palm pilot. I think it is a great idea to make the keyboard. It makes it easier to type and put in messages and is easy to transport and gets to be so small, that it's not a hassle. It's esay to use and keeps everything organized. My Dad has one that his work gave him and he loves it because it keeps everything nice and organized. Thanks again for making this product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"After checking out the web sites trying to find out when this product would be available, it arrived! What a cool looking product! It comes in a neoprene case and has a metal look to it.What I like the most about the product is inputting addresses and emailing. If I would of had this product when I first bought the old Palm Pilot years ago, I would of saved hours.The only downside I see to the product is that it isn't a \\"durable\\" keyboard. You have to have it on a flat, hard surface to use (not on your lap). The W-fold doesn't lock once it is open, so make sure you keep it on a desk when you are using it and don't just pick it up with one hand like you can with your PC keyboard.If you type memos, email or travel with your Palm, buy this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great product that can change how you work","review":"This is one of the only devices I own that has really changed the way I go about my day. Neither my cell phone, nor my Franklin Planner, nor my Palm V alone (which replaced my Franklin Planner) has had this kind of impact. The design is a marvel: compact, elegant, and solid. They keyboard has an excellent responsive feel, better than many desktop keyboards. The shortcuts are intuitive and work with all the standard Palm software and all of the third party software I own (in particular, Info Select). This accessory empowers the Palm V so completely that it should be tried by every Palm owner.I purchased this product in an attempt to buy productivity. For once, it worked. I can hardly believe that I used to carry my laptop to meetings in order to take *notes*."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly italian","review":"The recording of this CD belongs to 80's and Rampal is still the greatest.

Oh when will Kultur item 1290 on the Legacy of Segovia be available on DVD?!?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Real West","review":"This book opened my eyes to what life on the western frontier was really like. Forget current media fictionalizations, the frontier was not a shooting gallery. No handsome stranger rides into to town to save the cowering inhabitants from evil. The crooks and crooked politics are all there, just like they are today. The sheriff was not always the stalwart defender of the law, in fact he sometimes had business interests to protect.McGrath offers a carefully documented narrative of the day to day goings on during the gold rush. The data is from public records and the fill-in is from newspaper archives. A detailed yet readable account of frontier life. Far better than any cowboy novel, this is the real west.Steve Hurst"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are so many better books on type out there. . . .","review":"This book is the worst: poorly designed, poor selection of work, poor reproductions. And it's not even about \\"big type\\". The intro says: \\"<em>Big Type</em> is not what it might seem. This book is a collection of design work in which the typographic elements assume primary importance.\\" So the editors knew the title was misleading? Then why not change the title?

A couple of them are alternate versions of songs on other cd's released before Dance, Dance, Dance(basically LA Rocks) and an excellent accoustic version of Hands of Time. Most of this cd reminds of Contagious cd. Vol1 has several songs that I don't know how they didn't make to the original albums or cd's...better than songs that made those cd's. This cd has a few but not as many songs in that category. If you like the better stuff off of Contagiuos and Ten then you should like this cd really well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"Amazingly, I'd have to say that this is actually overpriced. It says natural pine finish on the box...but the \\"natural pine\\" part is questionable, and the \\"finish\\" part is pure hyperbole. Evidently they took a wood plank, made a couple of saw cuts, sprayed it with orange Kool-aid (okay, maybe it was root beer),drilled a couple of holes in it and sent it out. There was clearly no attempt to even do so much as smooth the rough edges from the cutting, and there is no sign of anything that could be called a wood finish - just a general (and very uneven) discoloration.Further, in my case at least, it won't even hold the rifles I had in mind - old military items. The wood forends won't fit in the rack.All in all, I regret wasting the five minutes it took me to put it together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coolest guys on the planet...","review":"Although their album has not been released yet, I grew up in the same town as Silent Envy and have seen them play several times. Not only are they talented musicians but they are also incredibly nice and funny guys who love to stay and chill with fans after their shows.Their music could be classified as screamo punk, but that wouldn't do them justice. The lead singer (Dusty Bochek) screams, but you can still understand what he's saying and even sing along, if you feel so inclined (the band encourages singing along and various hand motions at their shows). Their songs are loud, fast-paced, and sound somewhat in the vein of late-1990's AFI with a dash of My Chemical Romance and a bit of From First To Last. Highly recommended for fans of any of those or other similar bands. If you can, you should also check them out at one of their shows! You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"Not a total waste of money, but not a lot of value either. Some decent basic vocabulary, and the say it/play it helped me improve my pronunciation. But no help at all in figuring out how to actually speak sentences in French. The sentence/phrase examples are strictly memorization.. not useful. And I could never understand enough to use the 2nd CD at all. I didn't find the Dictionary or French Tour CDs useful either. The Michel Thomas CD course has been much more productive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst software ever","review":"This must be one of the worst purchases I have ever made. First, it came with no installation instructions, and the program froze all the time. Even when it was working, there was nothing to learn, other than colors and French translations for objects. How anyone could learn a language from this is beyond me, I definitely could not. If you can, more power to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading packaging","review":"I would give this program three stars if the intent was JUST to have a reference.

I've just learnt French for about 8 weeks in a course in uni, about 1/4 of a beginner French textbook and I found that the the 2 CDs \\"Talk Now\\" and \\"World Talk\\" have almost nothing new to learn from. And what about the \\"talking dictionary\\" ? The only thing it can talk is ENGLISH, not French ? Why do I need a dictionary which talks English when I'm learning French. And there is no mention about it on the cover. Can I call it cheating ??? The \\"Voyage in France\\" is interesting but it is in English and I can't learn any French from it. If you're planning to travel to France, it is helpful but not if you want to learn French. Conclusion : just a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I bought this about 3 months ago and am now writing a review.

From having read this book, I feel like I'm hearing the Father and feeling His heart. He doesn't always say what's on His mind because we wouldn't be able to comprehend it. But feeling His heart brings closeness and immense comfort. It's like sitting on His lap. Here, the Father is gently coaxing us into the ways of the Spirit. If we were led by our minds or emotions, we would be totally misled. He is leading us (who have little spiritual sight) by the hand, and gently coaxing us as we go, giving us sufficient wisdom for the day.

Excelleent ultrawide for architecture, landscapes etc. At 12mm though, it is so wide that you must be careful of distortion introduced by shooting off-level. This is not to say this particular lens is faulty and distorts, but would be true of any ultrawide lens with this wide degree of coverage.

It is written in a question and answer format that makes it an easy read though some of the content is rather heavy.If you are looking for a Hollywood type of sensationalism for a good read, this is not your book.

What's amazing about Freddie is the incredible variety of sounds and blues styles he is able to get out of his guitar - there is something different and unique about every song. As usual, Freddie's vocals are incredible and his bends will blow you away. Freddie is so refreshing because of the incredible energy he brings to every song - even the slow ones.Freddie King is absolute required listening for Blues fans of any stripe. If you have not heard Freddie much, this album would be a great introduction to the man Clapton once said was the guitarist who most influenced him.

I even consulted with a baby store employee and practiced, but I couldn't get a good fit. Perhaps I was just paranoid. It's a shame too because I really like the idea of a sling -- it's so much lighter and easier to pack than other carriers. However, it isn't super comfortable when baby gets heavier. I just started using it again as a hip-carry, so hopefully I'll have more success with that.I'm sorry to say that I can't recommend the product.

The amount of my time and their time they were willing to expend to avoid responsibility to provide the cover that should have been included in the first place was extraordinary.

Two choices were offered: Return the product and receive a re-conditioned model with a 90-day warranty. Or, return my model to be repaired, in which case I'll be without it for 2-3 weeks. Needless to say I won't be buying anything from Palm in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Palm - mixes business and pleasure...","review":"I have had my Palm IIIxe for about 2 weeks now. I wasn't going to use it to surf the wireless web or check real-time stock market quotes, so I didn't want to spend a lot of money. Right out of the box it was very easy to use. Although it came with a pretty thick manual I have only opened it twice. I love the Avantgo software. It puts internet news channels (of your choice) on to your Palm to read at your convenience. I use the Palm's features to keep track of appointments, phone numbers, and things that I have to get done. With all of the programs available online the possibilities are endless. I have even downloaded a few books (to my Palm) that I read when I get a chance. I can't forget to mention all of the cool games I have gotten to kill most of my free time (good thing the Palm has an alarm to remind when it is time to quit). Overall very easy to use, very handy to have around, and very fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not intimidating","review":"I purchased a Palm IIIxe earlier this week,and the minute I turned it on, I found it extremely easy to use and very intuitive in accessing virtually all of the features. Setting up the Hotsync was easier than a piece of cake. I keep finding more and more reasons that this little gadget is really useful! I really wrestled over this or the Handspring Visor...the only apparent advantage that the Visor had was the plug in modules they offer, and so far, they all seem pretty gimmick-y. I'm really happy so far with the Palm. After seeing all the useful things this thing does for me, my wife wants one for herself, too! The only thing I'd like in a PDA is one that is a slight bit smaller and lighter."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PRODUCT!!!","review":"This Palm is absolutly GREAT!!! If your just getting in on the PDA scene like I was when I purchased this, it's the best way to go! 8 meg's insure that you will almost never outgrow it no matter what you use it for. It is so small and light it fits in almost any pocket easily.And as for function, this sucker will do almost anything you want. I use it for a day planner and phone book, and it is the easiest thing you will ever use! Grafitti is VERY easy to learn, and even easier to enter data. With just a few screen taps, you can see what your doing MONTHS ahead of time. Backing up data is also very easy, just install the HotSync software, put the palm in the cradle and push the button. The computer takes care of the rest.If your looking for an organizer, this is definitly the way to go!! And who can beat the GREAT price??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional & Simple - A great product","review":"I have had a Palm IIIx, and planning to buy a IIIxe just for the additional memory. But I feel this is still not going to be good enough since I am going to run out of memory soon. Palm really needs to get its act together and add more memory to its devices. With the popularity of the Palm devices and the thousands of applications out there (I have a lot on my Palm IIIx and have now run out of memory), this is a major drawback of Palm. I considered switching to Compaq's iPAQ, but two things about the Palm have delayed that switch (a) its robustness (doesn't crash like Windows), and (b) the large number of third party applications that make this a truly useful device all the time. I use a Qualcomm QCP860 cell phone and I can connect to my Palm anywhere, any time - check email, surf the net, or use my Yahoo messenger. But if Palm doesn't continue to improve its devices I might soon switch to the Compaq iPAQ. But until then, I am going to be a loyal Palm user!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Plastic Toy!","review":"The only good thing about this Palm is that it comes with 8MB RAM and upgradable PalmOS 3.5 .Having used Palm Vx and Visor Deluxe before, Palm IIIxe can immediately be distinguished by its poor built quality and handling.

Another feature, contrary to the above models, is that the the digitizer(or plastic shielding) goes down about a milimeter down when you tap the stylus in the middle of the screen.Palm IIIxe is overpriced and not suiatable for frequent use at all; Visor Deluxe provides much better value at the same price.If you are a serious user then Palm Vx is a MUST!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never again....","review":"After seing what a Pocket PC or Windows CE hand held can do, I'll never buy another palm."},{"rating":"1","title":"so i so regret i haven't read the reviews here before i buy","review":"my palm have the same problem, even i use brand new batteries it also will auto shut off and i lose all my data...so i can't bring this palm outside and it's totally useless...and i haven't use it long enuf for 1 year..so pls dun't buy this product unless the palm company can fix this BIG problem...i know many users have the same problem as mine, so pls read review b4 u buy any new eletric product..so frustrated..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustration on get repaired","review":"Two days ago my son drop incidentally my Palm IIIxe and the glass top broke out.

My wife LOVES using a third party software program to create & track her shopping lists. I love how it allows me to carry all of my work contact information with me and only maintain it in one place. It synchronizes excellent with MS Outlook 2000. Plus (and this is sometimes the most important feature) - GAMES! We recommend Traffic & Blocks - again, third party freeware.

Make sure you get a good case to protect it (Rhino-Skin shocksuit sports case for me, and a Targus leather case for my wife), and Write-Right screen protectors as well. I've had mine for about 8 months, and the best thing about it for me is that I stopped messing with post-its, scraps of paper, business cards, address books etc. etc. Just check the Palm, it's there. As soon as I get another phone # or address, I enter it. I've read alot about broken screens, but this thing has survived 8 months at the fire station, around town and on trips hung externally in it's case on my safari bag, which shows the importance of a good case. Most screen breakage results from carrying it in a pocket or unprotected drops.

You don't have to be an executive to own one. If you need some organization in your life, whether you're a mother, father, student, administrative assistant, doctor or a president of a company this will do the trick for you.

I bought my IIIxe three weeks ago and have used it daily (sometimes for hours at a time), and I just replaced the batteries. Three weeks of constant use is pretty amazing for those lil' triple-A's.I was amazed at the number of applications you can find for the IIIxe on the web. Many sites, such as Palm.com and cnet.com, offer freeware and shareware galore. You can't beat the Palm platform for variety of software.My experience with my new Palm has been a very positive one.

On the cover I read \\"Words by Chris Carter,\\" so I figured that there was a couple of tracks of dialogue taken from the show. WRONG!!! Every track is blanketed with annoying sound bites from the show (i.e. \\"Is he human...?\\", \\"I don't know...\\"). If I wanted to hear all that I just should've held a tape recorder up to my TV, I would have gotten the same results. Mark Snow's music can stand alone and do well. But with the inserted dialogue, the music becomes clouded and muffled. It's like saying \\"Hey, this is X-Files music!\\" I give Mark Snows music five stars and if I could give the dialogue a -10 I would (at least on the CD). The dialogue should have talked its way off the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dixon writes with gum and hairballs","review":"Stephen Dixon is a nice man who should have been a mechanic or something.

More importantly, this is a great opportunity to get a load of Steve Vai's performance antics. He's a hoot! I still can't get over Satriani trading in his hair for a pair of sunglasses. He looks like Billy Corgan. The biggest treasure of this performance is Eric Johnson. I never heard him play before. He writes the most accessible music of the three and I am a new fan. All in all, a great success. Just, please wear a closed shirt next time, Steve. You should be heard more, and seen less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This is a very good performance, but Joe Satriani is much better on his own DVD. The sound on this recording could be better mixed, however, Eric Johnson is absolutely fantastic!! I only wish Eric would release his own DVD.

A book about images...without pictures. People like this book because a book about this topic replete with images has yet to be puslished.

I would say that her writing style is not to my taste, as she uses way too many metaphors and goes on and on about the quirky personalities of the scientists that she is interviewing.Now, when it comes to fields in which I know something about, she does a TERRIBLE job. The is as whole part about quantum consciousness where a particular scientist that is not very well respected in his field (was in the movie What the bleep - worst movie ever) and if she were to interview just about anyone in the field of quantum physics, the whole chapter would have to get thrown out. But did this happen...no. She seems to latch onto research that she likes, and just disregards the rest.Not a good author, not a good book, NOT a good representation of biomimicry!I wish Janine Benyus could give me the week back that it took me to read this book so I could do something more productive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good subject but poor content","review":"This book deals with an interesting concept which is 'biomimicry'. In summary, it says that Mother Earth offers many models on which we can base our innovation/creation. But the book is not so easy to read and not so well planned. I skip many parts which in my sense go to deep in details and some parts are a bit repeatitive. The book is quite large but offers only few interesting ideas that are then developed and so detailed to an end which you don't remember the purpose. Some parts don't have a conclusion so you finish the chapter quite frustrated because you have read a big technical part and uoi don't see what was the point the author wanted to demonstrate. If you are interested in technical sciences then you might like it but otherwise, the ideas on biomimicry in this book could be summarize in a more compact book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Biomimicry CleanTech 2.0?","review":"As a co-founder of the Cleantech Open, I've spent a lot of time and energy helping entrepreneurs bring to market more sustainable technologies.

I thought this book would give many examples of varied uses (and future uses) of biological processes. This book should have been a description of what new and exciting developments are occurring in biology, and how these are being applied to make environmentally friendly alternatives to current technology. What the reader gets is an extremely enthusiastic, repetitive description of one paradigm per chapter. The descriptions are poorly planned however, as they contain too much jargon for the non-specialist reader, and not enough details for a science-educated reader. Many of the descriptions make it clear that the author never understood what she was writing about. Her enthusiasm is admirable, but it translates into extremely long-winded rants. I look forward to a good book written on this topic. This one isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a rave about unsustainability than about biomimicry","review":"The purported subject of this book is facinating, however most of the book seems to be about something else. The author lectures about current poor ecological practices (which were \\"news\\" about ten years ago). I found very little in this book regarding actual progress in technologies that were inspired by biological systems. Rather disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating topic, dissappointing book","review":"Solar cells modeled after green plants, fibers stronger than steel, chemical factories without pollution, ceramics as hard as abalone shell. Nature has invented many things that outperform engineering feasts, and this is book about nature's innovations.Biomimicry is a hard book to classify: it is partly a popular science book (ca. 50%) but also a manifesto for sustainable development, a collection of miniportraits of scientists, and wild speculation of future engineering applications. All of this is embedded in the Benyus' personal odyssey of figuring out what biomimetics is all about. Lack of clear focus makes this book a difficult read: in the middle materials science exposee Benyus has decided to describe rock climbing hobbies of some prominent materials scientists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biomimicry is Very Good, Very Detailed","review":"As other reviewers have pointed out, Biomimicry is a good to great book, but the level of detail is enough to make a non-scientist's head spin. Be prepared for in-depth discussions on cellular activity, computer theory, and energy transfer. The main point of the book is excellent, which is that as a human race, we will eventually have to start acting like the rest of the living world and only use what we have in a sustainable manner. Physically, our path of using more energy than the world can generate is simply not sustainable for long. The book is not one of those alarmist environmental-destruction-is-imminent books however, it actually has good ideas on directions to take for sustainable manufacturing and sustainable energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I ordered this book with great expectations based upon the excellent reviews that it had obtained. Personally I could not finish the book. I had wished for something that would speak of the philosophy of biomimicry. Instead I found a rapidfire, dotcom style, gee whiz book that runs without much depth (though much wide eyed wonder) and seems to spend an excessive amount of time on the personalities behind the science. When you read a thoughtful book on a new subject by an author who has a commnad over it, you can feel it after a few pages. This book, to me, did not deliver that feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"One viewer's opinion","review":"For me, Faulkner's gretest books - his most honestly hopeful, structurally complete, and stylistically genius works - were The Wild Palms, The Unvanquished, The Hamlet, and Go Down, Moses. All of these are ignored by this video. Instead the video (a recycled 80's vaguely European hash) skips from the dreary to the hopeless to the minor; the amount of time spent on the potboiler Sanctuary is one example. I am still waiting for a documentarian who sees the stereoptic whole of Faulkner and celebrates his place in our literature. Do the future of Faulkner study a favor and skip this one, especially if you're a teacher looking for help for your class. You'd be better off feeling your way through with your students than you would be turning to this rubbish for aid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but practical","review":"They are not the highest quality cases I've ever purchased, but for the price, they do the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it.","review":"I love Jump Blues, and this is great.

We're trying to keep our son away from too many cakes and cookies, ice creams and coca cola. We already know he gets fed cookies at his Abuela's all the time (he turns 1 this week). I would have much rather had a book that emphasised how yummy fresh fruit, vegetables and healthy meals are.

We are still working on boogers...apparently she does not agree that they are yucky! Ok the only criticism I have is that Coffee is not yucky to all little ones. I know it's weird, and I obviously don't let my 2 year old drink tons of coffee.

My 16 month old daughter absolutely adores them. I was disappointed by the content of this particular book. Things such as chicken, fish sticks, hamburgers, cookies and chocolate sauce are illustrated as being \\"yummy\\". We happen to be vegetarian so I wish I had known about the animals listed as food items. But beyond that, listing chocolate sauce, cookies and ice cream for this age group is risky. I don't plan on introducing those things to her diet yet so I'm planning on returning the book to Amazon.

How about listing apple sauce as yummy instead of chocolate sauce?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat idea, but not for vegetarians","review":"I and my son are both vegetarians.

We gave it away. We enjoy spending weekend mornings playing with our son while we drink our coffee and he eats his breakfast. I do not want him getting a wrong idea that, together with our coffee, we sneak in a random worm or a mud cake while he is not looking. The same goes for the spicy sauce picture, as he sees us eating spicy foods and also samples some. This book would simply confuse him. A good idea but some very wrong choices for specific examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but not for everyone","review":"This book has a cute premise and is adorably illustrated. Unfortunately, it seems the author didn't put much thought into making her work accessible to all families.

He loves the juxtaposition of the charming baby face smiling at burgers and grimacing at boogers, smacking his lips at spaghetti and gagging on worms, etc. He doesn't seem to have been led astray by any of it--only deeply amused and happy to read, and that's sufficient for me.

Over the past nine months we have taken this book everywhere with us.

Millar simply did not live an interesting life; he mostly sat around writing. Which is fine, but not worth spending almost 500 pages reading about. There are too many unedited interview quotations from friends and acquaintances who ramble on and on. The main fact I learned was how long-suffering he was in dealing with his mean and difficult wife.The photo section is bad as well: too many pictures of actors who portrayed Archer, not enough of the author himself.

Roberts' character Lord Edward Corinth is a pale (no pun intended) imitation of Sayers' wonderful Lord Peter Wimsey, right down to the aquiline nose and the habit of getting information by acting like a befuddled upper class twit. Verity Browne is a sort of Harriet Wimsey taken to the nth degree -- grating and unsympathetic, without any of Harriet's softer side.

The audio and visual programs are strangely poor considering there are so many inexpensive options out there.The content is also very thin but that fact is well hidden by confusing interfaces. Navigating this software is not easy.

I complained to the company about this and they basically told me that I was wrong for not liking their product. Also, the five language dictionary isn't very good either.

But boy, could he belt out a tune.

It is perfection from beginning to end I think the comparisons to Dwight Yoakam are unfair. Mike Ireland has a very different sound than Dwight Yoakam, and if one comes to this album expecting to hear the next Dwight Yoakam, they are going to be sorely disappointed. Mike's sound is more 60s countrypolitan, whereas Dwight's is straight-up honky-tonk.This is an emotionally-charged record about heartbreak. The listener can hear the ache and pain in Mike's voice as he sings about secrets, lost love, and tears. Anyone who has ever gone through a painful, messy breakup can relate to the feelings expressed in these songs. Anyone currently going through a painful, messy breakup owes it to themselves to get a copy of this album for some release and healing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one will knock you out.","review":"By all means, pick up this gem by Mike Ireland & Holler. It will get into your head, under your skin and stay there. If not for \\"World Cafe,\\" a very fine alternative music program on public radio, I never would have heard of Mike Ireland. I'm very glad I did. This CD has as much emotion as the best 1960s country hits and any of today's retro work, Dwight included. It's that good. Really."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Dog Wont Hunt","review":"What am I missing here? OK, Mike has a sweet enough voice, but to be valid, roots/alt country music has to have some edge to it. This CD is sandpaper smooth with nothing but slick rounded corners. And with a name like \\"Holler,\\" the backup group is guilty of monumental misrepresentation. Comparing this guy with Dwight Yokum -- as does one of the Amazon editorial reviewers --would be just plain laughable if it weren't such a travesty. Dwight should sue for slander. The melodies here are mostly jingles and the lyrics mostly lame.

I was quite impressed; every single last song on this album is so good it's worth playing on repeat all day. I was surprised that \\"The Pain Song\\" is considered the single of this album; in my opinion, \\"Baby Come On\\" and \\"Over and Out\\" are better. \\"As Pure as SIN\\" is more mellow, a forecast of the gentler songs heard of Prey and Judas Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful--don't waste your time","review":"I usually love M.L.Baxter. This book, however, stunk! Bad. The heroine was totally unlikable and a whiny baby (with a father complex). And, let's face it--things like getting married to the family \\"gardener\\" and then keeping the marriage a secret from family while you continue to live in the \\"big house\\" and he lives in the caretaker's cottage just don't happen in real life.

It is at once philosophical, poetic, and visually stunning. The text and images beautifully complement each other.

Without the score conversion chart it could more difficult for the test taker to gauge his/her improvement. Also buyer beware: it DOES NOT contain actual practice and test questions from previosly administered LSAT exams as do both the Princeton Review and Kaplan LSAT prep books. As a consumer this was not obvious to me. I was dissapointed in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as i wished it to be","review":"This is a great book to use for discussions with pre-teens and older. But instead of remaining objective at the end of the book, the author chooses to have a zero population slant.I have 8 well educated children who are an asset to the world...and they will be in the future. The book is wonderful until it begins to speak on population control. This is NOT a given. There are many who believe the way to overcome or end some of the worst problems this world faces, is to EDUCATE, and not only with knowledge but with compassion. When we teach children to be compassionate and teach them to THINK we will have generations who will change the problems in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"World Population to Double 5 times?","review":"It's great concept with equally beautiful illustrations. Unfortunately, Smith says that a village of 100 today will be a village of 200 in just fifty years. He continues this pattern until he asserts that a village of 100 today will be a village of 1600 people in just 250 years. He is suggesting that world population will double 5 times in the next 250 years? That means that our world population of 6 billion today will soon be an astounding 96 billion! That's strange because the United Nations, Green Peace, and the World Health Organization all predict that world population will top out at about 10 billion in the next 200 years. That's not even one doubling of our current population. Where in the world did David J. Smith get the idea that the world population will double 5 times? More to the point, what is he doing filling the minds of children with these Draconian predictions. Unconscionable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creating \\"world-mindedness\\"","review":"That is one teacher's description of what the book helps her to do. It is certainly good to learn about other cultures and develop empathy and compassion towards all. Nonetheless, it is the height of moral relativism to assume (teach) that all cultures are equally good. Look with an open mind towards the cultures of Somalia or Palestine, then look to the flag of the USA with renewed patriotism in your heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Facts Dulled By Unimaginative Presentation","review":"This may be a five-star concept, but the execution leaves much to be desired, particularly in the illustrations. The best that can be said is that the pictures are deeply colored and might make a good stained-glass project. However, the almost uniformly bird's-eye view of this \\"global village\\" fails to show much difference between the haves and have-nots, or, really, to illustrate the facts of any given page. We simply see a colorful village from the air... over and over. The very imagery that might make these facts come alive in a child's imagination is missing. Some sense of interaction - this is a village, after all! - would help. Instead of faces, we are given a fly-over. Thus, the facts remain mere lists, and not emotionally compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"There just aren't many books willing to tackle the huge subject of the world population and its composition as this one does. It achieves its goal with all age levels using colorful illustrations and examples on how people differ economically, culturally, and religiously. If the World Were a Village gives a valuable perspective to anyone inquiring about their relative place in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book/idea","review":"great idea for a book, to reduce the world to a 100-person village and give statistics about the members of the village, truly eye-opening especially for western kids who don't realize how much they have. only issue is, a bit dry so my 2nd grader lost interest fairly quickly, so I donated a copy to his school hoping they could make it part of the classroom experience"},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"This is a great idea for a book, but it really is not well written. The text is very dry. I agree with the other reviewer that the concepts are too difficult for the given age range (ages 4-8). But the biggest disappointment was the lack of imagination by the illustrator. While the artwork is colorful and creative, the pictures do not help to get the concepts across to the reader. They just seem to fill up space to make the book long enough to be worth publishing.

This film should be shown in classrooms everywhere!","review":"Not only is this a great piece of entertainment, but it also has some profound lessons to teach especially in our current state of world affairs. If only every world political leader, religious leader and even community leaders could heed the lessons from this film. It's a powerful reminder of the importance of laying aside hatred and replacing it with tolerance. We can belong to different tribes and cultures and yet view those differences as opportunities to learn from each other without having to resort to racism, bigotry and war. The film also teaches us that religion can be good, but we shouldn't fear putting aside old beliefs that no longer serve us and which only cause harm and injury to others in the name of God. This film would be a powerful teaching aid and springboard for some great classroom discussions on all of these topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"A great moving with outstanding talent.

It allows me to plug into many devices that wouldn't even accommodate the original adapter I had, and since it has a small cord attached it takes the pressure off the adapter and the input hole itself.

There are many products that can do that but what if you really need a RIGHT ANGLE 1/4 male plug which it claims to be? My receiver is hidden in a cabinet and there is no room for a straight 1/4 inch plug to go into the 1/4 inch headphone jack for me to attach a wireless headphone transmitter when the door is closed.

This volume spotlights the 1950s. Max Weinberg selected some of his favorite songs with his favorite drummers. Unfortunately, he wasn't able to get every song he wanted to use. The most obvious ommision is Elvis Presley's drummer D.J. Fontana. \\"Hound Dog\\" really should be here, but what can you do? Anyway, the rest of the songs are all great. Of course, a lot of them have great drum solos, but there are a few of them that have very subtle drumming which you really wouldn't take much notice of the drumming. But Max Weinberg knows more about drumming than the rest of us, so pay attention to the drumming in these songs. Even if you don't care about drumming, this is still a great album of 1950s rock and roll. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute toy","review":"I bought this for my 2 year old daughter but my 3 year daughter started using it to give her polly pocket's and littlest petshop pets rides on it, they spin around and around as she pulls it.

The buttons are extremely sensitive and were constantly getting bumped. The screen was nearly impossible to read. And the kicker, it was going through batteries in under 2 hours.I ended up returning this player and purchasing a SANDISK MP3 Player SDMX1512A10. After the rebate that was being offered at the time, it was only $15 more than the Macvision. I am not only much happier with the Sandisk player, I literally have no complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too cheap for its own good","review":"As other reviewers have stated: sometimes it's just too cheap to be worth it at all. This is an unbelievably poorly designed product -- sure, it looks great, it plays MP3s, it connects to your computer, fine. But the controls are so annoying (basics, like turning it on and getting it to play your songs is a study in frustration). The little toggle control on the side of it simply too flimsy to be at the center of all operations -- half the time you end up jiggling it by mistake and find yourself recording a .wav when you thought you were about to play a song. Spend a little more, get something that doesn't lack the most rudimentary user friendlyness."},{"rating":"2","title":"MacVision 256 MP3 Review","review":"We love the player - it holds just the right number of songs and you don't have a library to go through to find the one you're after.

If my folks heard those lyrics, they would take the radio away forever! Then the media did an absurd thing: they banned 3 of the best songs, \\"Work With Me Annie\\", \\"Sexy Ways\\" and \\"Annie Had A Baby\\". Of all the nerve! One night several of my friends & I went to see The Midnighters play at Houston's El Dorado Ballroom. We were white guys during this most segregated of times, and the El Dorado Ballroom was for Black's. But they let us in anyway. The guitar player for The Midnighters was my idol: Cal Green. He started wailing on about a 10 minute solo and I thought I had died and gone to heaven. Man, he was good. In Houston there were 2 excellent radio stations that played R&B: KYOK (DJ's - Dizzy Lizzy, Hotsy Totsy) and KCOH (DJ's - King Bee, Lonnie Rochan). What a time. What music.

I can honestly listen to this one all the way through. I must admit I like the first half of the alblum a little better. Also, the very racy song 'Annie had a baby' is included here as well. There are plenty more hard rockers included as well. For the oldies buff, the ORIGINAL (and I think - better) \\"Twist\\" make this one worth picking up. The sound quality is really good too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too small for standard yoga mats","review":"I purchased this yoga bag for my black manduka yoga matt, it was too small, about three inches too short.

She is able to use it on her 1:9 scale Breyer horses with relative ease. I was a little concerned with how well it would hold up during play, since some Breyer things are made more for looking at than playing with, but it seems to be fairly well constructed. I'm not sure how well it would hold up to excessive handling, but for the occasional putting on or taking off of various horses it seems to be holding up fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recomend","review":"I wanted to know more about Germany and it's people.

A kid in Ohio was nearly killed the other day doing a decline press on a Jones Machine without a spotter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly organized","review":"I found the book to be poorly organized.

All I can do is go to Italy for a week and say words like yellow corn and ask where the bank is \\"Dove' la banca?\\" If I was asked a question or wanted to converse about flowers I couldn't because well the disks don't even teach you how to say flower. No sentence building, no basics even to learn when to use il, lo or la. Don't even ask about the other disks because it just gets worse. Only two teach the very simple words and they speak so fast you don't learn correct pronounciation. Save your money and go buy an Italian text book and do the homework. I realy wished I would have researched before buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"This is the worst product I have wasted money on yet. Most of the program had errors. You had better know a little about computers WHEN you want to remove it. The format is sub-par. The extra disks are fairly worthless. DO NOT WASTE your money. GO with the Pimsleur or living language courses. This one is not only a joke, but it will put you off from learning Litaliano. I dont write reviews, but this product angered me so much I had too. Too bad there is not a 0 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, please don't buy","review":"Ok I'll make it short and clear: DO NOT BUY IT.It's a waste of time and money.it doesn't have a continuos course, and they don't teach you usefull sentenses.I'm still looking for a good software, but this I know, this one sucks very muchOh and the dictionary is terrible too, 'cause when u wanna know how u pronounce a word in italian, it says that this feature is only available in english.

I had to do some studying on the side to use it. I still didn't learn a thing. The second disk repeats the first disk's information in a more complicated fashion!

The fourth is Voyage in Italy, a travelogue with sights and sounds of Italy.The EuroTalk programs are very good values. As noted in other reviews, there is a big step between Talk Now and World Talk. I found the games useful teaching devices. The other disks are just gravy."},{"rating":"1","title":"instant immersion italian","review":"Most unfriendly user product I have ever encountered.

One thing I have learned is that mega pixels are not everything. I bought my father a 4MP minolta S414 and the pictures are not as sharp as my camera. I think that has something to do with the lense. The long zoom is very nice. Up until today I never printed out a picture bigger than 8X10 Today I paid for a picture to be blown up to 16X20 and it looks pretty darn good. Certain things like the hand grip and resolution could be improved (and they have been with the newer models) I was thinking of replacing this camera with something like the FZ20, FZ30 or the new 8MP samsung with the 3.5\\" screen. However after seeing how nice my 16X20 blow up turned out to be, I think I will keep it for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"I've been a fan of Janelle Taylor for many years, and I've really enjoyed her Historical romances. She's written a slew of them, and lucky us, they're all still available! But who knew her contemporaries are equally as wonderful? Valley of Fire is a compelling read with a sympathetic heroine and a yummy hero to die for. There's clever dialogue and sexy, emotion-drenched scenes. I was completely drawn into the story and couldn't put it down. The same wonderful writing that brings Ms. Taylor's Historicals to life brings her contemporaries to life as well. Try this one; you can't miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't even finish reading","review":"I used to love Janelle Taylor's books. I would buy each one as soon as it came out and read it in just a few days. I was happy to see one I never read available for free for my kindle and was in the mood for a romanace. If I remember correctly, it was one of her early works, rereleased. they shouldn't have bothered. It was horrible. It starts out with too many pages of the woman's thoughts and her life, then she is passed out and stranded on a road in the middle of nowhere. A man on a bike comes up and the reader gets even more pages of his thinking...again way too many! I never even got to the part where she wakes up and they begin talking. Whatever they would say to each other I already knew, because I had read their thoughts. The meeting was a contrived cliche and I didn't care about either of the characters. I love reading, and it's hard for me to not finish a book once I have started it, but I had no problem deleting it from my kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"I was too disgusted to keep reading by a couple of pages in. The writing was mediocre, but more than that, the main character was horribly annoying. The book literally starts with page upon page of the main character sitting in her broken down car having an inner monologue about how anxious she is about being asked to edit her golden writing (oh, yes, the main character is a novelist, of course!) to appeal more widely to the lowbrow average population. I want to just whack the character upside the head, but I will settle for putting the book down and warning others away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salt Mill","review":"This is a complete 'rip off'. Over priced and barely functions.

It's so refreshing to have a good story combined with such beautiful language."},{"rating":"1","title":"borrrrrrrring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I couldn't have been more bored throughout the entire novel.

Life's too short for poorly written bad stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it a case of the Emperor's Clothing?","review":"On the back of this book are reviews that simply do NOT apply to what is written on the pages of The Thirteenth Tale. After reading this, it is clear to me that anyone believing this novel stands on its own, or compares to Jane Eyre has either been snookered by bogus reviews (believing there is substance where there is none) or they have been bought. In truth the pages offer little more than rambling, implausibility, insults to the mind and atrocious grammar. Characters drop in and fall away when they get in the way of cohesion. They are either fragmented or run on and on and on as do her sentences. Not even my reading glasses could take the absurdity of this book, breaking and falling to the floor after chapter 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I don't usually run out and immediately purchase a recently released book, but made an exception for this book based on reviews I read on Amazon. I was so totally disappointed with not only the story but the author's excruciatingly derivative narrative. Her obsession with Bronte, Collins and Austen only made me realize that she is merely a \\"wannabe\\" who has little of the talent or imagination of those literary giants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now really!","review":"This book is a mess. Dumb plot, one dimensional characters-each one more aggrevating than the next-overwritten and pretensious prose. I'm old enough to remember the REAL gothic novels-this ain't one of them.

Leprosy of the spirit, that is.This review is for people who still care about what they put into their minds and hearts; all others may skip it.I was intrigued by this book's story line. In my innocence, I didn't realize that such shocking horror awaited me in the pages of what looked to be a very promising story. It started out so beautifully, but abruptly altered.The author has turned her talent and lovely writing style to filth and depravity. I could not read beyond the first seventy or so pages. I returned the book to Amazon.I do not understand why anyone would write such awful things. I also do not understand why anyone would publish it or want to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"I love gothic novels and this one does not disappoint. Beautifully written with rich characters and a mesmerizing plot. I was pulled into the story and couldn't put it down.

And I think of this one often."},{"rating":"1","title":"bored me","review":"Way not a fan of the ending.

But for me, the plot unfolds too slowly, the underlying themes of abuse and mental illness too melancholy, and the characters too bizarre to relate to. Although it held my interest to the end, this book doesn't make my top ten list for 2006 and is grossly over-hyped."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few simple comments","review":"So many others before me have described the plot to this novel, so I must only write, as one who reads about 200 or more books a year, that this was one of the best fiction books that I have read in many a moon. Wonderful characters, a tightly-webbed plot and great writing really make this book a fabulous read---bizarrely hilarious and disturbing at the same time, The Thirteenth Tale grabs your attention to the very last word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it so much I read it twice","review":"Beautifully and elegantly written. A mystery you can't put down. After I learned the ending, I started from the beginning and read it all over again. Gave this book to every reader I know for a Christmas gift. I listened to it on CD as well and the reading is magnificent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a classic, but still a good read","review":"I had heard great things about this book, but I still went into it not knowing what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised and sufficiently engrossed in the story that I managed to read it during my commute, finishing in a few days. The story within a story was very interesting and intriguing - I did not know what to expect or where it was going. That said, some aspects, such as the author's subplot seemed contrived and unbelievable and the ending dragged on a tad bit longer than necessary. Nonetheless, definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored me to tears","review":"This book bored me to tears. The characters were flat and there was not enough intrigue to keep me interesred in their lives. In short, I stopped reading about 1/3 the way through because it was becoming more of a chore than a pleasure to read it. Don't get me wrong, the author's use of the English language is beautiful and I enjoyed reading her prose. What I did not enjoy was the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The power of marketing?","review":"I have nothing against Ms. Diane Setterfield.This book should get 5 stars for the writing, but 1 star for the plot.It is very slow. I managed to finish this book only because I was on vacation.At the beginning of the book, there is an introduction of a twin ofMargaret where Margaret finds out by accident. I thought Margaret'stwin sister shall play a role in the later part of the book. Yet thisisn't happening.It seems like most people like this book. Perhaps I am a minority.However, if this is a good \\"mystery\\" book, what do you say on any mysterybook by Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, and David Cray?Meanwhile, I did some research on this book and another title called\\"The Interpretation of Murder\\". There was an article on Wall StreetJournal about these two books recently.Eventually, I found out marketing play an important role, i.e. themillion dollars auction, the promotion by local bookstores, etc.I wonder if it is the success of the marketing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The good thing is the cover","review":"I tried very hard to reach the final pages of this boring novel.

It's been awhile since I've been so thrilled with a book and so satisfied with an ending. This book isn't perfect, but it's pretty darn close.The Thirteenth Tale is a beautifully written book. The flow of the words, the imajery, the characters, the mystery, make it impossible to put down. It is a book for lovers of books. It reads like a classic and is filled with a dark mystery like a classic.And like a classic, it takes a while to get into. This is my only criticism. It's slow going at the beginning. But once the story has you in it's grasp, it keeps you intrigued til the very end.I will be adding The Thirteenth Tale to my short list of favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Paradigm Shift","review":"Story of a young woman (the narrator) who is summoned by a wildly famous author of popular fiction, to take down & write the real story of her life. The older woman starts by telling the tale of twins Adeline & Emmaline and their growing up.This book surprises us with a paradigm shift similar to the effect of the Life of Pi. And like Pi, it was a little slow to me in the middle. When I look back, it wasn't at all, of course.This is a must read and, if I haven't already given things away, will have you wanting to immediately reread it. At the very least, you will think about it for days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story!","review":"I read the book and enjoyed it so much that I wanted to sit back and let someone else tell it to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll be haunted by this book","review":"I do believe in ghosts - especially the ones that haunt you from the pages of a good story. Ms. Setterfield's characters are now haunting my memory. This novel is fresh and unusual and yet there is something comfortably familiar in the narrative style. Others have mentioned \\"Rebecca\\" as a similar work and I think there is some truth in that; both novels live on in your mind after you finish them but The Thirteenth Tale definitely stands on its own literary feet, haunting the reader with the unforgettable story of Vida Winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would make a terrific movie!","review":"I can totally see this book as a movie. The author's detail and characters just beg to be on the big screen. It is a deep, mysterious, horrifying story that keeps you enthralled from the beginning to end. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"well-written, but disturbing plot","review":"I bought this book with much anticipation, after having heard so many good things about it. It is a well-written book. However, there are several themes that bothered me enough to make me stop reading - themes such as incest, abuse, and overall dysfunction. These things distracted and bothered me to the point of not being able to look past them and enjoy the wonderful language and atmosphere in the book. I feel the book would have been much better without the disturbing content."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"I read this last year for a book club choice, and it was torture. I will say that I'm not a huge fan of women's gothic novels and I recognize that this one did follow that formula, so if that's your thing, you may enjoy this. That said, I still can appreciate good writing, and there was nothing to appreciate here. This book had all the worn out characters you'd expect in gothic - the strange hermetic heiress, the hostile housekeeper, the zombie-like limo driver, the out-in-the-middle-of-nowhere estate, the writer without focus. I simply cannot share others' views and compare this novel with classic gothic writers, nor would I recommend this to anyone I like..."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This is a rare miss from Amazon reviews, I'm definitely in the minority. I finished it out of pure stubborness. Really not a likeable soul in the book. Incest, feral children, self-abuse, Mary Poppins (without the flying), the moors, a biddable maiden narrator, creaking manor homes, a \\"ghost story\\" without a ghost...just painful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book with many layers","review":"The Thirteenth Tale is a terrific tale on the most basic level, that of the simple written word, but it is also very good on another level, that of the mind. Our book club chose this volume for the month of July and we were amazed at the many \\"layers\\" of discussion that developed. The story itself was intriguing, but we talked for a couple hours about meanings and interpretations.Without ruining the story, one of our biggest disagreements was about who died in the fire. It could be interpreted two ways and, seemingly, there was no way to prove one or the other right or wrong. This is the perfect type of book for discussion-- the reader needs to be able to marshall her facts, present them and then defend them if necessary. Only the author can say.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"Loved this book.

Basically, I didn't care what happened. Can't believe I kept reading as far as I did--guess I wanted to like it. Kept waiting for something really interesting to happen. It never really did. Two stars for the fact I did get 3/4 of the way through. Next time I will follow my 100-page rule. Life's too short!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous and different!","review":"Very well writen I thought. Loved the characters and the way that they looked at each others life.

After reading it and then listening to it (library copies) a couple years later I just bought a copy for myself. The readers both do a splendid job."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Language of the Tale","review":"Beautiful language, fluid narration: Setterfield's novel is a series of lyrically constructed sentences that unfold the story of Vida Winter and the biographer who unravels her deepest secret --- a tale full of sorrow, yearning for forgiveness and eventually achieving redemption. Although at times convoluted, the sheer power of the use of the English language in an unpretentious yet impressive fashion ranks this piece as one of the satisfying reads of recent years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...","review":"Thank God for books like this. This book shouldn't just be called a novel but literature. There are so many books that are good but are purely commercial.This one is pure beauty and is written with love and true attention to all aspects of the story - the truly wonderful 3 dimensional characters - the amazing story that grabs you and doesn't let go.This book is meant to truly be savored. Allow yourself to give time to this one and escape into its magical spell. Yes it is a ghost story, suspense story and intense physological study.But most importantly it is beautifuly written and is so much more than all that - I would call this one a modern day classic.High kudos!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling plot; engaging complex characters; evocative, thoughtful writing style.","review":"This is one of the best fiction books I have read in the last few years. While it is probably classified as a mystery, it is much more than a whodunit. The characters are fully developed and you really start to care about them and sympathize with them. The writing is at the same time easy to read and thought-provoking. A real pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally Satisfying.","review":"Who cares about the style... the plot... the writer. This is one great read. You finish the last pages, you close the book, you think to yourself of what you've just read and breathe a sigh of satisfaction. \\"Well done,\\" you'll say... \\"I liked that,\\" you'll say. \\"who should I lend this to first\\" you'll wonder. New books are a dime a dozen. Keepers are rare. This one is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite book","review":"This is absolutely the best story I have ever read. It's a story within a story. I can't wait for any sequels.

Otherwise I would highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Book Worth Reading","review":"Diane Setterfield has a writing style that makes it hard to put this book down. The Thirteenth Tale is an excellent novel that has many twists and turns throughout, ending with an unexpected turn that makes your jaw drop open.

I kept this book for my private collection instead of donating it to the library like I so often tend to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that makes you remember why you love to read","review":"This book is incredible in every way.

I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and lumbering!","review":"I read the great reviews and purchased the audio copy of this book. It was a great premise and could have been a great book but it was so slow and lumbering I had to make myself finish it because I had paid for it! The story itself was of interest but it could have been told in far less time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not on a par with all the hype ...","review":"I was sadly disappointed in this book. I all but sat at the store awaiting its arrival and I'm a huge fan of classic literature and love a great story. The first few pages held promise (reminding me a lot of Shadow of the Wind - which I absolutely loved). The hype about this book was huge, but the reality lackluster. The writing style and form is excellent, so no qualms there. The author just needs a better story to display her talents. The plot fizzles to the ridiculous with the ending being untenable, patchy and just, uh, downright silly. I just didn't buy it at all (won't divulge the \\"spoiler\\"). I had a very hard time caring one iota for Vida Winter, she is just patently unlikeable (as are her parents). While conflict in a character is great, you have to at least care somewhat about them. I also found the main character rather ho hum. Overall, disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, Trite, Trite","review":"All I could think from beginning to end was how incredibly trite the whole thing was. It's a fast airport read I guess, but I don't even know if I would recommend it for that. I suppose I wanted to know the outcome, but I figured out the \\"twist\\" long before it was revealed and it made finishing the book a chore. Super light reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I ordered this book through Amazon because of the large number of 4-5 star reviews. Plus, the plot summary seemed interesting. However, I was very disappointed with this book.I had two major problems with The Thirteenth Tale: First, the entire book is \\"overwritten\\". It's a bit over 400 pages and I couldn't help thinking it could easily have been written in 250 pages. There is just too much fluff. For example, the author dedicates 3 whole pages to describing how a woman accidently sewed an extra heel in a pair of socks. To make matters worse, this had very little to do with the story. It could have been described in a paragraph. The second problem has to do with the ending. I don't want to spoil it for people who haven't read the book, so I'll just say it was a very far-fetched, hard-to-believe ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit slow, but ultimately satisfying","review":"It took me a few months to get through this book. It was slow in spots, and though the story was interesting, perhaps it didn't suck me in as much as I'd expected (or hoped) it would. I'm glad I stuck with it, though. Without giving too much away, there are some pretty huge twists in the last few pages that make the slow journey of getting to that point worthwhile. I found the ending to be satisfying (and, more importantly, plausible in the context of all that had come before).If you like fast-paced action, this is not the book for you. But if you can appreciate a story that unfolds slowly, then you just might enjoy The Thirteenth Tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent !!","review":"One of the few books that I have read that I rate with Katherine Neville's \\"The Eight\\". I truly await her next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read For A Wintery Day","review":"This is a page turner novel. While I was reading it, I felt as if I was in a cozy room with a blazing fire in the fireplace and lots of comfy chairs. Snow is falling outside. The novel had the feel of something written many, many years ago. There is incest and murder in the story. At the end there is a happy ending or maybe it is better to say the possibility of future happiness. The ending is not a downer.A young woman is hired to write a biography of a famous reclusive writer. The writer's biography is the basis of the story, but there are other things going on. Almost all the mysteries in the novel are solved.This is a very entertaining book and a good one for a book discussion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"This debut novel reminded me of a Charles Dickens book. It is a well-told story that never disappoints its reader in either character development or a plot filled with suspense. I truly couldn't put it down - it is a book to read by the fire long into the night. I hated to see it end because I knew it wouldn't be there waiting for me to read. This is not serious fiction like \\"Suite Francaise,\\" but it is truly mesmerizing. Diane Setterfield has a true gift that I hope will result in another book very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Well-told Tale","review":"I found this book most satisfying, in every respect. It was beautifully written, full of interesting characters and had enough of the supernatural element in it to be entertaining. Especially appealing was the quirkiness of almost everyone and the literate quality of the writing. Brava, Diane"},{"rating":"1","title":"unsympathetic characters","review":"No thanks. This book is full of psychotic, inbred half-wits. The two main characters take themselves so seriously. Not a badly-written book--just unsympathetic characters. Not a one I liked.Emily Bronte could pull off these characters: I don't know how she did it but she did.There's no time structure in this book: I had no idea of dates and ages of the characters. I had no idea what style of dress to put them in in my head. I'd put 'em in Edwardian dress and then find out I should put them in flapper gear.If it's modern day, how come the main character still relies on basically quill pens and carrier pigeons? I didn't like this--at least address why she doesn't use cell phones and computers. If it isn't present day, I need to know this.Did not finish listening. Feh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning Literature","review":"This book is the real deal. A wonderful story, masterfully told; a book that will be as good in 30 years as it is today; a piece of literature that will stand the test of time. Much has been written about the plot in other reviews so I won't repeat that, but this is a book for all readers who love books and appreciate a complex story, elegantly told. Much like a fine bottle of wine, it is to be savored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Read for Mystery Lovers","review":"The style is strong and enticing, but that was after a slow start. After that it clinches both suspense and the heart. Setterfield knows how to yank and jerk a reader's chain. I found I had a hard time putting the book to rest midway to the end. Expect a surprise nevertheless. This is a quality read perfect for mystery lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got a little hard to move through, but well worth it when I did","review":"I keep very few books that I buy (pass on to others, donate etc)but I kept this one! Really like the storyline, not your run of the mill tale. Would recommend!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous prose","review":"You absolutely must love the written word to appreciate The Thirteenth Tale. The old woman's hands were a \\"jumble of knuckles and rubies in her lap\\" - can you see it? Yes, the book wanders and meanders at times. It is reminiscent of novels from the nineteenth century, when mood was everything; when a reader had time to immerse him/herself in a pool of language and atmosphere and just float awhile.I withheld a fifth star because, in my opinion, the ends were too neatly tied up, all the book-long agonies too quickly assuaged, all the wounds too successfully bandaged for the end to fulfill the promise spied in the first few chapters. But, to be fair, there really is no good way to end a good story.Overall, I think I would describe Ms. Setterfield's style as equal parts Charlotte Bronte and Joyce Carol Oates, with a bit of Ruth Rendell in there for good measure. I anxiously await her next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST novels I've read in a LONG time!","review":"Beautifully written! This is one of the best adult books I have read in a long time. The language and writing is so amazing. Well done, well written and a fabulous story. Immediately interesting and woven. I've recommended it to several people -- all returning with rave reviews as well. I only wish Diane Setterfield had another novel to read. I can't impress enough that this story is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle price is higher than the actual book!","review":"I have only started reading this novel and am thus far enjoying it. I need to state though, how ridiculous it is that the Kindle version is $3 more than the paperback edition when the publisher expends little to no money in publishing the digital version. Amazon needs to be more aggressive with these greedy publishers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"B.O.R.I.N.G.","review":"I've been reading this book for what feels like an eternity! This book is incredibly boring and I honestly don't care at all about any of the characters. The only reason I continue reading it is because once I start a book I feel like I have to finish it. I'll be really glad when I finally finish this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too far fetched.","review":"The description of this book was very inticing. It started out good, easy to follow with an interesting story. Two thirds into it the events became too improbable and the characters unbelievable. Overall it was an unhappy story, that made me feel it was a waste of time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Slow","review":"I can't believe there are SO many positive reviews for this book! Am I reading the same book as everyone else? Blah, blah, blah - This story seems to drag on forever and not in a good way! Soooooo Very BORING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Disappointed!","review":"After reading all the favorable reviews on this book I was really anxious to read it. However, I had great difficulty plowing through it. In no way would I compare this to Jayne Eyre. I am a librarian, love to read , and had to force myself to finish the book. It was confusing, vague, and tedious. The characters all seemed superficial. I would not recommend it. I was totally disappointed and found it to be a long read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bronte? Ha - more like VC Andrews","review":"This book was VERY poor. The opening 8 pages (available to read on Amazon) are atrocious and I almost stopped reading the book there and then. The characters are not well defined, the writing is sloppy and amateurish. The plot makes no sense as a 'mystery' and the surprise is falsely manufactured, not to mention improbably stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is why I don't read modern fiction.","review":"Because books like this are what I always seem to end up with - psychotic characters and disturbing plot lines that make me feel like scrubbing myself clean afterward. This book seemed promising at the beginning, but quickly descended into the type of scandalous trash that you'd expect to see on one of those horrible TV talk shows. At least you can turn off the TV - and put down the book. Which is exactly what I did. At least I know not to give Diane Setterfield one more minute of my valuable time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfectly dreadful book NO STARS DESERVED !!!","review":"If you loved Jane Eyre and Rebecca, avoid this book. It's hackneyed, poorly written, boring, full of overused cliches. Going by the rave reviews, I bought a hardback copy when it first came out and was really disappointed. Of course, I didn't care for Deep End of the Ocean or Lovely Bones so that may give you an idea of my tastes.However, if you like Nora Roberts and Danielle Steel, this is right up your alley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I thought for sure this book was going to be good but it was really difficult to finish it.

It's probably not one of my favorite books of all time, but it was one that I really looked forward to curling up and reading any chance I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I found the disturbing nature of Adeline very interesting, the parts of the book that described the twins as children was page turning. I would have liked more of a twisted ending. I wasn't really expecting a happy ending for this story and having Vida Winter's just die wasn't enough of a punch for me. I had my hopes built up for some jaw dropping ending and I was disappointed. I found Margaret very boring, and hated the parts of the book where we left Vida Winter's story to talk about Margaret's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to pick it up!","review":"Another overly wordy book. There is nothing that motivates me to pick this up and read. I am about one third of the way through it and keep hoping it will get better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"If you can make through the first 10% of the book (a lot of description, D. Setterfield describes almost every movement of each finger of every character :) It is a novel after all). So if you'll make through the beginning of the book, you'll be captured by the story and won't be able to abandon the novel until you'll get to the end of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut with twists and turns","review":"The Thirteenth Tale revolves around Margaret Lea, a book collector's daughter who works in the family bookstore and occasionally writes biographies. Margaret is summoned out of the blue by world famous author Vida Winter to write her biography. Until then, Vida's true life story had been a carefully guarded secret of great public interest. Vida quickly draws Margaret and the reader in with her suspenseful story full of scandal, murder and intrigue. Diane Setterfield does a wonderful job of setting the dark, gothic tone of the novel and introducing many twists and turns that I did not see coming. I would have given this book a much higher rating had it not been for the sub-plot regarding Margaret's obsession over a twin that died at birth. I found the story line a detraction from an otherwise decent book. Other than the sub-plot, an entertaining and quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"entangled","review":"just the name gets you! but as you get near the center of this spider's web, the hold you feel is much stronger then one might expect.

I feel in love with the reading immediately. When it was finished I started at the beginning and listened again.I loved it.Great!Now, I want to read this author's other books"},{"rating":"2","title":"Did not want it to end!","review":"Reading The Thirteenth Tale is like eating a delicious piece of gourmet chocolate...each bite needs to be savored and you are sorry when it is done. I was captivated by the beautiful writing in this book and carried away to mist covered mansions by the mysteries and secrets shared by the characters each time I turned a page. Like Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights and Rebecca, I have added this book to my list of favorites. Excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped. I expected a lot more.","review":"I read this for my book club. I was in the minority, but I couldn't stand The Thirteenth Tale. I was excited to read it, but after the first few pages it became a chore. Setterfield has an extensive vocabulary, but she choked the life and mystery out of her writing with her abundance of details. It was also highly repetitious, Margaret frequently highlighted what was \\"important\\" from her interviews with Vida, and through Hester's diary she retold huge sections of text without adding new information.Having Margaret who lives in the present day receive and send hand written correspondence to business people bothered me. The author clearly loves gothic novels, but it did not work in a modern setting.Not to mention I had a good idea what the main plot twist was, long before it was revealed.I just can't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails!","review":"I like to give positive reviews for an author's hard work if I can, and I like to hold on to the books I have enjoyed. In fact I usually like almost everything I read. I hate to say that I really couldn't get this book to the used book store fast enough. I had such high hopes too__I loved the cover art, the title and the premise. The story even started out intriguingly, but lost ground quickly. The triteness of the good twin/evil twin device, the elements thrown in for shock value, and the general meandering of the plot towards the end all just made me wince. It was really painful to me to me to finish it. Even though I didn't find it as bad as \\"Bridges of Madison County\\" (my choice for the worse book ever!), this book makes it to my personal OHUP list (over-hyped, under-performed)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read","review":"This is a very entertaining book.

It pulled on all my emotions and kept me in the middle of this story. Powerful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW, SLUGGISH & TEDIOUS","review":"The narrator's personal story was boring & tedious, & became \\"filler\\" to the supposedly real story of the reclusive writer. I did stick with it to the end by speed reading over the repetitive stuff (and there's a lot)but I wouldn't do it again. Ultimately the story just wasn't much of a mystery or interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's no Jane Eyre","review":"This turgid, overblown, yet ultimately soporific tale is not aided by the unbearably pretentious accents of the two readers. Their plummy tones sound at turns angry and bored, and never deviate from these two modes. I am not surprised that this tale--which sounded promising based upon its advance publicity, which likened it to a rich Victorian mystery/romance--would have the life leached out of it by the windy self-consciousness of an academic-turned-writer. Only a handful of them are actually able to write clearly, much less compellingly, and Setterfield is not one of the handful.I spent many a tortured hour on long drives trying to drum up some interest in this story, and trying to ignore the absolutely nerve-jangling reading style (so slow, to boot) but finally left the tale at disc 11 (out of 13). I almost never do this, but finally realized I needed to cut my losses and just start listening to something I'd actually enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it! for people who like mysteries which slowly reveal itself","review":"I have to admit that at the beginning was quite boring. However, it just gets better and better when the story goes on. At the end, when i finished the last page, the story was just stuck in my mind. absolutely love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the read","review":"Have you ever read a book that you knew you liked, you just weren't sure how much (like does it rank in with the best books you've ever read?) That was this book for me. I come across them from time to time. This book pulled me right in, but there were parts that I didn't enjoy reading. Why we really needed to know about Margaret beyond the fact that she was a twin was beyond me. I didn't feel any of that really added to the story (except her research stuff). The ending was not what I was expecting, and I wasn't exactly sure how believable it was. And what happened to Charles? Were did he go? I hate loose ends!! But, overall I enjoyed the story. Worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"Sorry to buck a trend. I didn't like it. Read Michael Cox's books. He is truly Dickensien in his ability to conjure up that time and ambience and have a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I read so many good reviews of this book that I had to get it for the Halloween season. It begins with an interesting and mysterious premise but soon evolves into pages of story with little excitement. I am at the last 5o pages of the book and perhaps I will find out why everyone else found this book so good. An antique book seller and his daughter operate a dusty old shop with valuable books. The daughter is invited by one of the top authors of the day to write her biography although she has been a recluse and resists others attempts to find out the truth of her life. The common thread between the author and biographer is that they are both twins. I am married to an identical twin and I am baffled by the excessive concentration on this one topic. Wait for it to go on the discount table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put them all in the asylum and be done with it","review":"This book did not captivate me and made me wonder what all the 5 star reviewers have read previously. I enjoyed the beginning and the description of life in the bookstore. Other than that it it fell flat for me and was rather predictable. The twins needed a good spanking and maybe the author too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It draws from lots of great stories, many clearly referenced within the book, but everything was fresh, original, and engrossing. I'm not often a mystery reader, but I thought this was great. Setterfield presented enough suggestions to get me thinking but never entirely certain of how things all fit. And when things were revealed or did fall into place it was entirely satisfying. While parts of it were ambiguous, this was done in a way that is satisfying to the reader, leaving us comfortable either with uncertainty or filling in our own assumptions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing writing","review":"The real beauty of this book is the superb writing. The words sem almost magical, and they immediately trap you into this story. All through the book you wonder whether or not the old woman telling the story is, in fact, telling the truth or just making up a tale. Sometimes the writing is so excellent, you don't really care; you just want to go on reading! There is suspense and mystery, and a bit of the supernatural (possibly) in the book, but everything makes sense in the end, and all of the plot threads appear to be nicely fit together. I sincerely hope that this author graces us with another book of this quality in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tale holds you spellbound from start to finish!","review":"I have just read this book again for about the 5th or 6th time since I purchased it in 2006. With each reading, I enjoy it even more than the last time I read it; it's the only book I've ever read more than twice. I know the plot and the unexpected twist, but it's the author's words that draw me in each time. Each sentence is carefully crafted. There are no \\"boring parts.\\" The ending is not abrupt (which I really dislike), and ties up all loose ends. I find something new each time I read it, there are no wasted words. The Thirteenth Tale is my favorite book. A good wintertime read when the weather is cold and dreary....goes well with a cup of cocoa, a cozy blanket, and a fire in the fireplace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gothic in flavor","review":"Some elements of this book felt rather V.C. Andrews to me because they were so lurid. However, it was a very interesting tale within a tale and the characters are quite intriguing. The tone is very gothic and that made the novel seem a bit strange at times as the modern language was a bit jarring in contrast with the tone. The resolution, though, was very satisfying and the novel made for quite a page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Best Read in Recent History!","review":"A slow and somewhat uninteresting start, I was sure this was going to be a 3 star book at best. By a quarter ways through, I was positively hooked.

The excessively bookish young woman only has a few obscure biographical pamphlets under her belt and has never even read Ms. Winter's books. Margaret is intrigued by the secretive author and sees mirrored in her some of her own family secrets.I was immediately sucked into Vida Winter's tale; It has it all - secrets, insanity, incest, obsession, murder, ghosts... the carefully plotted and paced story never disappointed me, and for once, I did not see the plot twist at the end.

It seemed to have all the ingredients for an uplifting experience. But no, the more it developed, the more it lost its potential.

Many times it was very nice reading. However, the story makes you wonder \\"so what?\\". This is not a thriller. This is not a ghost story. It's not fantasy.

For an alternative read, I recommend The Observations by Jane Harris (try it--you'll thank me)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and uninspired","review":"To counter the avalanche of praise heaped on this book, I'd like to add a couple of comments. This book is an uneasy agglomeration of an Anita Brookner-style heroine/narrator and a gothic romance (more Victoria Holt, say, than Charlotte Bronte). Setterfield's prose style doesn't approach Brookner's level, and the gothic storyline seemed both underwritten -- particularly in terms of dialogue -- and mechanical. SPOILER: I can't seem to read a novel these days without encountering incest as a plot device. Or strange twins. Or strange Siamese twins. Yesterday's exotica is today's cliche."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Rehash of all Gothic Romance Novels","review":"I was waiting to read this book due to an excellent synopsis and reviews. Upon reading it, the first 3 chapters held me enthralled with its gothic mood and loved Lea's love of books. However, after the 3rd chapter, the storyline became very \\"syrupy\\"...it was too inundated with all gothic themes that I feel was somehow borrowed from other classic and/or romantic gothic authors, such as Bronte, Collins, Walpole, even contemporary authors such as Holt and Whitney. Veda Winter seemed too much of a theatrical character to be believed. I'd much rather have read more of Lea's story than Veda's.

Very good structure to the story: great. The setting was magnificent, the sense of place such that I imagined the castle, the plot is intriguing and full of suspense. Sibling rivalry and \\"twinship\\" are beguilingly portrayed. What kept me from giving this 5 stars were the heterosexual and homosexual references, which I admit to being too prudish to totally enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best novel I have read in a while","review":"Pretty much from the first chapter, this book was extremely hard to put down.

A bit slow in parts but a great story! Mystery story, love story and a bit of a thriller all in one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Eyre with a twist","review":"This was a very engaging story. Written in the style of a Gothic novel, this story is very reminiscent of Jane Eyre, with a unique twist. The secret to the story is revealed to the reader as the main character figures it out, in a very realistic way.What prevented this book from getting 5 stars was what I felt to be an unnecessary subplot that only served to bog the story down. I understand that our main character needed a \\"hook\\" of some kind to be convinced to write the biography she's been charged with writing, but I felt that Setterfield took the \\"ghost story\\" aspect of her lost twin too far.That would not stop me from heartily recommending this book to anyone who likes Gothic novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impossible to put down!","review":"This one goes in my top five of all time. The story kept me turning page after page and if I wasn't able to be reading it, I was dying to get back to it.

Mrs. Winter tells the story of Angelfield, an avoided house that was home to spooky twin girls that terrorized the village. The manor was run by their father, a recluse that never got over the unconventional love he had for his sister. Mrs. Winter's tale, along with Diane Setterfield's intriguing writing, will draw you in as you are told the stories of Angelfield and its inhabitants.The Thirteenth Tale is definitely for book lovers. My favorite quote is:\\"There is something about words. In expert hands, manipulated deftly, they take you prisoner. Wind themselves around your limbs like spider silk, and when you are so enthralled you cannot move, they pierce your skin, enter your blood, numb your thoughts.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a can't put down book","review":"Being a lover of books, the descriptions that she used and narratives that she gave captivated me.

The middle was good, though not quite as compelling. I felt like it took me a little while to get into it each time I picked it up, but then read tons in each sitting. However, because it was 650+ pages long, that still meant I had to \\"re-get into it\\" several times. It was worth it, though, I'd say. The plot/point was all about the character development, in my opinion, and I thought there could have been some tweaks, and that a little bit of it probably could have been left out (I get the ode to medicine and I liked the suspenseful parts, but I do not need every medical detail just b/c the author is a doctor), but overall, it was well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mysterious, bookish, and gothic","review":"I loved this book. It's mysterious, gothic, and bookish, and I read it in a beautiful,quiet, mysterious place -- Mendocino, CA. I love those moments in life where you become deeply immersed in a book while and the experience converges with a special place and atmosphere you experienced while you read it. The combination can be memorable and intoxicating, to the point where I would consider reading this book in Mendocino to BE an important event in my life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read! Kept my full attention!","review":"I loved this book. It really kept my attention. Very different. A little quirky, but that's what made it so creative. I would recommend it highly and I look forward to Ms. Setterfield writing another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it - didn't want it to end!","review":"Loved everything about this book and cannot wait for her to come out with another! I read many books and this is the best one I have read in quite awhile. Wonderfully written characters and the story always keeps you guessing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Thirteenth Tale: A Disappointment","review":"At first glance, this book looked very interesting: a reclusive, dying novelist choosing an unknown writer to share her life secrets. Moreover, the secrets she promised to reveal seemed to be very exciting. However, even though Ms. Setterfield is a talented writer, her novel failed to deliver. At times the novel moved very slowly, as unimportant details were given too much attention. Most importantly, the story was not that enthralling -- the mysteries of this woman's life were not that interesting. I suppose that I was expecting something different from this book, but I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I have to finish reading this book...","review":"If you like reading books with a zillion old english references that you will have NO CLUE of their meaning..... Then this book is for you. What a weird depressing novel. 10 bucks and a few hours I'll NEVER see again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down.","review":"This book has gotten a lot of undeserved hype. I managed to finish reading it but with some difficulty. Parts were quite compelling but much of it seemed contrived. I found I did not like any of the characters, which is not to say you have to like the characters to enjoy a book, but they all seemed shallow, self absorbed and soulless.The end of the book dragged on much longer than needed with unnecessary information as if the author attempted to tie it up with a bow for presentation, not content.I had high hopes for this book but it did not meet my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful gothic tale","review":"It took a while to get into the book, but once you stop judging, you were engrossed. This is a really lovely book, and the writing was so beautiful. Story about siblings Charlie and Isabelle, then Isabelle's twins, Adeline and Emmaline. There is an unique twist at the end, which blew my mind. I don't know which twin survived, which is part of the charm of the book. The book is completely bewitching, the writing is stellar. One of my favorite books. If there is a flaw, it is narrator, Margaret's sentimentality over Aurelius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written book","review":"This is a beautifully written book. Strong writing. Could not put down. Certainly not all believable, but did not care. Felt swept away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, I think this book is highly overrated","review":"I wanted to like it. I did. It gets great reviews, and it seems like the kind of book I'd enjoy. But all it has going for it is a meandering and anachronistic plot, a cast of characters that are ultimately unrealistic and cliched, and a finale that is not so much moving as it is dull and devoid of meaning.The main difference between the protagonist and the characters the author aspires to have her be like is that she lacks a personality and any kind of gumption. She's a dull, plodding spinster with no interests, talents, or friends, and I found it impossible to engage with her in any way. As for the mysterious and extraordinary novelist...well, I'd rather have written any of the novels that SHE wrote than this one. They sounded far more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I found this to be such a beautifully written book. I fell in love with the characters and did not want to put it down. I would very much like to see more from this author. .......simply beautiful....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read","review":"I couldn't put this book down. It had me guessing until the very end. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gothic ghostly story","review":"The audio version is well narrated and superbly done. Be patient for the first 20 or minutes or so - at first I was like, oh dear, I'm not so sure this was a good purchase, but then, I couldn't stop listening. Fabulous writing! Wonderful, spooky story..many twists. I laughed; I cried and was entranced by the whole atmosphere of the story! And her \\"experience\\" at the end, with her unexpected visitor, warmed me so much! I also appreciated the way the author \\"wrapped everything up\\" at the end. It's a MUST listen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"I was looking for a good story and an easy summer vacation read. The Thirteenth Tale fits the bill. It's a page turner and a great Gothic story. The characters are rather shallow, but that's okay, because their only reason for existence is the story, and the story does not dissapoint. The writing is not extraordinary or particularily memorable (I have not written down any quotes), but it is solid and facilitates this original tale. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange!","review":"I think this book is strange. The beginning seems very interesting and promising but once i got to the middle it got very wierd and boring. I couldnt even finish it, because it got to a point where i truely didnt care about what would happen, because i didnt care too much for the books main characters. This book was way too long and not interesting to me im sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will it ever end!?!?!?","review":"Alright, so I'm trying my best to finish this book. I have about 75 pages left and it's so boring I just want to give up! I've read 100 pages and NOTHING HAS HAPPENED!!! When I'm into a book this far, I usually always try and at least finish it but this is torture. I keep thinking something is going to happen, but it just doesn't.UGH!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please....","review":"Wow - I stupidly believed the hype and the reviews. This book is just such cliched, predictable dreck. There were so many references in the reviews to Austin, Bronte and Eliot that I thought it might contain something of substance. Instead it was overwrought, schmaltzy and read like a cheap romance novel. So disappointed!!!!! The author just followed some formulaic recipe on how to write a best seller that would appeal to un-educated, daytime television-watching women (sorry, but...true). I should have been tipped off by the cheesy book cover. Can't believe I paid full price for the hard-cover. Please save your money! A mediocre book for the lowest common denominator. Avoid if you have a brain."},{"rating":"2","title":"The editorial view","review":"This opening sentence from the editorial view \\"Settle down to enjoy a rousing good ghost story with Diane Setterfield's debut novel\\" is made by a moron. This book is intriguing and exceptionally well written, but what it is NOT is a rousing good ghost story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever","review":"this is absolutely the worst book i have ever had to read. the plot never thickens as well as it could have. if i didnt have to read this book for my english class i would have stopped by page 20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to read this for classes","review":"I had to read this book for my college reading class. I think it was one of the wrose books the school could have picked for us to read. The book is badly written and should have never printed. If I thougth it would help I would ask for my money back. I don't know how old Margaret or Vida are. I don't know what time period this story takes place in. I think the story lines are very odd and boring. The only reason the book is this long is because the writer doesn't know how to make a point quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"thought it would never end","review":"I couldn't be bothered finishing this .....it just seemed to go on and on ..getting more and more unbelievable with each chapter. Occasionly the writing was good but then , particularly with conversation, it was awful.Definitely not recomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twin's identity--duh","review":"Um, has no one realized that Adeline and Emmaline would be easily distinguishable? Emmaline has a baby. She also has milk. She also has changes in her body below the waist. Being cared for as she is, it would be an obvious thing to check. In spite of being twins, there are individual marks, especially on Emmaline, from all the beatings inflicted upon her by her sister. This unsatisfactory and dishonest ending ruined an otherwise adequate book for me.I say adequate because, although I grew to like Vida Winter, I was more and more put off by the morbid self-pity of the narrator and the psuedo-mystery of her twin's demise. For me, this book was a mere pot-boiler. Settleton is a fine word crafter, and can spin a twisty turny plot, but she has yet to learn honesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most boring books that I have ever read....","review":"This was one of the most boring books that I have ever read. There was an over abundance of details that I thought had no relevance to the story itself. I would definitely not recommend this book to anyone, because I could not get into it. Boooooring!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"overall quite disappointing","review":"I read some very good reviews of this book, but unfortunately found itquite a disappointment. The story just seemed too contrived, and noneof the characters really interesting or likeable. When I thought aboutputting the book down there were always little developments that wouldpull me back in, and have me read a bit further. However, in the endthe resolution is pretty lame. Despite the fact that by theend of the story the author congratulates herself on neatly tying upall the loose ends, there are still a number of glaring inconsitencies.Indeed, rereading Jane Eyre seems to be a far better option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable.","review":"The themes and subject matter might make for a great story, but the author just doesn't get it done. The author seems to convince many of her fans that it's a great book merely by raving in the book about reading books -- so much so that the book's narrator recounts falling from a wall as if swimming because she was so lost in a story about Water Babies. The author seems enamored with imagination for imagination's sake... even when it's neither compelling nor interesting nor suspenseful. Granted, I only finished the first 100 pages or so, but the author's \\"voice\\" was simply too much to bear. I'm surprised by the many rave reviews. And as a final gratuitous shot, the author's pretentious picture and pose on the back cover should have been an obvious signal to let this one go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way overrated! A struggle!","review":"I just don't get it... this was one of the most painful books I have ever read. If it wasn't a book club pick I would have dumped it about page 100. Very tedious read - so tired of overrated reviews and fiction with a total lack of substance. Big waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here is my tale........","review":"Finally finished reading this book after many previous attempts. I'm surprised I made it through. In my opinion, this novel's strong points were grossly overrated. It was hailed as a scary story of sorts, the type to give you nightmares. Seriously? It was slightly interesting, at best. The copy I read was given to me, glad I didn't spend money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thirteenth Tale","review":"I liked this book when I read it, but after meeting with my book club and discussing it, I loved it. There were so many twists and turns. Discussing it made me want to go back and read it all over again. I did go home and google it to read about the author and see what other readers were saying about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyment provided by a first time novelist!!!","review":"This book was very intense and sort of difficult to follow at times. My book club \\"took it on\\" and everyone in attendance really, really seemed to enjoy the author's first novel, so hard to believe that it was Diane Setterfield's first one! It had many of the elements required to make a great novel and Setterfield used most of the elements needed for some great writing. I'm so glad I read it. I don't usually want to read a book again, but for many of my friends, myself included, this one is very tempting to reread as it will all fall into place and be much clearer the second time around!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally engrossing!","review":"This book was a great escape for me. Diane Setterfield created a world in which I couldn't wait to delve into every night. I cannot wait for her next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Storytelling\\" at it's best!","review":"It's all about \\"storytelling\\".I found myself being carried along for the ride through this book by the author's wonderful storytelling.Smoothly page by page the book entices you to keep going on.I hated putting it down at night.This book is a wonderful read that does not disappoint.The ending is so amazing. The whole book is amazing!WOW! Talk about storytelling plot twists!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great page turner!","review":"Having borrowed it from the public library and loved it, I decided to add this book to my personal library so I could lend it out and read it again whenever I wish. I've bought two copies, it's that good!Great character development, suspenseful, good story. Would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read a good mystery.I wish Setterfield would write more like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let me tell you a story....","review":"This book may start off a little slow for some people, but it's worth the entire ride. It starts out quaint and slow, then works its way to mysterious. You realize that the characters have some secrets. At the end these secrets are revealed, not to mention some harrowing surprises. The end has more twists and turns than many novels that I've read. Once I got to the end I can truly say this novel grabbed me. If you like mystery and surprises, this is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging read.","review":"A lot of books are starting to sound like they've dipped from the same well of inspiration. Much in common with The Forgotten Garden, which I read a while back. Nice twists, atmospheric, keeps you intrigued. Mystery about a mysterious writer. You won't regret the time spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you reading","review":"With many twists and turns, Setterfield keeps you going throughout the novel. Though I found the bits of story about the narrator to be a bit weird and perhaps unnecessary, the main plotline--the real story within the story--is great. Whenever I thought I knew what was going on, something else came up that changed my perspective entirely, keeping me on my toes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great winter's night read","review":"This is a great read -- well written, a little spooky, a little mysterious, and immensely captivating. Won't rehash the storyline here, you can see other reviews for tha, but I did want to say that the story is a fine one to get lost in, and the ending is satisfying. It's the perfect book to read if you find yourself snowed in this weekend. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Handmaid's Tale","review":"\\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" is normally not my cup of English-blend tea, but I can't pass up a well written novel, and this one is really good. It softened me up so effectively that the ending surprised me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-hyped","review":"I agree with the reviewer that said this book was over-hyped. I was expecting an intellectual thriller about books and/or authors. As a book lover myself, I thought 'what could be better than that'?!?! The book started out as very intriguing, but in the end it just couldn't live up to the hype. Extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not new.","review":"It was supposed to be new, that's what it said, that was an overstocked item. Not happy at all. I'll keep it because I need it for a school project."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not finish","review":"I did not finish this book because, although the writing is good, the characters Isabelle and Charlie introduced early on are just so evil that I don't want to let them into my imagination. Of course it is fiction, but for me, the things I read enter and inform my mind, and this is a dark direction I am not in the mood for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me interested","review":"I really enjoyed this book, it kept me interested with the twists and turns. It has a few different plots going on at once since it is a girl telling about the life of mrs. Winter but that only made it Better in my opinion. The only bad thing I have to say about this book is that at times the author was a little verbose during her descriptions of places."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thirteenth Tale","review":"THe Thirteenth Tale was an excellant book. Even though I read the book several months ago, I still think about the book and all the twists and turns it took and how interesting the characters were and how I just could not put the book down and how I wanted to know what was going to happen next. I recommended the book to my book club and I believe everyone (13 people) liked the book. I have also lent it to some friends and they really liked it. It is a book, I believe I can read again in a few years. I will keep it in my library. I will definitely read more books by Diane Setterfield."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"I found this book boring in the sense that their seemed to be to much of it.The premise is interesting-the twist*no spoilers*got me-but by the time we get to the end of the story I found myself asking do I really care?This book has been compared to Jane Eyre-Don\\"t believe it!Or the hype that this book has.I guess all in all this book left me a little empty and wishing I had the time back that it took me to read(listen) to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Novel!","review":"I well written novel. It pulls you in at the beginning and makes you want to read to know the end. Love these type of books! Diane Setterfield did a great job moving the story along at a good pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Story Telling, but weak ending.","review":"I was absolutely riveted by this story. Ms. Setterfield has a hauntingly beautiful writing style that will stir your soul and have you rereading some of her amazingly descriptive passages. Having said that, you cannot imagine my disappointment in slogging through the final few chapters of the story. It was almost as though another rushed and inexperienced author stepped in to finish the book! All of the questions were answered, but all of the passion and poetry seemed to have been exhausted and none was left for the very hollow final pages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Story Telling at Its Best","review":"If you like a good story set in a bucolic village with a bit of horror, a bit of madness, and a mystery at its core, this is a book for you. Vida Winter, a reclusive author, has decided to tell the \\"truth\\" about her life, and has hired a young woman, Margaret, to listen to her stories, take notes and write the book. Margaret is the daughter of a bookseller with questions about her own past. She moves into the big old house and becomes mesmerized by the tales she is hearing. As she writes and researches she discovers not only the truth of Vida Winter's life, but that of her own. The book is filled with interesting characters, lots of suspense and a satisfactory ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored to tears","review":"I received this book as a gift from a friend who worked for one of the big book stores at the time. I was delighted at the thoughtful gift because I am an avid reader; however, half-way through the book, I was sorry I'd begun reading it. The story seemed overly dramatic, predictable, and at times clichéd. I sold the book back to a different book store shortly after finishing it, and felt just a little bit guilty about putting it out there for someone else to be disappointed in."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thirteenth Tale","review":"I joined a book club recently and this was the latest book for us to read. It was delightful, unexpected story twists, and following in a tradition to English writers, simply terrific. I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting something just a little different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twists and turns amid family scandal and piles and piles of books","review":"Diane Setterfield's debut is just what I needed; an original story with enough twists and turns to keep you thinking long after you put the book down.Margaret Lea, a bookshop clerk who writes biographies of obscure people on the side, receives a letter inviting her to write the biography of the most acclaimed novelist of the century, Vida Winter. Little is known of Miss Winter except that over fifty years every time a journalist or biographer has tried to get her story she has spun a wonderful yarn completely different from the last version. Does she really want to tell Margaret her REAL story, or is she out to tell another wonderful, but fictional account of her life. Margaret sets out on a journey not only into the mind of a reclusive octagenarian novelist, but into her own past to uncover what it means to have a story and to share it.This is a must read for all book and story lovers. 4.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked this read !","review":"I found this book a really delightful read . I liked the story line ..it never got dull and I did not guess til almost the end what the heck WAS going on.. which happens rarely..I felt it read well, good development and flow.. I don't think you will be dissapointed. My only dissapointment was when I finished it.. AND IT CAME IN KINDLE FORMAT.."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thirteenth Tale","review":"The Thirteenth Tale arrived promptly and in good condition. I have submitted a review several times, but it doesn't go through when I hit the submit link."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and thoroughly enjoyable read","review":"Certainly an ode to her love of nineteenth century literature, Setterfield hits the mark with with her debut novel. The plot is well thought out, with a cast of interesting characters, an atmosphere that is a mixture of lush and foreboding settings, and a decent dose of mystery and intrigue to boot. Well worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Strange","review":"So glad I didn't purchase this book; checked it out from the library instead. It starts off fine, but quickly turns very bad. Very strange and not believable. It's more dysfunctional than mystery - incest, evil. None of the characters are normal or likeable, just weird. I cannot recommend this book, but if you still feel like you would like to read it, I recommend your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow sensationalist shock-o-rama","review":"One reviewer said that this is the same \\"shock-o-rama\\" one sees on TV these days, insest, abuse and sado-masochism, and I agree. Do we need more of it, especially in literature, whose purpose is to educate and elevate, not merely to entertain in the lowest sense of the word? I don't care that the book it well written, if the subject matter is basically trash. If it's the shock factor that keeps your attention, and not the story itself (which is not great by any means, and should never be compared with Wuthering Heights or Rebecca), nor anything else of value that you may learn while you read, the book is not worth wasting time on. Good thing I've only spent $6 on this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, found it flat","review":"Ok, I read to page 127 and then skipped around as I could not yet find anything that made me want to keep reading. Maybe my problem is that I never liked the book, \\"Wuthering Heights\\" (yes I suffered and read the whole thing), so that is probably why I didn't like this one. Not my cup of tea?Yes, it was descriptive and the characters were different. But I just didn't find anything in the characters to identify with so they seemed \\"flat\\", not real, to me. So, then I didn't like the characters, so I didn't care about them. Plenty of description of the settings, but I felt it too wordy, not really pulling me in.Less is more? I think if it was maybe 180 pages as opposed to 400, it would have had more substance for me, a little more intense. But I just couldn't get into it. My neighbor was reading the book and felt the same way as I.So if you are thinking of buying the book, perhaps go to the library and read a few pages and see if it grips you or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Unanswered Questions","review":"I found several gaps in the story which distracted me from fully enjoying 'the 13th tale'. It seemed the author went out of her way not to give the reader any clues as to when the story took place. Although automobiles are mentioned, it could just as well be 1890 or 1990.Was the uncle/brother's body in the shed ever found? What happened to the Missus's remains? How did the other child arrive at the house and why did the Missus and John the Dig keep her from view? What was Margaret's hang-up about being a twin anyway and why blame her Mother, yet have such love and respect for her Father? The end of the book was over-the-top and magnified, for me, the flaws I found throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a mystery","review":"I liked this story well enough although not with the passion I have read others. I don't have any complaints really except one lingering doubt that will nag away at me until i put the story out of my head. Basically I never got one question answered... whose bones were buried?? I thought that was critical and unfortunately, not told."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Simply Brilliant Tale","review":"For anyone who yearns to experience a really good \\"snuggle in the blankets by the fire\\" story, The Thirteenth Tale is definitely the book to read. Diane Setterfield expertly creates an unforgettable world of characters each with their own vivid set of dreams, regrets, and mysteries that will simultaneously haunt and enchant the reader. The Thirteenth Tale is a fictional masterpiece that no doubt reminds us how to absorb a story with childlike awe and captivation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterfully written","review":"I received this book in the mail, opened it, and read it in two sittings. Diane Setterfield creates characters that anyone can relate to, and uses words in a way that brings back literature to its art form. This book is FABULOUS and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who enjoys being captivated by the written word, or simply likes a good tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Book","review":"I give this book 4 stars instead of 5 only because it wasn't as riveting as I thought it might be. It's an interesting story, and I'd say that if you enjoyed Jane Eyre, you'd enjoy this book. The main character seems a little odd at first, mainly because she is so isolated and has no friends whatsoever. I got used to her, though, and the book reads pretty easily. I had a theory about the ending that was close to correct, so it may not be a surprise ending for everyone. Still, though, it's a good book and a nice way to pass a rainy afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!!","review":"I think that Derringer wrote the previous reviews ... 5 stars for what? Muddled guitar, so-so vocals, and bad songwriting? All three of these guys have some great music in their past, but sorry boys, the party's over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I bought this hoping Rick Derringer would prove he has improved as a guitar player given the company he is surrounded by. To my chagrin, he is still just a rythym guitar player trying to assume a lead role. It just goes to prove, Carmine will play with anybody just to make money. It's boring and quite disappointing. A kick [...] band with a mediocre guitarist. What's the point?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vitamin, great price, what are you waiting for??","review":"We've used these vitamins for years now, and our kids eagerly scarf them down each morning with breakfast. It's great to know they are natural, without the extra junk that other vitamins have, and it's fun giving them to the kids because they are happy to eat them.These vitamins are a LOT more pricey on other websites, including a leading online drugstore retailer.

I actually really like the features afforded to me by my factory head (mainly BT w/steering wheel controls). I used this device to do line level conversion on all of my speaker outputs. I'm now running RCA to a 4-channel amp and mono-block subwoofer amp in the trunk. I replaced all the door speakers and added a subwoofer in the stock subwoofer mount on the rear deck. These improvements have made my OEM system go from sounding \\"Pretty good\\" to sounding \\"awesome\\", with excellent response at all volumes.Ultimately, this device does it's job well. My results had no distortion at all and very very little alternator noise (only slightly noticable when cranking gain WAY up on the amps)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run away from this piece of junk.","review":"I only gave this thing 1 star because I couldn't give it 0 stars.This thing is pure GARBAGE. This piece of junk turned what should have been about a 2 hour amplifier install in my 2007 Wrangler into a 3 day ordeal. (I should have given up after an hour, but I am a hard headed individual.) The connectors are so shoddy that any movement causes at least 1 or more wires to come out, forcing you to start over. I used 3 different gauges of wire, tried taping over the connectors, tried soldering the connections, NOTHING worked.Finally, I put the piece of junk next to my seat, where God and everybody could see it, so that I could reconnect the wires as they inevitably came out. I then ordered the Pac-Soem 4 channel converter, waited for it to come in, hooked it up, and put it under the dash.Problem solved, amp installed, no wires coming apart, amp and all associated wiring hidden from view.DON\\"T BUY THIS ITEM!!!! You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Design, Poor Build Quality","review":"The electrical qualities of this unit are irrelevant, as its build quality is so poor that you're likely to break it during installation. The use of screw terminals was a bad design choice, as most users of this device are going to need to splice into something and will need wire leads. I ended up cutting and stripping several 9-inch leads out of the blue \\"remote turn on\\" wire that comes with amp kits. Unfortunately this was for naught as the screw terminals are extremely easy to strip and there appeared to be no amount of torquing that was enough to hold the wires but that did not strip the block. If you are going to use this unit, expect that you may need to solder your leads onto the terminal block.I ended up picking up aPAC SOEM-4which did the job. It was a little bit bigger, but had built-in leads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this","review":"This does not work. The gain adjustments come broken and if you barley attempt to adjust the remaining controls they break off and it is virtually impossible to repair them. If your trying to install subwoofers or an external amp your better off just getting a new head unit (aftermarket stereo). You can get a decent one for under $100 and the installation is no harder than this thing from what I understand. If your getting subs you could try the Scoshe 2 channel converter but I think you'll probably just get the same problems. Bottom line, just but a new stereo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bang for your buck","review":"This umbrella is the best! Its the best looking umbrella I've seen for its price in a long time.

The interpretation is relegated to the 2nd half of the book and can be read or disregarded as the reader feels fit. Seeing the photographs of the faces of the children does more than many thousands of words to convince the reader of the true nature of these apparitions. Having just done a search on Amazon.com I found almost nothing in print on the Zeitoun and Garabandal apparitions. That, in itself, makes this a worthwhile resource.Also, having just read this book, I feel that some of the negative reviews on this site seriously misrepresent and distort the views of the author that are presented in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a shame","review":"This book is both a big disappointment and an insult to intelligence. The author pretends to discover the messages of Marian apparitions with the help (readings) from a Source, that conveniently, is speaking to him in the dialect used by an obscure Yoga sect, that author was previously in. This is a New Age book, an eclectic sum of beliefs that is falsifying the Christianity. The author considers behind the Fatima miracle a UFO, considers Jesus not to be born Christ and so on. The authors believes that a Marian apparition to him was actually Kal, the Yoga equivalent of Devil, and a senior Yoga saw \\"poor Jesus\\" struggling in a lowly astral plane begging help from a Yoga masters! Forgive him God, he doesn't know what he's saying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away from this Book","review":"The secret of Fatima revealed by a psychic? If you are a Christian with minimal faith, you'd find this concept hard to accept.

There are numerous GOOD books on Fatima, including one by Lucia Santos herself. Avoid this one at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure deceit and non-sense!","review":"Ray Stanford is a fake, and he intentionally purposes to perpetuate bizare lies.

As a pastor of a church, I am currently trying to help rebuild the life of one such casualty of this trash. Reading this book caused a 33 year old man to attempt suicide and stuggle with delusions of apocolyptic destruction. Books like this should be banned or treated like science fiction.

One example is his view of language as something that has evolved to be learnable by the average two year old. Another was the idea of language as a \\"virus\\". His structure of icons, index and symbols is itself a powerful virus that I found difficult to stop applying to everything I have recently read.

Deacon's approach to argument is endless repetition and obfuscation with detail.

What stood out to me is the total lack of grammer and structure. A basic concept in German is that nouns are: a) capitolized and b) always male, female, or neutral in gender. Neither is touched on. This software will not help you put a sentence together at all! It's good for helping you pronounce simple nouns, but that is all.Also, the \\"speaking dictionary\\" only speaks in English, and so is no help in pronouncing words in German."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sounded pretty good but...","review":"I purchased this program as my girlfriend is German and I thought I would take a shot at learning a few words.

Would purchase another set in a minute!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharper than sharp","review":"I picked these up because the deal was unbelievable. We figured they might make a good gift later on. But on closer examination we were so impressed by the quality of the blades and the fine cutting edge that we kept it to ourselves and packed away most of our old knives.I only wish there was some space in the rack for the two old knives we still use occasionally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overview of a lifetime career.","review":"This book is a compilation of articles, linear notes & book excerpts plus a selected discography and bibliography of Ella Fitzgerald, \\"The First Lady of Jazz.\\"Follows her from orphan to icon - gives you an oversight of how the singer was discovered in Harlem and rose to be the highest-paid jazz singer in the world.Not an actual biography this book collects writings about Ella Fitzgerald and her career from a variety of sources and follows her achievements over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific activity toy","review":"Wonderful activity toy, my son spends time every day making deposits and withdrawals.

This toy provides hours of entertainment and I highly reccomend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning Piggy Bank","review":"I bought this for my friends baby who was a premie and needs to concentrate on midline work with her arms and hands. She loves the pig when she talks and sings to her. She is doing well with placing the coins. Would definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great toy!","review":"My daughters recieved this for their first Christmas and they loved it. Especially the coins. They were only 6 months old at the time and they loved to chew on the coins and carry them around with them everywhere. At the time we didn't know you could purchase extra coins but you can! That is a great idea! The coins themselves are a great toy. The piggy bank itself is so cute and the girls love the songs and pushing the piggy nose. They played with this for many hours. We have given it as a gift as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Toy!","review":"We got this for my 20 month old daughter for Christmas. She loves it. It is her favorite toy. She will sit and put the coins in and dump them out over and over and over, whether the music is on or off! And when it is on, she sings and tries to count with it. What a great toy that is big enough not to choke on and small enough for her to carry around by herself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Loves It!","review":"My baby receieved this \\"piggy bank' for his first birthday.

My daughter who is 16 months, has loved this toy since the moment we opened it (at about 13 months). She can sit down and play with this for over 20 minutes. Every time she gets a coin through the slot she shouts YAY!!!!! A toy that makes my kid this happy makes me want to shout YAY too!!! This is a handy way to help children learn hand-eye coordination, counting and colors. The songs it plays are adorable, and it counts with the kid as they put the coins in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love that singing, counting pig!","review":"We were given this as a birthday present for our 1 year old, and she absolutely loves it. Before it was out of the box, she was making it go off and screaching hysterically (she loves pigs). Once we pulled it out, she immediately started opening and closing the side door. She put the coins in the side door one by one, then took them out, closed the door, opened it again and started over. It didn't take her long to find the sensor in the slot, and she started setting it off on her own (and she was so proud). She now puts the coins in the slot with ease and twists from side to side with the music. She can play with it for half an hour and she doesn't seem at all bored.She rolls the pig around the floor, picks it up, drops it, climbs over it and it's still in one piece and working beautifully. I thought for sure the plastic door would've snapped off by now, but it hasn't. We are very pleased and will probably buy this toy for our friends' children!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My boys love it!","review":"Both my boys love this toy! It really keeps them entertained. My little one (13 months) has really improved in his hand-eye coordination from playing with it and I love how he gets excited when he successfully fits the coins into the slot. He also dances a bit to the cute music. My older son (2 1/2 yrs) got this as a gift last Christmas and has consistently played with it since. He likes to count with the piggy and stack the coins up, etc. I have found a lot of musical/electronic toys to be annoying but this one hasn't annoyed me at all. We give it two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful toy for my 18 month old granddaughter","review":"great toy for my 18 month old granddaughter.

This toy fit both requirements. Both my kids love to put coins in and hear the sound when it drops in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah, the beloved \\"Piggy\\"","review":"My daughter loves this thing so much, she has named it, \\"piggy\\" (ok, i know, but she's two). Her therapist actually recommended it for fine motor therapy, and it's been great for that. The problem we had with it wasn't the door, but the button inside the drop slot. It got stuck and we had to fiddle with it for something like a half hour before we got it fixed. I'm not sure how it even got stuck, but when it did, the sounds that play when you drop a coin in wouldn't work, and well, that's half the fun of \\"piggy\\". Still, it's a good toy, it's been dropped multiple times and still works great. \\"piggy\\" has been very loved."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Little Piggy Went To Market","review":"Overall, this is a very good product for the investment. My son (14 months) enjoys feeding the coins in and taking them back out again. He'll repeat the process for about 15 minutes on average before he gets bored with the repetition and moves on. I didn't realize how much he needed to practice his hand-eye coordination of putting the coins into the slot, until I saw him struggle at first. Within a few weeks, he has mastered the process and now we focus more on teaching him counting. This piggy bank is durable, educational and entertaining.CONS�?Coins can jam, depending on how they fall within.�?Counting can be inaccurate, especially if there's a jam.PROS�?Teaches hand-eye coordination�?Teaches counting�?Durable"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter still loves it after a year!!!","review":"My daughter received this last year for Christmas just after turning 2 years old.

He's put in three coins but the pig says he's put in one, etc...We have to snap the button back out for it to start counting again, and then after a few more coins it will just stick again. Happens every single time he plays with it and so it is totally useless to help him learn his numbers. Such a cute idea but very bad quality, very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE!!!","review":"It takes a lot of patience for baby to hold coin to put in slot...fun sounds and songs...has volume control so mommy won't get a headache when baby plays it OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Very Durable and can be thrown LOTS!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to play with once an adult opens the door","review":"Our 20 month old grandaughter loves her \\"pigee.\\" The basic problem is that she is unable to open the door to the pig to get out the discs in order to use them. She needs adult help and it isn't that easy for adults to open quickly.She is learning to count to five and says her colors. She lines the discs up in order of size or matches by color. She immediately figured out how to use her finger to have the sounds begin. She just puts her finger in the slot and pushes on the trigger mechanism.I'd suggest that the door problem be fixed and that the trigger mechanism be placed where children can not reach it with their fingers."},{"rating":"2","title":"17 month old loves it","review":"The first day we got this toy she was 15 months and sat with it for 20 mins playing with it.

It was ok at first but then the door quit shutting all the way making the toy not function as it normally would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't old interest for very long","review":"This is a cute toy when you are looking at it to buy, however, the door on ours falls off all the time which is a bit frustrating. I have a 13 month old, 15 month old, 28 month old. They liked it the first couple of days - I have even tried putting it away and bringing it out a few months later (I like to rotate toys) and they just don't show interest for longer than a few minutes. Basically just taking up space right now. Cute idea though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring toy. Doesn't teach much.","review":"I am pretty tired of toys that look cute but don't teach much. The only thing this teaches is numbers. Everytime you drop in a coin, the switch in the coin slot reacts and the pig counts the next consecutive number.The bank could have been a lot more educational, if it could recognize different coin values (there are 3 different size coins) or colors (there are 4 colors). Instead, each coin simply makes the pig count up one number.So this toy doesn't really teach colors at all. I'd say a (non-electronic) pack of crayons teaches more about colors than this toy.If you lose a coin, the pig won't be able to count to 10 unless you remove and re-insert a coin. besides number counting, the only other features are fluff: an Old MacDonald song that advances a few notes with each coin and a handful of pig related speech when the nose is pressed.On the plus side, this toy has survived a handful of falls from the high chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Go Wrong with this One","review":"This toy is great for the 1- and 2-year-old set. I love that they can open the door by themselves and can have fun just taking the coins in and out that way without even using the slot. My little guy (16 months) has pretty well mastered getting coins into the slot (I had to make sure the pig was aligned right for him at first)so I think he is taking a break from it for a while. I'm guessing he will get back into it though once he figures out the counting feature or possibly starts using it for pretend play. Also, nice compact toy for those without a lot of toy storage space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small coins are dangerous for younger children!","review":"My one year old daughter received this toy as a gift. She was able to put one of the smaller coins in her mouth completely and I had to reach into her mouth to get it out. It was in her mouth so far that no part of the coin was sticking out. I did contact Fisher-Price so they were aware of the problem. If your child is young please put the smaller coins away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy","review":"Great toy to learn the value of money.

I read some of the reviews and have not seen a description of the size of the coins or any safety issues? Is there another place to ask questions?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh I'm a Piggy Bank.....Fan","review":"Ok, I have to admit that one of the first things that drew me to this toy was the cute little songs it sings. We don't purchase many talking toys for our house, but I made an exception for this one. It is not annoying at all, and it has a volume switch.You can press the piggy's nose to hear several little dittys, or put coins in the slot and it will sing or count, depending on if it is switched to the \\"music\\" mode or \\"counting\\" mode.At the time we got it, my baby was really into \\"putting and taking\\", and now that he is a little older we use it to teach colors.I considered giving only 4 stars because the door seems just a little on the flimsy side and ours doesn't close exactly evenly like it should, but I am picky and overall this is a 5 star toy. I liked it so much I got one for my friend's baby for his 1st birthday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs improvement","review":"I bought this for my 9 month old son. I think the concept is neat; however this toy needs improvement. The toy is faulty because the door does not want to stay closed and after you put in a few coins it pops open on its own. After you add a coin, then the toy exclaims \\"one\\", then you add another coin and the toy counts \\"two\\". We have had problems where if you add a coin, then push the nose, then go to add another coin, then the toy looses track and does not count consecutively, which is confusing for a child learning to count. I was really disappointed that it only plays 3 songs or so and they are not very fun. I do like the volume feature and the coins are cool colors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Piggy Bank","review":"My son is 18 months old and he loves to play with this. He figured out where the button is for the door and he will push it to hear the pig say open/close. He laughs at that. It took him about a day to figure out how to put the coins in, now we work on colors. He plays with this everyday and we have had it for about a month. He loves to hear her sing as well by pushing her nose. When we tell him \\"go get your piggy bank..\\" he grabs it by the ears and brings it to us. He has also learned how to say the word money from playing with this toy !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Learning Toy","review":"My son absolutely adores his piggy bank, and I don't mind it either! The sound on it isn't loud and annoying like some childrens' toys, which makes it great when he wants to play while we're watching movies, reading, doing homework, or doing other activities. It is also amazingly durable. My son got ahold of someone's drink and spilled it all over this toy. I thought it was done for, but after I cleaned it up it still worked! This is a wonderful first time piggy bank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Piggy bank is fun for small children","review":"This toy is durable and fun.

Well she received this Piggy Bank for Christmas and it is simply adorable. It's educational, durable (sustained a few falls already and still holding up), and cute. The bank comes with 10 large coins, which is the perfect fit for baby's hands. When the coins are placed in the slot, they are counted, or there is a music option as well. This toy promotes hand/eye coordination and cause and effect as well. Once the coins are in the piggy bank, the bank is opened and all of the coins fall out and the fun starts all over. This toy definitely keeps my baby girl occupied for at least 15-20 min, which is a plus. I definitely recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I have twin boys almost 2yrs old and they love this toy. They have been playing with this toy about 1 year now so it is very durable. As a Mom I love this toy because it teaches so much more than number counting.

Great way to teach them to wait their turn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music from the Northcoast","review":"I've been a fan of Pat Dailey's since the first time I saw him live at the Beer Barrel many years ago.

The sound itself is really good, BUT...Something's wrong here. Shouldn't the pieces be played a little faster? Never mind how great it sounds! The great Giulini had chosen a slow tempo, which would make you think the symphonies are taking forever and could bore you.You might as well get the 1965 recording on London.

My main nit-picks are that often times the many newspapers that the book attributes each of the articles in many cases do not list the city of issue. Or it will list them perhaps in the very first entry for that paper and unless you've made a written list, it's easy to forget where it came from.

The quality is first rate. Perhaps the most telling thing I can pass on is that when at the range, and I let guys with scopes that cost 3 to 5 times as much look thru my scope, they do not believe the price. It compares that favorably to much more expensive scopes. I really like the modified #4a reticule. It is easy to see, pulls your eye to center and is easy to acquire the target. The free floating center dot works very well for both target shooting and hunting. The illumination only lights the dot, so in low light it does not obscure the target, but still allows you eye to see where you are precisely aiming. It's a good looking scope too. Again at the range I get a lot of guys who see it, like the looks, and start asking me questions about it.

I guess this is NOT one of her better books. It was slow and boring. Not exciting at all. The plot was good but it was too bad that the story was so bad. It was almost as though the plot was wasted.

Both of them were murderd. Jenny's mother , Madeline has many fans of her books that thik that she actually solves real mysteries with the policelik a mystery-writer who solves mysteries on TV. Madeline ahs never helped the police solve a crime before, until now. I liked this book a lot because it was scary and suspenseful. It made me keep wanting to read it. I highly reccommend this book. If you like this book,check out other books by Joan Lowery Nixon, such as \\"The Ghosts of Now\\"which is similar in a way to this book. It is about a teenage girl who is trying to find out who hit her brother with a car, putting him in the hospital for months. He is in a coma.

After you play a few games it automatically adjusts to your playing strength. As you improve, Fritz increases the playing strength so that it's always challenging but not overwhelmingly so. In addition, the friend mode is able to adjust to your level in a human-like manner. The mistakes that the program makes are similar to what you would expect from an actual human player. This is crucial, since it is probably the most frustrating problem with other programs...Other modes are also very useful, including the sparring mode, where the program makes intentional mistakes that provide strong tactical opportunities. If you miss them, the program warns you accordingly...Highly recommended without any reservations whatsoever"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am disapointed","review":"This is the first time I buy Fritz.

In the future I'll have to replay each game each time to get to an established position. The directions are unclear, incomplete, or just don't work.

Sadly this movie doesn't have hardly have any of that. There is alot of reminiscing between the couple taking us back in time when times were not so bad between the two of them.

The movie is very reminiscent to Paul Bartel's Eating Raoul and Bob Balaban's Parents but the movie is a couple that argue about everything and then the wife gets mad and harasses a teenage girl in the basement and then tries to kill her husband as well as the husband trying to kill her. For a low-budget black comedy this is a unwatchable mess with no redeeming values. Despite the title the movie takes place in the couple's dining room,kitchen,and the living room and the front cover has nothing to do with this movie because it is not a slasher flick but a bizarre soap opera-ish movie that looks like a Lifetime movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for people who have never worked out before!!","review":"I love this book.

This was not where others wanted the party to go, Newt and the boys wanted to cut out all social spending. Lamar disagreed and offered a platform based on responsible spending.

Every recipe has a picture, and many ingredients are pictured by themselves. I found this feature wonderfully helpful when I wanted to make a particular recipe: I went to the local Asian market looking for several ingredients, and used this book as a picture dictionary.The recipes themselves are unique, adding fare that I have not seen in other vegetarian cookbooks. The only warning: many of main dishes need at least an hour to prepare. There are salads, soups, and other appetizers that take less time, but this is not a \\"meal in 30 minutes\\" kind of book.Bon appetit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"4 DVD'S 1# HELP IS ON THE WAY.2# FAMILY SECRETS. 3#DON'T GET LOST IN THE HOUSE. 4# LORD, HELP ME!

This would be one of those stories that could be placed in installments in a magazine. The premise is also way out there. The author introduces things, but then lets them drop.

This book has revealed the truth about riding big waves in and interesting perspective to the new generation such as myself, and I will never forget some of the stories in here. I reccomend that if you're a surfer, and are even remotely interested in attempting to tackle large surf, that you pick up this book. It will give you second thoughts about venturing out at places like Mavericks, Waimaii Bay, and Todos Santos."},{"rating":"2","title":"As close as you can get without dropping in yourself","review":"The stories that comprise this book cover a variety of eras, locations, and players in the arena of big wave surfing.

An awesome read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get inside the Big Wave Surfing Culture","review":"Not just a surfing book but focusing on the Big Wave surfing crew, that elite group of athletes that live to challenge the ocean's fury. This is a collection of short stories but it does a great job of covering the total history of Big Wave surfing, particularly paying attention to the heroes of the 50s and 60s the water skills necessary to challenge large waves. With complete coverage and analysis of all big wave sites and legends, I can't imagine what it left unturned.This exciting sport has elevated itself recently with \\"ski in\\" surfing and these stories do a great job of covering the controversy of this sport's growth and it's trailblazer, Laird Hamilton.I strongly recommend this book if you like surfing or are enthralled by the culture of these people who devote their lives to the ocean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firsthand accounts...","review":"...of Big Wave surfing - many of the stories are haunting and memorable. It was hard putting the book down once I started reading. I actually found it more interesting and insightful than watching film of surfers going over the edge - you actually get into their excitement, awe, and fear of what they've gotten themselves into - not only when they've caught the waves, but gut-wrenching accounts of what they were thinking and feeling when driven under (or saw their friends driven under) by these monsters.This is as close as you're going to get, short of paddling out yourself! BTW, I just finished reading \\"Caught Inside\\" before \\"The Big Drop\\" and reading these stories made reading CI seem like a waste of time.You won't regret reading this one - highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Props for the original extreme sport","review":"Provides great insight on the pioneers of the sport, but doesn't come across like a history lesson.

It's also a book that will transport you back into time with the end of chapter exercises that will be sure to help you to heal and love ourselves compleatly.

As I began reading on the plane, I felt I was ready for my archelogical dig. Good concept, but it never went anywhere. I have an envelope full of pictures, what do I do with them??? Breathnach truly loves the written word, but too much of the book is reciting others works, without much original fodder. For instance, I read Black and Blue, it was quoted much to extensively. If books like this are calling out to you, try The Invitation, by Oriah Mountain Dreamer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring, banal breathnach.","review":"Sarah Ban Breathnach steals. Doesn't anyone remember that it was Emerson, and the Transcendentalist crowd who first coined and developed the term, \\"Divine Discontent?\\" Throughout her book, she seems to offer ideas or terms of expressions as if they spun organically and originially from her own mind. Ms. Breathnach offers many New-Agey type ideas that are either silly, or else you're sure to have read them years ago in women's magazines. She really needs to sit down, reflect, and truly come from an authentic place from within her own soul. What she says and how she says it doesn't ring true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"After Sarah's first book I expected something wonderful here, but was very disappointed. All of the peace and acceptance that the first book propels you to seek are missing here. Sarah seems too angry about her divorce to see straight.

Spare me friends like her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"This book was a complete disappointment to me. The most disappointing thing was that it somewhat undermines what I loved about Simple Abundance. The concept of Gratitude was a major theme in that SA and it has had a profound impact on my life.

I don't know if I have ever felt such a dichotomy between books from the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"What she left out.","review":"I can say that after reading SA twice I was SADLY disapointed in this book. In fact I plan to burn it when I get the chance. If she has resently left her husband or vice versa then she needed time to heal not time to write a new book \\"TO FEED THE WOMEN OF AMERICA'S SOULS.\\" There is a love and a deep spirtiual beauty to a loving marriage. I feel she is calling to women to look for this perfect man who does not exist. This mythical man who's soul purpose is too serve you. Sorry to disapoint Ms. Breathnach but this man does not exist. I feel that she is calling women to leave their husbands in droves. I would have put minus five stars if they would have let me.

Unfortunately, SM offered nothing new. Most of the book seems to be centered around divorce, marriage, and finding the perfect man. While this is a fine topic for books about love and romance, I expected SOMETHING MORE to have more to do with the individual reader and her relationship with herself. Since I have never been married, I found that the extensive sections about marriage and divorce did not relate to me.

I am glad I didn't buy it but borrowed it from thelibrary. I found this book very boring and hard to follow.

I love reading but this book did nothing to make me feel it was worth spending my time on it so I put it down and returned it to the library way before its due date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, and a little dangerous","review":"This book seems to be the author's written justification for her own quest for self-actualization. That's fine, but the residual anger left over from her own divorce permiates this book, and, if the autor's message on marriage is to be believed, 1) self-fulfillment can not be found in a happy marriage, 2) in order to find one's self, one must stike out alone (divorced, of course), and 3) husbands, no matter how pure and genuine their motives may seem, actually only want to control their wives. Granted, this book is not only about marriage, and in many ways, it is good, in that it encourages introspection. But if one's desire for SOMETHING MORE is based in problems with a marriage relationship, there are MANY better, more objective books, including Iris Krasnow's Surrendering to Marriage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for every woman....","review":"I'm 25 and it was great for me, passed it along to relatives in their 30s and 40s and was loved also.

After 100 pages she has nothing new to say. I simply couldn't finish the final tribble. Her appproach is highly ego-centric and a dose of Dr. Laura would do her good. Happiness and fulfillment are more often measured by responsibility, fortitude, and joy in the life created. Not in the bodies of men less than our soul mates lining the path to our front door. Does she never speak to the children of wrecked marriages in the name of women finding themselves. I find women like this boorish and endlessly introspective. Yes, the spirit lies within, but the work of the spirit is in the small, dull,and monotonous events of everyday lives. Mine is full of joy and authenticity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Less","review":"I loved Simple Abundance and have integrated many of its insights and practices, such as the gratitude journal, into my daily life. In Something More, Ban Breathnach has repudiated so much of what she allegedly espoused before. Even the exercises and collages seem perfunctory here.

I wish her luck in her new life and with her dream man but she'll need something more than this book to help her find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mixed up mess!","review":"After just finishing Excavating Your Authentic Self ,I have to wonder if this is the same Sarah Ban Breathnach that penned Simple Abundance?!

I agree with another reviewer that this book was simply one woman's bitterness and hoped-for recovery after a painful divorce. This was obviously written as a woman-power rant while dealing with creating a new life she felt she had been deprived.

The exercises throughout the book are very helpful in that respect. I read her other book, Simple Abundance years ago, and remember getting at lot out of that book and its exercises, but this one continues to help you discover something more in yourself and in your life.

I cannot recommend it, and I gave Simple Abundance to about 50 people for Chirstmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book simply does not speak to the reader the way Simple Abundance does (a book that I adore and read every night before bed). To those who already have a full life and are doing the Simple Abundance exercises, this book seems tedious. It feels as though the author cranked out a book just to have another book.... sort of like she's talking \\"at\\" you instead of \\"to\\" you. In Simple Abundance, the author shared herself. In this book I'm not sure who she's sharing, but it does not have an authentic feel to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding","review":"I'm debating whether I should waste the time to take this book back to the bookstore or just toss it in the trash. I cant even finish the book. The book is geared for the newly divorced. As a 35yr old mother, working on making a good marriage/life better and looking for good insights that I found in SA, all I found was the whine of me-me-me. Makes me want to toss SA too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah, hon, you were wrong","review":"After hearing the rave reviews Oprah gave SA, I decided to splurge on the hard copy. Reading the book, I was nothing short of disgusted. I felt swindled for paying so much for a book that was that bad.It seems as though some people loved SA and some people hated it. I hated it. Not only was it long-winded and packed full of annoying advice, reading it made me develop pure hatred for the peevish, whiny woman who could write such an attrosity.If you still aren't convinced, browse through it at the bookstore.

Is this book going to show every women the way to a more meaningful life, probably not, most will be too scared and too much in denial to even attempt some of her suggestions. Citing magnificent quotes that will knock you socks off, Sarah grabs these ideas and runs with them, giving us a chance to understand why we sometimes say to ourselves,\\"I deserve better than this\\".

The premise of the book is excellent - one's restlessness generally bespeaks of life choices made - good and bad, consciously or unconsciously. Hoping that the author would widen the subject content to include more personal growth ideas, aside from finding your soul mate, I read the entire book, and was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Disappointing","review":"I've never written an Amazon review, but this book compelled me to do so. I'm surprised that this book was published because its style and organization are so poor. The chapters are choppy, their arrangement makes no sense, and there is no cohesion. The self-excavation thread does not tie the book together as well as it might have, and the excavation journal project doesn't finish what it starts.Though some passages are interesting to read, the tone of this book leaves me feeling depressed rather than inspired. Is marriage such a bad thing? Do we give up ourselves completely in order to be married and raise a family? This book can suggest that, intentionally or not.Something More may be helpful to others or it may slightly resonate for me at a different time in my life, but I just don't agree with the view of life and relationships that it expresses. I was expecting something more positive, inspiring and helpful. Instead it leaves me unhappy an unnerved."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was hoping for something more.","review":"I recently read Something More, and I still find myself wondering if I misunderstood the author's message. I came away feeling that in order to receive something more in your life you must expect nothing less than perfection from others. Obviously, this will never happen. I think it's crucial that you expect those in your life to give you their best, but they'll never be perfect. I also felt that she spent a lot of time conveying this message to women in particular. I understand that there are many women who don't have high standards when it comes to the men in their lives, but I think the author went overboard telling women to just sit back and let the man do all the giving. I personally think it should work both ways. There were a few parts in the book that struck a chord with me, so I can't say that the book was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great instruction book","review":"This is the other book the professor made me buy for clarinet class.

The item I received is, in fact, black! It's described as a \\"Longitudinally slit, flexible plastic\\". It is, in fact, flexible plastic and by golly it does have a cut going all along its length. According to the product bullet points, it's \\"perfect for the keyboardist.\\" I am not a keyboardist, but I found it to be perfect for me too! So I think the seller should be somewhat more general in describing who this black flexible tube would be perfect for.In all seriousness, this is a simple product and it works fine. The only problems I would expect from something like this is the plastic being too thin so as to kink when bent or the plastic chipping. It has done neither of those things to me. Comparatively, it seems priced well too (I paid $12.26 for 10 feet on September 16, 2012.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This is nothing more than vinyl hose that might be used on newer washing machines, split down the middle.

Don't miss the chance to learn the eternal and internal struggles of the Old World. What a timely book! Outstanding! In the time we approach this new war in the Middle East, and delve into a new millennium in which these ancient worlds still collide, DeRosa brings to light a fascinating look at that part of the world. It is a struggle between love and hate when two worlds are brought together...who will prevail? A picturesque look at a rebellion from beginning to end. A war between right and wrong. Frank Costello is a deeply thought proven character. The supporting players are given a true spirit that make DeRosa's novel that much more enjoyable. Princes and warlords, Americans, Israelis and Filipinos, DeRosa's prose is unbeatable! His first book offers a defined history of the ancient worlds enveloped in fiction through a fluid intense writing style all his own.Cpl.

They used to be wonderful crates when the company was Doskocil. They also had a great little 16 inch tall kennel that worked great for toy poodles. The material wasn't as thin and the workmanship was much better.I won't be ordering another Petmate kennel."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP, FLIMSY, KNOCK-OFF QUALITY","review":"We have 3 PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED Petmate Deluxe Vari Kennels and they are solid, well constructed, and of excellent quality. The one my husband just ordered on Amazon was extremely flimsy, poorly constructed, has inadequate closure clips of top to bottom, has stiff and insecure latching system, and is a hideous lime green (think 1970s) instead of the moss green as described. I wouldn't trust this to securely keep a 2 pound dog safe and secure. Frankly, this looks, feels, and functions like a cheap knockoff. Returning this immediately - could not possibly be more disappointed with the poor quality of workmanship, materials, or function. And the hideous color was just icing on the cake! Would rate it ZERO STARS if that were an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal Quality","review":"This product is SO markedly different from the couple-years-old Vari Kennel Jr. we already own - which is fantastic and motivated me to purchase another one - that it is difficult to believe they are the same brand. Our first Vari Kennel Jr. is made of rigid plastic that does not flex and has a sturdy handle. It is a quality carrier that we feel confident would keep our cat safe.In contrast, the Vari Kennel we just received is flimsy, flexes easily and I could break the handle off if I gave it a hearty twist. In NO way would I feel comfortable putting a beloved pet in there and I would be foolish to believe it would protect her.If you are a responsible pet owner that loves your animal, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfy","review":"Not my favorite color (pea soup) but nicely made, not too heavy and seems very compact and very comfy.

I tried to play along with the CD and was left in the dust on the first song.The whole book is the same three or four songs over and over and over and over again, but it's only 48 pages.

When I tried to use it, I got absolutely no signal on all channels (and I live in Los Angeles, so you'd think there wouldn't be a problem with the signal), and the channel buttons themselves were not functional.

The item arrived quickly and in nearly perfect condition (one of the corners where the two sides line up is slightly bent, but not to a point it detracts from the usage). Usage is a breeze, toss the veggies with some olive oil and seasonings and put on the gril and stir every so often. The high sides worked great, I didn't lose anything over the side and we had enough veggies for two meals worth. Clean up was very easy, just a bit of hot water and some soap.

It is quite heavy and well made! The 'handles' on this Wok-Topper slide in where the other charcoal pan goes for a perfect fit!..and it will hold plenty of charcoal. It is going to give the charcoal much more ventilation which will increase the temperature of my smoker.

I'm not sure what it actually does in my skincare routine! It does feel soothing, like all Murad products do for me, but besides that it just seems like an extra layer. If I use too much it might peel off later in the day (under the SPF 15 Correcting Moisturizer). It does have a nice light scent and seems to do no harm, I just don't know why I need it. To be honest, I do not use the powder in the Redness Therapy line, which is recommended and partner to this product I think. There's a limit to how many products I can handle in my routine. Correcting Moisturizer SPF 15 does it all for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $$$$","review":"I purchased this at the local Sephora store and used it everyday.

Brass is a shape-shifter with a gambling problem. So off go a bunch of rag-tag heros to track this creature down and put him back where he belongs. Conley offers a large portion of the tale from the \\"monsters\\" point of view. In fact, he's just a bit misunderstood. A large typeface fills up 310 pages, of what seems more like a novella. Conley's narrative was reminiscent of one of Kipling's \\"Just-So\\" stories. There really isn't much meat to any of these characters, and by the time it gets interesting it's over. It's a great idea there just doesn't deliver much. BRASS is a quick read that is good enough to take your mind of the trials and tribulations of the daily commute. It an age of \\"lite\\" beer and cigarettes, BRASS should be nominated as the first \\"lite\\" horror novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulp, indeed!","review":"Lovely, classless, 'B' movie, over-the-top pulp horror. In short, I loved it. Conley joins the ranks of gifted new authors such as Harry Shannon (Night of the Beast) who are trying desperetely to revitalize the horror genre by turning back the clock to the kinds of books we all used to know and love as kids. He deserves to be read, and I hope more books follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleasing return","review":"The last thing I expected was another wonderful album from the Band.

After testing it some more, we realized that what \\"worked\\" was leaving a wine bottle open during 30 minutes before drinking it. After researching this further on the net, we found out that there is a natural process called oxydation which works on wines and makes them age super fast once you open the bottle. Regarding the Perfect Sommelier, we could NOT witness any improvements with its use. So, my advice would be to air out your bottles of wine before drinking them and to save yourself some money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a decanter instead","review":"I am a chef and Sommelier in NYC where every gadget comes down the pike as either a gimmick or a time saver. This product was disappointing at best. I bought a tannic California Cab as a test and after a half an hour (in a Riedel Glass), there was next to no difference in the strident and pronounced chalkiness of the tannins. After an hour, the wine lost some of the vanilla characteristics of the oak, but maybe that was an \\"Emperor's New Clothes\\" phenomenon because I really wanted this to work. I returned it (Amazon still has the best customer service) for a newer decanter."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW it really does work","review":"I just got my Sommelier and I didn't really think it could work, but since Amazon has a great return policy, I tried it.WOW after 30 minutes it was like a totally different wine. I tried the sommelier on a 1998 BV Cabernet Reserve which normally is pretty good, but after I opened the wine and set it on the base and put the top on it for 30 minutes WOW, it was Fruitier on the tongue, it had a nose that just came flowing out of the glass and the finish was oh so smooth. I thought my wife had poured me a glass of Merlot, right out of the CAB bottle.Thumbs up on this product you have a winner!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like your wine!","review":"I bought this with a certain amount of skepticism.

Mine is perfectly square and I had no problem trying to get it that way. The blade that came with it cuts great, but I think I will get a better one with more carbide teeth for picture framing. The only drawback I can even find is I would have liked Porter-Cable to include the hold down clamp, or at least make it more available to buy around town.

They were right on target; 1/2 of the right side of the right table is tapered nearly 1/8\\" downward. I've checked 2 more at a local Lowes and neither of them were level. The left side and table in each case is level, the right sides are the problem and each in varying degrees of level.I'll continue till I find one that is perfect.I initally had a problem with the sliding fence binding but with some filing relieved that.

Lead singer Ronnie Van Zant's lyrics offer timeless insight into the many facets of life, love, wealth, substance abuse, and fame. Coupling the already solid and dynamic talent of the band with guitarist/magician Steve Gaines created a nova-like explosion in rock-and -roll history, the likes of which have happened all too infrequently through the past 50 years. Andy Gill's description of the gems taken from Street Survivors in this collection blatantly amplifies the need for him to be relegated to reviewing Manilow or Streisand releases.

Also,several previously unrealeased demos such as \\"Free Bird\\",and\\"\\"Four Walls of Raiford\\"and a booklet telling some of Skynyrds history make this set a must have for the money.This music sounds as good today as it did 25 yrs. ago, when that tragic plane crash took some of them home....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Shipping and Handling","review":"I ordered this panel only to have it arrive irreparably bent at two corners.

The finish looked fine, but those wanting a sophisticated look at low expense will not find it here. The panel will require trimming along the edges to blend it in to surrounding cabinetry. Mounting will also require your own set of screws (and difficult to match the finish) and would entail using liquid nails to make sure the panel remains flush to the wall between stove top and cabinet bottom.

I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BRAND OF TV'S TO ANYBODY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS BRAND!!!!!!!!!!Spend a little more money and get a GOOD tv. There customer service(if thats what you want to call it) is the worst i've ever seen. ****B-E-W-A-R-E-**** DO NOT BUY"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't buy it again","review":"It has a nice colors and great image. Sound is not impressive. It has only 1 HDMI input, although the 1 S-Video, 2 component and VGA inputs are adequate. PC display works fine, but its highest resolution is only 1024x768. The remote control is really bad: it cannot control multiple devices and switching between TV modes is slow and sequential. It lacks of an auto-voltage regulator, which you should buy separately. After 6 months of minimal use I had go to repair it. In summary, the display is good but there are better options."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Trash","review":"I bought this unit brand new 5 months ago. It quit working after 3 months.

I have been using Zia Sunless Tanner for the past 8 years, and I love it. I recommend exfoliating your face prior to using it and applying two nickle-size amounts all over your face, neck, and ears evenly, at least an hour apart. I put the lotion in the middle of my palm, and spread and rub it evenly on both my palms, then smooth all over my face neck, and, ears. The next morning, I shower and lightly exfoliate again. I have a fresh, glowing color that is not fake-looking. I have found that skipping a couple of days here & there help keep the healthy color fresh. Good luck! I think you will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best self tanner I've ever used!!!","review":"I usually hate using self-tanners because of how fake they look and I can't stand the smell!! This self-tanner has a smell, but it's bearable and nowhere near as bad as other self tanners. The tan is extremely natural. The lotion goes on well, no streaking!! This stuff will change your life if you want to have some color, but don't want the aging and possible cancer that comes with the sun. I absolutley, 100% recommend it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Drumming makes me happy.","review":"This is the third volume in the series of CDs spotlighting Max Weinberg's favorite rock and roll drumming performances. This particular volume covers the 1970s. Due to licensing restrictions, some drummers, like John Bonham of Led Zeppelin, had to be left out. But we do have a nice sampling songs featuring great drumming. Most of these songs were hits, but there are a few obscurities like Ringo Starr's \\"Drumming is My Madness\\" and Yes's \\"The Fish\\". This is essential listening if you want to learn how to be a rock drummer. But even if you don't, this is a fine album of '70s rock, soul and disco."},{"rating":"2","title":"comprehensive","review":"Overall, I was pretty satisfied with this book.

The book is, however, an excellent study aid that I highly recommend.I have purchased other supplementary texts for organic chemistry, this one has been the most valuable. It is written in the perspective of someone teaching an organic chemistry course rather than that of chemist writing a reference guide - which cannot be said for a lot of the other material available."},{"rating":"1","title":"not suitable to non-chem/bio major, some chapters not well written","review":"i just finished reading the book. overall speaking this book, as is named, easy outline, give the essential part to the reader. however, i do not satisfy about the match of the figure with text description. say, on the DNA section, there is no remarks on which is base and which is sugar. i have no background at all and so it is very difficult for me to follow. the last chapter is the most important one to me, but worstly written.chapters after 10 are not well written. some wrong figure. less instruction, less background especially to me, not a chem major, i could not follow. i have to rely on several other O-chem book to get me through.the book is ok, perhaps to chem/bio major people. but need to be more thoughtful, and taking care with new O-chem reader (say common non-chem/bio student)."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"This book does not help you at all, it just confuses you.

The description saysWIRELESS - ITS NOT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good device, strange button","review":"I love this computer because of the 4 line display - the information you want is always available to you. But the button is odd: though it looks from the photo like the gray area on the bottom is a button, it's really just a colored area. When you push it, the entire unit slides up in the handlebar bracket on which it is mounted, causing a smaller button underneath to be depressed. I wrote the company to ask why they did it this way; never got an answer. The unit itself works fine, though I would have definitely preferred a real button."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Computer","review":"I have it on my bike for three weeks now, have done almost 300 miles on it with no problems. I had the non wireless version pervious to this one, the problem with that one was it would turn off in wet weather and then it popped out of the mount when I was going down a hill and hit a nasty bump, never to be seen again. This wireless one seems to fit tighter into the mount on the handle bars. I haven't used it in wet conditions yet, so I'm not sure if it will turn off like the wired version. I love the temp reading and all the info on one screen and you can't beat the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long term user report","review":"Just finishing my second year with this cyclometer. No problems and being able to display 5 items of information at one time makes it the best cyclometer I've ever used. But, it isn't perfect. There are no buttons on the body of the display unit - the \\"button\\" is on the rear and is activated when you push forward on the body of the unit. It takes a bit of force to do that and you end up holding the handlebar with your fingers and pushing the cyclometer body with your thumb to engage the button. Every other cyclometer has a simple button or two - this one needs to have the same thing. Note that the wireless range of the cyclometer is very limited and the range is too short to use this cyclometer on a recumbent bike where the pickup to cyclometer spacing is typically much greater than on an upright bike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost there","review":"I wouldn't recommend this product for one reason: The unit does not turn on and start recording distance from the motion of the wheel alone, you have to press the unit to turn it on before it begins recording.

Most competitors only have 2 line displays. Wireless is great too! Only 1 out of 3 units somehow gets interference from other bike computers next to me and doubles my max speed reading.

I tried two of these and both accumulated ride time and mileage when parked near fluorescent lights - whether the computer was mounted on the bike or removed.One night I accumulated over 24 miles without even moving the computer from my kitchen table. Planet Bike customer service confirmed there have been other reports of this interference problem.They exchanged the wireless model for the wired version which does NOT have the interference problem. I've put about 6000 miles on the wired model in the past 3 years and love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transmitter isn't secure","review":"I started using this in the beginning of the summer of 2012, and it worked just great. Everything was accurate and the display was amazing, until I was riding one day and hit a bump(not surprising I live in the north-east) and the transmitter on the fork snapped off! Not that the screw fell out, the plastic snapped! So i thought i did something wrong so i got another one. This one broke before i even got to ride with it! The screw was tightened so it was snug, the it just popped of, and the same peice of plastic broke again. Unreliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"It worked well for two months - dead in four!","review":"I purchased this in February but only rode a few days with it - winter in Wisconsin is not conducive to February biking. March it worked well for about 10 rides; then started to lose track of my speed - it would drift from 16 mph to 5 mph with no change in my cadence or speed. Then it just stopped tracking speed and mileage; clock and thermometer still worked. The materials are very cheap; and constant adjustment was necessary to get this thing working only intermittently. Very disappointed with the quality and the performance of this unit. The distance restrictions from the wireless wheel monitor to the handle bar display unit was also very restrictive. I threw this in the basket..that worked better than this unit ever did! PlanetBike! Up your quality cause you just lost another customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very reliable","review":"I have almost 2000 miles on this computer since purchasing and the only complaint I have (which is small) is that after a couple months the time seems to be off by about 10 minutes.

The setup was easy with a little of confusion over the instruction's details on where to align the magnet in relation to the sensor. Once mounted, easy programing, and worked great on the ride.

When I received it everything seemed great. It was a bit more complicated than I wanted to tackle so I took it to a local bike shop to install for me. When they got it installed it would not read the sensor. I changed both batteries out and it still would not read the sensor. I ended up buying another more expensive model that works just fine.

I have a tri bike and just purchased this computer. I was surprised to find the mount is NOT adjustable to fit on the stem of my tri bike where other manufacturers' products do adjust (CatEye, Sigma, etc). To put this on my bike would require me to purchase an additional $12 part - if I knew this I'd have purchased a different computer obviously.

The display is great, it was pretty easy to install, and worked fine for about a year which for me was about 1,000 miles. Then it started reading part of the time and finally not at all. I replaced both batteries and re-installed them a couple of times to make sure they were seated correctly, adjusted the distance of the magnet to the sensor, the sensor to the computer, reread the manual, and everything else I could think of.

Installed one on the mountain bike, setup the device for the appropriate wheel size, took it out for a spin - wild differences between it and the GPS I carried. Speed was sometimes three times more than the GPS unit, other times it was close, but more often wildly higher than the GPS. Going up a 15% grade it read I was traveling 9mph when the GPS read 3.9mph. At first thought it might be the front shocks possibly causing the problem, locked them out, still the same problem. Re-calibrated the unit by using the wheel length method, same problem existed. Transferred the unit to the road bike, same situation with the wild readings. Both units are going back to Amazon for a refund. Wish they worked, as I prefer not to have wires hanging and strapped to either bike.

Doesn't bother me, but may be worth noting for those with greater concern for performance and accuracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product, Awful Installation Instructions","review":"First off, let me say that I really like the product and how it functions on my bike. Easy to read, easy to reset, reads distances to .01 miles and the temperature display is a nice added feature.

Right out of the box the directions were easy to understand making setup very simple. It not only takes the size of the tire, but the width as well into consideration for a very accurate reading. It allows for any size tire if you want to measure the tire using the ground method. The display is large, easy to read with all the pertinent information on one screen. You don't have to keep changing the screen to see the speed, ride time, distance, max and average. And yes, it even has the temperature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Planet Bike Protege 9.0 Wireless Computer","review":"I searched for a while to find a bike computer with temperature and a display that wasn't tiny. I can appreciate the look of a small profile on a bike, but when riding, I want to be able to actually read the display quickly. I was afraid it would be too big - it is the PERFECT size. I tend to keep it set on the display that shows speed, time, temp and elapsed trip time. Just what I want to know when I'm on my way to work and home.

I am going to go back to the cateye's. i hope it works better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off to a bad start","review":"The Planet Bike Protege 9.0 has proven to be a great little computer--once I got it set up. During my initial setup, the tiny rubber button on the back (necessary for making adjustments) apparently got stuck. I did email Planet Bike for help, though, and got a quick response. I was able to pry the rubber button back out, and the computer worked fine. Operation has been simple and straight-forward.

The little chrome handle fell off the first time I used it. A real pain to keep putting the turning handle back on. After the first few uses, the handle hinge broke off so that the grater had to be held together while attempting to use it. Too much pressure required to shred all but the softest cheese, and now, after less than a year, the crank broke off on one of the graters so the entire thing is USELESS...into the trash it went. I'm the eternal optimist so I'm gong to spring for the battery powered one I saw in another catalog. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for hard cheeses, broke twice","review":"I bought this because I was looking for an easier way to shred mozzarella cheese. I used tried all three blades, and was disappointed with the results. The fine blade, even though is designed for hard cheeses, worked best for all cheeses. Basically, I personally found the other two blades too much of a pain to bother with. The handle is awkward with no grip. Like the other reviewed mentioned, it is clumsy to use. The handle screws into the blade barrel. I stripped the treads on the handle while grating during normal use. (Won't turn, therefore, won't shred) KitchenAid was great and replaced the whole thing. Well, after a couple months more, the threads on my new one chipped during normal use, leaving the whole thing again useless. I didn't bother getting it replaced because it wasn't worth it.Before it broke, however, it did work okay for parmesan cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not KitchenAid quality","review":"Don't be fooled by this apparently well-designed grater.

I just had my grater break at the threaded shaft that connects the handle to the grating cylinder after maybe a dozen uses for grating parmesan.

The problem is in the design. You cannot apply adequate pressure to the cheese because the plastic is flexible and the pressure point is not directly over the cheese. This is a horrible product.

I can see this after using this regularly for more than a month and tossing it in to trash.2. Blades to grate are not sharp enough hence grating is not efficient.3.

The third time I used the Kitchen Aid grater, the handle broke at the screw shaped attachment to the grater drum. I needed it right away, and althougth there was a warranty on the device, I bought another for expedience. One week later, the new one broke exactly the same way. I went on line and found the VAST majority of customers are unhappy wit this product for the same reason. With the Kitchen Aid name, and the connection to Hobart, I assumed that this would be a quality product. It is certainly more expensive than the other brands. Kitchen Aid, get your act together and replace the plastic part with a metal one.

So I thought I had hit jackpot when I found this at my local Ross store. Hah! I tried to grate 1/8th of an onion (sans skin) and it couldn't even perform. Nothing came out; the onion was 'too tough' for the wimpy grating slots. Most of the onion stayed trapped under the holder even though I had already applied all the pressure that I could garner with my left hand on the holder. It might grate something soft like cheese but I won't bother trying. Good thing I saved my receipt; it's going back to the store.

The Stainless Steel that it SHOULD be constructed with has been replaced by cheap, plastic GARBAGE. The money you THINK you will save by buying this unit is illusory.

Suppose you wish to start a vacuum cleaner agency from your kitchen table or an mlm distributorship. Then I could see this being of some help. It's basically all about dialing for donuts endlessly from home.There's also very little of Gianforte in the book. Reading it you can't escape the conclusion that he farmed it out to his co-author, who then did all the work. Unfortunately the co-author is a journalist and not a businessman, so he focussed on the wrong things, in my opinion.If you are looking at starting an online business, go with \\"Go Big or Go Home\\" by Wil Schroter.

I clean it weekly with vinegar due to hard water, but otherwise the kettle requires no maintenance. About once a month, I clean the outside steel surface carefully with steel wool and voila, it looks like new.

It's supposed to help in marking points as it has sliding plastic clips with holes in the middle, but is absolutely not necessary. In fact, the distances from the edges to the holes (the number you need to add to mark a hole at some specific distance from the end) is either 4-17/32\\" or 3-15/16\\", which means you spend more time figuring out the math than you save marking the holes. Worse, the pencil holes are huge making it difficult to mark the centers accurately.I have hung hundreds of shelves, paintings, and cabinets with an ordinary level just fine.

Just to name a few, \\"Little Wing,\\" \\"Life by the Drop,\\" and \\"May I Have a Talk with You.\\" These are all great songs and I hope you will decide to buy this album because it is GREAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD AS A COLLECTION OF BONUS TRACKS","review":"This isn't a REAL album, since it's been released after Stevie's tragic death.Despite some VERY good moments as \\"Little wing\\", \\"Chitlins con carne\\" and \\"Life by the drop\\", IMO, the Cd suffers a bit from lack of consistency, with songs that were left out of the REAL Stevie's great recordings.Another low point is that some of the songs are very similar to other song issued on other CDs with changed lyrics.I strongly recommend \\"Couldn't stand the weather\\" to anyone who wants to listen to a passionate work from this great musician.His guitar never sounded so strong and sparkling as on CSTW, but there are some moments of real fun and passion on this one too."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 and 1/2 stars : an average record with some good songs","review":"i don't understand the five stars ratings for this record, for me it is really average; the bad news first : i don't like his voice and it rather detracts the music than the contrary, plus personally, and that is purely subjective, i think he plays with too heavy strings; 'Little Wing' is a bad endless version, way too repetitive (the fact he didn't understand that playing the same musical theme over and over again was to turn this great song of Hendrix into such a repetitive thing is beyond me); the good news: the sky is crying, May I have a talk with you (raw and bluesy, my favorite track), Life by the Drop (a simple but nice bluesy ballad), the instrumental Chitlins con carne, are good though i find his guitar playing on the excellent 'May i have...' a little bit repetitive, he seems to play the same melodic theme, with some bits of variations over and over again; however the four songs that i quoted are worth a listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vaughan's best album","review":"I've become a huge SRV fan in the last year or so. His guitar playing reaches right into your soul and takes it down a lonesome winding path. No song represents this better on the album than \\"Life by the Drop\\", a fantastic reflection on a rough road traveled through life. My favorite SRV album."},{"rating":"2","title":".","review":"As an anthology there were good and bad stories, but the good were good enough to make up for the bad.The order of the stories is a little tedious and it would have been much better if there wasn't themed sections."},{"rating":"2","title":"good service all round","review":"good delivery time from abroad also product very good what else can i say fantastic brilliant super mega stuff its for cleaning windows which it does very well"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"We used the cargo bag for a 3 hour trip to and from Kansas City, all in dry weather. The bag held more than I expected and the zipper and material were very cooperative when closing and opening the bag. Caution: Stay away from the Rain-X cargo bag if you live in a cold climate - the bag material is not flexible enough to allow the zipper to properly close without breaking the zipper or tearing the material. The bag seems durable, but time will tell. I will update my review, hopefully to a 5, once the bag has gone through a rain storm. We used additional straps to secure the bag to our SUV on the way back home, even though it didn't need them (an additional $20 at Walmart for adjustable straps). And, put the zipper facing the side and back of the vehicle, not the front."},{"rating":"2","title":"great deal","review":"I purchased this carrier bag for my move to Texas and it did a wonderful job. My rack was a bit small for the bag, but it held on nicely for 1300 miles when completely full. Without the specialized bags, it didn't hold its shape very well, but the straps supplied did a fine job of holding on.The straps get a bit noisy if not tied off or pinned down, and every once in a while something would bump the roof and make a funny noise, but no damage to the car or things inside. And the waterproofing did a good job. Nothing was wet inside even though it sprinkled a bit during the drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highland Car Carrier","review":"I purchased this car carrier for an upcoming vacation to GA and I must say this was a great buy. We have a Ford Focus Stationwagon and the topper fit perfectly. We had room for 1 set of golf clubs, 4 duffle bags, beach toys, 2 chairs and a stroller and still some room left. It kept everything dry when it was raining. You do have to keep the zipper part along the back of the car and make sure that the zipper flap is covering the zipper. I know that other reviews stated that their items got wet but we followed the directions and it worked well for us.Hope this review helps!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"We purchased this item to travel to the mountains for Christmas. We drove 7 1/2 hours in the pooring rain. Our luggage stayed completely dry. It easily attached to our mini van luggage rack and stayed secured the duration of the trip. This bag is awesome and reasonably priced!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value - Sturdy and Waterproof","review":"I drove from Oregon to Colorado at the end of December with this cargo bag on top of my car. Despite driving through rain, snow and being outside several nights in a row in below freezing temperatures everything stored in this bag remained COMPLETELY dry. There was not even a musty smell. This bag came with straps which made it very easy to attach it to my roof rack. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked like a dream","review":"This carrier was amazingly simple to attach to the roof of our car. It was easy to pack.

It was a huge pain, b/c we got all of our stuff to our destination but had no way to get it back!I'm going to try to return it. I regret this purchase and would give it zero stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good quality product","review":"Just a note: your roof racks DO NOT need to be as big the dimensions of the bag. I used it on a two door honda accord with a very small roof rack. Its soft so it can fit whatever space you have.The material is high quality and very durable. I'm very glad I went for the waterproof carrier. It poured the whole 6 hour ride and everything made it perfectly dry. I fit two large duffel bags of clothes, one extra large vacuum bag and a few garbage bags full of clothes. I was amazed at how much actually fit in there.The only downside to this product is the straps. Which on their own i would not trust. I fixed this by putting a set of ratchet straps, two from front to back and two from side to side. This thing wasn't going anywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highland top carrier","review":"This is a great product as I like many reviewed the comments and shopped around. This is truly what it is advertised to be. I was most interested in finding something that was waterproof and not water resistent and this product proved that on our first use. It is easy to setup and the straps are no problem to operate. It folds up for easy storage. Highly recommend for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked Great","review":"Just got back from a trip from Ohio to Florida. It rained most of the way down and part of the way back. I went ahead and put our luggage in garbage bags just in case but we did not get any water inside.

All in all a great product and I had not problems using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not durable","review":"I purchased the Kar Pak carrier for use on a 3000 mile road trip. The tie downs did not last 1500 miles before the two in front began to rip out and I had to use a racheting tiedown to secure the load. I packed 7 sleeping bags and 2 tents in the bag and the bottom of the bag wore through in several small spots. I would return it but no longer posess the box or the reciept."},{"rating":"1","title":"straps broke less than half way to destination","review":"I bought this product based on the wonderful reviews it received from just about everyone. I don't know if we had a defective one or not, but this carrier's strap broke about 300 miles into our 750 mile trip. We had to stop multiple times and even find a Walmart in order to buy twine to tie it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Cargo Carrier","review":"I just purchased this for a trip to Disneyland. It held a full sized suitcase and five fairly large, stuffed to the max duffel bags. It was easy to install on top of my Chevy Tahoe and we experienced no wind or flapping noise described by other users. It folds up and stores easily....I'm so happy I'm not having to find a place to keep one of the hard plastic sided carriers when not using. I researched many cargo carriers and for the value this one is a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"worked great","review":"We bought this for a trip from Massachusetts to Delaware and found it easy to attach to the van (even my non-mechanically inclined husband figured it out!) took about 10 minutes tops. Having read the reviews of several products and hearing complaints about nothing being waterproof I pack all our stuff in Space bags and loaded up the Kar Pac. I fit 3 large bags full of bedding and towels, 4 fishing rods, tackle box, three beach pails, a large frisbee, two boogie boards and a bag with 5 pair of shoes in it and still had a bit of room. I did put on a couple of bungee cords to be sure and off we went. At speeds of around 70mph for almost 500 miles down and 500 back, in wind and driving rain this thing worked great. Everything was bone dry and the bag never moved, the car performed as if it wasn't even there. I tied the straps down so no flapping and absolutely no noise either. A great deal for the money"},{"rating":"2","title":"kar pak quality","review":"so far so good! i've only used it once but it has tons of space and keeps stuff dry. what more could i ask for? perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try something else","review":"This broke the first few hours of a road trip. Almost as effective as putting things in garbage bags and strapping to the top of your car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for the price","review":"We purchased this carrier to give us extra space for packing up our camping gear and it works great. Very easy to install (you must have the roof rack with crossbars already on your vehicle), took about 10 minutes total. It provides a lot of room, but truthfully, with a family of 5, and a ton of camping gear, we could have used 3 more feet! It does hold a lot of stuff though. For the price, a great bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for only one or two time use!","review":"I originally had written a great review after a one time use with this. However; now that we've used it three times, we are VERY disappointed! It is quiet and roomy BUT it is already ripping and the zipper isn't holding up either. We don't even put much in it so this shows how poorly made it is. My husband doesn't think we'll be able to use it again. Very disappointed in the quality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trip to Idaho, and back to Colorado","review":"We received this item a couple of days before we were scheduled to leave for Idaho. As was stated in another review, this does not fit all vehicles with roof racks. We used this on a 2008 Kia Sorento, and the racks are not completely adjustable and had to be moved as far to the rear as possible, and the carrier had to be turned sideways. Instead of the tie downs being in the front and the rear, we had to tie the carrier down on the sides of the roof rack. Other than that little set-back, it provided enough room for 4 large suitcases, dog food, blankets, room for a box of dishes that we brought back from Idaho, after the dog food and blankets were dropped off, AND a Big Wheel for a 2 y/o., that was in the box. All in all, this performed admirably. We didn't encounter any inclement weather, but we had wind all the way from Cheyenne Wy., to the Utah border. This did effect our gas mileage, but once the wind stopped, we were able to get 20 mpg, again."},{"rating":"1","title":"great for 4 hours","review":"We just got back from our second trip using this bag. DON'T CHEAPEN OUT, GET A HARD TOP CARRIER. The first leg of our first trip down our suitcases almost ended up scattered over the Garden State Parkway!! People were frantically pointing to our roof and low and behold the pack had opened (lesson to us to use twist ties or a small padlock next time to secure the zipper). On our trip home we had to stop constantly because the ties kept loosening up. When my husband took the pack off the car we found there was a hole in the pack the size of a fist. Wouldn't you think that we wouldn't use it again??? Well we are a glutton for punishment and my husband has great faith in duct tape. On this recent trip one of the straps ripped clear off and we had to tie it down with what was on hand. Its unusable now after roughly 25 hours of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"On our 2nd trip (the 1st being only 2 hours) the straps began to tear away from the bag. Poor design, the straps are just sewn to the bag - causing an obvious failure point. The bag itself is great, very waterproof, and can hold a lot. The strap failure was disappointing, it also happened in the middle of back roads Colorado. So I had to find a store that had some rope or something so the bag wouldn't just fly off my Explorer. I mean the bag is supposed to be strapped to the roof and then the vehicle driven, right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kar Pak Worked Fine","review":"I have used the Kar Pak just once - from Los Angeles to the Oregon coast - and it was fine. It has a large area to fill and the loading worked fine (except I have a SUV and getting the baggage up and into the carrier was a bit of a task - high up). The material seems rugged and durable. The price worth the product. The tie down straps need to be tight as the weight will shift a bit depending on how much weight you have in the Pak."},{"rating":"2","title":"cartop","review":"havent made the trip I bought it for yet, but construction looks good, should seal. not sure how long the tie down eyes would last but im insecure like that. just strap over it. A lot more affordable than the hard carrier.when done it can fold back into its packaging size & take a lot less room in your shed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Product","review":"I was skeptical about buying this product but after reading various reviews I purchased it because of the value. This product is an absolute \\"BUY\\"!! The bag is much bigger than I expected and it is a snap to install.

We went to the beach in a medium size car with 3 kids and 2 adults so needed more space for our equipment.

We went through several hard downpours over 8 hours of driving and everything inside the carrier was dry. I do wish they had three zippered side instead of two.

We stowed our clothing, sleeping bags, and pillows in it and they stayed dry through rain showers. I was able to fit more in it than I thought, so I was happy with that discovery. The Kar Pak, along with the heavy load in the vehicle, significantly decreased the gas mileage, but that was expected. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a similar product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kar Pak","review":"Our combined family of 9 went to Baja in 2 cars. We bought a Kar Pak for each car, & they worked extremely well. We didn't hit rain, but had lots of wind, & both Kar Paks remained tight and secure for our 3 hour trip. My only suggestion for improvement would be to have the packs open up a 3rd side for easier packing. Items don't slide in well due to the rubberized fabric, so having the pack open up completely would be a plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardware not included","review":"We received this product but did not receive the hardware to attach it to the crossbars on our SUV.

It is big, and held our stroller, some luggage, and still had room for misc. stuff. Beware, there is no rigidity to it, and you have to stuff it like a garbage bag.The biggest problem was the quality. When my wife got back from her trip we found the carrier was shredded, and thread bare in many places. Everything in the carrier was wet.I wouldn't recommend this product for anyone who drives over 30mph."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great carrier at good price","review":"This carrier worked well on our Honda Pilot.

The second time used, one strap broke and the other was almost tore from the material. If another car driver hadn't flagged me down while driving, we would have lost everything in the bag. As it was, I had to go back and find the queensize mattress that had fallen out of the bag. Somehow when the strap broke, the items shifted enough that the zipper opened and then items were starting to fall out. I am very disappointed that we paid $55 to use this item twice. Will not purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Explain","review":"The product did not tell me that It was for cars with a roof rack.

It is waterproof as it claims and the zipper can be a little difficult to zipper because of the weight of the material. The bag is made of a heavy grade material. We love the added space we gained by putting this bag on the roof. My husband put a bar acoss the roof to remove some of the weight from the roof. It fits nice on the roof rack. I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 sided zipper makes loading somewhat difficult","review":"Size is great and attaching is fairly straight foward. Liked the fact that it is waterproof but have not yet used it in the rain to evaluate its water resistance.Only issue I have with it is that the zipper is only on 2 sides and not three which is more typical allowing for flipping the top over for loading. This would allow for loading and unloading on both sides where with only 2 sides zippered it only allows for loading on the passenger and rear side of the bag while on the car. Since the rear is relively difficult to get to, loading and unloading only can be done easily from one side. This has not been a major issue, but it would be easier to load and unload from both sides of the car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad straps","review":"We were using the Highland 10391, for a trip to florida from NJ.

It definitely makes traveling with \\"all\\" of our stuff easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rather pleased","review":"I have used my Kar Pak only twice so far but have been quite pleased with it. I knew I didn't want a hard shell carrier because I don't really have the space to store such a thing, so soft shell was going to be the only choice. I like how they have the straps arranged. Even if you are not completely filling it you can still keep everything snug. I only had to drive a few hours with it but I can tell you that it did not budge, and I don't think it would have had I driven cross country."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CAR TOP CARRIER","review":"This car top carrier was the greatest purchase this year. We took it on a 6 hour trip to Wisconsin through heavy down pour for about 1 hour strait with no leaking. Everything was totally dry. It held 4 very large suitcases and was stuffed to maximum.

Before I got home from our first trip using it, one of the straps had ripped off the bag (while driving)and I had to stop and purchase some long bungee cords to hold it on till we got home. Also, pieces of the outer rubber coating had come off in random places, allowing rain to get into the bag. All I can do with it now is trash it."},{"rating":"2","title":"car top carrier","review":"We bought this to take my daughter too college. It freed up a lot of space in our van.

It served it's purpose for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not easy to use, but I love it","review":"We've used this carrier on four trips, ranging from 1400 to 2500 miles. We have stuffed this carrier to capacity, and it has done the job. The beauty of the soft sided carrier that it conforms to the shape of your luggage, making it possible to use every cubic inch and haul an amazing amount of stuff. And it has been through all sorts of rain, keeping our luggage dry.It *is* a pain to load this thing. If I need to stuff it to capacity, I allow about 30 minutes to load the carrier. It sometimes requires a bit of trial and error. Tying it down so that the straps don't beat against the car roof is also an art form.Even though it is a pain to use, I still like it very much, particularly for the price. It has allowed our family to haul stuff on road trips that we could not even consider without the carrier.Last but not least, I like that it stores compactly when it is not on the minivan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secure straps and lots of room","review":"This carrier worked great on our Honda minivan's roof rack. The straps were secure--we checked them at each gas/food stop and they had not loosened at all. We took another reviewer's advice and pinned up the excess strap lengths with a diaper pin to avoid flapping noises against the car. We did not encounter any rain, but the bag seems to be made of a rubbery material (rather than a nylon backpack-like material), so I would bet it would do well in the rain as long as you follow the instructions and make sure the zippered portion is facing the back of your vehicle, not the front.We packed our clothing/swimming stuff in several Ziploc Big Bags so we could make the most of the Kar Pak's space. (It is pretty tall when compared with some other carriers.) When we arrived at our destination, we emptied and flattened the Kar Pak carrier and then emptied our Ziploc \\"luggage\\" and flattened those bags, so there was no bulky luggage to store at our vacation house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"We looked long and hard for a good car top carrier. In the end we selected this one due in large part to the feedback on Amazon. I have to say this was a very nice carrier. I was skeptical that a soft sided carrier would be right for us, but it performed great. I strapped it to our Honda Odyssey and it never loosened up or made a noise. We loaded it full of stuff and it did great even in rain, nothing inside got wet.My only issue with it was that the zipper only unzips on one side and the front. I would have preferred it to zip open on both sides and the front so you could completely open the carrier, but even with that issue the access is still plentiful and its easy to load.Have no fear buying this carrier and at the price its a fantastic deal. I ordered it with standard shipping and it arrived 4 days later, so that was a bonus too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised.","review":"This is a nice alternative to an expensive luggage carrier that straps to your roof rack.

I struggled for close to two hours to try and get it to fit on the roof of my '08 Subaru Outback. It did not fit. And even if it did fit, I'm not sure I would trust it. The straps used to secure it to the roof rails didn't seem to want to hold the carrier securely."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"Three of the straps tore off leaving holes and we had to use a bungee cord to secure it to our van.

It has made about 2-3 trips each year since then (used about 8 times). Over the last few trips one of the straps has pulled away from the bag and is hanging on my the strings (literally). This trip the second strap has started ripping off. I have been through driving rain with it and everything stayed dry (I made sure the zipper was not across the front). It holds a lot of stuff and never moved during the trip. I only wish that the straps would have been secured better. The last trip I bungeed the bag down so we could get home. If that was changed this could have been 5 stars, but now I'm off to find a different bag to replace this one, so it's a 2 star. The price was cheap but the life of the bag was short too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't hold up.","review":"We have taken this bag on two large trips. Both trips were in excess of 4 hours each way and it rained at least one way on each trip. In both cases, the bag held a significant amount of cargo and kept it dry. The problem is that on the second trip, 2 of the 4 straps tore off the bag. We are lucky that the bag stayed on top of the car, because it could have caused significant damage if it flew off. The other problem is that we cannot use the bag for the return trip, yet we still need a roof-top carrier, so we are going to have to get a different bag quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product at a great price!","review":"My husband and I purchased the soft-sided carrier for a trip to DisneyWorld in August with 3 of our children. Looked at the hard-top carriers, but did not want to invest the extra $$$ and have the clutter of the hard-top carrier in our rented villa all week. We went thru heavy rain and wind, and were very satisfied with this carrier. Kudos to the manufacturer on presenting an item at a reasonable price that really delivers. Our luggage and personal belongings stayed perfectly dry, (we did follow directions and make sure the flap and zipper was to the back of the car) and the extra room in our mini-van was a godsend. We definitely recommend this item to fellow travellers."},{"rating":"1","title":"softsides topper","review":"I'm sorry to say that I did not like this item.

To me it was such a surprise how much the band has developed between the recording of this album (=Frank Zappa produced demos) and the first official Little Feat album. The difference is like night and day. And unfortunately for this album but this one is the night in that case. Surprisingly bad album from such superb musicians. Thankfully there's a couple of tunes here that rise almost to the level of the first Feat album but other than those couple tracks listening to this album is a drag. But we all have to start from somewhere and since this is where the Little Feat started from to me this is pretty much like Jerusalem to the Christians: A holy place where only few of us ever go...

But Rosenberg sort of reminds me of Britney Spears in that she can be relied upon not to screw up a song that is a hit on its own, but her voice does not really stand by itself in weaker songs. Unfortunately, most of the collection is composed of these. Rosenberg's voice is very high and very thin and begins to wear on me, particularly through songs with sparse accompaniment. Another weakness in the set is that it doesn't include lyrics, which is a real downside for me, because I picked it up at least in part because I study German.

I bake a lot, and I have had this for more than five years now - never leaked or deformed. This is a heavy-duty product and the cake carrier is extremely useful as well. A minor complaint is the fact that the plastic dome of the cake carrier does eventually crack, especially if not cleaned very carefully. It would be great if that were available as a replacement accessory. The spring mechanism to put the carrier in place is great and fool-proof and has never let me down in years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Improvements","review":"Having used German spring forms for more than half a century I would not hesitate to purchase this model. The buckle on mine has never given trouble provided it is cleansed after each baking. The fit of the spring side to the bottom on this stainless steel model should be far more reliable than on my unit which is made of aluminum which is apt to be deformed allowing minor leaks of batter. I would recommend that a plastic insert be included with this product so that the stainless steel base can be protected from being scored when the cake or tart is cut prior to serving. The plastic would be placed between the base and the baked product after it has cooled. Another enhancement that the manufacturer could add would be a cone that could be attached to the base so as to convert the form of the cake from cylindrical to BUNDT form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very substantial","review":"The quality, even for Kaiser, which is usually excellent, is superior.

I use the tennis elbow strap to provide support when I exercise and lift weights, the action of pulling towards my body aggravates my tendonitis. As I start to sweat the ACE brand tennis elbow strap would slide and move from its position on my arm. The Champion Neoprene Tennis Elbow Strap stays in place. The ACE brand tennis elbow strap had a removable pressure pad which is secured by a velcro strap glued to the plastic pad. The glue failed over time making the tennis elbow strap useless. I like the fact that the pressure pad is sewn into place on the Champion Neoprene Tennis Elbow Strap making it a permanent part of the strap. My only dislike is the velcro strap that secures the neoprene band around my forearm. The top half of the velcro strap that attaches to bottom half is exactly the same size. If I do not precisely place the two velcro components together then a portion of the velcro pinches my arm when I flex it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great","review":"This really helped clear up my tennis elbow. My only complaint is a standard one and that is the corners of the velcro poke and itch. So I cut off the sharp corners and then it was just fine.

When I tried to use it to cut through a potato, I thought that I must be doing something wrong because nothing should be this difficult. So, my husband tried. Even he couldn't get it to cut properly. If you find a potato that won't disintegrate while you're trying to cut it with this gadget then you have one very tough potato and if you can find a man who can get this thing to slice through a potato properly then marry him because he's a real he-man! I simply don't know anyone strong enough to make these dull blades slice through any potato on earth. A french fry cutter is useless if it won't slice a potato and if I want an apple slicer I can buy one for $2-$3. I wouldn't waste my money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It CAN slice cheese, if it is Brie.","review":"This is junk. The blades tore through the plastic with the first potato I tried to slice. The apple slicer broke on the 4th apple. The blades are not sharp, and takes considerable force to get it to slice anything. The Julianne attachment would not slice a block of chedder, though I do think any attachment would be able to slice Brie, and if not that, then perhaps jello. Worst purchase I ever made with the name Kitchenaid on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't toss your knife & cutting board","review":"This slicer seems easy enough and is easy to clean. Hard part is you have to press the blade over the food to be sliced. Potatoes and most foods used with this tool are oval shaped and do not stand up on end without slicing them. Once you have gotten the slicer over the food, you have to press it through the slicer sections manually. It is a better idea to get the box style cutter for about the same cost which is easier to use, has a shaped press to push the food through the blades and dishwasher safe too! I wish I had not found this item first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money","review":"We bought this thinking that it would make food prep easier, especially french fries and salsa. It's just not doing the trick effectively. Even my husband has a hard time getting the slicer to push down over a potato. It takes a lot of muscle and time, which is what it was meant to save. Delicate foods like tomatoes just get smashed, while hard foods are very difficult to push through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasted 2 months","review":"The apple slicer only lasted 2 months and then it completely broke apart going through an apple yesterday.

Buying frozen fries is easier..","review":"The big impressive handle is fine. However this gadget did not earn my cupboard space.However a closer look reveals dull nicked cutters that are attatched to hollow plastic holders or cutting dies.I tried making french fries. The potato just gets stuck half way through and I really pushed my weight onto it.Furthermore there is no chessboard like plastic pusher with grooves to mate with the cutter to finish pushing the potato through.Food gets into the hollow areas making cutters both fun to wash and dry.With only 1-3 grams of fat and some sodium, I'm buying frozen fries from the grocery store. I will continue to use my tube shaped apple corer with handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Strong Enough","review":"I could not push this all the way down to cut into french fries.A regular apple cutter works much better because after slicing down the apple, you can't just push out, the whole frame comes out with the apple. Worthless appliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"mildly entertaining","review":"After reading the other reviews on this book, I thought I would try the series. I am glad I only bought the one book as I found it only mildly entertaining and had to force myself to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom of the barrel","review":"If you are trapped on a long international flight or at the dentists office you might want to read it, otherwise move on. The characters are so simple-minded you don't care what happens to them and the story so predictable you can skip chapters and still know what's going on. I know summer books are the easy reads and follow tried and true formulas, but you still need something to sink your teeth into and this is where the book fails. We don't get a charming town with a neat or colorful history, instead we get a hillbilly outpost where no one is aware there is a world outside their zip code. We don't have a character that we really want to root for, because they are all so ignorant they should be happy with the life they've got. And the humor falls flat because it is cliched and leans on old sterotypes. It takes alot of talent to write comedies about the South, and it takes alot of nerve to write it when you aren't from the South. A least the author has nerve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Hee Haw instead","review":"I was given an ARC of this book and all I can say is I am glad I didn't pay for it. People outside of the south might find the book entertaining because it plays to the same inbred, illiterate sterotypes the public is use to, but Southerns will be offended by condescending treatment of the characters by the author. The book is poorly written, with more corn pone on each page than an episode of Hee Haw, and more Dolly Partonesque phrases than any Southerner (no matter how country) would ever use. The plot is trite, the dialogue tinny, and the characters unbelivable. As a native Carolinian I should've recognized some small town behavior or people in the book, but I didn't. The author's web page says she wasn't born in the South, which explains why she was able to convince herself and Simon and Shuster that her book had Southern charm. Real belles know she's just whistlin' Dixie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah, blah, blah","review":"I received an ARC of this book out of the blue, so what the heck, I read it. Other than the quotes at the beginning of each chapter (which I enjoyed), this book is nothing special. The characters are all sweet but very much stereotypes with no real depth or individuality. Overall reading this book affected me similarly to receiving novacaine at the dentist--dull and numbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"The book is a quick read and does have a few entertaining moments, but not enough to make up for the book's shortcomings. The characters are superficial and don't really come to life. I agree with the two other reviewers who said the southernism are exaggerated. I was so annoyed that people in other regions of the country would read this and laugh because they think that is how we are that I could barely finish the book. Are the five star reviews written by family and firends??? There is alot of plot action, but it is cutesy and so easily wrapped up that we don't care. I was unconvinced by the writing and weak story line. With the characters being so superficial, I can't imagine how the author plans to get more books out of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"There should've been a \\"look inside\\" option","review":"I bought this book as a gift based on the synopsis and the glowing reviews.

I didn't laugh or chuckle. I wasn't surprised or delighted. The relationship that developed did not draw me in enough emotionally to be able to categorize this as a romance novel. Some of the plot points concerned family secrets, which were somewhat predictable. The characters were not interesting enough.Story brief: Smart, nice and humble girl Elizabeth helps solve problems for people in the small town of Cayboo Creek. A wealthy woman in nearby Augusta, Georgia, asks Elizabeth to be a friend to her grandson, Timothy, a Buddhist oddball who recently moved back to town after his father's death. Sexual language: none.

There is some sexual content, so the book is not for young kids. I've read it three times over the last ten years, and will read it again in a few more. This is the one that hooked me on Silverberg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Silverberg fan","review":"I bought the Kindle version on the strength of the (generally) positive reviews this novel had on Amazon. I was looking forward to Silverberg's great imagination and storytelling skills with this one, as I had never been disappointed with his works before. Sadly, by the third page, I knew that if my copy had been a real book, I would have thrown it at the nearest wall.The novel seems like an archaic (that's us) human's stream-of-consciousness rant at waking up in the far future, where he encounters different versions of humanity from the various epochs that have passed. Silverberg's depiction of future humans are interesting, but it was the stream-of-consciousness drivel that drove me up the wall!By the way, I haven't finished reading the book. I've been able to plod through two-thirds of the book in the weeks that I've had it, so maybe I can finish it in time for Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Deserve 1 Star","review":"Worst book I have ever read in my life.

O'Rouke's name is being used to sell this book, he is not a major contributor.With some notable exceptions, there is isn't much depth to most of the articles although some are quite interesting. Most of it is just journalists writing for the sake of writing. Useful in a waiting room, or reading on short train/bus rides.This book will leave you with a feeling of being unsatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives good tan if you use it consistently","review":"I've found this product to provide a nice tan, if you take the time to apply it at least once a day for 4-5 days. The days you can get it on twice, such as in the morning and in the evening, you will really notice the difference.The color will fade after about the 2nd day, so you would need to put it on at least every other day to maintain that level of tan. But it will get you dark with consistent use.As far as washing off, I suppose it would if you bathed within a couple hours of putting it on. But I've never done that. What I would recommend is letting it dry for 15 minutes before you get into bed or do anything else that would rub on your skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expired Product don't buy from here!","review":"Wish i could give them zero stars. I just received my product from this seller and I had hoped that the product would be better than what the previous reviews had stated, well was I wrong.

It was made in 2005 and has a 24 month shelf life so even with the two years added to 2005 it has still been expired for 5 years. This seller is providing damaged goods. I have been trying to request a return but they still haven't labeled it as sold so i contacted Amazon and complained. Do not buy from here its not worth the hassle. The product doesn't work when expired, normally the lotion is white but in the bottles i received it was brown so that was the signal to call and find out if it was even a good product.

I have pretty fair skin, so I wanted something gradual so I didn't end up with too much color too soon. I VERY carefully applied this one morning after showering, exfoliating, etc. and waited for it to fully dry before doing anything or getting dressed. By the evening I seemed the slightest bit darker, and the next morning when I woke up, my legs were orange and streaky! Like unbelievably streaky! I couldn't believe it after I had so carefully applied it! I wanted it to work, so after it wore off, I tried it a few more times to see if I could get it to work, with the same results :( Wouldn't recommend it at all....plus it really stinks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two for the price of one","review":"This is a great deal.

When the order arrived I noticed the cream was dark brown and had a strong smell. Being I've used this product several times before, the lotion was always white and had very little scent. I called Neutrogena and ask if they changed their formula. They said no. I gave them the LOT number which gives the Julian date and year is was bottled. They were bottled in 2005 and have a shelf life of two years so were expired in 2007. This is 2011. I contacted the seller, they didn't have any fresh product so promptly refunded my purchase. I'm thankful for that. I ended up buying fresh bottles at Target, which still had white lotion inside.

What\`s the point, almost every cichlid demand different conditions. Discus vs. Malawi. The total lack of a register is also a big drawback. Another little thing is that the book is made by Tetra, so it includes a lot of their products.

The paddle part where the bristles are is in three sections - the middle section in one piece with the handle, and then the two sides are just glued on, it appears.

It works for all age groups and all ability levels. I'd really recommend it.Also, I really like the instructor. Ms. Sansone seems very nice and positive. I'm not big on \\"tough love\\" and some popular instructors turn me off with their aggressive ways. I know that works for some people, but I hate feeling like I'm being bullied by a dvd.

I've owned it for one month now and it has quickly become my favorite. Excellent workout with the boosted walking segments and super strength training with the firm band. On Weight Watchers for four months and had hit that plateau to where I couldn't move the scale much anymore...this is doing it! The only thing that would make this DVD perfect would be if it had an option to turn off Leslie's constant chatter. She talks way more in this one that the other two I have. By this point we've got the steps, Leslie. The music is great - it's ok to just lead the workout and leave me to my own thoughts! Thanks - Lisa"},{"rating":"1","title":"Walk Slim: Fast and Firm 4 Really Big Miles","review":"Even though this is a great workout. I'm disappointed that it's just like Super Challenge. Same music and routine, just different people. When I watched the sample trailer it shows Leslie by herself and doing other exercise routine such as the squat with the stretchy. I was really looking forward to the workout.That's the reason for the 2 star score. I feel dupped into buying a workout dvd, opening the package and once it's opened you can't return it. Oh well, I've decided to give it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I love this tape, it's fast, and is a great workout.

The three mile ones were getting a bit too easy so I decided to try 4 miles. This DVD is so fun that I hardly noticed that it was an extra mile. I worked hard and felt great afterward but it went by very quickly!! She introduces some new fun moves that made the workout unique from some of the others. Can't wait to do it tomorrow!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Try This","review":"I have been a Leslie fan for years. I love the boosted walking (jogging) that this DVD offers. I have had it for two weeks and already people have noticed the inches coming off. I highly recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun and motivating","review":"I enjoy this DVD alot. It is divided into 4 miles. Even if you have a really busy day, it is nice to put it on, and get one mile in (only takes 15 min). You feel better all day. I love how the background people in the DVD make \\"mistakes\\" like getting off beat or kicking with the opposite leg, and they didn't edit it out. She says throughout the video to keep moving, and doing it exact isn't the point. That is not to say that the DVD is done sloppily, because it isn't. It just reflects their attitude that if you keep moving you are accomplishing the goal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Fast and Fun","review":"I have three of Leslie's videos now and this one is by far my favorite! She keeps the pace moving really fast, but not too fast. After a few times of listening & watching the video I now play the DVD on my portable player and watch TV while I work out. It is very easy to keep up because Leslie prompts with hand movements for the next step. She also has Boost Walking which is like a light jogging which really steps up my workout. I would recommend this to anyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"She really kicks your butt!!","review":"I like her even though she is suppose to be beginner friendly, sometimes I have to pause to catch my breath.

I have been dieting for about Four months now and it has really really boosted my weight loss. I am a huge fan of Leslie's and I really enjoy doing this workout so do yourself a favour and purchase this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leslie at her best","review":"I'm already a big Leslie fan, and if you are too, you'll like this workout. The miles are presented continuously, or you can choose them one at a time, on the title menu. The first 3 are fast paced enough to make me sweat, compared toLeslie Sansone - Walk Away the Pounds (Get Up and Get Started 1 Mile / High Calorie Burn 2 Miles)which does not. Leslie is at her best encouraging self in this fun workout, with some slight dance-like moves a time or two. Mile 4 is slower, using a stretchy band. I modify the moves and use light weights for resistance, as I don't like using stretch bands. There is also some light jogging in this workout, but again, it is very easy to modify if you would rather not jog. The stretching period of each mile seems a little longer than usual, and somewhat yoga inspired. Why am I giving 5 stars when I don't follow the whole workout the way it is? Because I love Leslie, and this dvd brings adds great variety and fun to my collection of workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great motivation","review":"Leslie always keeps you motivated. This is a great video for the someone who wants to advance in the walking series. You can do 1, 2, 3, or all 4 miles at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best","review":"I have at least 25 of Leslie Sansone's Video and DVD. I many of the older out print like walk away the stress the 1 mile for abs etc. I wish she would put those on DVD. This one is one of her best.Yes she talks no stop for almost an hour. She uses her basic 4 steps but it goes by fast. I like the music she uses for her 4 the mile. I wish she would use it more often. I am thankful for Leslie because she gets those of us up and out of the chair. It has been because of Leslie that I have been able to at the Firm into my routine. And I am using the older firm tapes/dvds and they are long.... but thanks to leslie I am keeping up. I will say this about Leslie Sansone I feel like I know her and her walk leaders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leslie Sansone Four Mile Walking Tape","review":"I have quite a few of Leslie Sansones Cd's. This is a great way to get in shape at home regardless of the weather. I find that I will do these alone more than most exercise tapes and like to get together with my neighbors to do them as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk with Leslie is Good for You","review":"If you are starting a work out program (or returning to one, like I am) this is a good DVD as it shows the distance walked and allows you to increase your distance as you increase your duration. Distance is shows at Each Full-mile marker. I recommend this for the beginning exerciser or for the high-intensity exerciser who wants to walk 'with a group' indoors on their days off (or during incliment weather). Would expect it to be FABULOUS after major surgeries as it allows you to walk in the comfort of your own homw (in a gown, if necessary!) This is the First Leslie DVD I have purchased...not a life-long fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this","review":"I have had some of the older DVD's and enjoyed them but needed something new and fresh. I love this DVD. It gives someone, my age at least (65), a great workout and is easy to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Money","review":"I bought this video about two weeks ago and I have to say I like it. Its fun and it makes working out fun! ***Update*** November 6th...can't stop doing this video. I love the \\"boosted\\" part. I use three pound weights during video for an added burn. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to work up a sweat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"This DVD has given me results in just 3 weeks. I feel like I've worked every muscle by the end. Coordination is not required for Leslie's program (trust me, I have none) because she has only a few simple steps that she uses throughout the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I highly recommend this DVD/CD combo disc to appreciate that FIVE people play simultaneously in lock-step rhythm. Let alone, siblings. It is quite a feat to accomplish their task, and wholly resonated when you listen to the depth of tonal quality in their unique selections."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit dissapointing","review":"I guess I was expecting more of a Ferrante and Teicher thing with more than one piano going at a time ... could be that it is but, if so, am missing depth ... great family but disappointing album"},{"rating":"2","title":"They did it again","review":"These young, hip, classically trained wonders have definitely shown that their first album was only the beginning. Brilliant playing by all individually (or in duet form) and unbelievable sync-ness when armed with five pianos and 50 fingers. If you're looking for something different in the classical realm, look no further. A great introduction to classical music for the younger set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burrough's Best?","review":"At fourteen I read The Wild Boys and was completely in awe of William S. Burroughsgenius without knowing that others in the world were aware of his genius. Though disturbed and horrified by his imagery of a violent world of homosexual renegade boys, it did not tempt me to judge his work as merely pornographic or solely for those of prurient interests. As soon as I could find a source for procuring \\"The Naked Lunch\\"(a local Baptist college!), I tried to read it with the same expectations. Although certainly The Naked Lunch was an excellent work, I was disappointed, for I felt it never even came close in scope or power. Even years later, after having read quite a few of Burroughs books, I feel The Wild Boys to be unsurpassed in the Burroughsian Ouvre! When one of his works proves me wrong, I will write another review. Until then, reader beware, this book will change you, and maybe not for the better. But you will not remain neutral,for certain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it if you wished Naked Lunch had been better.","review":"After reading Burroughs' more famous novel, Naked Lunch, I was interested but disappointed. Burroughs was much too high when he wrote it and many parts an incoherant. However, the lucid intervals were very well written and I wanted to read a book he wrote when he was more in control. The Wild Boys is that book. A poignant masterpiece that will push anyone who reads close to tears. Far better than Naked Lunch, anyone who thinks Burroughs was a one-trick pony should read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks","review":"The quality of the copy was fine, this is just a dumb book, I'm very disappointed. Glad i didn't buy new"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not what you think it is...","review":"The Wild Boys is advertised as an adventure book of sorts. While using an interesting writing style, be forewarned that this is a collection of homosexual fantasies with young men and boys. I am less than interested in this subject myself, so I found this book pretty unfulfilling in it's graphic descriptions of gay encounters. Thanks but no thanks..."},{"rating":"1","title":"You All Are Beatnik Sheep","review":"Quite simply this was the most tastless and ignorant piece of literature I have ever read. It seemed as if the book felt like convoluting any actual storyline with scenes of gratuitous and repetive sex. Is it just me or does everyone in this damned book seem to carry a tin of vaseline? I thought there were some interesting parts but, call me a prude or an ignorant little ... but I think this book was riding on the current of the Naked Lunch which has been the wave on which Burroughs had carried his wrinkly disgusting body upon. This book is pretty much like a David Lynch film. No one gets it, they just talk about it and pretend that they do so they look intelligent but quite simply they are just beatnik sheep ready for slaughter by the corporate identity you have tried so hard to avoid with your lies and propaganda of free intellectual thought, which is disguising your true ignorance and gullibility"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good little book","review":"Over all, I thought Horror Between the Sheets was pretty good. I picked it up after I read an issue of Cthulhu Sex Magazine (which is a beautiful magazine) and there was an ad for it on the back. When I picked it up, I thought it was a good looking book and didn't look like most of the other books I get. I liked that there was almost as much poetry as there was stories.My favorite poems were The Titterer in the Twilight by Mark McLaughlin (I love Mark McLaughlin and his humorous poems)and Giant Squid by Heather Highfirld. My favorite stories were Erato's Sister by David Annandale, The Noseeums by Jeremy Russell and The Reaching Wall by Christine Morgan. I didn't really get the story Two Loves by Adam Falik and Robert Wheeler.But over all, there was alot of good, fun pieces in it. It's the type of fun that I like but someone who takes the horror too seriously might not. I'd give it a B-."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good for the Pre-professional Player","review":"As a member of several small orchestral groups and performer of solo work, I rather like these strings.

Though they came in the same box, the cost for S&H was the same as if I had ordered and had them shipped separately; no benefit. That I could deal with. The problem is that the paddle doesn't fit the machine. The user manual I have doesn't give a separate model number for the paddle nor warn me that there are different diameter slots.

It guides you through the basics of setting up on the computer you've probably already got with a cheapo microphone and freeware audio editing with Audacity. It also shows how a few more steps can lead to a far more professional sound with relatively minimal effort and expense.I also like the frequent \\"notes\\" which highlight important terms and ideas, many of which I know, but some of which were new. Cochrane's explanations are always easy to understand.The only downside is that this book was released before iTunes support for Podcasting became the pod-word of the month.

Todd might have done better to have hooked-up with someone who could show him the ropes about audio. His knowledge and tips regarding sound recording are, largely to be ignored. This is not to say that Todd's book is a waste of time, as audio is only one - albeit a critical one - aspect of podcasting. The book is approachable and does have some interesting advice and Todd shares his enthusiasm well.

First, (you) don't have time anyway, and this book is a quick read. That's good for you. Second, it shows you step-by-step how to create a low-cost, effective podcast. That's good for your business.If you're a programmer looking for inner secrets, this book is NOT for you.

There are a lot of negative reviews for this book because of it's nature and the fact that many people say the content is empty but I will have to disagree.

We are but a new-born speck in the universes of life-forms. Other intelligences are here and they are helping.

Fluid mechanics does not usually make for interesting, easily comprehensible reading, but Dr. Smith's book is clearly the exception. I'm constantly irritated by the very inaccurate descriptions of aerodynamics given in many flying magazines and instructional books. This book has none of those common errors. Reading this book should greatly increase the average pilot's knowledge of how his plane flies and what huge design constraints aeronatical engineers have to live with. Highly recommended reading for all those who are interested in learning more about the principles of flight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"If you frequently use this reference, you'll quickly find that Oxford has seen fit to cut out a great many words.

It's definitely \\"fresh\\" smelling, not cloyingly sweet/flowery/perfumey like most products marketed to women. Not chemical-smelling or plastic-y either. I'm really picky about how I smell, and I love this smell!!!The anti-perspirant and odor-blocking effects are fairly long-lasting. 24 hours easily if you don't do anything sweaty, but it benefits from reapplication if you exercise. Feels good on the skin; non-irritating even with shaving/regrowth cycles. It's similar to most other solid deodorants in terms of leaving white marks on clothing and white streaks in the armpits if you put on a lot.

The easiest notes to play and finger are presented first with exercises to practice them. This book comes with a play-along CD. This CD includes all solo exercises.Hal Leonard also offers (though not through Amazon) band sets for band directors. They are simple arrangements of music that correlate with the book. They are great for the first concert.There is an older version of this book called \\"Essential Elements: A Comprehensive Band Method\\".

Kenny Ball's \\"Midnight in Moscow\\" has a distinctive dixieland flair yet sonehow manages to invoke images of Moscow indeed. While I certainly am a big Connie Francis fan, her entry in this collection is argueably somewhat mediocre. The innovative foot stomping beginning to \\"Sherry\\" by the Four Seasons compliments the falsetto voice of Frankie Vali. I think those of us who grew up in the 60's were really spoiled by the incredible mix of our popular music.

If two programs overlap, there's no way you can compromise to record one partially. With Time Warner's programming, you can specify one to record a shorter length to accommodate the other for full recording, or vice-versa. With DirecTV, it's all-or-nothing!

Love it and highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good for new moms!","review":"So good for new moms, makes you remember to appreciate every little moment because they dissappear before you know it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let Me Hold You Longer","review":"The book, Let Me Hold You Longer, is a terrific book for reflection on the childhood of our precious children. Although at first glance, a reader might think that this is a book for children, it is really written for parents encouraging them to hold their children longer. As I read the book, tears of memories came to my mind about my two grown sons and how quickly those wonderful childhood years went by. This book was actually written as a poem in one of Karen Kingsbury's books when a mother's youngest child was getting married. The mother was reminding herself that she would no longer be the number one person in her son's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let Me Hold You Longer","review":"My son's second grade teacher sent the book home for me to read to him for a read aloud. As I began to read I could feel the tears welling up. This story is beautifully told in rhyme which my son loved. It really makes you think about the importance of appreciating life now.My son has been a hand full to raise and then there are the moments that only a parent can appreciate- the whisper of \\" I love you\\" when you kiss him good night or the sad sigh and whispered prayer when he sees a dead animal on the side of the road. This book makes you take a look at the child God has blessed you with and to appreciate the little moments that will soon be gone as he matures into adulthood.The pictures are delightful as well. I especially loved the one of the young boy holding a flower - root and all- and handing it to his mother. An all too familiar scene that many can appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tissue?","review":"Get your tissues ready before you sit down with this book! If you are a mother you won't be able to keep a dry eye. Very touching & so true. Knowing the situation in the Baxter family at the time makes it even more emotional. Wonderful, simple book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let Me Hole You Longer","review":"I purchased this book for my daughter in law's baby shower. When I read it, all I could think about were the days when I was raising my four children and how hard I tried to cherish every moment. Even though I tried, the years flew by. This book is a charge to all parents: CHERISH EVERY SINGLE MOMENT of raising your children...One day you will look back and wonder where the time went."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let Me Hold You Longer","review":"This is a great book.

It was much cheaper to buy this song this way than buying a new copy or original from the artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who can resist?","review":"You have to assume that anyone who buys this is already converted. You won't make kids understand the good old days with dodgy, grainy video, so the music really has to deliver. Unfortunately, the audio quality ain't much better than the video. But the performances? Another story.Even with lip-synched appearances, there's a massive energy flow throughout the disc that separates the rockers from the lounge lizards. Result: about half of this is essential viewing (Personal highlight: Joe and Eddie doing Dylan. Personal weird moment, but still a highlight: The Hullaballoos. Loved 'em then. Now they really look scary!)Sixties fans, get all three Hullaballoo DVDs.

He (or she) is intentionally ripping off his (or her) customers by sending them the wrong items. I ordered this higher priced set of flags(24.99) as opposed to the cheaper 10-man set (17.99) specifically because it came with the 6 large cones and the mesh bag and the rulebook. This seller tried to dupe me by sending me the one with the 4 cones that fit into the palm of my hand. Don't waste your time, effort, or money on this seller! When I emailed them with this complaint, they said \\"we do apologize for this error. we only have the model that you received.\\" Weird right? I wonder why they would even advertise that they carry this model when they actually don't. Sounds like a well-working scam to me!SKLZ 10 Man Flag Football New DELUXE Set"},{"rating":"2","title":"difficult, but excellent jazz","review":"Immortalized in Jack Kerouac's On the Road, this CD features Lennie Tristano in a variety of settings. If Bill Evans is the most colorful piano player jazz has ever produced, then Tristano is certainly the most \\"black and white\\", as his playing focuses on technique and composition rather than feeling. This takes a little bit of getting used to, even if you're a jazz fan; his playing at first might seem a little clunky and off-kilter, but it defintiely uncovers new rewards with each listen. In my opinion the only drawback is the live recordings, which, despite the prescence of the excellent Lee Konitz, aren't quite as special as the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good","review":"I bought 3 of these blankets as Christmas gifts and one for myself as we live in a very cold climate. All three stopped working within 6 weeks and even when they did work they did not heat up very fast and were not very warm once they did. Not sure what the malfunction is but these were definitely not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked One Time","review":"Used the blanket in the car Christmas day for about 1.5 hours.

After several attempts in different cars, I've returned it. It just does not heat! At best, by the time we reach my son's school, which is a 10 minute drive, it feels room temperature...probably because by that time the car's heater has warmed it up to the touch.Not only does it not work as it should, the quality is very disappointing. Imagine two thin pieces of fleece covering wires, which are plainly felt when the blanket is over/under you.I'm happy a few people have been happy with the performance of this blanket, but sadly, I am not one of them. If you decide to order this, be sure to test it out immediately so you will be able to return it to amazon within their return time frame if it doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"The reviews on this item looked good, so I ordered this in December as a gift. I tried it in my car, and my sister tried it in hers. It's a nice blanket, but you had to wait about 20 minutes to feel any kind of warmth at all. You could eventually tell that it was on, but it gave off no real heat at all. Buy only if you're looking for just a blanket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Blanket","review":"DO NOT BUY!

It doesn't get very hot, but its a nice toasty warmth. The heater went out in my husband's car and I got this for him to keep him from freezing on the way to work. For only [...] bucks I'd say it was worth it. I just wish it was a little bit bigger.

This was a present for her, but its more of a present for me since I can keep my window down without any argument anymore. I would recommend this for anyone who has this same problem with their girlfriend/wife, since it has basically resolved the issue. Overall pretty nice, but I didn't like how attractive the fleece is to little bits of dust and hair. This isn't the company's fault, since I bought something made of fleece, but I don't particularly like that part of it. The cord is long enough to use in the backseat of the car, and overall it made a good present. Also, this works remarkably well at drive-in theaters, just be sure you don't drain your battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea","review":"This is a great idea, but seeing as it is only 12v, it will not be very strong. noting that, I received a defective one, and will give it another shot (I'm sending back the defective one, and and getting a new one)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted","review":"I thought I was getting A blanklet for my bed not my truck!!!

I am also not so stupid that I wear shorts in sub freezing weather. My friend likes to ride in a nice warm (no that is a complete lie as she likes it so hot you could charbroil hotdogs of the dash). This blanket was the perfect solution for us. It works well, is the perfect size to wrap around her legs and keeps her nice and warm and I can breath. If you have this problem, then this is the blanket for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling, interesting and surprisingly funny","review":"I admit that all the jargon about codemaking and codebreaking went over my head, but Marks's self-deprecating humor and engaging writing style kept me going so I finished the whole book in just two sittings in less than 24 hours. (Admittedly, I had nothing else to do that day.) People who like World War II books will love this -- it's thrilling and suspenseful but without the violence. I did not envy the coders, and even less so the field agents, and I admired Marks for kicking and screaming and agitating so much to try to make their lives easier...and longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both historical and autobiographical","review":"It's rare to find such good writting and excellent insights into very secret matters of WWII. Another reviewer, Ljunggren, seems upset that we actually learn what the chief codemaker for the SOE did and thought. I welcome a well-written book that allows us to see behind the scenes and into technical areas that are still fairly well hidden after 50 years. The book is also useful to literary folk as a companion to Helene Hanff's \\"84 Charing Cross Road\\", where Marks grew up intellectually in his father's bookstore, Marks & Co."},{"rating":"2","title":"E-Commerce decisions makers should read this book","review":"The guy has a bit of an ego, and the book is too cutsey, but Marks is a successful screenwriter and it reads well.I would recommend this for anyone looking to learn more about cryptography. Unlike most books that are more oriented towards algorithms and protocols, this makes the operational issues of creating and analyzing encrypted messages very clear.Anyone involved with e-commerce implementations but unfamiliar with the application of encryption would do well to read this book and learn how dangerous poor practices and half-hearted implementations can be to a security system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Study of the underside of the Second World War","review":"The author brings out some fascinating stories of the secret service and codebreaking in the Second World War. He fails however to shed light on the code breaking and the origins of the Holocaust story"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doorstop for Christmas","review":"Overall very tedious. His style of wit began to wear and eventually I felt trapped in the wartime bureaucracy of London. Marks had enough material for about 200 pages. Nonetheless, I found something interesting about every 20-30 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naughty, brilliant boy saves the world","review":"OK, I had my kids read this--Man what a kick in the pants! It does drag in places--for instance when Leo Marks wanders too long in,\\"Oh what a bad boy I am-Land\\" but he redeems himself with sheer bravado. I am an unabashed and shameless fan. In our finely tuned, high tech, silicon injected, code spewing world--it's lovely to read about the Man who created the CODE, back in the day:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"See below","review":"Fascinating topic, but prose too often indecipherable due to author's heavy-handed attempts at wit"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money. Avoid if you want an introduction","review":"I agree this is a fascinating subject and has a critical role in both military and politcal history. It is unfortunate, however, that one should have to suffer through this book to appreciate it. Get this man an editor. Monty Python could have made better parody of this self-indulgent bore. I sadly wish there were cliff's notes. Absolutely appropriate for only the hard core crytographic fans. Even intermediates should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read at all","review":"Once I start reading a book, I VERY rarely quit until I'm finished, even if the writing is terrible. Just a personal quirk, I guess. This is one of those rare exceptions -- the book is so poorly written I couldn't bring myself to finish it. It should have been an interesting story, but due to the author's twisted style, I just couldn't do it. Hard to believe someone that was so close to the action could tell a story that is so uninteresting. If you're thinking about buying this book, make sure you can handle the strange writing style first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read, wanted more","review":"I found this via a web search for 84 Charing Cross Road; I started reading the eval pages online, and loved it so much that I ordered it immediately.I fun and interesting read...I simply didn't want it to end.I'm getting it for my granddaddy, who was in WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and delightful","review":"I've never before had a look at this side of the WW II code war before, and Marks is such an entertaining writer that I wish he'd write another book. This book hooked me from the first sentence. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in secret codes, history, or good story telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs an editor","review":"I'm in the minority with \\"friedman@islc.net from South Carolina\\" (August 22, 1999) who wrote: \\"Mr. Mark's silliness gets very much in the way of an interesting and intriguing story...The book of approximately 600 pages could have been improved by reduceing it to 400 by cutting out his mostly juvenile wit and getting down to really telling the story.\\" On the other hand, Marks' story is both fascinating and unique and I found it refreshing to read an autobiographical account of service in the military establishment in which the author gives a great deal of credit not only to his subordinates and peers but to many of his superiors as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down","review":"Exciting, interesting, easy to read, and amusing too. I found this to be a fascinating and compelling story - all the more so because it is true.

Not just the expected stately homes but a 300 yr old treehouse, an underwater smoking room, a house built out of chicken wire and cement, a grotesquely decorated terrace house, a shell grotto...VERY interesting read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away","review":"You get what you pay for with this springform pan. I had to open and close the side buckle several times before it closed properly.Another thing is I don't like the crisscross pattern at the bottom. That's not how a springform pan should look like. You don't see pro bakeware with bottoms like that.I ended up giving it away and went for the Daddio's Cheesecake Pan. The bottom is removable. It's a regular cake pan with a removable bottom. That makes sense.

Today, we listen intent to exactly what Aretha was saying in these musical messages. We now understand Aretha's songs better than in the past.

It is also the most expensive, but you do get what you pay for. It gives out a very fast read and I found it to be very clear. It cleans easy and is small enough to store anywhere, unlike the fork thermometers. I have had no problems with this thermometer. Mine came with an extra battery, which makes it a good value.

The production values and general sound clearly place the piece in the 1970's.Very quickly though I was struck by the sense that there is something clean and fresh about the album. There's an exuberance of people playing songs they like and having fun doing it. There are times when it borders on pop, and the rock-n-roll sensibilities are never far from the surface. However, the musicianship, harmony and improvisation are clearly the product of highly disciplined and talented jazz musicians.You'll find it easy on the ear on your first listen, and after a few more you'll discover you can't get the quirky little melodies stuck out of your head. The songs have that pleasant characteristic of being both comfortable and unexpected.

I always enjoy Crunch workouts for their fun factor.The dvd is a mix of uncomplicated kickboxing and dance moves. It has the classic Crunch set and background exercisers in colorful outfits. The music is upbeat and the instructor is good.Several of the background exercisers are annoying and whoop and holler a little much, but I can ignore this. If that bothers you, you probably don't like other Crunch videos either and would probably steer clear of this one anyway.All in all, a great exercise and I worked up a sweat. The moves are not complicated.A keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Jeanette Jenkins is a favorite of mine, but this workout did not cut it. The warm up was excellent, I felt prepared for an intense workout. Yet I became more and more disappointed as the video went on, as the majority of it was ridiculous dance moves with very little actual kick boxing. I also experienced little cardiovascular benefit. I wear a heart rate monitor and I was barely above 92bpm for the entire workout. My target is between 160bpm and 175bpm. This video may be good for someone who is new to exercise or maybe has a hard time with strenuous workouts, but for someone in good physical condition, it's mostly a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not intense like a class","review":"I was looking for a DVD that had me work as hard as I work in a kickboxing class.

Having said that, I thought that this DVD provided an awkward combination of the two. The dance moves did not blend in well with the kickboxing moves, and if anything, they detracted from the intensity of the workout. What's more, Ms. Jenkins had a certain sassy quality in her instruction that was distracting at best, and frequently annoying.The workout was not very intense either. To my mind, it was pretty much the worst of both worlds. If you're new to exercise or to kickboxing, you'd probably want a straight-up kickboxing workout. If you're more experienced though, then this DVD probably won't do much to raise your heart rate. I'd check out something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great conversational and grammar book!","review":"This book starts from the very basics, but from the beginning you can use the language acquired.

They looked like they would work just fine and Kitchen Aid is a good product, so I thought. They wouldn't pick up a thin chicken cutlet. The cutlet just slid right out. The more pressure I applied to the handles, the larger the separation between the tips of the tongs.

Strictly speaking, the album is recorded in a folk-rock key, but there's so much True Blue feeling in every track that they sound \\"more Blues\\" to me than many of the \\"canonized\\" 12-bar standards. The arrangements and performance are tasteful and natural, and the production is simply perfect (a George Martin level work done by guitarist Bruce Kaphan). To those yet deciding whether to buy or not this CD, I'd say it'd be one of their best investments, a \\"long term\\" one - the more you play this record, the better it sounds. Drew James' music world is a place to stay - \\"you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good variety and not too bad for immitations.","review":"Definitely listen to the samples. It will give you an idea of what's on the cds. If you are very familiar with the original artists then you will definitely notice that these songs are not performed by them.

The FM reception is very poor, but the worst problem is in the weather band. I have not been able to hear one word on this.

As far as I'm concerned, this radio is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off","review":"Though the price is attractive this little radio is hardly worth the plastic it is built in. I personally live near a NOAA tower for the radio. Heck I even can see it from my backyard. This little radio can't even pick it up. It can hardly pickup any of the FM stations in town too! The light it produces is very poor, even with brand new batteries.Don't waste your money on this radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality control issues make this the luck of the draw","review":"I've been reading reviews for this unique radio that range from very poor to fantastic. From my experience, they are all correct as there seems to the factor of getting a good one or a dud. Mine has a great FM tuner, but very poor AM and weather band. FM works as good as you could ever expect and then some. AM is so poor that every station on the dial bleeds over on each other (I am assuming it's a defect). Weather band is very weak overall. I could barely pick up my local station.The LED flashlight works very well.Overall it's truly the luck of the draw. You might get a good one, you might get a dud.

Not too mention what was missing from the first go 'round, a save function that gives clutzy gamers such as myself a way to beat this thing without sitting up for days hoping the batteries last.

The only difference is that the game has slightly better graphics and you can go out anywhere with it. The only problem with this game is that it's very different from the other mario's. When you jump you don't have much control and the characters look tacky. This is not Game Boy Advances fault either, it's just how the game is.

Over 12 levels, all in great color and bristling with tricks at every turn. This may be too hard for younger children, but is a great game for older children and teens."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Challenging Game","review":"Super Mario Advance is a challenging game. The point of the game is to eliminate the enemy,so you can pass through levels. there are 7 worlds with 3 levels in each world ( except for world seven. It has two because it's the last world. After three weeks, I finished the game, and it's boring to go back to level one. On some worlds, there are traps when you complete the world, and the next world leaves you stranded. Then you have to look all around for a \\"Warp World\\". It's a nice game, but I wish the fun would last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reencarnation","review":"This game looks just like it did on the NES, but even a little better.

The graphics are excellent, the sound is awesome! I actually stood at the demo stand for a couple minutes, awestruck by what I saw.

If you're a fan of Nintendo games, no matter what your age is, you're gonna love this game!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT THE WORLD, ON GBA ?!?!?!?!","review":"This is a great choice if you are considering buying it. The game Super Mario Advance is spectacular. It has eye popping graphics, mind blowing secrets, and it's all in one very small cart. Yeah, so what if it is a recreation from the old NES system. Nintendo has developed the best video games known to man. Mario has evolved into a better 3-D version but just like clothes. the old is coming back and it's better than ever. Plus the games are very affordable. In my opinion this is a GREAT game on a GREAT system."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only BAD Mario game!","review":"Mario is known all over the world by his famous super jump which smashes enemies into the ground. Unfortunelty, this game has no super jumps. You have to throw vegetables to kill your enemies. This is the worst idea for a Mario game. The good thing is that you get to choose from four diffrent characters, Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad, and it includes the amazing Link It Up, which allows four players to play from the same gamepack (Note: you will need the link cable).I just don't like it because they killed the Mario classics. Buy it if you enjoy wasting your money!

Luigi or Toad?","review":"You can play Mario, Luigi, Toad, or Princess Peach. I played Peach the most because she floats. Luigi was second because he jumps the highest.

Here's a hint-when you get to Wart use Peach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Mario Fun!","review":"This game is a very good game for the GBA. this game is very easy to learn and has a lot of screts for replay value.

Thanks to Game Boy and Amazon because i got it a really good price and for creating it. It was a really smart idea. I hope that they will come out wiht other Mario gameboy advance games cause they are so much fun to play. This game is worth a lot of money because i have a blast playing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game was a nice try but couldn't cut to the chase.","review":"I didn't like this game because there was no storyline.

It is pretty good, and it has some features that the Nintendo version didn't have. One example is the fact that each character has 3 different stats. Another is that this game has some different characters, such as, giant Shy Guys! Also, the color is impressive, and the play control is pretty good, but sometimes I think the directional pad is a little unresponsive. Overall, if you like Mario games, you might like this one.

I will have to rate this game five stars because i loved it! I havent beaten it yet but im close. The game itself has two games in it. Mario two and Mario 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Mario Advance? AWESOME","review":"Wow! SMA is a great game for me cuz i never did play the NES version that i can remember, but if you did i think it might bore you a little. Another bad thing is the scrolling of the game. If you fall of ,say a cloud or platfrom, and there is nothing under you for a long way, it takes forever to fall cuz of the scrolling. You have to see yourself in each frame. But I think the other aspects of the game rock.The original Super Mario Brothers is stupid if your playing by yourself but if you are hooked up with many players it is fun. If you like Mario and his pals, check this one out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What You Wanted!","review":"Mario Advance lives up to the name.

First off though, I have to correct the editorial review for it is inaccurate. This game originally came out for the NES back in 1988 and was upgraded to the SNES in 1993, just a clarification. The only reason for the 4 stars is because SMB3 is way better that SMB2 and it should have been there in its place. It would be cool to see this run as a series or something with SMA2 including the original SMB and SMB3. Other than that, despite lack of originality (which was the intention) this is one of the funnest games you will ever play."},{"rating":"2","title":"I always loved the gameplay in smb2 and now it's back.","review":"One of my favorite games was SMB2 and now it's back with better graphics and new feaatures.

It was not really one of the games that you just can't put down. At first, you have to chose a player every time you lose. After a while, I just kept hitting the buttons until I got back to the game.

Now I am at level 2-2 and I can't pass it. You have to try to pass each level as either Mario, Luigi, Peach, or Toad. At the end of each world, you have to fight a boss. The main reason I like this game is because it's not too easy nor hard for me. But it can get frusterating when you're about to beat a boss and then you die. It's pretty fun overall with challenging new levels and a catchy song. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes Mario Games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Do not buy this game. Even if you loved this game before, don't buy it. Whenever you jump and land on an object, it feels like your sliding. I got bored of this after an hour. And don't just buy the game to play multiplayer unless you want to spend 6 hours playing that stupid POW game with four people. The singleplayer is boring on that to. I hope Nintendo comes out with Super Mario 3 or even Super Mario World from the SNES. All in all, I can safely say now the only game worth playing my GBA is Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2, other than that, forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Mario...","review":"Man, this games the COOLEST!!!!!! Mario says: \\"Ooh look at me, I'm the man!\\" Indeed he is the man! You gots to throw em' vegetables (radishes for example) in order to Send those enemy dudes flyin' into the ground. You can also choose to play as Peach, Luigi, and (I hate this guy,) TOAD! MAN I HATE TOAD! I absoulutely LOVE Peach! She may have low stats all-in-all, but man she's cool. There are 7 worlds and 3 levels in each world except the final world where it has 2 very hard levels. So that totals=20 levels. By the way, you can choose the character you want to use in between each level. There are also jars that can warp you 3-6 levels ahead. For example, in level 3, you can warp directly to level 10! WOW! Also, in level 7, You can go to level 13! COOL! UDA DADA, COOL! So overall, Super mario advance is, in my opinion, the coolest games that exists!

This game is built off the original Mario Bros. 2 where instead of jumping on enemies to kill them you throw beets and weeds at them. While it is still a side scrolling game it doesn't have the same characteristics of a normal Mario Bros. game. You can choose between Toad, Luigi and Mario.(If that's all)The game doesn't revolve around mushrooms and firepower. This game revolves around the use of hearts you find in the game \\"floating\\" around. The bosses don't revolve around the princess being kidnapped or Bowser being a boss.

There are only subtle variations. But this is a game so great that there is no need to drastically improve it. I'm just so glad it fits in my pocket.

This game's got them!","review":"Super Mario Advance is two great and fully restored Classic Mario games. The main platform adventure is Super Mario Bros. 2. An evil frog named Wart has took over the land of dreams but Mario,Luigi,Princess Peach and Toad are out to save the day. Several levels filled with hazards such as shyguys roam the worlds but there's plenty of vegtables to be used as weapons agaist them. New voices added to old bosses such as Birdo,Mouser,Fry Guy and others. The other classic Mario game is Super Mario Bros. Turtles,crabs,and bees to stop you from advancing to the next level. It's a nice piece of restored work. The multiplayer feature let's you team up or battle it out in the Super Mario Bros levels. Bowser even drops by to give you a burst of fun. Super Mario Advance is a must have launch game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool","review":"I got this game with my gameboy advance it is ok, it is very, very, very cool you need to beet a person at the end of each level. It gets harder and harder by each level.

The GBA version is almost a replica of the NES version. There are some differences (not many at all), but they don't change the scope of the game. It is not that difficult, but it can bring hours of fun. This is one of the neatest GBA games (if you like these kind of games). Some annoyances are the voices of the characters played, but it doesn't change the game play."},{"rating":"1","title":"below average game","review":"This game should not be your first choice if you are looking for a quality 1-player experience. The updated version of Super Mario Bros 2 is worse than the original one for the NES. The new voices are incredibly annoying(especially Toad). The graphics and gameplay are not noticibly much better either. The best part of this game is the original Mario Bros game which is great with two or more players via a link cable.

Some recommendations are Mario Kart: Super Circuit and Super Mario Advance 2: Super Mario World."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPER COOL","review":"This game is SUPER COOL.

I wanted to bake a tart on one of the cookie sheets in case the filling ran over, but the warp on the sheet was so bad that I couldn't risk a big disaster. Save your money for another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warps like all the rest, but still great","review":"I bought the Kaiser on the recommendation of Cook's Illustrated, and for the most part they live up to the hype. They do discolor quickly, and while the discoloration can be removed with Bar Keeper's Friend, it doesn't affect the cooking so I don't bother. The size and feel of the sheet is perfect. Despite what Cook's claimed, they warp in the oven almost as much as the Ekco, but it's never been a problem. I bake a lot of chocolate chip cookies, and these sheets brown them more evenly than any other I've used. While I harbor an extravagant wish to try the All-Clad cookie sheet, really I can't imagine needing a better one than the Kaiser."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 is not enough","review":"These cookie sheets were recommended by Cooks Illustrated as best buy for the money.

There is a world of difference between store bought pre-ground pepper and freshly cracked pepper, which is MUCH more aromatic and very tasty.This is a nice pepper mill and salt shaker set, pretty enough to put on the table, but also very functional, and not just decorative. The pepper mill grinds pepper to a fine, even consistency. It will hold about 3 heaped tablespoons of black pepper, but you don't want to put more than 1 in the pepper mill at a time. Keep the remainder in an air-tight container at room temperature until ready to use.You can measure the amount of pepper you dispense (20 cranks of the handle equals half a teaspoon), or just sprinkle it directly on top of whatever. The matching salt shaker does not have grinding parts (which would have been nice for crushing rock salt), but works fine with kosher table salt.I like stainless steel because I think it looks nice, and resists scratches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and deep","review":"This film was excellent. The director allows the viewer to become comfortable with the characters, and then adds abstract information to complicate the plot. The viewer feels uncertain and confused at some points in the film, but that is the brilliance of this piece of work. This film keeps the viewer stimulated by using visual effects. Also there is a strong sense of motion. Sometimes it is difficult to understand what is suppose to be a dream, and what is actually reality. The film is basically centered around a brother and sister relationship with a few added complications. This relationship is very odd, but realistic and touching. The ending is very vague, but that is reality. The viewer is left with a deep feeling of some kind, it is very difficult to explain. This film is a pure representation of society, economy, and morality. The director puts the viewer face to face with the hardships of everyday. life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good service","review":"Haven't viewed DVD yet, but order arrived quickly. Happy with service.

And \\"Jimmy Olsen's Blues\\" was another great song. A few others on this album were tolerable, and several were quite forgettable.

Christopher Barron wrote and sang some fine lyrics on this album - each song has its own \\"message.\\" Finally, drummer Aaron Comess pounds out non-stop funky beats (check out Refrigerator Car). The best tracks are Jimmy Olsen's Blues, Little Miss Can't-Be-Wrong, and of course the most outstanding: Two Princes. All the others are good, there is not one I do not like.

It will take much time to absorb what is said, so read with patience and in small doses if it overwhelms you. The book presents the myth of the origins on the universe and mankind, and is the cornerstone of Barry Long's mystical teachings. Barry takes us on a journey through the mist of time (and before time) deep into our own consciousness, and gives us a glimpse into the mind of God. Having read piles and piles of books on theoretical physics, psychology, religion, spirituality and philosophy, I was surprised at how remarkable and refreshing the book was in its view of the human condition. Recommended for everyone to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"I found no value in this book. Reading it felt like a chore instead of a learning experience.

I am very, very, VERY disappointed in the book. While it gives decent descriptions of the various aspects of your home, such as heating and cooling systems, it does no more than that. I thought I was getting something more in-depth than just descriptions. For instance, how do I MAINTAIN my air conditioner properly? I've heard that you should hose down the outside unit every so often, for example - yet there's nothing about that in the book. I don't feel any more educated about my home and how to keep it safe and well-maintained than before I got this book. This was almost a complete waste of money and I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great gift for a first-time homebuyer","review":"I am a Realtor, and find that this is the perfect gift for a young couple purchasing their first home. It can answer many of the questions that come up about the inner workings of a house, and also alleviates much of the anxiety which can arise when something comes up and they live far away from Mom and Dad. It is also a great reference for people searching for their first home. No longer will they stare at a pressure tank or a septid drainfield without knowing what it is or what it does. Saves many a frazzled nerve, a few anxious phone calls, and is reassuring. If you, a friend, or a family member are buying or thinking of buying a home, run out (or log on) and get this book right away. You will never regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish there was a West Coast edition","review":"I was given this book prior to my house search even beginning and had time to read it through before touring properties.

I noticed most good ratings for this book are from women ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I bought this book hoping it would help me to understand and fix the minor repairs my new home needed (and it needs a lot). To be honest, it was useless. It had cute little anecdotes and a few useful diagrams but nothing to help me fix it myself. Like many first time buyers, my house isn't 'top-of-the-line' and I used all my money to buy it - I don't have the money to call in someone else everytime a faucet starts to drip. The entire book is an account of one northeasterner's experience purchasing a home. It's all text. If you want a fix-it book (or you live outside of New York), look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book nothing like title suggests...","review":"This book should have been titled something like 'How Does Everything Work In Your House\\", because it does very little toward letting you know what you have to do to maintain one. It's written as if you know absolutely nothing about a house, since the author apparently never saw one before she bought hers. She does an ok job of describing the 'systems' within a house, if you can stand the New York attitude that comes with it, but if you are trying to learn how to maintian your house, you'll be very dissapointed. What's more, she covers only those things associated with owning a house in the northeast, she never mentions the special needs of a home in California, and very little for Florida - two states with very demanding needs for homeowners. And what's most disappointing, is that her solution to maintaining a home is \\"call a contractor\\", preferrably one from the local country club."},{"rating":"2","title":"This isn't a how-to book, it's background information!","review":"I recently bought an older condo and having been raised in a traditional family (Often told to \\"go help my mother\\") I wasn't prepared for the hows and whys of how houses and their appliances work. I needed a basic education.This book will give you the background on how various parts of your home work - the electrical system, the water/drain/vent system, your plumbing, appliances - everything! I'm loving finally knowing what some of these things do.As other reviewers have mentioned, it's NOT a how-to book. I don't think this was designed to help the homeowner diagnose and FIX a problem. It's more to help us understand how they work so we can at least rule things out and communicate to a repairman without being intimidated.It is probably more appealing to women since it's written by a city girl who moved to the suburbs and realized she knew nothing about this stuff. I feel I can relate to her, maybe that's why I enjoy it even more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outrageously comfortable - Terrific","review":"I got this rope chair for Father's day and it has been amazing. I put it under our big maple in the back yard and everyone fights over sitting in it.

We have not had any problems with it at all - we take it down when not in use - but we certainly have not seen any of the problems reported.

She is an active, outgoing, and pretty daring little girl though. She got right on and rode it great! I'm sooooo glad I didn't go with the battery jeep! She will be able to ride this for years. We have had it for about 3 months and so far its ran great and had no problems. It was also half the cost of a battery jeep! It says like 12 and over but don't be too scared to get it for younger girls. My 10 year old rides it just fine too.

Vacuum your rugs with it on. Pay your bills. Romantic evenings. You're wearing a plastic viking helmet. It arrives in four pieces, but you're not stupid and can figure out how to snap them together.

I'll say up front that we cook a lot, so the mill got pretty heavy use. It worked great for about a year, then the plastic parts cleverly hidden beneath the metal top began to disinegrate.

Seriously though, I'm changing brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"These things are the best in the business","review":"I have tried a lot of pepper mills but most of them require you stand there grinder for longer than it would take to eat your dinner in order to get enough pepper.

It has four stored memory settings.Setting the stored memory settings is intuitive. You don't have to drag out the manual when you want to change a setting.

If you want to change the setting it is easy but - unlike with other timers that I have had - you don't end up deleting settings by accident.The battery lasts a long time.

In addition it is a clock and has 4 timing cycles. We had broken the battery in our old one and, when we called the rep in New York ?? they said send it back and they would replace it. Naturally, we couldn't find it so we bought a new one - I almost wish we had ordered two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"Pyrex Programmable TimerThe Perfect timer!

This film is gruesome and very unflatering to the captors. They were abusive beyond human comprehension. It is a tragedy. May we learn and turn toward embracing and empowering people with their particular talents.

I don't know how to suggest that chapters be added to the table of contents of the Kindle edition of this book. It would make it so much easier to use as a reference book. People don't usually read through commentaries; they use them to look up specific passages."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"Just to reiterate.

I was wrong,I mean it's not a total waste,but not what I would have expected from DR. MacArthur. It has failed me several times as I would go to look up certain verses and find that the whole section of scripture isn't even aknwoledged,so I guess the whole Bible wasn't worth commenting on? And he does nothing to resolve what seem to be conflicting statements,I had to look elsewhere to find the answers I needed which is odd because I bought the commentary thinking it would be a source of help and not frustration. I don't know who wrote the best Bible commentary you can buy but it's not this one-apologies to Dr. MacArthur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Commentary","review":"John MacArthur is a man who cares about the truth of the Bible so much & it is evident in his books & commentary.

I would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I'm disappointed by this product (\\"MacArthur Bible Commentary\\"). In the commentary on Genesis, MacArthur states that the earth is \\"thousands, not millions\\" of years old, estimating that a creation date of about 10,000 B.C. would be about right in his mind. Commenting on First Corinthians he explains that miracles and healing were \\"temporary sign gifts\\" ... \\"limited to the apostolic age and have, therefore, ceased.\\" I was really looking forward to studying with the \\"Commentary\\". I still think it can be a very good study tool for people who are comfortable with the author's viewpoints.

Instead of exegesis (scholarly applications and conclusions) he opts to re-write the Scriptures (eisegesis). How do I know this? Look at every instance of baptism in God's Word and MacArthur's twisting of its meaning. It is past time to give a hard look at what all these \\"religious leaders, aka televangelists\\" are saying and writing, don't you think?

It really is hard to take apart and put together and does a very poor job with the actual chopping, which is what is it's only function. My Mom has the original Pampered Chef chopper and it's a dream! I was hoping this one would be just as good. It's not. Do not buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls apart","review":"This worked fine the first few times I used it. The plastic part that moves around as you chop keeps food from sticking to the side of the clear plastic chopping area nicely. However, after using it only about 5 times, the top ball came off, and it doesn't go back on. So technically it still works OK, but without the ball on top to cushion your hand it's a bit painful to use.

The one we have is very heavy gauge metal, and dark inside and out. The one in the picture looks like it is dark inside and out, suggesting a heavy gauge metal. However, the one we received is clearly lightweight metal, similar to the light gray pie tins you can buy. It feels like it has no substance to it and that looking at it will cause it to crumple. Also, unlike the pan in the picture, the inside of the pan is light gray (like a cheap pan would be) but the outside appears to have been spray-painted dark grey on the wide middle part (the bottom and top rims are lighter grey).

This was one of the easier specialty character cakes that I've done over the years and he recognized him right away and loved the cake. Because the whole cake was just the face as opposed to several that are of the entire body, it was much easier to decorate and the indentations were much more distinct.

However, the fatal flaw appears to be reliability.I hung the thermometer in my oven, whereupon first use, it proclaimed that my oven's thermostat was 50 degrees too cool. The second time, 25 degrees hot. The third time, it was right on the nose. The fourth time, the needle never budged off its resting point.

Barely thorough the third chapter, I couldn't wait to share this with others. So I purchased a number of extra copies and gave them out to my siblings and other friends who also have difficult parents.

This is a web smart switch so it does have a good deal of functionality that are offered with managed switches. It has features like VLAN, QOS, and Jumbo Frame support.This switch replaced two 24 port 10/100 Ethernet switches. The goal was to upgrade our network to support our many servers and newer workstations that have gigabit Ethernet cards. This switch really did the trick and the speed difference is amazing even cutting down on network backup time by more than half.There is one minor issue with the switch, which could be a non-issue for most people. The fans can be pretty loud on this switch, however, considering it is a rack mount switch, it will probably be placed in a server room. Again, a minor issue, not really worth knocking off a star. I would highly recommend this switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLASTIC - NOT Stainless Steel","review":"This Salt and Pepper set is made of plated plastic!!!!!!I'd assume the internal mechanism of the pepper grinder is made of metal but this set is going back to Amazon.

Very cheap feel to them. The title of product is very misleading. No where in the description does it say they are plastic with stainless looking coating. I didn't notice the reviews when I purchased I was kind of in a hurry. I wish I would have looked because I see others said the same thing. Shame on Amazon. You can't leave customer service feedback for them either like you do with other sellers."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Okay","review":"This set looks really nice in package.

As many have criticized, they are plastic. They put enough \\"token\\" parts to be able to legally justify saying \\"stainless steel\\" on their labels. Legal? -probably. Ethical - no way. It is bait-and-switch, a technique that is illegal according to many state attorney generals. To top it off, the parts inside are plastic too, and guess what? They break, as mine did. This is where the \\"lifetime warranty\\" came in handy, or so I thought. Their \\"warranty\\" consists of sending your mill in, at YOUR cost, to be repaired. And to get it back, you must also send in $12.00 for their return shipping. By the time I do that, I might as well put all that money toward a better mill. This is not a warranty, it is a program to make you buy a new mill from their company when yours breaks. Stay away from this brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritual Read","review":"I really enjoyed this book, it was very uplifting and kept me coming back.

However, the dialogue was so stilted and unbelievable, it was difficult to become involved in the story. The conversations between husbands and wives, between children and parents, etc. were dripping with sentiment and religious phrases such that they became trite. Who in today's world, let alone yesterday's world, would continually communicate in such a manner? Since Book 1 has been such a drudgery to plow through, I have abandoned the idea of reading the sequels even though I already purchased them. The tragedy is that the little known subject matter of the orphan trains, handled differently, could have been exciting, convicting and such a joy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"preaching overcame interesting subject","review":"This book was so heavy handed with preaching that the characters, story and scenes were completely overwhelmed.

But on my Ludwig Bonham Amber Vistalite I use the Speed King. I also have a 70's original Speed king in my Living room china Cabinet. Basically there is not much difference between the two. Same weight and action. I like a direct drive pedal as opposed to chain(Cams) or straps. On my Ludwig kit I find myself backing my foot off the pedal and droping it down and mainly working it with the ball of my foot for the fast response. So far is has held up fine, but if it breaks I will probably want another one because for the single bass action I really enjoy it! The Yamaha pedals like much of todays modern pedals are heavier and are a kind of different thing I think. On my 24\\" Maple kicks I would use those actually. But for the felt beater and a 26X14\\" kick the speed king is a groove!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pedals I've ever Played","review":"First off, I gave this 4 stars because I haven't played this particular pedal. I used to play an original Speed King (wish I still had it!)and there's a reason it's called a SPEED King. Easy to play, easy to do quick \\"skips\\",(like a double bass) and easy on the shins! I LOVE Speed King pedals, and there are a lot of other drummers that swear by them. There's nothing fancy about them, they're just GREAT pedals..the best in my opinion, and I've played quite a few. I used to almost CHERISH that pedal! You could switch drum types etc, but the pedal STAYS!

It had me captivated from the opening page to the very end. The characters are what make this book so special. The story is told by psychotherapist Dr. Duke and delves into his Thursday sessions with four of his most dynamic patients. They range from comical, to pathetic, to annoying, to scary (and that's just one character!). Each time the oddity seems to level off somebody manages to spiral down to the next level.

Those three things are Rock For Light, I Against I , and Quickness which are all essential to any comprehensive music collection. I think there are two kinds of music, good and bad. Sadly, this Building a Nation falls into the bad category. It sounds like a band that has lost any form of relevence or cohesion.

I've never been able to understand those fans who feel that their Rock For Light album is the only good and real thing they've ever done. These guys have so much good material, they are simply brilliant. That being said, does one want to start learning about them by listening to their last two albums? (Nation and God of Love?). I think not. After you've listened to their classic stuff in the early 80's, then move on to Quickness (one of the rockingest albums in all history), if you dig that, then try God of Love and Build a Nation. Build a Nation is DAMN good, they are thrashy, noisy, FAST!! And the mellow songs are good as always.

ALTHOUGH, for some reason, on Build a Nation, it doesn't bother me at all, and i find myself actually getting into some of the tracks.

Compared to hardcore/dub-littered classics like Bad Brains, Rock For Light, and the archetypical Black Dots, this simply lacks the raw, punchy energy that made them so revolutionary (not to mention entertaining)in the first place.H.R.'s legendary vocals are afflicted with similar symptoms; indiscernible, low in the mix, and effect slathered. I wouldn't call it a colossal failure of a comeback, as their have been far worse - it just doesn't measure up, and certainly lacks relevance today.Hell, the best Build A Nation offers this time around seems to be the reggae. If the guys chose to reamp their I Against I sound (which I've never been a fan of, even), they'd probably flip a few more wigs than 'resurrecting' a sound that has been built upon and revived with relative consistentcy for the past 20 some years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer.","review":"I'm not a fan of the vocals/vocal effects at all.

Every time, the base will flip up sideways or the top portion will close and just slide right past the base, not gripping it at all.

I'm a solid, experienced, intermediate level sewer who loves to sew tee shirts, and I found a great deal of helpful information, some of which was new to me. So I completely disagree with the reviewer who thought experienced sewers wouldn't learn anything new from it.The clearly written and well illustrated section on altering patterns to assure a perfect fit was especially valuable for me. I only wish I'd read this chapter earlier this year when I made half a dozen muslins to fine tune the fit of my basic tee shirt pattern.

But anyway...this band is a lot of fun! Especially live. I recently saw them open for Flogging Molly on the Green 17 Tour and was very impressed. Too often opening bands are just...ok.

I'm glad I bought It."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good GBC fare","review":"The fourth installment of the long running Alone in the Dark series makes it's GameBoy Color debut, and the results are surprising. For being an 8-bit GBC game, the graphics are awesome, even reminiscent of Konami's GBC version of Metal Gear Solid. Besides the great graphics and sound, the only glaring problem with the game is that it is incredibly easy to get lost in the game and the enemies and puzzles are taxing. Not to mention the game has virtually no replay value once you beat it, no matter how much of a survival horror fan you are. Despite that though, as far as the genre goes on the GBC, there is this game and Resident Evil Gaiden, and Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare is noticibly superior. All in all, if your still playing your GameBoy Color, this game is definitely worth checking out, and from the looks of things it's most certainly better than the upcoming movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"It saved my family!!","review":"This book is equalled only by one other, \\"Build a Catapult in your Backyard,\\" available here on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Youthworker Journal Review","review":"Rick McNeely, in Youthworker Journal (March/April 2003), said this about the book HOW TO GET YOUR TEEN TO TALK TO YOU:There've been a couple of times when a book ends up on my desk that goes far beyond its intended good, reaching past its target audience and opening a door to a fuller life with deeper relationships. This is such a book. Its intent is to speak to parents, to help them get their kids to talk to them instead of them talking at their teenagers. The book ends up being a lesson in communication, about taking care of yourself in order to take care of others . . . oh, and about parents and how they can get their teens to talk to them.

Also, some of the interpretations in the Symphonic Metamorphosis are quite contrary to the style of the piece. This recording just isn't the one you are looking for.

My one complaint is I had ordered it for climbing and not lifting. It's a very smooth and fine chalk (even the chunks break smoothly...silky is another word to use). I find this to be very effective for lifting, but when it comes to climbing, I prefer a chalk with a bit more grit. Let my team use it, and they agree, it's just too fine for climbing. Don't get me wrong, its not terrible for climbing, it dries your hands just fine, but again, myself and my team, we prefer a bit of grit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Chalk","review":"I only buy this kind of chalk and love it.

However, since it has been impossible to locate, I found this book which I think is O.K. No doubt is more complete than many I have found in my search, but I think its title is misleading since it says \\"A record of your early years\\" and it actually covers only the first year. Also, I think there are sections completely unrelevant (for instance too much on the grandparents instead of information to complete about the new baby). If you are the kind of person who would like to record in detail the physical and social development of your child, this is not the book to buy. If you are looking for a book with very nice illustrations for the first year, then it is o.k."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby: A record book of your early years","review":"While the illustrations in this book are lovely, and there are many wonderful categories that will spur a parent to write rememberances of events that might otherwise have been overlooked, I ultimately did not keep the book. The main reason: it is written strictly from the mother's perspective. Couples who wish to jointly track their memories of their child will, I believe, find offputting categories requiring mom to relate what dad thought about the child.

Be prepared with the knowledge that Rhino did the best they could on the analog to digital transcriptions with the masters that were still available.

The plot is far-fetched, and I never accepted the premise or the denouement. Moreover, the jeopardy is cooked. The writing is full of cliches. The characters are flat and unbelievable. The atmosphere is not there. The dialogue is clumsy and stilted.One has to wonder how something like this passes the editor's blue pencil.

Its amazing that it took two people to write something this infantile and uninteresting. Mary Higgins Clark has been on a downward spiral for years, but this is a new low. The story is boring and most people will be so far ahead of the plot that its not even worth finishing the book. With so many young writers unable to break into the business its a shame that the old guard can churn out garbage like this and still be on the best seller list. Shame on you Mary and Carol for selling this kind of junk to your fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the usual Mary Higgins Clark","review":"As an avid reader of Mary Higgins Clark, I found myself disappointed in her latest effort.

Carol adds just the right amount of humor .."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deck the Halls","review":"I have every book that Mary Higgins Clark has written and have been a long time fan. This one was the pits. You knew the entire story before you were even through the first 30 pages. There was no mystery to this mystery. You knew who the kiddnappers were, and why Luke and Rosita were kidnapped. The reason I loved her earlier books was because she gave you clues without actually telling you who it was. It was a challenge to me to see if I could figure it out by the end. There was no challenge to this book at all, just mindless reading. I have read Snagged and Decked by Carol Higgins Clark who can not write at all but is merely riding on the coat tails of her mother's success. Carol Higgins Clark has no talent which shows in this \\"joint effort\\". Best advice to readers, stick to the books that Mary Higgins Clark wrote by herself, without the influence of her talentless daughter. They are the best examples of her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave No Cliche Behind","review":"I was looking for some fluff after reading two war novels in a row. I needed a break, and I'd read some MHC books back in the day and enjoyed them. This book is an insult to readers' intelligence. Name a cliche and it's in there along with terrible dialogue, paper thin characters, and a story devoid of suspense.

Save your time and money and skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware of rugs and heels","review":"Once again Clark has written a fun holiday story. I epsecially like how the two authors merge their two characters. What a great idea. It really works well and the two characters are the perfect ones to combine.

Crimes known to be done by certain gangs are covered, heredity of the latino gangs, tattos, etc. are both covered and photos shown.Seems like a good informational book with little narrative about what society should do about them.

What makes this CD worth the purchase is the collection of music otherwise unknown although very listenable. The Suit Italienne, the first two movements of the Divertimento, and the rousing Danse Russe concluding the album. Mordkovitch plays these pieces faithfully, avoiding unnecessary frills and tempo changes, but she too often lacks a bit of warmth and dynamic, giving a monotonous feel to the collection. However, the freshness and innate beauty of the music overcomes some of the underwhelming qualities of the soloist. For those who enjoy exquisite violin sonatas, like ones by Franck, Debussy, or Prokofiev, rest assure that Stravinsky will fit into your playlist seamlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naivete betrayed","review":"This is an accomplished crime novel by a British writer that has a satisfying level of complexity in the plot. Helen West, prosecutor, was to marry Bailey. Ryan was Bailey's bag carrier. Elsewhere Aemon Connor and Brigid, his wife, bickered. There was an allegation of rape against Detective Sergeant Ryan. Helen West went to see Anna Stirland, a midwife, who had been raped and was not dealing with things well.Ryan was suspended from duty and denied accesss to his office. A co-worker, Sally Smythe, and Ryan kept a book on cases where they believed the complaint but proof was lacking and critical information was missing. They had begun to theorize that there was a pattern. The author builds for the reader some of such cases as the mystery progresses.Fortunately Bailey is not content to let Ryan twist under the implication he has committed an offense and Helen has a very deep liking for the truth. They continue to seek answers as a chilling end is reached."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have used a tarp and bungie cords instead","review":"After having multiple installation issues to begin with, it started to break apart.

Not in my eyes. The author does include \\"Anne Frank: The Diary Of A Young Girl\\" so she's not ALWAYS wrong. But it does seem that Ms. Odean doesn't seem to be interested in books that make good reading but only books that make good points (by her feminist definition).

Also, this game was way too easy and over too quickly,(meaning the value relating to replayability and amount of first time play value is poor) the puzzles are too simple and the number of enemies you face is far less than previous TR games.

I love the Tomb Raider series and they could have not picked a better actress to play Lara Croft, but waiting and waiting for the Angel of Darkness to come out is only pissing me off. Not even waitng for the next installment of the Sopronos is this bad.

She's hard to control and will fall to her death with monotonous regularity *yawn*. Other than that, pleasant enough graphics and story line (typical tombraider stuff). Nothing innovative and would have greatly benefited from a little more work prior to game release... boo hoo.. definitely rent before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!! Worst Tomb Raider game ever played!","review":"I would think most of the Tomb Raider fans have already bought this game by now. I am very disappointment about this game. I waited a long time for this game. Not to mention I am a tomb raider fan. Who design the controls? It's horrible!! I played MSG2 and Splinter cell, and they are very easy to control and understand. I played two nights and I stopped because I got so sick of the controls. I didn't even get a chance to get into the game because I just didn't want to play anymore. Yes, I am very frustrated because I love Tomb Raider, and they (designer and programer) really screw this game up. So, I suggest all the gamers try this game out meaning rent this game before you buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Well I have been a fan of Lara Croft (not the tomb raider series) for a while... This is my first Tomb Raider title that I actually play.After more than 72 hours of gameplay! all this game has that is worth any positive comment is the story line...other than that this game is garbage!! I don't know how else to describe it...The stealth mode is useless! the enemy AI is pathetic!! Contra for NES had better AI than this...There are countless Bugs in the game! Slowdown! The control setup for Lara is Terrible! (I can't believe anyone would compare her stealth abilities to those of Solid Snake). Metal Gear Solid 1's control was better than this set up! 100 fold!This game has been in development for 2 generation of titles for PS2. Eidos has no excuse for delivering the fans of this series with such an incompetent effort!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this mess of a game!","review":"I love the TR series, but this game is awful. It would be a fun game if not for all the bugs. It does have better graphics than the others, but that's the only nice thing I can say. It's amazing the number of bugs this game has considering how long the game was delayed. I've played demos with fewer bugs. The game will slow down because it's raining on the screen. It slows down other times for no apparent reason. And the control scheme is arguably the worst I've ever played. You'll get stuck climbing up ladders that you don't want to climb and other won't be able to climb boxes that you need to climb all because of the poor way the control scheme is set up. This game is sad, and the manufacturer should be ashamed that they didn't do any better with the extra time they had to get all the kinks worked out of this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoulda left her dead.","review":"Clunky,almost impossible controls...camera angles that refuse to correct themselves...did I mention the horrible controls? Try to move in a direction, she turns around! And what is with her constantly drawing her gun when you try to jump onto an object?Did I mention the user-UNfriendly controls?One star deserved because they finally got past the lousy polygon graphics and went with smooth texture mapping and some very nice light sourcing. By the way, the light sourcing SLOWS the game down (you'll see that right away on a rainy rooftop).Oh, and my game went black screen twice, in the first half hour and had to be restarted.Too bad I waited so long for this. I personally looked forward to a revisit to TR One and Two. Such ground-breaking games. Hope this game gets better or it goes in the shiny frisbee stack."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this get past the game testers?","review":"Seriously, trust me when I say that this game is really bad - tons of glitches so far including falling through scenery, opponents who just stand there motionless, etc. and the controls are horrible.....I remember everybody used to complain about the controls on the old Tomb Raider games, but I played it so much they became total second nature too me...the new controls seem so hit and miss and just plain frustrating. It [...] because I was really looking forward to this game, but once again they managed to screw it up.....I seriously wish I could get my money back for this game......Go back and play the first two again instead of this one.......the graphics are good, I'll give it that, but they;ve been working on this game so long they look really dated...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great game (if you can manage to beat the glitches first).","review":"I was excited to get this game... Until I played it. The game itself is fun, but a lot of the camera angles suck. I'm also COMPLETELY stuck in one part, because a glitch is preventing me from getting what I need. Which means I'm stuck in a club with repetitive techno music I can't shut off unless I decide to completely restart my game. It also has lousy maps. I had to just run around until I started recognizing buildings. Its not too clear on where your supposed to go. Like I said, if you have a LOT of time and patience on your hands to get past the glitches, it's a fun game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I have played all of the Tomb Raider series. I consider myself above average with gaming control, and this game has the worst control of any of the Tomb Raider games. Laura is slow and delayed in her movements. The days of fast moving Laura with precision jumps is gone. I assume my dog and I would have an equal chance of playing Laura against an advanced foe. I have decided to make a Frisbe out of my CD so I can at least get some enjoyment from the game. I will never buy another Tomb Raider game without a test drive from the store or a rental. The TR5 engine will have be brought back to save the Tomb Raider series, and it will be difficult to get back the people who have written it off. The only people who will enjoy this game are those who have suffered a stroke and have impared motor skills. What a shame to disgrace the best action adventure game of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angel of Darkness is worth the effort...","review":"Overall, I really enjoy the game. I've been playing it since I got it in November, and I haven't gotten bored with it yet. But I usually play the game 8 or 10 hours a week, so I'm only 3/4 of the way through it. The first 3 weeks I started to think buying it was a mistake. The controls are hard to get used to, and are entirely too sensitive. But if you stick it out, get used to them, you'll really enjoy the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"Awfull controls, full of bugs, OK graphics, nice storyline. Shame because it could be so much better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Devistatingly Disappointing","review":"Let me start by saying I have everything tomb raider from all the games to a hat from the ride to a bobble head lara croft doll. Now setting the stage for where I'm coming from, what the hell happened?! New controls?? Game glitches so bad I had to restart from a new game TWICE due to getting trapped or \\"pinned\\" into an area that WASN'T supposed to function as a trap. The game is so disfunct that at one point I was climbing down a pole then suddenly started to levitate. The controls have taken over and walked me off an edge. I pushed every button to stop and nothing worked. It has locked up when I simply used a health pack. Some boards are so graphic intense that the frame rate dropped to about 3 per second...I though this was an effect like the matrix in slow mo, but it was just BAD DEVELOPMENT! Let me finish by saying I am now playing TR1 to try and get the love back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"The graphics on this game are amazing. So amazing in fact that the PS2 console has trouble handling it. There is so much slow down during some parts that it becomes ridiculous. On top of that Lara moves horribly slow. So slow, I wanted to toss the game out the window.You know in the previous games, you got some Uzies and a hand gun to start out and you could do some cool flips and shoot the bad guys. That doesnt happen in this game. It's not till I played the game for an hour that I got to shoot someone. In fact it wasnt till the third level that I realized I had a gun.I am really disappointed with this game. The people at Eidos good have done so much better. Do not buy this game if you wish to keep your sanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I got this game this weekend and it's terrible. Long and frequent load times, Lara is harder to control in this game than she was in Tomb Raider 2. The graffics show little if any improvement from the last PSX Tomb Raider outing . . . I can't believe I've been waiting this long for this game. You would think with an 8 month delay, Eidos could have gotten it right. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angel of Darkness - the best TR yet!","review":"I've been a fan of the series since I got the first game for Christmas way back in 96. I love it! I think this is the best game in the series.. and of course, Lara's never looked better. I really enjoy the RP-like elements that they implemented into the game. I also like the strength meter Lara has when hanging onto or shimmying across ledges now. Makes the game much more realistic. I haven't played a game this fun in ages. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"this game stinks on ice","review":"This is the worst game I have ever played besides lord of the rings the two towers. The controls were so bad that if you pressed jump forward, she would jump sideways. What's the deal? Then there were so many Bugs like boaz you had to press square to aim when square is really to roll. Can anyone see how boaz was once a human?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down","review":"By far, the worst of the TR games. Glitches and bugs are everywhere and even frequent saves won't save you from having to start over. Important pieces of rooms go missing or the screen turns to grey. Sometimes Lara becomes invisible and you should probably turn down the volume on your tv because when her guns get stuck on super rapid fire, the sound is deafening!I won't bother going into the poor controls. Save your money. Rent this game or borrow a buddy's so you can see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is HORRIBLE","review":"Ok. There should be a negative 5 star rating just for this game. Graphically, the game doesn't look too bad at all, but the controls are so incredibly f!@#ed up, you can't even play the game. No, seriously, they're that bad. They should have kept their original controller setup, because you were essentially controlling a puppet. With this controller setup, you can't even turn around w/o a fair degree of difficulty. In the words of Mr. T, \\"I pity the fool that buys this game.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best game on the PS2!","review":"This is by far the best game in the series. Some of the other games from the series were very dull compared to this. I liked how you could make Lara adapt to how you play, by making her stronger, letting her talk to people which altars the way the game finishes. I also liked how the makers of this game did a better job on the graphics. You could tell that they did in fact take their time on this game. I also think it is cool how they let you play as a different character. If you have never played any games in this series, this would definitely be the best one to try out. If you are used to games such as Resident Evil, or Metal Gear Solid, and you like the gameplay, this game is very similar. It is by far an awesome game and I would get it, no questions asked."},{"rating":"2","title":"angel of darkness","review":"I LIKE THE GAME,WITH IT'S NEW FEATURES AND GRAPHICS.

I was so excited when I found out they were finally making tomb raider for the PlayStation 2. Little did I know the people creating this game were high on crack and blew their entire budget on rocks. I literally played this game for 30 minutes and couldn't take any more. Gave it a couple months and tried to go back and play it, and it still made me want to strangle a Kennedy.

The graphics are the best thing about the game. As a gamer addicted to Tomb Raider this game was really disappointing because it strayed so far away from the original idea. The levels are short and it is a real pain trying to figure out the new button configuration. It is also lame how different icons will appear to let the gamer know what they should be doing such as the hand icon that lets you know that Lara can open a cabinet or door. I just want my Tomb Raider back.

To say the least, I was very disappointed. To keep it simple, there are no tombs, the controls are horendously bad, the game freezes up and has to be restarted, and the game has a slow down problem. Most of these factors could be overlooked if the controls were like the controls from the old Tomb Raider games.On the positive side, the game has great graphics, and has a very interesting storyline. Rent this game before you buy it.I sold mine back and took the loss only two days after buying it. Don't make the same mistake that I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait","review":"This game has mixed reviews, but as an avid Tomb Raider fan, this game definitely lives up to expectations. The controls are basically the same, with a few minor adjustments. The gameplay is difficult (extremely hard without a players guide), but that is what has made all the Tomb Raider games so enjoyable. The graphics are outstanding, and the storyline has far surpassed the previous editions. I am 3/4 through this game, and I can't put the controller down. I think it will be even more enjoyable the second time around, not using a players guide. One of the top 5 games of the year - hands down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your $50.","review":"There will be some people who have to have this game and that's okay. Let those 3 people sit and torture themselves while you could be playing something else. This game doesn't seem finished. There are so many glitches and bugs in this game that it's a chore to play. It's a miracle if you can get Laura to do what you want on the first try. There are those of you who are saying you like a challenge. Go play GT3 and shoot for 100% completion. That's a challenge. The only saving grace for this game is the story. The story is told rather well and that's where my 1 star comes from. I guarantee this game will hit the bargain bin faster than you can say huge disappointment. Trust me. You'll be happier saving the $40. You're not missing much."},{"rating":"2","title":"this game is awsome!!","review":"This game is the best of tomb raider yet!! I have been a fan since the begining and this game kicks a$$!!

I definately recomend this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably good, but what happened to \\"Tomb\\" Raider?","review":"Well, I think that this game will probably be a great game, but what happened to the Tomb Raider spirit? The original Tomb Raider games were about raiding tombs, jungles, Area 51, islands, and other places to find a mystical artifact that had awesome powers. This game strays away from that idea to join the crime drama bandwagon that took off with the release of Max Payne. Max Payne was good, but Tomb Raider should be different, and now that it's similar, and in my opinion that's not good. If you want a good game that requires you to raid tombs, get Indiana Jones and the Emperors Tomb, not Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness, but if you want another crime drama game, get the new Tomb Raider."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!","review":"A total waste of time and money.

Then they TOOK AWAY LARA'S TRADITIONAL OUTFIT!!! I LOVED THAT OUTFIT! They took away Lara's pistols and added Kurtis or whatever his name was. I don't understand why they did this because it just frusterated me even more. Then there are the camera angles. Oh, boy. I could rant on and on about how the angles... I cant even put it into words. They always changed and moved when you didnt want them to. And Von Croy died! Overall, don't buy this game. Don't rent this game.

Instead, I was frustrated and disappointed.The controls are completely different, and Lara isn't very responsive. The game looks better than any of the previous games, but it doesn't compare to other modern console games. Broken hearted, I set the game aside before finishing the training level. It took a repeat viewing of the second movie to prompt me to pick the game back up. I just finished it, and it earns a solid 2.25 on a 5 point scale from me.Specific complaints:Unresponsive controls, bad camera angles, LOTS of BUGS, very linear levels, too easy (I finished with 12 100% Med packs and hundreds of rounds of ammo)The positives:Sound is okay, graphics are decent, the new (stealth) moves are coolPurchase at your own peril..."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I have played all the tomb raider games be it on the computer orplay station, but Angel of darkness was very disappointing.

What did they come up with in the end ... make Lara jump lots.They know that it's hard to jump where you want to so they put you in loads of positions where you have to reach tiny targets that are in the middle distance.

I played all of them before I played this one. Then, I tried this one even when I heard many bad things from reviews, but still I wanted to see it for myself and they were all right. This game sucked. Many times was too slow (walking in slow motion), it was kind of like Metal Gear (but embarrassing Solid Snake), there were not enough puzzles (and the ones it had were boring and repeatitive), the design was bad, and the graphics I expected more since this was the first tomb raider on PS2 (I liked better the previous games the way she used to move).

I thought the sense of freedom was well done and was an improvement from the other games. For all you people not rating this fairly because you don't really \\"raid\\" anything, Lara Croft:Tomb Raider is her title. Now that I have that cleared up, let's move on. The Angel of Darkness focuses on Lara being caught in the middle of grisly murders and is on the run. One thing I liked is that you can choose what to say, and that really made the game re-playable for me, to see what would happen if I was mean/rude.I only paid $10 for this game, so I can't say it wasn't worth my money.

Since disco instrumentals were more readily accepted by pop audiences than rock instrumentals, disco is well-represented by \\"TSOP\\", \\"A Fifth of Beethoven\\" and the mildly-obscure \\"Sun Goddess\\". That said, I simply don't care for several of these selections - \\"The Hustle\\" snf \\"Also Sprach Zarathustra\\" especially.

I use small cat pellets (less than 1/4\\") and it has yet to jam. It is light on this base so my cats have figured out how to knock it over but I added extra weight and it's no longer a problem.

I find the feeder to be a well made and well designed product (and isn't it nice to find a quality product which is made in the USA ).I relied on the manufacturer's video during assembly because I tend to respond better to a visual guide. Assembly took some concentration, but everything came together fairly easily, and I was relieved to find that the final adjustments I had to make for my cat's particular brand of dry food were not difficult. ( I did fine tune my initial settings after about two weeks).I bought this particular model because of the many positive and helpful reviews which I found here on Amazon...they convinced me that spending a bit more than I had initially planned would get me a better product...and it did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, reliable, impossible for cat to break in to","review":"I found the Superfeeder after discovering that my cat could break into any timed pet feeder on the market. I often have to take short trips, and my cat does not have the foresight that if she eats the whole pile of food now, she will be starving by the time I return home (I can't say I'd be much better were I in her paws :) ). Along with doing its timed feeding job perfectly, this machine can withstand a full-on hungry feline assault from the highly trained feeder demolition team that is my cat. It completely blows away all competing models I've tried; while it's pricey and requires a little analog configuration, you won't regret purchasing this feeder."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for dual feeder","review":"I have two \\"aggressive\\" kitties. The only way a feeder would work is if it could drop food into two bowls simultaneously. Otherwise, the cats would fight over whatever went into a single bowl.I hooked up two of these feeders to a single timer, it works perfectly! I have the version with stainless steel bowl. This bowl is great at letting the cats know the food is on its way. The bowls clang with each piece of kibble that falls into them, thereby alerting the cats, even if they are upstairs in a far bedroom.We used to leave out a large bowl of food when away on trips, but our cats really can't control their eating. This feeder makes it easy to control their food intake when we're not at home.We use the Whole Foods brand catfood with these feeders (purple bag)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smelly bowl, horrible set-up, overall clumsy","review":"One reason I bought this feeder is that it has a stainless steel bowl (many have plastic). However, the rubber rim on this bowl stinks so bad I had to throw it away. Can't say for sure, but if anything smelled toxic... and who wants that right up against their cat's nose? The instructions for putting this together were some of the worst I've ever seen. Overall, making adjustments to this feeder is very awkward.

Annie soon discovers that in the Victorian era, women were somehow worse off than in her own time.Though the plot is interesting, the romance inticing, and the characters real, the writing technique is not my favorite.

Not only are the characters shallow and barely constructed, but their thoughts sound like the words of a four-year-old enamored with her favorite TV show. The story itself--the setting, the research, the plot--have the potential to produce a five-star product, but Cooney seriously fails somewhere between her thoughts and the act of writing them down.If you love Harlequin books, shallow romances, and fuddy-duddy teen novels, definitely give this one a go.

Like other former Australians (Germaine Greer etc) Pilger has become content to sit comfortably at home in England critising a society in which he has not truely participated for 20 years. No number of smiling photos in the outback, or wistful stories of childhood in Bondi will disguise the underlying fact that he is still stung by 60's Australian society, and apparently believes that little has changed here since that time.The timely revelation of decades of abuse against indigenous Australians was skillfully and appropriately composed, but much of the rest of the book is grossly self indulgant"},{"rating":"1","title":"well written conspiracy theorist's handbook","review":"I guess if it smells like a conspiracy, looks like a conspiracy, sounds like a conspiracy, well it must be the truth.Apparently, Australian politics throughout the 80's was held together by a bunch of 'mates'.

Being from Maui, Hawaii, where he was spotted every now and then at the Sir Wilfreds' Cafe at the Maui Mall, where he took part-time residence and played a very low profile in the community, I felt especially connected to the Indian spiritual sounds of the transcendental music on this performance composed by Ravi Shankar. Eric Clapton and friends organized a beautiful gift for their beloved friend. Heartfelt performances, interviews and dialogue in the extras on the DVD encapsulate what transpired that evening of November 29, 2002 at the Royal Albert Hall, London. If I had known about this concert, I would have post-poned my trip to London in the March of 2002 to attend this once in a life time Concert for George.Aloha & Mahalo George."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest!","review":"after seeing a DVD clip of this tried to buy the album in Australia without luck.

Had the US DVD system been compatible with Australian would have bought the DVD but the CD is the next best thing. Fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable performance!","review":"I remember seeing this amazing performance on PBS, and was hooked from that moment on.

It was very nice to see Ringo, Paul and Eric in a very good shape and singing better than ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot Reccomend this Enough...","review":"This is, without a doubt, the very best music I have ever heard. The talent on the stage is unbelievable, the sound is incredible. All of the songs played in this concert are played better than they ever have been before. All of them actually sound better than in their studio recording version. It is also a very fitting and very much earned tribute the my favorite Beatle. It is worth the $20.00 and much more; having listened to it, I would have paid double that amount! BUY THIS DVD, OR AT LEAST THE SOUNDTRACK, YOU'LL NEVER REGRET IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best thing since The Last Waltz.","review":"Words cannot express how great this film is. A must see for all musicians & for anyone who enjoyed George Harrison's music. Eric Clapton is in the best form I've ever seen. Check out Gary Brooker singing 'Old Brown Shoe'-----priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply great","review":"As of this writing, there's nearly 200 reviews of this DVD, and the number of reviews with less than 5 stars can be counted on one hand. That pretty much says it all. This DVD is brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sam Brown-Magnificent!!","review":"With all due respect to the concert, one thing that made me watch this DVD so many times was Sam Brown's rendition of Horse on the Water. For me, I have discovered a singer whose voice is so forceful that it actually made me fall in love with her. WHAT A SONG!!! WHAT A SINGER!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All things must pass away...","review":"I always liked the Harrison Beatle songs the best, so it was a no-brainer to get this DVD.Really liked it, although I was not familiar with some of the performers - my bad, I guess.Don't much care for the Monty Python section in the concert, but because George was apparently a fan (an exec producer of a movie of theirs), there it is. Within that part, however, it was nice to see Tom Hanks involved without fanfare.Of course George had the heavy east Indian influence, but I liked Ravis Shankar and his daughter's contribution the least - but that's just me.I've got a few concert DVD's. This ranks right up there with the best. I dinged it one star only because of the 2 mentioned sections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet & Beautiful","review":"IF YOUR A BEATLE/GEORGE HARRISON FAN, AND YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS DVD, THEN YOUR NOT A FAN. IT IS THE BEST PERFORMED TRIBUTE CONCERT EVER CONCEIVED. LAID-BACK GEORGE HIMSELF I'M SURE WOULD BE PROUD OF THIS EFFORT. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SONGS PEFORMED AND HIS ORIGINAL RECORDINGS IS THAT GEORGE IS NOT THERE HIMSELF TO SING THEM.

AN ABSOLUTE MUST SEE, AND HEAR IN DTS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Throw away disc 1 and it's even better.","review":"One of the great music experiences ever.Some of the greatest musicians of all time playing together.Tribute to George Harrison.Disc 1 is a sitar orchestra. Watch it once and say, \\"That's interesting\\", then throw it away.Disc 2 is incredible. If you can watch Billy Preston doing \\"My Sweet Lord\\", Sam Brown on, \\"Horse to Water\\", and Eric Clapton on, \\"When My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and not be moving your body, check for a pulse.Hell, the backup players include Paul McCartney, ELO's Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty, Gary Brooker of Procol Harum, Ringo Starr.Just get it, thank me later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Concert","review":"In my 35 years in the music business, this has to be one of the most awesome concerts, I have every witnessed. I was really never a George Harrison or Beatles fan, so I didn't know if I would like this DVD.What an incredible surprise! Everyone was brilliant, and I have never seen Eric Clapton sound and play better. Jeff Lynne was also brillant, and really helped Eric reach a musical level, that I haven't seen Clapton reach since the 70's.Also the sound is also well mixed and managed,... not an easy task with that many musicians on-stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving tribute to George Harrison","review":"Eric Clapton loved George Harrison as a friend, as a musician, as a songwriter, as a guitar player, as a human being. It definitely shows in this concert DVD. The concert begins with the Indian music section, and this music is rather impressive. Ravi Shankar and his daughter were in charge of this part, and I enjoyed it immensely. The second part is done by Monty Python, which George absolutely loved Monty Python, but I, personally, can NOT stand Monty Python, that's why I give the DVD 4 instead of 5 stars. So this part I skip. Then Eric takes the stage with other musicians who were friends of George's. For me the highlights are Eric Clapton, Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney. If you are a George Harrison/Beatle fan this DVD is worth the price. Even if you're just a music fan this DVD is worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A memorable tribute to a memorable man,artist and BEATLE..","review":"Friends coming together to pay tribute to George Harrison..The music is superb. The feelings shared are real. This DVD is a must for your collection...It was strange to see how much Dhani resembles his Father...his face, his movements and gestures...This DVD moves me from smiles to tears each time I watch it.....George had some really cool friends. We should all be so lucky.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Brilliant!","review":"I have watched this DVD many times. People who wish to put on all-star concerts should study the Concert For George, because it was done right.All the performances ranged from very good to genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it should be","review":"This is one of the best concert dvd's I've ever seen. The performances, the song selection, the sound, the video direction and the picture quality are everything one could ask for. Sure, there were several more of George's songs that I would have loved to have seen performed, but I'll not be greedy about it. If you've ever enjoyed a George Harrison song then this dvd is for you. The menu alone is practically inspirational. Love it, love it, love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work!","review":"It came on time, but would not play no matter what i did..

I highly recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yep....Absolutely Fantastic","review":"Worth every penny, especially Ravi Shankar.....what a beautiful family he has. George's family, his friends, my word....what an absolutely fantastic gathering at Albert Hall. I'm positive that George would have loved it all.....Billy Preston getting down.....Eric Clapton and everybody else just concentrating on making sure every note was for George. Without a doubt this is the nicest piece of excellent playing released on DVD so far....and yes, you do see George in your dreams for days after you watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing show","review":"The standout moment is Dhani Harrison holding back the tears during \\"Isn't It A Pity\\", but the whole show is an uplifting and moving experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Fantabulous!","review":"The best concert ever! The Indian performance is inspiring. What a thrill to see (and hear) so many guitarists and drummers playing together. It was electrifying. It was so good, I watched it a few times. And everytime my boyfriend asks what DVD we're watching, I'm always quick to offer this DVD title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homeric, Haunting, Beautiful","review":"I may have now watched or listened to this remarkable concert 50 times in the last few months. Like the man it celabrates, it continues to delight me and breath new life into the music of my times. Many on that stage are the rock royalty of the 1960's and onward and they're skills have aged like fine wine. I had to chuckle when I first had my 15 year old watch it. To see all these old guys on stage, playing with such chemistry and soul and TALENT! And then his one word critique \\" WOW\\". What more can I add, other then buy it, play it loud and sit back and see how long it takes you to say \\"WOW\\" too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply beautiful","review":"If you've already seen Concert for George on dvd, the blu-ray does not have much additional material. But it does have improved picture and DTS HD Master sound. The sound alone was worth the purchase for me. The performances are all inspired, the mix fantastic, and the songs are arranged to truly honor their friend, George Harrison. It is as inspiring as it is moving, and just a touch surreal, with Dhani Harrison, looking incredibly like his father as a young man, in the center of the stage for so much of the show. The reverence with which the musicians treat the material is humbling and entirely appropriate. There really isn't a weak song or moment. The show continually builds from beginning to end, and it is very easy to connect with the obvious inspiration and love emanating from each musician. If you like the music of George Harrison, or you like any of the musicians playing in this concert, you will love Concert for George. It is simply beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Me Love, Give Me Peace on Earth!!!","review":"I am so Happy that Eric Clapton was the \\"music coordinator\\" because the concert runs so smoothly and sounds really amazing. After watching it through I realized something which most people would probably disagree but after McCartney comes out, he tries to \\"steal\\" the show (as he always tries to do)...but because the band is so \\"solid\\" by this point...he doesn't get anywhere, and he almost takes a \\"backseat\\" as a one of the performers, instead of being \\"the Main Performer\\".Overall I really enjoyed this DVD...it would have been nice for Joe Brown (ukelele player) to cover some of George's Brainwashed Uke stuff...or even have Dhani sing a song.Good Stuff!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving tribute","review":"I just saw the concert for George DVD and must say it blew me away, the players were all at their best and the selection of songs was just right. It was good to see Paul and Ringo on stage together, and Eric played the guitar amazingly. If you enjoyed George's music you'll love this DVD. Seing Dhani on stage it was like seing George still playing for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Harrison songs","review":"A great DVD. I couldn't believe all of the people who performed. I wish there were names captioned with the people so that that they would be more easy to identify. A very touching and entertaining tribute. Couldn't believe how much his son looked and sounded like him. I even like the Indian music by Ravi Shankar and his daughter. Glad that I have especially now that Billy Preston is no longer with us and he is in the video for most of the concert. Jeff Lynee and Eric Clapton are amazing. The Monty Python part was too long for me (I'm not a big fan of that comedy) but it was a good tribute for George. This DVD really has everything for everybody. Worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Joyous Explosion of Beautiful Music and Memories !","review":"This concert blew me away! All the best musicians in one beautiful place, playing the music of their beautiful friend and someone who has given so much to all of us through his music. This tribute to George Harrison is more moving than I could have ever expected... You will cry, smile, laugh, sing and dance along with all who were there to celebrate the life and music of George. The Concert for George is much more than a dvd...it is a true heartfelt experience in JOY and LOVE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely, Positively Spectacular!!","review":"Received this incredible DVD as a Christmas present, and upon viewing it was simply blown away! I'm not usually a fan of concerts, particularly tribute concerts, put to DVD. They almost always fail to re-create the vibe or feeling of the live performance. This concert is the exception that proves the rule. Great songs played by legendary musicians in tribute to their friend. And, perhaps that's the main thing that separates this from other tribute concerts. Each and every performer loved George, and that love is apparent throughout. Each and every performance is magical, and watching becomes almost a spiritual experience. If you're reading these reviews because you're thinking of buying, then think no more. This is a sensational DVD - 5 stars is not enough. Buy and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing","review":"I get chills even thinking about the concert.

I just wanted to add that this is probably the BEST concert video you will ever see! I have to admit that I really haven't listened to much of George Harrison's solo music, but after this video, plan to explore it more in-depth. What a touching tribute to someone who gave so much to the world of music. I rented this DVD, but plan on buying it TODAY -I would recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Legendary Performance","review":"This may well be the finest live performance ever put out on DVD or film for that matter. The moving and brilliant display is enhanced by high quality sound, exceptional camera work and editing. Eric Clapton is astonishing. He is well supported by a cast of legendary musicians who were all friends of George. This is a must for any lover of music. It is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Harrison DVD set","review":"Very cool! I'll bet on a 60+ inch LCD and a Blu-Ray disc, this would be as good or better than actually being at the concert.

Just buy it!","review":"I rarely write reviews of anything on any site, but I had to comment on this.Some of the greatest players alive, playing some of the most memorable and industry-changing popular music ever written, with outstanding production, a wonderful tribute to both of George's musical worlds (east & west)... this is one of the most treasured DVD's in my collection. It is touching, beautiful, and could not have been done better IMO.I suppose I could've done without the Monty Python bit, but that's just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio is totally unacceptable","review":"Don't buy this DVD if you expect to enjoy your home theater system.

Each character shares a tragic story of bravery, cowardice, betrayal, and sacrifice. However, this video copy was disappointing. There was hardly any sound, even with the volume at the highest setting. Granted, the movie is in Polish and I had to rely on subtitles, but there is more to communication than just words. I missed the emotion in the voice, and missed the ambiance created by the sound effects. Also the picture quality in the kanals seemed poorer than I had remembered, keeping me in near darkness. Kanal is a great movie, but this video's quality was disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful second act","review":"The Bottom Line:Wajda's classic war film takes a little bit of a while to really get interesting (the battle scenes above ground/character development we see occurring is nothing terribly new or fascinating) but once the main characters descend into the sewer and start fighting through muck and grime, Kanal develops into a very compelling picture unlike any I've seen; it's not quite as polished as Ashes and Diamonds, but if you like seeing different shades of World War II then check out this vision of the Warsaw Uprising/the lower depths of Hades.3/4"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crawling through the sewers seeking freedom","review":"Although the film is depressing, it is worth watching. One gains an idea of the conditions of Poland during the war and how the Poles tried to fight back against overwhelming odds. The film itself is very dark, with much of it taking place in the sewers.In this film, a band of Polish soldiers is ordered to retreat through the sewers. Giving up their holding is disappointing to the men, but they have little choice because they lack the weapons and reinforcements to hold their position any longer. The sewers are a maze in which the soldiers try to find their way to freedom.\\"Kanal\\" (1957) is directed by Andrzej Wajda.

It is solidly constructed too. I like it, but it is most certainly a special purpose tool for me because I already own (and love) aBosch PS20-2A. If the PS20 won't fit, then I'll use the PS10. However, because of the relative sizes of the tools, the PS20 is what will most likely be at hand.So, why only four stars? I think the tool head could be smaller to fit into even tighter spaces. After all, this thing's special purpose is fitting into places other drivers can't. Why not go all in and engineer with that idea in mind?My PS10 is a refurb, so the price was rather comfortable. It came with a recharger and two batteries that also fit my PS20 and my PS40.

Save yourself from my mistake and buy something else. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, but special-purpose","review":"I needed a drill that could get into tight places for a cabinetry project I was working on, and the Bosch seemed like the best choice. It's my first experience with the Bosch brand, and generally I'm satisfied with it.I like the two included batteries, the fast recharge time and the beefy performance (regardless whether it's labeled \\"10.8\\" or \\"12\\"). I seem to get substantially longer than advertised battery life - a good thing.Only gripes are that it seems to spin up somewhat eratically sometimes, going from slow to full speed at an odd pace. And it's somewhat of a special purpose tool...even though I suppose you could use it for just about any task, I find myself reaching for my other tools unless I'm doing something in a cramped spot.Overall seems like a high quality unit that will last a long time, and I have no regrets. Solid four-star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good design, needs improvement","review":"Overall this is a great design; heavy and beefy as you'd expect by the price tag.

There is no safety switch to keep the tool from being switched on if its hit by something in the tool bag. And the minimum torque is not that minimum. Its quite a bit of torque before the electronic clutch kicks in.I will keep it but would not buy it again until some of the quirks are worked out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opened Box","review":"Drill shipped as an open box.

Roots of funk indeed! There are a few tracks that most everyone will be familiar with, most notably \\"Tighten Up\\" by Archie Bell & the Drells, but amongst these 18 soul treasures, some of them will be totally new discoveries, even for longtime music listeners. The tunes on here are from the late 60s and early 70s, and as the title indicates, cover the funkier side of soul, although some stuff borders on psychedelic soul and some is more firmly rooted in traditional soul. But it's all wonderful. As you would expect from Rhino, you get quality tunes and an informative booklet. \\"In Yo' Face\\" was an outstanding series of compilations, but I think this volume was the very best of the bunch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed","review":"These things are very thin, thinner than a dime.

This film is a wanna-be Godfather, Scarface, and Good Fellas, and Master P's character is a wanna-be Michael Corleon and Tony Montana. The story-line is cheesie,and the actors put about just as much feeling into acting as low-grade pornstars, which brings me to my next point.

They say it's due to the color palette gaming companies use..., also not all gameboy color games will work. The only time it looked half way decent was on a sunny day outside. Disappointed i took mine back. Other than that, if you don't want to worry about your eyes, or only buying ninetendo games- mario, donkey kong, the sound and graphics are better-if you can see them.

There is no backlite or frontlite. You can't adjust the brightness like you can on the Sp or the DS lite. It is way to dark. It doesn't seem like a big deal because you can just go near a light source, WRONG!! Even when you go near a light source that you still can barely see the screen whatsoever. The graphics for this system is really outdated and really boring. It is not 32 bit it is 16, (which was still really good for that time). But now, it is not good. The DS and the PSP's graphics are now considered really good and 3-D. Most of the games for the DS and the PSP are 3-D anyways. Even the games that are 2-D look so much better than the GBA. It is too outdated. The games for the system o the other hand are pretty good. But you can play GBA games on the DS, so what is the point anyways. That is the only good thing about the system. I say either go for the Nintendo DS Lite. Now!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nintendo is DISHONORABLE","review":"Shame on Nintendo for putting GBA on the market.

Nothing felt like it was put on the CD just to have another song. Each one is a great piece of music on its own and that makes this CD a must have for any fan of bands of this genre.

Please note that these scenes, and others are edited in the R-rated version. Overall, the set-design in this film is awful. The basic plot of this film, is to follow the ultra-violent, neurotic raise to power of Caligula/Cesar (Malcolm McDowell. This film is set in 1st century Rome, the performances and lost. There is a lack of plot, simply due to the need to focus on explicit sex. Peter O'Toole (Tiberius) is totally wasted in this film.

In addition, the books are so cheap that one came apart just from being opened. O.K., so I didn't buy it completely for the pictures, so we pulled out King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table figuring that would be a great story. I think Cliff's notes would be more interesting. The editing essentially left us with \\"King Arthur went here, King Arthur left, Sir Somebody cut of someone's head, etc. etc.\\" Continuity of the story? Who needs that?

I quickly flipped through the last pages in denial (\\"She isn't REALLY going to do that is she?\\"), saw I was right, and gave up on finishing. However, in Erickson's defense: this is her first novel and it shows a lot of promise. I'll definitely look for the next one, but if I were you, I'd skip this one altogether.

There WASN'T an ending because this is a series of books that must be all read together to get the entire story. I wouldn't have been nearly as upset if I'd had a little warning that this book was a dead end street if you didn't have the next ones. The tiny #1 on the spine was the ONLY indication that it was part of a series--seems like a crappy marketing ploy by the publisher to me.Despite all this, I would recommend the book to fantasy lovers and horse lovers alike.

I was a little dissapointed in the ending of The Road to Balinor. It is obviously meant to be in a series because it kind of leaves you hanging. Also, it is kind of hard to figure out.

It had some real writing in it, and I (a 12-year-old girl) found that I was drawn into the world that Ms. Stanton drew. Her novel was quiet extrodinary, but not quiet as good as the others in the series. I think my favorite had to be #5 or #2, but this book got me into it.I suggest it for anyone who really loves a good book. WARNING: This is Fantasy, so if you hate fantasy, then don't read this! If you begin looking for unicorns. . . I don't blame you! Makes you wonder. . .This is not a good book for someone who is under six, though, because it takes a while to figure it out. I suggest it for a child eight or over. . . and basically to about 15, unless you really like Fantasy.

Stay away from them!\\", etc, as it's all very suspenseful with so many twists, and I love it! Sure, some parts can be quite scary, while others can be really cool and make you wish you could have a unicorn or that the Balinor land really does exist, but this book is awesome! I, individually, am very sensative to scary things, yet the frightening scenes in here are good, not the kind of scary where I can't sleep at night, the kind of good scary where I am fearful only at the moment the scene is occuring, then I switch back to being my normal self.This is one GREAT book any horse or unicorn lover would have a fabulous time reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Southern Story, Warm, Funny, Wonderful!","review":"A young southern girl faces adolescence amid a wonderfully dysfunctional but loving family.

Yes, they're different from what they've done in the past, but let go of your preconceptions and just appreciate them.The later cuts are more traditional Cowboy fare. \\"Small Swift Birds\\" has the classic Margo vocals, and \\"Beneath the Gate\\" has the vocals _and_ the depressing backing musicianship. They could churn these out by the dozens and people would be happy, probably including me.The other songs aren't quite up to the stellar work of Black-Eyed Man or Pale Sun, and Crescent Moon, but then that's why those albums are what they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bom como os anteriores e como o proximo","review":"A banda pode voltar a flertar com o mais acusticos dos som amanh, e mesmo assim no perde o rumo, eis a diferena deles.O cd esta muito bom, algo muito mais áspero que o anterior, mas sem perder o tom da melancolia.Dica para os iniciantes... comear pelas ultimas musicas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"no disappointment here!","review":"i have been a junkies fan since the early 90's when i fell under the spell of margo's voice, mike's writing and the addition of al's bass and pete's percussion. i own every album they have cut and eagerly awaited 'open'. it was well worth the wait.'open' starts out dark, but moves into lightness. it is probably not for everybody. some will get it while others won't. thanks mike, margo, al, pete, jeff and the rest .... i haven't stopped listening to it yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"True Fan Disappointed","review":"From the Whites Off Earth Now until just the other day, I've defended the CJs as the finest talents contemporary music has to offer. Truth be told, though, their last two studio albums have been disappointments. \\"Open,\\" however, represents a new low for the band. Every single one of the tracks is, for lack of a better term, over-played. Noisy. Their strong points always have been Margo's vocals and Michael's lyrics. On Open, however, both are drowned out by noxious guitar chords and irrelevant background noise. Sadly, the lyrics do not compensate for the CD's other short-comings. Buy Lay It Down and Trinity Sessions in order to appreciate the band. Open is a crushing disappointment. I waited three years for this? But I'll still go out of my way to see them in concert every chance I get. Everyone's entitled to a bad CD or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff...","review":"I have really enjoyed this latest release. I have always been a casual listener of the Cowboy Junkies, but after listening to a few of the samples I was hooked. Now listening to the album, I am pleasantly surprised. The lyrics are a bit unusual, but they are complimentary to the overall feeling of each song. This newest release is good recommendation for anyone who did not buy a Cowboy Junkies album in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Margo?","review":"I have been a fan of the Junkies' since 'Trinity Session', and I hate to say it, but this is the poorest effort I've heard from them. They seem to have forgotten that the key to the group's success is Margo Timmins breathy vocals, and they've covered them up with long, boring bizzaro intros and strange guitar sounds. Junkie fans, take a pass on this one, and listen to 'Black Eyed Man' a few times instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"CJ flops","review":"I'm a Cowboy Junkies fan. I think the new \\"Open\\" CD is miserable.I heard 'I saw your shoes' live, and the lead-in was incredible; great guitar work. The track on the 'Waltz across America' CD is not as good as live, but I still thought to myself \\"I hope they do more stuff like this.\\"Well, I should have been more careful, because with 'Open' I got what I wanted and it is not good. The first few tracks sound like they were recorded over a partially erased tape with the guys messing around as the underlying layer.As a benchmark, to help you weigh my opinion, my favorite CJ tracks are 'Hold on to me' and 'Blue Guitar' (from 'Lay it down' and 'Miles from our home').I seems extremely unlikely that 'Open' will grow on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"I've been a Cowboy Junkies fan since the 80's. Boy, this one is terrible. There are maybe 2-3 songs listenable on the whole album. Why would you take a voice as haunting, soaring and pretty as Margo Timmin's voice and bury it in the mix and clutter it with incomprehensible arrangements? Mebbe the next one will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a pleased CJ fan :-(","review":"Aften listning to Open for the 3. time, I still don't like this cd. I consider myself a huge CJ fan, but this Cd does not speak to me the way Studio, Lay it down or The Trinity Session did. :-(.If you like to enter the Cowboy Junkies universe, try Studio instead, which is a good place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"No...., sorry","review":"Been a fan ever since I heard Margo sing 'Sun comes up', and thought they were fabulous when they released the 'Black-Eyed'-cd. Still love the tracks of that time... But since then, there have been few high-lights. We've had 'live' and 'B-sides' (an appropriate title). Should have been a 'greatest hits' to finish it all.To me, this new cd really is for 75%just uninspired, unorganised, freakin' noise. I'd rather label it 'Hard-rock'... examples: 'Dragging', 'Did it all', 'Dark hole', get worse each time you hear them.Give us back the quiet and fragile atmosphere of the old Junkies, please. Like on '1000 year prayer' and 'beneath the gate', those 2 are ok. Put those 2 on their forthcoming 'Greatest Hits', and 'Open' can be dumped.Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing release from a great band","review":"I own 8 CJ albums, and this is my LEAST FAVORITE. After Lay it Down and Pale Sun Crescent Moon, the band released Miles from Our Home, which had some very solid and powerful tracks but was a step down from the almost flawless previous albums. Then came \\"Open\\"-all I can say is that the distorted and noisesome guitars and feedback are grating and sonically destroy what is best about the CJs. I listened to this album several times when I got it and occasionally try to put it in again--but it is really just an unpleasant album with no strong melodic content. I do hope the CJs return to their more sparse and haunting sound..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Cowboy Junkies fan","review":"I have been a Cowboy Junkie junkie since my brother gave me The Trinity Sessions. I fell in love with the story songs and Margo's lovely voice. I bought every CD of theirs and bought this one without even hearing it...just because it was Cowboy Junkies. WHAT A SHOCK! Who are these people and why are they calling themselves Cowboy Junkies? Since this CD was released, I haven't bought another. I'm too scared of the extreme change in their style with this one. I used to dream of seeing them in concert. Now I'm afraid I'd get more like the noise on Open. Please, Cowboy Junkies, if you read this: bring back the ballads and wonderful style that made me love your work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete letdown","review":"I've been a CJ fan for several years now. Have enjoyed every CJ CD I've come across. First time I played Open, I thought there was either something wrong with the CD or with my sound system. Unfortunately, I determined CD and sound system were fine. I was so disappointed with this latest CJ effort I sent the CD back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Change isn't always good. Disappointing.","review":"When Miles From Our Home was release I suspected that the CBJs were taking a different directon, and Open confirms my suspicions. I was very disappointed with this recording. This is the last CBJ recording I'll buy without hearing it first. Off to the used CD store with this one... and Miles From Our Home along with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give this CD a couple of listens","review":"Upon first listen I thought as a couple of other reviews. This is terrible... However I persevered and gave the CD another chance. The beauty of this collection is not readily apparent on the first listen. The Junkies will make you work to appreciate Open. The music of this CD is hypnotic. The words and music from this CD will burrow themselves into your brain. Songs like Dragging Hooks, Bread and Wine, and Small Swift Birds are good examples. They seem to me to grow stronger upon each successive listen. This is an inventive collection from a band which defies all labels. Certainly this CD is different from their past works but it is most definitely Cowboy Junkies at the top of their game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the effort","review":"\\"Open\\" can probably be considered one of the 'Junkies' darkest, yet most rewarding cd's. I admit that the cd is best listened to as a whole to fully appreciate the equal parts of lulling and lush sounds. This is the band's heaviest recording to date that displays the band's somber and reflective side as well as their gritty/rocking side. I recommend this album to all Cowboy Junmkie fans, it is a very satisfying listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drowning Margo","review":"Ok. There are a couple of options for the Cowboy Junkies.1: They tone down the band so we can hear Margo.2: They set Margo solo [with the tender lyrics of Michael Timmins in hand].Perhaps I'm too prejudice. I love the early stuff, the slow songs, the songs where we can still hear Margo singing those beautiful, thoughtful and lucid lyrics. But somewhere along the line, perhaps \\"Lay Me Down,\\" the band began to drown Margo."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Letdown","review":"This seems like an expansion of all the weak material on \\"Miles From Our Home\\" - the vocals are inaudible, the guitars are too loud and out of tune, and there's no discernible direction to most of the songs. The first six, and the last couple, sound like the Grateful Dead on a night when they can't find a groove. \\"Small Swift Birds\\" is nice, and \\"I'm so Open\\" is OK, but otherwise there isn't a single song on this that I'd ever want to hear done live. This really makes me wonder whether Michael Timmins is jealous of his sister's success and wanted to smother her contributions with junky space music. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional truth","review":"Don't be misled by old-school junkies fans who think an electric guitar is a sell-out. The first five tracks are the most emotionally true songs I've heard since Neil Young's \\"On the Beach\\", although the remainder are more comfortable for the easy listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, I liked it.","review":"Okay. I'm not going to beat around the bush. I just want to say I liked the cd. I thought the lyrics were crafted carefully and the music matched the lyrics in their meaning. The art direction was very stylish, and I have to admit I looked at the venus fly trap for quite a while after I bought the cd. All around a good cd. The only reason I didn't give it a five was because I thought the music could have been thought out a little more so that the album had more of a polished sound. And in my opinion, I believe an album can still be polished and maintain its raw, rustic talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"i trusted them...","review":"i own and love all cowboy junkie music. i bought their latest release based on this only to be very disappointed. it's a messy record, not worthy of repeat play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the Band, But Open Disappoints.","review":"I'm all for a band spreading their musical wings and exploring new arenas, but I have to say Open is a tough one to love. I'm a huge Junkie fan, and will remain one despite this cd. Michael takes his love of guitar feedback and distortion to another level (depth?) and all it did was to distract me. But all in all, I still rate the Cowboy Junkies as one of the most underrated bands ever. See them in concert and you'll know what I mean!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened to my favorite group???","review":"Suddenly we've got all this instrumental weirdness -- what's up with that? This CD does its best to hide Margo's immense talent. There is not a single track on this CD worthy of Sweet Jane or Misguided Angel, for example. If you haven't heard Cowboy Junkies before, let me suggest that you purchase the Trinity Sessions or one of their older CDs instead. And, Cowboy Junkies, if you're reading this, please go back to your wonderful old sound. You're the best! And Margo, to love the Cowboy Junkies is to love you -- so come back to us as you were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yep, JUNK is an appropriate term!","review":"I'm a hardcore fan of this band, but what a waste. I read the bad reviews, but figured, \\"It can't be THAT bad.\\" Well, yes it can and it is. The mixes are horrible. Gone are the acoustic sounds that have made the band one of my favorites. If you are into a far more electric sound with awful mixes, then you'll probably enjoy this CD. Otherwise, go pop in an old Junkies CD and save your money. I listened ONE time. The CD is going into my rack, or to the used CD store.

I didn't want to go up to bed after seeing this film even all these years later. I also don't wish to view this movie a third time, however I know I probably will. There is nothing like a great mind-fright!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i cringed!","review":"good stuff, i recommend buying the [heck] out of this movie! its not a hack em up movie but it has some graphic depictions of a woman getting raped by some ghost who has the sexual appetite of a convicted felon. this movie freaked me outgood work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"scary one!!!","review":"The entity to me was a good scary movie, not as horrifying as the exorcist, but had a twisted sense of fear in it. Its also a true story, but how much did hollywood exagerate this tale? I think this movie will shock anyone who sees it for the first time"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Paranormal films then give it a whirl","review":"This is a classic for sure, it use to scare the pants off of me when I was a kid. There is not a whole lot of mind blowing special effects or anything like that(keep in mind this was the early 80's) but it had a great story and great suspense!"},{"rating":"2","title":"gloriagirl Don't mess with this","review":"The first time I saw this movie, was about 8years ago..I think.and ever since then, when ever I see it on TV,(and that is not often) I will not see it alone!!, that's how scary it is..I, myself like horror movies..as a matter fact..that's the only genre I do like. But there are movies, that to me can scare you, and I don't care what anyone say's..\\"Oh, come on, it's not that scary\\" It IS!!.The reason it's scary, is because is something that really did happen to this poor woman..it's in books, it's in biography,it's in web-site of true gost stories..One night, I saw in Tv, a show about it, it was in the si-fi chanel, and they were talking about True Gost Story's..this one was in the list..and in the end they said this lady disapear..never to be seen or heard from again. Yep, I for one say, that if you like horror movies, but, after reading all the info. on it, still want to see, I recomend you have a friend, husban, sister, anyone, But not alone..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Entity {REGION 2]","review":"First of all i send the movie back.Because the movie would not play in my region.Whatever that mean. so i did not get change to ses it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could of been an original copyright,if I would have known","review":"I purchase this dvd through VideoUniverse.com and had gotten ripped off for the price I paid for it.They said it was new copy of it and ended being a homemade which sucks that I gotten ripped off.Please do not order this movie through them as Video Universe with Hollywood Block,if you do get this movie!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOOOORING","review":"My friends rented this to watch one night (they always pick the worst movies- every time) and yes, we know rape's not funny, but we couldn't help laughing at most of the movie. Why is it getting 4 1/2 stars? This is bad. The little girls weren't even good enough to act in a bad commercial, the music sounded like some early childhood Trent Reznor project, the actor who played the son was a cheeseball and wore nothing but booty shorts, the psychiatrist guy was a total jerk and really annoyed me, Barbara Hershey overacted, the plot was totally obvious (if it gets too boring and quiet in comes the \\"scary\\" music and you know she's gonna get assaulted in one way or another), not to mention the grody fake body they used when she was getting felt up by the ghost (but when you realize this was 1982, the effect was pretty good). I know it's a true story and all, but jeez."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD SCARE","review":"THIS IS A GOOD SCAREY MOVIE LOTS OF THRILLS AND TO THINK IT IS BASED ON A REAL LIFE STORY MAKES IT EVEN MORE SCAREYER."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Entity is a trip!","review":"I read the book, and watched the movie when it came out. I beleive I like the movie better now than then! It also has a real beauty staring in it!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh My god","review":"I saw this movie years ago. It has stayed with me all these years..I often wonder whatever happened to this poor woman (carlotta)? She is brutally beaten and raped in her own home by something you cant see! That in itself sends shivers up your spine! As her chidlren watch thier mother fall apart, Feeling some of the beating for themselves. The effects were good for the age of the film. The handprints on her skin..The voice in her ear as she is driving..Jesus you have to see this one! The fact that it is loosely based on Culver City Case..is amazing..This one scared me Good."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!!!","review":"THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST SCAREY MOVIES. I LOVE IT. IVE SEEN IT A HUNDRED TIMES, AND I STILL JUMP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous Supernatural Chiller","review":"The Entity is about a ghost that rapes a woman repeatedly. Which is ironic, since after watching it I feel like my time had been raped. There are a few chills and thrills, but there's also a lot of dull stretches where nothing interesting happens. And the plot, supposedly based on a true story, is ridiculous. They should have made a sequel where the ghost turns gay and repeatedly rapes a man. They could have called it \\"The Entity 2: Supernatural Homosexual\\". It would have been more entertaining than The Entity."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Entity","review":"This movie would be really good if you could see the entire thing. The credits come up Full screen, but the movie itself is cut at the top and the bottom so it looks like a ribbon going across the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back Off, Casper!...","review":"Like THE AMITYVILLE HORROR, THE ENTITY is based on a \\"true\\" story. However, unlike AMITYVILLE, this movie is both smart and engaging. Carla Moran (Barbara Hershey from Boxcar Bertha and Falling Down) is haunted, terrorized, and sexually assaulted by three ghosts. Her psychiatrist (played by Ron Silver of Silent Rage fame) tries to convince Carla that it's all in her head. The invisible attackers continue their nightly visits, causing Carla to seek help from a group of parapsychologists (ala Poltergeist). This leads to a final showdown in the local college gymnasium, where Carla confronts her fear once and for all. Hershey is quite believable in her role, as is the skeptical Silver. Frank De Felitta wrote the screenplay, based on his book of the same name. De Felitta also wrote both the book and screenplay for AUDREY ROSE, another good spooker! Enjoy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately a must see!","review":"I've seen a billon scary movies and nothing has scared me more than The Entity. If it's fear you want, this is the movie you should watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Entity","review":"The Entity is a true story about a mother who is raped by a ghost. People try to figure out what is going with her and the film just takes way to long. I love 80's horror movies but this one is boring. When the ghost arrives it sounds like techno music. Don't bother with the blu ray as it contains just the film, not even a measly menu. The dvd has a menu, a trailer, and a documentary over the case. I'd avoid this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Entity","review":"We really enjoyed the movie- more so because it's based on a true story.

Yes, you will find a very good index of trees, shurbs & hedges. Yes, you will see nice pictures for everyone. And yes, you will get some details about each species. But that's about all you'll get. Each specie has 1-2 pages allocated to it. And that includes pictures. So you can imagine how much information there is. It's kinda like a bread book would say \\"in order to make bread mix flour and water and bake in the oven\\".Try the \\"Surpise me!\\" feature from the Amazon Online Reader to check different sections in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase this Cello!!!","review":"I purchased this Cello for my daughter who has been playing Cello for three years in Middle School. First it did not ship on time so we didn't have it for the beginning of school. Second, the Hard Case has been discontinued so it came with a Soft Case. Third, the strings would not stay tight long enough to play it. Fourth, there are no fine tuners to get it in tune if the strings would stay tight. After my daughter and her orchestra instructor couldn't make it work, I took it to a local musical instrument shop who quoted $250.00 to make it playable. The only valid use of this product that I can think of is for a stage prop. Fifth, after returning the Cello (and paying for return shipping), I had to fight with Austin Bazaar for a full refund. They claimed that it was not defective and charged a $50.00 restocking fee. Amazon A-Z Protection was very helpful in resolving the refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality.","review":"I ordered this from Austin Bazaar some odd 6 years ago, it was supposed to come with a hard case but they give me a soft case, the cello was broken and was shipped back and forth 4 times (they made me pay for shipping every time) before I finally give up and took the least broken of the ones they sent me. Even if it wasn't broken it's not a good quality cello. The tuning pegs never stay where they are supposed to and you have to tune every song. The end pin is too long and snapped the sound peg off when they shipped it so now it rattles around in there. The only quality thing about this is the bow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manufacturer Response","review":"Santa Claus brought this gift however during all the excitment the directions were lost. I have been trying ever since to get a response from the manufacturer. (Trying to replace the instructions) I have used their customer service email address - no response. I have been on hold for 2 business days then finally left a message and never heard back from them. I honestly cannot rate the toy as we have not \\"played\\" the game yet for lack of instructions.Very disappointed in the manufacturer especially considering the price.North Carolina"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't touch that Rat!","review":"Mr Gottfried work is an interesting look into the origin and mechanism that spread the horrid y. pestis strain through most of the world during the mid-14th century.
