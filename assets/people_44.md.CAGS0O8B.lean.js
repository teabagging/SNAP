Lisa shows busy moms how to take care of their spirits, bodies, souls, selves, and relationships. After discussing the importance of each area, she gives several specific examples of how to take care of this part of you. For example, under taking care of your soul, she lists some fun things to do with your family--such as pillow fights, a paper airplane distance contest (big hit at my house!), making a house out of cardboard and having a meal in it, playing dodgeball (outside!), buying a cake and having them print \\"Happy Monday\\" on it, taking the kids to breakfast at a fast food restaurant in their pajamas, etc. I liked that she not only discussed general considerations for us as moms and WHY it is so important to take care of ourselves (and that we aren't being selfish in doing so), but she shows us HOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serviceable Ceiling Hook","review":"I wanted a hook to hold a suspended Tiffany style lamp over the center of the dining table on my new screened porch.

He removed the plastic insert, and the wallet is thin and supple, but holds everything he needs: a few cards, license, money. It's made of quality leather, a good rich brown color. The price is definitely right. He has transferred his stuff at last from the ancient wallet of his youth. He's very happy with the new one, so I hope it lasts a long time too.PS This is one of the few leather wallets that doesn't have the designer's name stamped in big letters on the front, a big plus.

I already have a wallet about that size and I wanted a small one due to the fact I have a lot of trouble getting the bigger one out of the back pocket of my work pants.

The only things they got right were it was leather and black... That is all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat, but fast","review":"This book was something that I read in one day, just to pass the time. I really didn't care about the characters, and Lara seemed just too unreal to be true. She was too much of Scarlet O'Hara in her dealings with a real estate world dominated by men. I only finished it to find out what crisis happened that gave her an empty birthday party, but when I finally came to the end, it wasn't too satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading the reviews, I wondered if we had all read the same book. There was very little to like about the main character. She had a very difficult beginning, but the way she went about \\"raising\\" herself above her beginnings was not admirable as far as I was concerned. She began her \\"rise\\" by prostituting herself in order to get her first loan. Later on her business dealings, especially with foreigners, were unscrupulous, i.e. insisting on meeting while they were suffering from jet lag in order to gain an advantage. If you enjoy a book having a bitchy main character who has an affair with a much older married man, then this book is for you. I was very disappointed. Normally I enjoy Sidney Sheldon, but there was very little in this story that I really liked."},{"rating":"1","title":"readable novel","review":"This is a beach book if you don't have anything to read. I am not going to read another Sheldon's book based on this one. The plot is there but the whole novel read like a condensed version. The sentences are basic and bare.

Try Nelson DeMille's or John Sandford's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting, Sexy, Reveling, leaves you hungry for more!!","review":"The Stars really do Shine down on Lara.

It's a lot like \\"Master of the Game\\" because it's also a rags-to-riches tale. However, all the characters are flat and the plot is kind of sleazy. It reads like a made-for-UPN movie. The bottomline is that it's just plain stupid. After this one, I've given up trying to find a Sheldon book I can tolerate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheldon scores again.","review":"Good book.

Well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"We fell in love with the music","review":"Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer's first album, When I Go, is outstanding. Recorded in Tracy's kitchen, the album takes advantage of its humble beginnings. The sound is simple, the lyrics intriguing, and the more I listen, the more interesting they get.Some of my favorite songs this duo does are on this album, including Kate and the Ghost of Lost Love, Lancelot, The River Where She Sleeps, and the title track.That said, every album they do gets richer, making more use of Tracy's voice and both musicians' considerable instrumental talents. When I Go earns every star I gave it, but Tanglewood Tree is better, and Drum Hat Buddha better still. On one of our CD players, we simply put all three in and play them in rotation. Well worth the money.Dave Carter and Tracy Grammer are my favorite musicians yet, and if you haven't heard them, you need to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave and Tracy, the formative years","review":"Their first widely available album, this is one fine work. You need listen no further than the first song to be utterly drawn in (and possibly crying). I cannot say I liked all the songs on this CD. I feel that as they searched for an identity (well established in Tanglewood Tree and Drum Hat Buddha), they tried to sound like other folk artists. The result is somewhat fakey in a couple of the songs (where Dave gets a pretty wheezy southern-ish accent), but that is what 'song blocking' on your CD player is for! However, the good songs on this CD are incredibly good and worth the price to complete the all too small selection of Dave and Tracy recordings out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but not believable","review":"It was an interesting and fascinating read, but I would not take the historical aspect of it very seriously, I doubt women had that much freedom in the Harem. I felt the author was over glorifying the Ottoman Empire, and the part about Venetian life for a woman was rather inaccurate. He made Julia sound as if she was coming out of Calvinist Europe rather than Catholic Southern Europe. Other than that it kept me entertained so I wouldn't totally disregard this book. Its still a good read.I agree with other's comments that the Julia/Abbas characters were unneeded. Julia irritated me because she was such a weak and boring character, Julia's part cutting in every other chapter was just an irritating interruption on Hurrem's part. I felt that Julia's character was just a way to stick a lesbian sex scene in, which, at times took completely away from the point of the whole book.Still a recommended and exciting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Similar story I read durings the 1980s....","review":"Interesting read, but as I read the book, I realized it was the same story, that was published as a paperback (Maybe Harlequin?) romance novel that I read back in 1981 or 1982. Main thing I remembered was that the cover had an elaborate illustration of a redhead dressed as an haremgirl being seduced by an sultan. Back then it was titled something like \\"The Bas_Khan?\\" but the story line focused more on the relationship of the Sultan's parents mainly his mother (who was an Irish girl that was kidnapped), and later her struggle to get free of that world and thwart the Russian vixen's power grabbing plans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed a lot","review":"Shame on you for writing half a book. What would you say about an author who did not find out where his main character was from???Even after it was well know in Eastern Europe complete with ten part mini-series.Hureem Sultan aka Roxolana aka Russlana was from Rohatyn in Western Ukraine. Her father was an orthodox priest and she was taken prisoner while at her wedding and sold into slavery. Now does that help the story?Hurem kept in touch with her mother, sent money back to build a church and kept the Sultan from conquering her beloved Ukriane. Tatar my butt. In 1990 the archives were still under communist rule but this is 2005. Was the author that lazy to rewrite the book? It would have made much more sense.Too bad"},{"rating":"1","title":"soap opera","review":"i dont understand how anyone could have given this book 5 stars. there is hardly any character developement just twists and turns and a plot that makes as much sense as the unjustifiable plot twists in day time soaps. Why does hurrem hate the sultan so much? what motivates her? the intrigue was distracting and didnt make much sense. it was a waste of valuable time. spoiler ahead. the writer doesnt even bother to tell us how imbrahim could have possily slept with hurem. I like intrigue but i didnt want to read a mindless soap opera with one dimensional characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"This is one of the few I've ever been too disgusted to finish. The beginning of the novel gave me the impression that Hurrem was fighting for her freedom; however, I was sorely proved wrong. The minute intrigues of Hurrem was something I suffered to get through. It was just boring! Falconer never explains why Hurrem hates Suleyman so much, nor does he have any redeeming characters. Now I understand that not all books have heroes, but this book makes you want to scream, \\"Why are these people so dumb?!?!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What were the Dirt Devil designers thinking?","review":"All vacuums have an air exhaust somewhere on them. Incredibly, the Dirt Devil designers placed their's right up front just below the headlight, so air blows hard on the floor directly in front of the vacuuum.

Good luck as you try to sneak up on the dirt before its blown away from the vacuum. (Don't even TRY to use this lemon on a tile floor!) No wonder I got this on sale for 60 bucks.

About 3 day's ago, I tried using it and the motor started making a low sound and was not picking up ANYTHING. I have fixed many vacuums over the years, and I took this vacuum apart piece by piece, unclogged it (for about the 30th time since I have owned it) cleaned everything, made sure the belt was fine, and put it back together. It worked like it was brand new!! For 30 seconds. Then started making the noise again and won't pick up anything. It won't even blow dust around now! Don't waste your money.

REAL fishermen like me prefer games that you can actually move around in a boat and try to find the fish. This game is horrible. Just do me a favor and don't buy it.

But here were complex, whole characters involved in real life, the way I recognize it ... except for the desperate moments caused by murder.

The suit had small leakage in the crotch where the zipper was. Other than that, I was completely dry. I figure that I could ride four more hours in heavy rain before it became uncomfortable.

It is starts from the ground up, ignores fancy IDE's and aims at serious programmers. The code examples are solid, and the explanation of the three pillars of object oriented programming was far better than what was in my college programming books. It does have a few downfalls, nothing serious. Firstly, the examples are kind of boring. Who wants to make a file manager? And why is that always the big final project at the end of every VB book?! VB can be much more fun than that. Secondly, the IDE is not explained very well, which is a mixed blessing. I'd prefer more detail on it's nice features, but they are easy enough to figure out for the average developer on his own. The last few chapters are excellent, starting with the ADO.NET elaboration.

While Miller may have some compelling evidence and arguments to present, she has yet to master the basics of the English language. Every other sentence is followed by a sentence fragment (\\"White pushes ahead, the sailors following. Out of their element.\\"), making it difficult to follow her line of thought. The paragraph structure is equally as choppy and distracting.I'm amazed that someone so educated could churn out a product which would receive an \\"F\\" in any high school history or English class and still be taken seriously as a scholar.What was the editor doing throughout the publication process?!?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, a bit sensational and little new ground covered","review":"I have now read five books on this subject and this is my least favorite. If you want to know the facts about this fascinating story almost any other book is better. However, if you are reading more than one or two books on the subject of Roanoke then it's worth the read just for the conspiracy theories. Found the writing style unbearable and almost put this book down several times despite my interest in the subject matter. Read some other book first, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting assertions but not effectively supported.","review":"Miller's theories on the fate of the Roanoke Colony are quite controversial and border on conspiracy theory. In order to give credance to these controversial theories, she had to include a great deal of historical referrences. This created a dichotomy of style straddling narrative and historical treatise. This caused difficulties with both styles. The narrative, while compelling, is often interrupted by the historical references. However, the theories put forward in the narrative depend on ascribing the political motivations of the people involved. That would be a nearly impossible task no matter how much documentation that was presented. Miller augments the documents she sites with layers of supposition and conjecture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat interesting, but flawed","review":"The mystery of the Lost Colony has always been fascinating to me and I am always interested in reading books about it, so I bought this one as soon as it came out. While it is clear that the author has done a great deal of research, her methodology leaves a lot to be desired. I didn't like how she interspersed quotes from primary materials into her text, because it was often impossible to determine what those materials were or who wrote them. Also, I have to wonder if she is taking these quotes out of context and placing them where they fit her arguments best. This approach weakens her arguments. Also, her constant use of incomplete sentences annoyed me and I am surprised her editor let her get away with this. Whereas she makes some interesting observations about the mystery, I suspect that this book will not be taken very seriously by the historical community because of its methodological flaws and its grammatical errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, for a grammar lesson!!","review":"This could have been a first rate book.

The author uses italics within practically every sentence to indicate the inclusion of phrases from primary sources. The phrases add nothing to the story except constant distraction. Primary sources are great, but a real researcher knows how to paraphrase at times.Worse yet, there are big gaps in logic. Ms. Miller draws conclusions that aren't supported by the evidence--at least, she doesn't show the reader how she got from A to B. She fills much of the book asking questions like \\"Who is this person?\\" \\"Why are they here?\\" \\"Why did they disappear?\\" Instead of coming up with any convincing explanations, she just lets the questions hang there, as if the reader is expected to tell her!

Unfortunately, very little in the way of ability is evident here. Sir Harry Oakes was one of the early land merchants of Nassau and a friend and cohort of various British social luminaries of the post-WWII-era, including the Duke and Dutchess of Windsor. What could be a compelling account of his mysterious murder, which has never been solved to satisfaction to this day, is instead a clumsily written attempt at conspiracy grasping and groundless guessing on Marigny's part. The actual writing was no doubt done by Mickey Herskowitz, who has been paid to ghost-write numerous books.

The idea of a child watching their mother being held with a gun to her head and threatened to blow her brains out, not once but twice is totally not permissable. Not even if you are talking about a big doggie and his bad manners! Guns have no place on page illustrations of a child's book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for young children","review":"We checked this book out of the library for our 3-year old son without looking through it first. It had a cute title and a cute cover, plus our son loves dogs. Were we surprised! The story takes a dark twist at the end with the mom held at gun-point by a burglar, who basically threatens to kill them. We found this scary, not to mention inappropriate for a children's picture book. I cannot recommend this book to anyone with young children."},{"rating":"1","title":"SCARIEST BOOK I'VE SEEN FOR PRESCHOOLERS!","review":"Be aware that this book shows the burglar holding a gun to the mother's head as the child watches--if that's not terrifying to a preschooler then I don't know what would be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mom held at gunpoint in a picture book? Scary!","review":"My kids love dogs and stories involving dogs, and the other Pinkerton books are no exception. \\"Pinkerton, Behave!\\", however, features a burglar creeping into Mom's bedroom at night and holding her at gunpoint! Pinkerton coming to the rescue notwithstanding, this is much too frightening for my children. I would argue that such visuals are inappropriate for children of picture-book age, period. The fun and humorous elements of the plot could easily have been acheived without portraying such creepy and violent image, and I am disappointed in the author as well as the publishing house for their choices in creating this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kellogg, Think!","review":"My four-year-old daughter was subjected to this travesty of a children's book in preschool. Ever since, she has awakened nightly at 3 a.m., tears streaming down her face, worried about burglars coming through her window. I'm not \\"squeamish\\" or a \\"namby-pamby\\" as suggested by other condescending reviewers of this book. But I do value my sleep. If you value yours, pass this one up. There are many other good children's books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's my job to worry about robbers, not my 3 year old's.","review":"I was unimpressed with the picture of a gun-toting robber coming into the house. Especially since the mother was essentially helpless while the dog lay sound asleep.Furthermore, it is not my 3 year old's job to worry about robbers sneaking into her house in the middle of the night. That's my job.I probably would have given this book 4 stars if the mother had at least been empowered enough to fight the intruder - with deadly force, if necessary. At least that would make a child feel safe in her home. But to have to depend on a dog that's too stupid to wake up when a bad guy sneaks into the house?! How scary for my 3 year old!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR YOUNG KIDS!","review":"I picked up this book at the library for my 4 and 6 year olds. I usually scan through the books before checking them out, but this one got away from me. I was shocked and then mad, while reading this to my kids, to see a scary man breaking in through a bedroom window with a gun in his hand!! He then threatened the mother and held the gun to her head!!!

I showed it to my husband and I watched his face as he read it, and when he reached the page with the robber a look of horror appeared.We both agreed not to give this as a gift.My son, who is 9, happened to see a commercial for a whole-house alarm and now wonders why we don't have a whole house alarm to protect us from robbers.I don't need to share this book with him or the rest of my kids to further enhance their fears of a bad person entering our home.It was my own fault for allowing my son to watch the TV commercial. But now I know better.This book should suggest what to do, or at least have a side note, or something, letting adults know it contains \\"mature\\" and possibly nightmare inducing content."},{"rating":"1","title":"My five year old daughter thinks someones coming in her window","review":"I think the other reviewers covered it.

I do not recommend this be read to any child. Pinkerton may be cute but that all dissolves into thin air when you are blindsided by a masked burglar breaking into a bedroom window, proceeds to hold a gun very close to a terrified mom's head and says \\"This is a stick up. Don't move, or I'll blast you and your silly hound to chicken powder.\\" Not a bedtime story. I am stunned this topic even crossed an author's mind for a children's book and even more stunned that it made it to a publisher. No matter what wonderful message the author was trying to get across, all a young child is going to remember from that story is how a burglar broke in a window and holds a gun up to a very scared mom's head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful pictures and story","review":"Steven Kellogg books are my favorites to give as gifts. The pictures are marvelous and each time you read the book you see something you had missed before. I love all the Pinkerton books, The Missing Mitten, and the Jimmy's Boa series.

As to the reviewers that are concerned about the gun, I just went and looked at my son again and so far he seems completely normal."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book","review":"Steven Kellogg is my favorite author and illustrator.Any adult or child who loves dogs and humor would enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recognize it for what it is-- a tribute...","review":"Good tribute record, with a VERY different spin on some classic tool songs...

When one thinks of the atrocities perpetrated against Native Indians- land grabbing, reneging on treaties, stealing of livestock and one's ability to make a living, you think of 19th century and prior.

I read this as a single girl in my late twenties, so I identified with the characters in a small way.It's a lovely light read with winning characters. It was one of those books that, when the last page was read, I wanted more and I mourned the loss of the characters in my life. It's a fun read!This book was written for people like me... who wouldn't dream of picking up a romance novel but who have a secret corner of their heart that likes to see happy endings.

He wants Katherine to go out with the guy who's been flirting with her at work, to put her boundries down and go for it AND he wants Tara to dump Thomas, she can do better. The three friends learn from each other and start to conquer their fears so they can live life to it's fullest!This is a great book, Marian Keyes portrays Finton's illness in such an amazing way, as well as the emotional feats Katherine and Tara must deal with to honestly be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"great 2nd book from marian","review":"Please read Watermelon before Last Chance Saloon and Rachel's Holiday or else you might put Last Chance down too soon.

No- Is that my friends-definitetly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much happens","review":"I first picked this book because I am almost 30 years old and single, so I thought that I might be living a similar situation than the characters in this book.Unfortunatly I think that , exept for the last 3 chapters, not much happens in the story.And believe me that 563 pages to read where the story is not moving is bad!I think the most develop character was Katherine,specially at the end of the story.Tara's story was interesting as well, however you get to wonder if she ever found someone or not!Fintan's illness, although touchingly sad, seemed to be just an excuse to trigger an output (as he made some requests to his friends).A personal question to the author: Do you have something against Third World Countries? By the way, Chile where I live, is much more developed ,less poor and more peacefull than Ireland ,for example."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the.....","review":"Ok.... I have read all Marian's books. I thought Rachel's Holiday was absolutely fantastic. A masterpiece, in fact. Movie material, even.... I'm telling you her 3 last books were good ( Rachel's being the best , of course )What I'm trying to say is that The Last Chance Saloon was absolute crap.

However, once I was engaged in the lives of these three friends, it became a blast to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Such fun...","review":"Not normally a chick lit kind of person, but Marian Keyes has a unique way of weaving serious life issues into hilarious situation that is really compelling.This and \\"Rachel's Holiday\\" remain two of my favorite books. My only regret is that I've almost worn out my UK-published versions of both, and the American equivalent just isn't as entertaining, vernacular-wise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I've read all of Marian Keyes' books, and I am sorry to say that I first saw a downhill slide with Angels, and it continued with this book. Full of cliches (as another reviewer noted) and the token gay friend, it seemed like a half-hearted effort. I have Sushi for Beginners yet to read but I am a little apprehensive about it-I'll give it a try, but if it's as bad as Last Chance Saloon and Angels, I'm afraid I will have to give up on Keyes, who used to be one of my favorite modern writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I had heard so much about Marian Keyes and was looking forward to reading my first of her books - The Last Chance Saloon. What a disappointment. Cliched and dull with no emotional depth. I found each character to be a laboured stereotype and the plot dragged on and on and around in circles. Some aspects - such as Tara's obsession with food and the problems with her boyfriend - were repetious. We knew the boyfriend was awful as soon as he was introduced as a character because Ms Keye's told us so. Why did she have to keep telling us - we got it the first time! I know that a book is not doing well when one of the main characters might die and I don't care.However, I'm glad to see that other readers who were equally as disappointed enjoyed Ms Keye's earlier books. Maybe I'll give those a try if I see them. Surely the fuss about her must have some basis................."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"I don't usually go for this sort of book (young singles in London) - I bought it because I just had to have something to read on a trip - but it was really good !

I don't usually read chick lit, and I don't know what made me buy it. Maybe it was the cover, staring at me, but it must have been faith.This is a wonderful book, with characters so witty, funny, sad, whom made me laugh so hard, that I had tears in my eyes (especially Tara's visit to the spa, page 300, that had me howling in laughter to the point where I thought I was going to choke) and Katherine's cold and evil looks she gave men, that made them want to run away crying, Fintan was the character who brought them all together and changed their lives radically.This is a phenomenal read that made me truly sad when it was over. Read it, you'll love it, even if this usually isn't your cup of tea.Cheers,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another \\"FRIENDS\\"","review":"I Loved This Book. It had new and fresh ideas as well as characters that you could relate to. It's like a \\"FRIENDS\\" in London. You feel for these characters as well as develop hopes for them.

You have to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saucy Brit Girls","review":"This is the first novel that I have read by Marian Keyes. I thought it was outstanding! The cast of characters is excellent and the details that Keyes gives brings the whole novel and cast to life. Tara and Katherine are marvelous and anyone can easily identify with their insecurities and their confidences (where they apply). I must say that I am definitely hooked by these Brit girls! They are just charming characters! Though this is my first book by author Marian Keyes, I definitely plan to read more by her. I was very impressed by her writing style and by her ability to bring her characters to life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, suden ending","review":"I loved this book and it was one of those that kept me up all night reading at some points... lots of unexpected turns but it is all very sudenly solved and I was left wanting to read more about what happend to some of the charachters.One thing I don't like about Marian Keyes is she very often spends a whole chapter telling stuff that is not relevant to the story and could just be metioned I find myself rushing, uninterested, throug whole pages because she's going on and on about something she could have just mentioned for quick reference. I still enjoyed this book very much, it is very modern and it reflects very well the reality of women in their 30's now a days!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good read","review":"I think a sure sign of a good book is when you can't stop thinking about the characters after you're done w/ the book.This was the case here. This was a simple story about realization of \\"seizing the day\\". We know we should \\"seize the day\\", but it's so hard to do. And I think Keyes really depicted that struggle.The book was a slow read at first. I actually skipped to the ending after a few chapters and thought that was it for me. But I couldn't put the story out of my mind so I went back and read the whole thing the next day. Sometimes things are a bit slow and I skip passages but I'm glad I finished the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable Tripe","review":"Like so much of Brit chick lit, this book fails to deliver on its promise of being the next Bridget Jones. This novel fails to flesh out the cardboard, stereotypical characters (the fat girl, the ice queen, the gay guy, the womanizer), and sets them into a you'll-see-it-a-mile-away Afterschool Special plot. It's an easy, yet vapid read -- substitute Jessica, Elizabeth, Bruce, etc. for the characters and this book could be a part of the Sweet Valley High series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but it turned out to be full of cliches, and generally pretty boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"This book was fantastic.

Earthy humor, friendships, and on occasion, serious issues, which is why I wouldn't call it a \\"beach read\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keyes' best!","review":"I love this book, and don't think that it is typical chick lit. It is a little deeper than just single girls out trying to get themselves out of debt, lose weight or trap a man. In fact, Katherine hates men, Tara won't leave the one she's got (even though she should) and Fintan loves the one he's with.The characters were well developed, they wittily talk and spar like only best friends can. And they change as people by the end of the book. Fintan becomes sick and calls in favors from Tara and Katherine, \\"challenges\\" he calls them. Ones that will change their lives...for the better.A great book about friendship. Once you have read this one, read Keyes' other books, specifically the three that each deal with one of the four Walsh sisters. Claire in \\"Watermelon\\" is my other favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bright at All!","review":"Having read everyone elses great reviews of this laser, I ordered this pointer from Amazon a while back and ended up being just terrible. This laser isn't very bright at all and is very hard to see because it is so dim. Second of all, the dot that this laser projects is like the size of a pinhole it seems, which adds to it being hard to see.I bought one of those generic key chain lasers you see everywhere for $5 and it outperforms this pointer in every category. The $5 pointer was alot brighter, had a much bigger dot, making it very easy to see during the day or night. I did a comparison test between the two pointers at night outside and I couldn't even really see the dot of the LaserLyte pointer at 100 feet, but the $5 pointer seemed to go hundreds of yards.

Rent this ifyou're interested, but before purchasing, try getting a hold ofthe original. The black and white predecessor to this film isfar superior, and most movie critics agree (check the reviewsites). Why? Because the original respects the imagination ofthe viewer, and achieves an incredible state of tension withoutovert violence and gore.

First off, considering that technically it was a remake of the 1942 movie of the same title, it's much better than the original. I don't think that should do a sequel, unless it was in the format of a prequel (then they could have a younger guy for Malcolm MacDowell's role, cause he's definitely too old to play young now). I would like to know how MacDowell's character came to realize what he was and how he accepted to live the life that he did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat People NOt Purrr-fect","review":"After not seeing the film for many years, I was excited to finally watch this movie on DVD. The movie is plenty erotic and eerie, but very little substance, action, suspense and gore. The best feature I can say about this movie is its musical score and title song.

Quite frankly I was bored to pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie's a bit dated, but still is exotic & haunting","review":"Cat People does a darn good job of combining sexual intensity with dark horror.

The reason I can't recommend this film is because when compared to the original, it is simply a poor, and revolting remake. The original is everything this version is not: subtle, suspenseful, intriguing.In the original, the erotic aspects are hinted at, while the 1982 version lays it on a bit too thick. The main actress, Ms. Kinski does a fine job in this film, and we will probably never see John Heard look as fit and thin as he is here, but the rest of the acting is pretty atrocious.A very poorly made re-make.

I agree with the previous commentator that there are no special features on the DVD which is disappointing. This is the barest DVD I have yet seen, not one extra feature, not even an option for sub-titling. But the image quality and sound quality is good. The film itself isn't an all-time classic per/se, but judged from the viewpoint of the time period when it was filmed, it is very good. A very sensual, stylized thriller filmed like a Duran Duran video. As a fan of that era, I love this film and highly reccomend it to early-80's fans everywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and intriguing","review":"This is the last best role for Malcom McDowell, who is the perfect foil for Nastassja Kinkski in this artfully crafted film.

The plot involves a crashed super-surveillance satellite, and the reader is hooked quickly. The hero, the hard-boiled geologist Philip Mercer, returns from two previous novels along with a cast of humorous yet touching supporting characters and promptly gets himself and his pals into a slew of dangerous situations. The historical background on Eritrea was interesting to me, as I didn't know much about that part of the world.

Once on the job, he travels to Africa, where he is forced to find a legendary diamond mine. Once there, even more danger awaits him and a secret with biblical background, deep in the mines. A secret which neither Philip nor anyone else thought was real. A secret searched throughout centuries with the power of God.

Boy was I blown away. It is exciting and compelling throughout. Now I admit that some of Mercer's escapades are a little fantastic, the book is enjoyable nonetheless. Du Brul's attention to historical and socio-political overtones also adds to the book and helps put the characters and their motivations into context.This book will remind you of Indiana Jones for numerous reasons, but the strength of the supporting cast and their characterization make it better than any movie.A small warning...while not overdone, some portions of this book are graphically violent.

However its execution and therefore the book is ridiculous at best, if not outright damnable.Two of the scenarios, 1866 and 1916, are actually quite interesting and would have deserved better, grammatically correct English would have been a first step. Some are downright silly like Napoleon Bonaparte as third president of the US; others are absolute crap and read like the wet dream of an old Nazi.What hurts is the total disregard for facts. To give one example: Napoleon Bonaparte, born in 1769, could not have been a candidate for president in 1804. For that you have to be 40. And so on, and so on ...So my advice for prospective readers: go for a walk instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest band no one has ever heard of","review":"I bought a used copy of Mortuus Deus on a gamble, and I was very impressed. The album hits you with a combination thrash/black metal, mixing solid grooves with shredding guitars. Ankhelgloknar's songs have a nice epic feel, and the guitar solos are actually quite mind-blowing. The vocalist has a sinister growl/snarling style, sounding playful, melodic and harsh at the same time. The entire album is essentially a hymnal to some sort of god, \\"Ankhelgloknar,\\" who represents the triumph of nothingness. Don't let the nihilistic lyrics fool you, though; I think the songs are mostly self-parody, full of over-the-top lines like, \\"It will crucify your brain!\\" and, \\"char... my... booooooones!\\" But the music is actually very good, and it's a shame Ankhelgloknar only has one album.

If the brain is truly not the organ of thinking, as you claim, Mr. Hacker; then I suppose it shall come as no insult to you that I believe *your* mental processes would suffer no loss even if said organ were removed from your skull.

And i ABSOLUTLY LOVED IT!!! Now i am all about the jam band craze. All of their cds are great to kick back and listen to with some friends, ridin down the road or perfect for listenin to at the beach and just relaxin and havin a great time. \\"I feel home\\", \\"hangover\\", \\"sail away\\", and \\"3am\\" are my favorite songs. ok, bottom line... GREAT BUY! especially for all of the Jam Band lovers out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"frat-boy rock","review":"Great soul-searching tunes for the former frat-boy with his buds in their golf cart.

The presentation and photography was excellent, and the history and background of the various composers was engaging and compelling. I have used these as teaching aides in both my middle school and high school music classes with good results. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classical music and European history all in one!","review":"Folks looking to learn a little European history with a strong emphasis on the composer's lives while enjoying their wonderful classical music will be happy with this video. It is interesting to learn what inspired the great composers to create their music. Many of them socialized together (and sometimes competed with each other). The video brings their lives into perspective and one will learn that the great composers were just ordinary people trying to make a living doing what they knew best. Anyone who has traveled in Europe will be familiar with many of the locations and enjoy it as a bit of a travelog. The theme song created for the video is quite nice, but one gets a bit tired of hearing it multiple times in every episode. I am hoping Part 2 of this series becomes available in the United States sometime soon. Simon Callow is very knowledgeable, articulate, witty and worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classical Destinations DVD","review":"This is helping me to plan a musical tour of Europe. Wonderful to see the landscapes, landmarks, buildings, gardens, etc. alongside the music.

A very pleasant, relaxing viewing experience - and I'd say you are likely to learn something."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!!!!!","review":"I love doomsday conspiracy!! I'm in 8th grade and I couldn't put it down! I read it in a day. sidney sheldon you rock!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a silly little book.","review":"I can't believe this book was a best seller. Even more, I can't believe I read the whole thing. Here's my nitpicking beef with the premise: this secret cabal is intent in permanently silencing the witnesses to the downed \\"weather balloon\\" in an attempt to keep the world from knowing we are not alone and breaking out in global panic. The span of time in the book is about a month. Yet in that time there is no panic, there is no exclusive interview with Diane Sawyer, there's nothing! There's nothing because the witnesses aren't saying anything. A few thought the whole crash was a hoax, another few were too embarrassed to say anything for fear of being ridiculed, and the one or two who did tell someone else what they saw weren't believed. There was really no reason for this Organization to go to all the trouble and expense to kill the witnesses off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper thin plot and no characters to speak of.","review":"With no other choice at hand, I picked this book up at a foreign airport. \\"How bad can it be?\\" I wondered.The answer is bad-- very very bad.The plot is past unbelievable. The characters are cardboard. I am not sure what to even say beyond those two points. By the end, I was only reading with incredulity because I was curious if it could continue to get worse. It could, and did. The ending was rushed and made very little sense.I enjoy a good entertaining thriller as much as the next person. This is not that book. Skip it, unless you are a huge Sidney Sheldon fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard cliches","review":"I cannot believe the cliches in this book. I actually laughed out loud during the short chapter where he introduces the members from different countries. First of all, he has each different person have exactly one line so he can mention them, and the descriptions he gives! The Frenchman was arrogant, the English snobby, the Japanese polite ... ! I will not be bothering with Sheldon again."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOORING","review":"This guy is called for duty at the supper secret National Intelligence Agency, given a mission \`for his eyes only' and the next thing the \`hero' does is disclose it to his former boss.It gets better.

After accomplishing this \`minor' feast, he is released to do some other work elsewhere. Why would they like to keep him training more pilots?Even better: in order to find out who the tourists in a bus during a tour where, they don't just ask the driver for descriptions (and names?) or check credit card receipts: they send one person \`in person' to track them down, because is very urgent.Boring, ridiculous, infantile. A bad selection I did at an airport before catching a flight. I left the book at my seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"This is a fast paced read.

The ending was a bigger let down than the time I wasted reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doomsday literally","review":"While Sidney's book is easy to read, this book was just one kind of chase scene after another. I read when I exercise and kept thinking this book would get better. It never did. Please don't waste your time with this book. However, I want to read some of his other books as he writes fairly well. It was just the plot in this one was predictably boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Mr.Sheldon plese dont venture in unknown places...","review":"The other side of midnight etc was the area sheldon scored, however I dont know how he got the idea of venturing to write on such storyline which was foolishly conceived, but writing was not bad. I think that best is to avoid reaing this book or even writing longer reviews and should be forgotten like it is not there , only message is:1. Mr.Sheldon pleae next time dont do this mistake of writing on such topic, leave it to Baldacchi etc2. As a reader I will never open the sheldon book if it not a love stroy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! A real disappointment","review":"This was the first Sidney Sheldon book that I have read and I'm very hesitant to try reading another of his books after reading this. The UFO elements are entirely too hokey and he made little attempt to be creative with it (he gets a few points for them being made of vegetation). The locating of the witnesses quickly becomes dull because Commander Bellamy is always chasing thin leads that pan out and then the witnesses are systematically eliminated. I found myself thinking, 'get on with it.' Then Bellamy becomes the hunted and everyone he runs into betrays him. Things stay predictable through much of this book. Give me Jack Higgins or Dick Francis anyday over this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I am (or should I say \\"was\\"?)a huge fan of Sydney Sheldon, so I was maybe expecting too much. This book is nothing like other his books. From the beginning, you can tell what will happen next and it was almost a torture to finish reading it. (I made it since I was in the airplane and had nothing better to do.) Especially, if you're into X-file, you will laugh at this shallow, stereotyped, boring story."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT WORK!","review":"The Doomsday Conspiracy wasn't just about government and politics, it was about a man caught in a conspiracy and the life that he had to lead. It was a wonderful spell binding book that I couldn't put down. Sidney did once again, and I'm sure there's plenty more where that came from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheldon's best book","review":"I've read a lot of books and this is certainly the best. It looks like it just came out from an X-Files episode. The only thing wrong with the book is the end, which is too fantastic. But anyway it's highly recomended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doomsday Conspiracy was doomed from the start","review":"It seems as though Sheldon, took a leave of absence and let someone else write the novel. It was not like anything else he wrote. Never before or after has he written about aliens, so why start now? Not only was it unbelievable but it was confusing too. I almost didn't finish reading it, but I stuck it through to the end, with hopes that it might get better. Sadly, I was mistaken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his best efforts by far!","review":"I found this book very hard to not only follow, but tu enjoy. I found it difficult to continue to read this book, because their are too many other books that are far better. I did finish it, but was not impressed or was enjoyed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"The Doomsday Conspiracy is definitely a page turner. It follows a military officer who is commissioned to find witnesses to a balloon crash. He identifies each witness, one by one. Sheldon lets on fairly early a general idea of what will happen, and builds a great deal of suspense when you know the main character is barking up the wrong tree. It is a suspense-packed novel that keeps you wondering what will be on the last page - although when I got to that last page, I had to laugh at the silly and agenda-packed ending. Overall though, the book is superb, and definitely worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghastly attempt at SF","review":"This book is proof that writers unfamiliar with the SF genre should not attempt to write in it. The Doomsday Conspiracy is filled with dated Pulp Sci-Fi cliches that would have any SF author since the 1920's laughed out of print. Clumsy uses of literary \\"technique\\" and a ridiculously presented ecological \\"Message\\" make this book one to avoid even for those unfamiliar with Science Fiction. If SF is what you want try Greg Bear or Vernor Vinge instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work by Sidney Sheldon","review":"This is the first book I've read by Sidney Sheldon. It's also the first book that I've read in less than two days. From the first page on I couldn't put it down. I found it very interesting with only a few pages getting a little strange with a small science fiction twist that I thought was a little corny. I thought the ending was excellent. I hope to read more by Sheldon and hope that they are as good as this one. Without hesitation, I'd recommend this book. It's worth the price and the time to read it. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I still talk about it","review":"I never never read Science Fiction! When I read this book 4 years ago, I found that from the first page, I could not put it down. It may be fiction, but it still made we wonder about our government and all the things that are hidden. I really liked this book and I recommend it. It is different from the usual soap opera love stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding","review":"I bought it, so I read it. Every agonizing page. Filled with cliches, stereotypes, unimaginative characters, ridiculous plot twists, 6th grade level writing and a totally unbelievable premise. Are all these reviewers, who are giving this book four or five stars related to Sheldon, or are they simply middle school students having to read a book for the first time? Be warned, if you buy this book for anything other than to start a fire, you'll be incredibly disappointed. I gave it one star, because it was the lowest score available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"I can't say anything about the frequency with which this product is bought and doesn't work. However, I have had my Finishing Touch for almost a year, and I am happy with it. I am now getting to the point where I turn it on and it takes a while, with my fiddling around with it, for it to turn on (it might be the battery). But as far as hair, it seems like it can handle most anything, even a lot of hair. I have used it on several parts of my body to remove hair from my face and eyebrows, to my arms and legs, to more delicate parts. Most everywhere, it will remove all the hair you need removed. However, the hair does grow back quicker than with anything else out there you could use. Also, I have a hard time pulling it apart to change the battery. On the other hand, it's quick, it's cheap, it doesn't smell bad like Nair, it doesn't leave cuts like a razor and it doesn't hurt like waxing.

Not only is the speed more than impressive, but the blades are put together in a way that it is not easy to get cut, nicked, or injured in anyway.

The Hoover Sidewinder rocks! It picks up pet hair better than my upright vacuum. It's lightweight, reasonably quiet, and I love the easy-to-clean dust cup. The swivel head is great for cleaning tight corners and upholstery. This vac is SO much better than the (supposedly) comparable Dirt Devil that I owned before it, and it's $10 cheaper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My second one of these hand vacuums","review":"My 30 year old Hoover died, found this updated replacement.Swivel head is very nice.

From the packaging (both Black and White) to the music itself, the band seems to have a perfect concept of subtlety. Which isn't to say \\"Plaster Hounds\\" isn't at times quite abrasive. Songs like \\"Monarch\\" sport their fair share of feedback and dissonance, so this certainly isn't your ambient Eno school of minimalism. The band has evolved into a much darker sound this time out, and has branched into the utilization of drum machines on a few songs. Though there are precendents for this sound, I think it's quite fair to say the Chromatics sound unique amongst their peers (other GSL bands like The Locust and Year Future are certainly mining different territory). So far, this is my favorite record of this year, and I'd readily recommend it to anyone who appreciates the non-dancey side of Postpunk."},{"rating":"2","title":"bath pillow","review":"Love this bath pillow.

Sitting in an Italian Cafe in downtown London and what I thought was a familiar voice coming from the cafe's speaker turned out to be Zucchero, not Peter Gabriel as I thought. I immediately had to ask the waitress who the artist was. The CD starts out with an amazing duet between John Lee Hooker and Zuccharo - \\"I Lay Down\\", you can really feel the emotion in this song. \\"Muoio per te\\" sung with Sting (Mad About You) is brilliant. A must buy, a little of something for everyone on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zucchero is Superbo!","review":"Great album of contemporary Rock & Roll Italian style with collboration of musical icons ala' American Style.

And even then, it worked maybe 20% of the time. Most of the time I actually had to -touch- the remote to the wireless receiver to make it work, which of course defeats the purpose of having a wireless.I'm happy other reviewers here had an easy time with it; but man I wish I could get my money back on this one.Flickr has a small user discussion on this wireless as well. Search for \\"d200 wireless shutter release\\". Some got it to work, and most had trouble getting the plug to connect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to the D200 accessory","review":"I purchased this remote for my D200 and found it to work very nicely for what I needed it for, mainley self portrait photography in a studio setting. I've released the shutter from up to 20 feet away and it works. There is a lag sometimes and the receiver won't activate without the antenna in the up position on the sending unit. It works best when its unobstructed.Also the receiver 10 pin connector could be improved by adding a Locating (White) Dot to match the White Dot on the D200 10 pin socket, as is you have to be carefull to match the connector slots before pluging in the receiver into the D200.Otherwise I do recommend this remote if you need hands off photography with the D200 and don't want to point with an inferred or be attached with a wire to your camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Reliable Experience","review":"This item failed to trigger on critical family pictures on several occasions.

Ok, I put the magic wand (antenna) very close to the receiver, click, fired, click fired. I move the wand away, nothing, moved back, fired!

The game-play, the graphics etc. The makers of Wildlife Park were just trying to rip off people who like Zoo Tycoon. They copied all of their ideas - including the dinosaurs and the marine animals!

The ball has \\"traditional\\" white stripes versus the black stripe across the middle. The striping, however, is not the issue. The bad thing about this ball is that it is much slicker than the composite ball with the black stripe (currently being used in my league in NY). The black stripe ball is very very tacky. This ball is slick vs tacky. I recommend you purchase from somewhere that has the black stripe ball."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase","review":"It looks like this years model was produced by a different manufacture.

Unfortunately, it didn't live up to those reviews. Within 2 minutes my dog had split the two halves and within 3 he had a good sized hole in the felt covering. My dog is a power chewer and maybe this would be good for a dog that doesn't chew as much - but if you have a power chewer on your hands don't bother with this ball. The few minutes of fun wasn't worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I bought two of these for my granddog because it said they were so \\"indestructable.

Only problem with that is he makes very short order of them. Within 1 hour of chewing, the ball usually gives up, resulting in two halves held together by a thread and my doberman looking for the next one. I figured he would love this ball. He totally did! Why wouldnt he love a ball that is twice the size of a normal tennis ball, is designed specifically for chewing, does not get confiscated by it's owner, and lasts about 15 minutes before it's demolished?While my dobie is psyched about this, i am not. I payed 6 bucks for a ball that my dog demolished in a quarter of the time it usually takes to destroy a wilson brand ball.

Holly is always good to her toys, Kira on the other hand.. always ruins everything we give her. This only lasted about two days before she split it in half.

James Stewart was apparently a great actor and did a hell of a job making me laugh.

I recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Old Classic","review":"You know this show is remarkable. It is slow, eccentric, and sometimes downright goofy, but due to the strong acting of Jimmy Stewart and others it somehow holds your interest. One thing is sure. It is memorable. I think I only saw part of it once before probably 25 years ago on a station that showed a lot of old movies, but I never forgot it and always wanted to see it again, this time in its entirety. I finally decided to find it on Amazon and purchase it. It was only then that I found out it was based on a successful and long running Broadway play and that James Stewart often starred in those presentations. I would like to give it 5 stars on uniqueness alone, but I don't think it is something I would watch again and again like \\"It's a Wonderul Life.\\" Still don't let that dissuade you from watching it. It's worth seeing even if you watch it only once or twice in a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody should have a Harvey experience","review":"As a child when I would hear an unexplained noise in our house my mother would say it was Harvey. Not knowing any better, I thought that it was her way of easing my discomfort and it worked. It wasn't until I became an adult that I realized she was referring to the movie, and when I finally saw Harvey I adored it. As a lover of classic movies, I believe this is one of James Stewart's finest roles. It's zany, but so much fun. He makes his invisible rabbit so believable and his supporting cast is fabulous.

Amazon used to take better care of it's customers and it's products. Lately, apparently, they use 3rd party companies to do their shipping and what results is flimsy packaging and broken products. I ordered a DVD and, whereas even a year ago, this item would have come in a small cardboard box, insulating my DVD from damage, a few weeks ago I received it in a thin, plastic covering (which is bad for the environment, as well, but it - supposedly - cuts costs for the company). Well, I argue the \\"cutting costs\\". I ended up returning the DVD because the box had gotten broken in the shipping process. So, where's the savings for them? They lost a sale. It was a hassle for them, and I KNOW it was a hassle for me. So, I will no longer be buying DVDs or CDs from Amazon until this problem gets remedied. By the way, the actual movie is excellent.

It's a great combination and we used it on a 10hr drive to the beach. It was a heavy downpour and yet the inside of the bag was perfectly dry.I absolutely recommend this bag over the one sold at Harbor Freight. Much better quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Cargo Bag","review":"We bought this bag to be used on a hitch cargo tray. This bag carried four carry-on suitcases plus still had additional space left! We drove through rain and snow. Everything kept dry and secure. In very cold weather (5-20 degrees)the bag gets rather stiff making the zipper difficult to close, but still worked. I am glad I bought this bag!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rainproof/Expandable","review":"Returned from a trip to Disney. It seriously rained the whole drive down and not a single drop of rain entered. Definitely waterproof. It also is expandable which I did not realize. I was worried about the capacity but was able to expand it. It fit a large suitcase, 3 medium suitcases, and a small one. It fit more loose bags also. I believe it is worth the money. I paid less for this Rola cargo bag than I did for a waterproof backpack. The Rola is an awesome product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bag","review":"I don't like how it opens .but it seam still to small for what I need also.great water proof. One of ties broke when hooking to bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cargo Bag!","review":"We traveled 1,800 miles over 8 days from SC to KY to IN to OH and back to SC with this cargo bag full on our small hitch tray. the cargo bag did a perfect job of keeping our items inside safe from water when it rained. We are very pleased with this product; it can hold A LOT of stuff! We were able to fill it up and still open our back door of our SUV; it was not in the way at all. We highly recommend this cargo bag, especially for long trips where extra cargo space is needed and your only choice is outside of your vehicle. I don't think we noticed a significant change in our gas mileage either (whereas a cargo bag on top of your vehicle could affect your gas mileage)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great heavy duty cargo bag","review":"Used this bag for a trip to Florida recently. The bag held two large strollers and some other stuff. One stroller was a double. We encountered heavy rain but the bag was perfectly dry. The straps never loosened at all, they are tough and don't appear that they would ever rip from the bag. Don't hesitate to buy this bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"This thing is great","review":"We used this during our Christmas trip for carrying home toys, etc from out of town. It is well constructed and heavy duty. The expansion section is great too for items that are a little too tall. It is also nice to have the 6 tie-down straps attached rather than requiring separate ones. The only downside I see is that it is pretty stiff, but that is due to the heavy duty material that it is made out of. It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. The roads were wet on our drive home, but the contents of our bag were bone dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, inexpensive bag.","review":"This thing did the trip on our rainy trip, kept everything nice and safe n' dry. The straps attach with little effort. The material does not appear the same as those in the photos (which imply some sort of canvas construction), an it does seem to be a little thin, but hopefully will hold up. Zipper is easy to operate. All in all, a worthwhile purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item not as pictured","review":"Same as another reviewer, we also got a bag that was made out of a heavy vinyl / plastic like material. It was not the same material as pictured. I am confident that it will be waterproof but I am concerend about the flexibility of the material in the winter. The zippers are very cheap and after only zipping it up once, one of the teeth broke off and we did not even have anything in it. The bag will not fold up very well because of the stiffness of the vinyl. We had wanted to keep in the the back of our van in the storage compartment until needed but it just won't fold up small enough to fit. Overall the bag is OK but I feel I did not actually get what I thought I had ordered. I will replace it with something else when it wears out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best 50 bucks I have spent in a long time","review":"Love it....don't hesitate in buying this...I got the new black one and love it.

This bag kept sleeping bags, camp chairs, etc. dry and secure. It's expandability assures that you have more space when needed. If I was a heavy user of these things a heavy duty bag may be needed but for an occassional user it is well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops","review":"I did not like this book as much as I expected to. I admit to having been *really* looking forward to reading it. But I ended up not caring much for what I read.It's hard to say specifically why I disliked it. It may be that (like \\"The Vagina Monologues\\"), this material works much better in performance. But I think it alse had to do with the odd confluence of academic writing with prose that was clearly intended to be something else entirely. I kept wanting to think that these dissonances I was experiencing were intentional and that they had some kind of meaning. But in the end, I couldn't find one.Another issue I had was that the book seemed really deeply rooted in heterosexuality. Which is fine, except that it seemed like the author was trying to be more universal.Finally, I lost interest. This is one of the few books I have failed to finish reading. And I don't expect to return to it later. In fact, I have already given it away to someone else who said she wanted it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No answers here ..............","review":"This book is a perfect example of why psychoanalysis is a doomed profession. A therapist with deep feelings of weakness and vulnerability writes a book about how to be strong and powerful. Every psychoanalyst who has ever practiced has unresolved feelings which pollute the therapy she provides. And even writing a book like this still leaves her unhealed.The subtitle is \\"The Achievement Of Authentic Power\\". My question : what is inauthentic power? The title, like the text, is nonsense, well-intentioned nonsense I'm sure, but nonsense all the same.I bought the book as a cheap remainder, to see how someone could spend 400 pages talking about something that doesn't exist. It's well written, but unreadable because it's so derivative and pointless. The only way to feel strong is to feel deeply buried early life feelings of powerlessness. End of story. Book not necessary. More trees still standing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disaspointed- NOT Dishwasher Safe!","review":"I have been looking everywhere for heavy-weight flatware with black handles.

The flatware very heavy and seems to be well made. Now comes the big disappointment: After the first two washings in the dishwasher, the finish on the handles started to unevenly peel off. The manufacturer advertises this set is dishwasher safe & there was no mention of any sort of protective coating. I have a top of the line Maytag dishwasher & only use Cascade soap.

The Author gives us a community study at par with Streetwise, Getting Paid, and Street Corner Society. Through this book, black neighborhood are transformed into multi-dimensional communities, rich with institutions and networks. Truely a balanced view, which goes beyond books like the Truely Disadvantaged (although both deal with the same community). Most importantly, the author reminds us of the link between structural factors and race. The content of the book should not be overlooked, and the conclusions regarding the need to maintain race-based affirmative action, even for middle class blacks, should influence every policymaker in the country."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO CD INCLUDED","review":"From London, EnglandI ordered the book which arrived without the accompanying CD.

This \\"book\\" is less than 40 pages. On each page, a single \\"mystery\\" is printed. (Most of us would call it a \\"riddle\\" based on a double meaning of a word or phrase). Answers are provided in the back of the book. Example: \\"Although she was not an unusually large woman, people were always surprised at Livia weighed. What was it?\\"Answer: \\"Anchors\\" (i.e. Livia worked in a harbor and weighed anchors).The author tries to dress up the book by providing a process of \\"critical questioning\\" for \\"solving the mystery\\".Save your money, especially you homeschoolers and teachers. Instead, go to your local library and check out a book of riddles and jokes. You'll get the same benefit by reading that with your children. After all, the point of riddles is getting you to consider something carefully and look at it in a different way, or what this book would call \\"critical thinking skills\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I wish I hadn't bought this -- it is a waste of time as far as teaching any kind of critical thinking -- not nearly as useful as the Mindbenders series -- or any monthly $4.95 issue of PennyPress Logic Problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn and laugh the deductive way","review":"What a fun and family friendly way of making your brain grow.

A few years ago a college buddy of mine had a copy of a similar book with a similar title, and unlike the book under review, it was funny as hell!

Jade Snow wanted independence from these traditions, so she went to collage. There, she learned how to live her own life.I liked this novel because it taught you many different things. For example, it taught you many different Chinese traditions and how hard it was growing up being a girl in a traditional Chinese house and that is also why it makes this novel unique and remarkable. My overall impression of this book would be good and I recommend this book to others, but mostly girls because it is about a girl's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Greatest, but Somewhat Enjoyable","review":"This novel was overall ok but it didn't really do it for me.

I did like it when she was growing up but once it got to college, it just kept getting more and more boring to me. I did not like how the book didn't really have anything very exciting happening that made me want to read more. I have read many novels and this is definitely not one of my favorites.

I had a lot of fun reading it and finished it in two days!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST RED DRESS INK SO FAR!","review":"I'm reading them in order of publication, and I liked this one the best so far. I could relate to Sarah, having played doormat in my life. It was good to see her working out of her \\"Oh, what can I do to please you, I'll do anything\\" phase early on in the book. And her new friends Martika and Tyler were a hoot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure trash, and not in a good way","review":"This book is by far the worst I have read in a long time. The story is completely unbelievable and there is not a single character worth rooting for. Sarah goes from a goody-two shoes (who was so saccharine-sweet my teeth hurt - she's given her boyfriend Benjamin the nickname \\"Jam.\\" Ewww!) to this ultra-[mean woman] who uses men for sex, thanks to the advice of her new \\"friend,\\" the dominatrix Martika. And speaking of Martika, whose story this book is as much as Sarah's, my reaction to the ending was, \\"you have got to be kidding me!\\" Overall, this book was a huge disappointment from Page 1 to the end. In my opinion, it doesn't even deserve one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I was suprised this book was published. It's pretty poorly written and the story is trite. I finished it just to see if it would get any worse, and it didn't disappoint, the ending was... huh? I've lived in both LA and San Francisco, and I've rarely met women as shallow and one-dimensional as the protagonist. The only redeeming character is the ...friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Characters","review":"I can't believe this book was published! The characters were terrible. The book was so boring that I forced myself to finish it, and when I was done I threw it across the room! Sarah changed her colors so many times during the book, it was hard to imagine what she looked like. Martika was utterly disgusting, although the way it was written, you'd think she was \\"supposed\\" to be a sex goddess of some sort!? And those \\"boots\\" she always wore that the author kept referring to? I can't imagine they EVER were in style. Not cool characters AT ALL. If you must buy this book, buy it used. Otherwise, you're wasting your money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my thing","review":"A chore to read. The characters were boring, and I didn't get the feel of the exciting L.A. life like the title and blurb suggested. I think I'll re-read my old Judy Blume books, they were even more exciting than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Don't buy","review":"Don't buy this game! It has the worst graphics you have ever seen! You shoot a line at another line, and that is the object of the game.

With thier powerful lyrics, punchy drums and bass guitar combined with guitar solos it's the way RocknRoll should be. This is by far the most listened to CD in my collection right now and should be on the top of your list of CD's to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree - own your own!","review":"This is a great book.

The drawers open smoothly and should be able to hold all of the files. The cabinet was delivered within 4 days of ordering by Ensenda, which is very fast because it was delivered 2 days before the estimated delivery date period even started! I am very happy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good as it looks.","review":"I spent almost $500 on this product and I was very dis-opointedat the quality even it suppose to be good brand .The top drawer doesn't lock and you have to push hard tokeep it close to the close position.I honestly dont advisebuying this product its not good as it looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay. Just \\"okay.\\"","review":"It's good for what we needed in our office, however, there are 2 draws that don't fit properly and tilt downward, making it difficult to hold the draws open while also filing papers into them. It does have a lot of room though. We did not contact HON or Amazon about the tilting drawers, too much hassle to do so. I've purchased many things from Amazon.com and personally, I think they are getting somewhat sloppy on their vendor quality requirements. This is the 3rd item we bought this year that has not been correct. Prior to this year, we NEVER had a problem with anything we bought at Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"This seller and product was a joke as it CAME FROM THE SELLER DAMAGED!","review":"Length:: 0:41 MinsHere is a damaged file cabinet that looks like someone ran into it with a fork lift and it was shipped to me to deal with.

The book was not in inventory and the order had been cancelled, I was informed. I placed the order on Sept. 2nd and e-mailed to find out today (Sept. 19th). I was never contacted about the order being cancelled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Reading--Excellent Results","review":"The text of this book is difficult to work through. It is not designed for the light reader or the quick student. Taking twice as long to read this book was a drain, but the payoff was excellent.He does not simply give facts, but works to tie them together into a specific working hypothesis, which is yet to be proven. Yet he has asked the correct questions and cannot be faulted in not having all the answers.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"American music history","review":"Rather than being a fan of Nelson Eddy I approached this cd from the point of view music history and found it to be the best one-cd collection of Stephen Foster's music available. Eddy does a good straight-forward job of singing the songs and I kept listening to the album while reading Ken Emerson's excellent book, \\"Doo-dah: Stephen Foster and the Rise of American Popular Culture.\\" The cd and book are a great combination and introduction to a fascinating period of American culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"what? no song list","review":"Much as I like Nelson Eddy, without the label doing us the courtesy of listing the songs, I can't spend my hard-earned loot on the CD. I've heard a few of the songs he did with a Southern drawl, and they were jarring, to say the least, to hear that great voice used in that manner. i have to guess this CD is more of the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful Songs - No Remastering","review":"These are classic songs, however the recordings are NOT remastered. For all the early Bee Gees songs that have been carefully remastered in a two CD set (63 songs) with a booklet of copius liner notes, purchase \\"Brilliant From Birth\\" here at Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Chance To Waste Your Money!","review":"Like the CD \\"Claustrophobia\\", this is another attempt to cash in on the early Australian years of the Bee Gees. Don't Bother. The fantastic collection \\"Birth Of Brilliance-1963-1966\\" contains 32 tracks and is a collectors item. Once you have this, you can ignore all these 'copy-cat' recordings. Besides, the cover is false. Band members Vince Melouney and Colin Petersen were never in the Bee Gees until 1967. Nice cover though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Linux beginners.","review":"If you wanna give Linux a try, starting with Corel Linux (which comes w/ the book) is not bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"FALSE ADVERTISEMENT","review":"The seller (Interstate Batteries) sent me a Battery instead of a phone. Even if you need the battery, you can find it way cheaper at ebay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I was hoping this was EZ but it turned out to be impossible. I am our companies computer systems manager and I've loaded hundreds of software/hardware packages. I cannot get the terminal to respond to the software and I've tried all the faq's from the companies website on two different computer. I tried to register online, and that faulted out, and forced me into a snail mail registation. You have to download the help files (they are not on the CD) and they failed to load when I search a topic. Based on some of the software out there, I'd rate this one as low as it gets. Even if it ever does work, I wouldn't pay more the $250 for a credit card swipper and $20 software package"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else","review":"Out of the box, the software did not work. After wasting many hours, I called support, and had to download new software as the software on the CD would not work.After using the software for most of the year, it finally quit working completely, losing all the time clock it had stored. The database connection was \\"lost\\" and could not be recovered.It is very, very amateurish software. You even have to manually change the time period each payroll. No event logging.I've worked in I.T. for 26 years, and have written many programs and installed hundreds of other software programs. This software is as bad as some of the worst DOS programs from back in the 80's. Simply disgraceful coding by some hack programmers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and overwritten","review":"The plot is threadbare, the characters are two-dimensional, and the prose is so overwritten that it eclipses the book's tenuous literary merits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book because of all the praise it recieved. Perhaps my standards were too high coming into it, but I found this book to be tedious and completely unentertaining. So many pages could have been removed that added nothing to the story. I found the main characters personal life to be stereotypical and the story around the old man's biography was a chore to get through. My recommendation would be to avoid this book, as I felt it was a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strangely disturbing and comforting at the same time.","review":"I really liked the evolution of this book. The author takes his time developing the main characters, Will and Charles, although Charles' development is in the form of journals written throughout his life and given to Will to read. The book got better as it progressed and by the end it became very interesting. The lives of Will and Charles are linked in a way that is quite original and not very obvious (I didn't see it coming). One of the themes of the book deals with casual promiscuity in a gay culture of the past, which can at times be disturbing. However, by the end of the book another subtle theme reveals itself, and that is that everyone has a story, and everyone's story is interesting even if it is not told or written down in a journal. I don't know, I guess I just really liked how all the stories were somehow linked together in this book. I recommend it and I'll read some more from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry....","review":"While ones look for fresh creativity across different musical genres, reggae music is often overlooked or is expected to be the same old thing;nothing really new or spectacular. Unfortunately, this is the same feeling I walk away with after hearing this album. The keen listener will norice from the start that the lyrical content contains alot of \\"reggae keywords\\" but not much substance. His voice too, I must say, becomes downright aggravating after a short while.Certainly, when placed next to the masters of the genre, Johnny Dread's impact becomes little next of nothing. A serious fan of roots reggae might as well stick to real roots from Jamaica instead of re-hashed made in the USA wannabe stuff like this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this because I thought it was a version of Lilac Time. It is not. It is an unconvincing story with very little to commend it musically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly engineered","review":"I have a number of Rachel Ray stuff but the last two purchases were disappointing. The handle on this skillet is long and heavy making it tip over unless there is something in the skillet.

Not a great solution but at least it will sit flat now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rachael Ray 8-inch Skillet","review":"This is a great skillet, I have used it more than any other skillet I have in my collection. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Far from being the promised \\"pee your pants laugh fest\\", Teen Angst is an utterly generic - and bland - collection. Although one of two of the poems evoked a grin, for the most part, these are thoroughly unremarkable, and a far cry from being \\"so bad they're good\\". I found the blurbs leading into each of the entries much more interesting than the actual poems, establishing the context in which each was written, but still felt as though something was missing. Great idea, but strangely unfunny."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Not-So-Funny Attempt","review":"I was actually looking forward to getting Teen Angst in the mail, but after reading through it, I was disappointed. I found only a few poems to be even remotely funny: 4 exactly. The rest were just really bad poems. The introductions to the poems were often humorous, but the individual poems consist of hardly any humor. I felt as though I was grading an 8th grade English class' poetry assignments. Of course, that's what some of these poems are...Certainly NOT the pee-in-your-pants laughing I was promised."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap but what you pay for","review":"Pros:InexpensiveCons:Uncomfortable - narrow, top of heel back cuts into back of ankle, itchy zipper seam, doesn't stay 'up and smooth' on calf, looks a bit too 'club' to wear anywhere other than a Saturday night"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these boots!","review":"Not only are these boots adorable, but they are also surprisingly comfortable! The fit is fantastic. I have long thin legs and most boots fit me loose in the calf. These were perfect. As a previous reviewer said, they do lack tractions, but scuffing the bottoms up on some pavement seemed to help. Exceptional pair of boots for the price.

It is virtualy impossible to navigate the CD and the choices are so few it is of little use. I expected something that would be easy to follow either on the CD itself or on the instructions on how to run the CD, both were of no help in fact the instructions consisted of 4 peices of paper that basicly covers how to install the Disc itself. This to me was a waste of fifty bucks! I recomend that if you are intrested in purchesing this CD-Rom you should think twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"very effective text","review":"I took two years of high school Spanish, then went over 6 years with no Spanish lessons or use and I found this book very useful. Since this book uses a different style of teaching Spanish, it is necessary for the instructor who is teaching the class to use and follow the \\"Natural Approach.\\" When coupled with a good instructor and the workbook/audio tape portion, this text was a very effective learning tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange organization","review":"I am currently using this text in a Spanish class. I find this book's organization to be nonintuitive.

I ordered this as a gift for someone who had seen a copy in a cabin and loved it. Buyer beware. To me, sellers should note a book in written. A little shelf wear is to be expected but very good condition or the like shouldn't be written in in bold blue pen in my opinion. Guess I should have asked. The book itself is a delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"for a friend","review":"I bought this book while on vacation for a long time friend. This friend was like a brother to me.

While there are obvious standouts (Metrodub's urban flavored opener and the awesome hyper Central track Hard Hit), whole whole album seems to be working together, letting the audience get a taste from every region. And for the most part, it tastes good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great backscratcher, as long as it lasts...","review":"First, let me say I agree with other reviewers that this is by far the best of all the backscratchers I have purchased. I bought mine about a year ago. About three months ago, the wooden endpiece fell off. I finally gave it to a carpenter friend of mine to do a professional repair job. He told me that the real problem was that a long split had appeared in the wood of the handle, under the rubber grip, and that it could not be repaired. So, I called Earththerapeutics. Even though the product was clearly defective, their customer rep refused to replace it, saying this was because I had purchased it a year ago. Since this is an item that should last a lifetime, I found this response to be unsatisfactory. The moral of this story is: buyer, beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unhappy with the product and the customer service","review":"My son ordered this Back Scratcher with few other EarthTherapeutics items via Amazon as my Christmas gift. The scratcher is supposed to have five distinctive fingers to scratch. Unfortunately, three of them were sticking together.

Would not buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It cannot be described","review":"You have not lived until you have tried this back scratcher. I am not exaggerating. I never had any use for back scratchers (it seems kind of geeky, doesn't it?), I got it for my husband so he wouldn't rub his back along the corners of the walls (disgusting, I know). Once I tried this back scratcher--I was hooked! This is an extremely high quality product which cannot be improved upon (wood with ergonomic handle), the rolls royce of back scratchers!--pay the extra dollar and experience bliss.

The reason for having this tape is the singing of Richard Tauber, not quite at his best performing in English, but, nevertheless, one of the greatest tenors of the century. His screen character is given an Italian name -- not credible for a moment because his voice and accent are obviously Germanic. But I don't care about that; I just want to see and hear him. Unfortunately, the manufacturer of this cassette chose to issue it in extended play format, at great cost to picture quality (reduced tape longevity can also be expected at this playback speed). It's difficult to understand why anyone would be so cheap. If they needed to save on tape, they should have excerpted the musical selections and cut out the rest of the movie, since Tauber's singing is the only worthwhile thing in it anyway. This cassette is worth just about what it costs -- under $5. (This review applies to the Madacy issue.

That makes the writing easy to read. And because the messages are from famous people, the book has a lot of authority. Those people have obviously gotten over their shyness enough to become famous!Or NOT gotten over their shyness. The book is inspiring because you realize that 1) shyness can be overcome, and/or 2) you can succeed even in highly public fields and remain shy.This is not the magic bullet that will tell you all you need to know about overcoming shyness, but it will inspire and motivate you. So if you are on the path to overcome your own shyness, this book is a welcome companion.

I now whole-heartedly believe david did not act alone. I also feel rather foolish that I was so easily deluded, and I want to laugh when people tell me he thought dogs were devils. now, next time someone tells me that i'll be sure to recommend your book.one of the greatest reads.(the author, maury terry, did an outstanding job!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best German World War II Memoir","review":"A well written and translated war memoir. Especially interesting are the author's analyses of both German and Allied strategy and tactics, as well as his description of the prominent players on the German side, particularly Hitler.

Written by one of the Third Reich's most brilliant military strategists. The book is not an apologia for Nazi Germany but a hard look into reasons why and how Germany lost the war in spite of winning so many early battles. Manstein relates conversations with Hitler who he maintains, he and most of Germany's generals, disagreed with and even, at times, considered replacing. I also liked that it was not laden with minute descriptions of battles and troop movements. There is some of that but only when it is useful in explaining larger tactical and strategic considerations. It also provides insights into mistakes made by Polish and French military planners. Basically, they made military plans based on the assumption that European assurances would be honored. He states Hitler's strength was his conviction that Europe was unwilling to fight another war and would make excuses to not come to the aid of its allies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comment on a line in Dave Hart-Maxwell's review","review":"He says \\"Manstein was required to consider facets of war (unity of command, morale, logistics) that few other commanders have had to contend with\\".Sorry, Dave, but this is completely absurd.

How can someone say it is good? That he was a master general ? THis book is another one of those books written by German generals and field marshalls that, since Hitler was dead, took full advantage of the fact to place the blame of all bloody bath caused by the German armed forces (and their posterior defeat) into Hitler's shoulder, why everything good (victories, etc) was their responsibility. In reading this book, it becomes clear how German generals succumbed to Hitler and did and they could to give victory to the mad man, and after the war they said that they could not have anything different, that their \\"oath'\\" prevented them to get Hitler ouf of power. Come on!!! Do you think we are so naive?!!!! The general received bribbery all the war long, it is a proved fact.

Chapter 11, which weighs in at 50 pages out of 900, is on EJBs and the various O/R mapping and persistence objects. The back end coverage then continues on with chapters on messaging, XML processing, and web services.This is not an all-in-one book. The coverage, with perhaps the exception of the front end, is not thorough enough to replace a full book on any one of these topics.

Since no body was ever found (just some blood spatters in their garage), he didn't expect to be found guilty, nor did his defense team who kept giving him reassurance that he wouldn't.His motivation in proving his innocence was his little boy, Landon. There are all kinds of adventures in the story, as he managed to escape prison. It was hard to put down, because I just kept wondering what was going to happen next.

Didn't even notice it was there and found myself checking to make sure I still had my camera! It fits the camera perfectly. The extra pouch and strap are also nice extras, although I didn't use them. Definitely a great product to go with the camera and better than some generic brand that basically fits rather than something that's actually sized right to the camera. You'll be happy you bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony soft carrying bag","review":"I purchased two of these bags, both my girl friend and another friend of hers who we gave the other bag to are extremly satisfied.

I'd picked this book up after several years to finish it off, I'd started with The Ninja back when I was a teenager, and I feel like I've grown up with the hero of the book, Nicholas Linnear. I was told there's now 5 books in the series. I just hope the rest aren't like White Ninja. Though a wonderful writing style, I found the book lacked imagination. Some of the scenes became so unrealistic, put there to inject a sense of drama and climax, but looking out of place. The climax to the book by the way was awful. What a complete disappointment. It slowly builds, then nothing. Nicholas does his usual three fingered gut thrust and monkey blow, but no twists, nothing that makes you think wow, that was a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and too boring.","review":"This was pathetic.

Cinema is good for action and image, but surely has his limits. I don't know the original book of Mishima, but all these is evident. The movie show us, not one, but two stories and truly there's no much cohesion between the two: the children's gang and his chief -a little Hitler-, and the history of the widow and the sailor. These two tales doesn't attain to make a full unity, but remains as two different histories without no much relation though full of pretentions and false steticism. Probably at his time -1976- this movie was very daring owing the nudes of Sarah Miles, but this is another tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evil","review":"Regardless of the packaging and the nice photography,this is an evil film, loaded with neurotic, paranoid, antisocial content.There is no clear evidence that its immoral portrayals were even intended to act as a valid \\"cautionary tale.\\"The film can do no one any good. The filmmakers should be severely chastised. This film encourages only negative things, and presents a twisted worldview with which to persuade audiences to share the filmmakers' own negative, neurotic, and paranoid views.This film tries very hard to lower the moral standards of all who see it. The best way for an audience to respond is by rejecting the product, and avoiding or ignoring it altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling","review":"Anne Osborne (Sarah Miles) is a young widow living in a picturesque seaside village in England. Her troubled son has fallen in with a bad crowd; he belongs to a secret society run by a bully who has his own very definite ideas about the proper order of things. When Anne decides to marry a merchant sailor (Kris Kristofferson), her son takes the news quite badly and turns to his pals for help.This movie was quite controversial in 1976, and with it's graphic sexuality and shocking cruelty, it still is. Miles is well-cast as the needy widow but sometimes overdoes the cow-eyed trances and histrionics. Kristofferson looks the part of a rugged seaman and the two have great chemistry. The creepy boys club provides some truly cringe-worthy moments as innocent young boys commit unspeakable acts, and this movie is not for the squeamish (especially animal-lovers).Lovely Devon locations contrast nicely with the increasing tension and overall feeling of doom. An interesting and haunting movie for adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last time I saw at theater - it was too hot for it's time!!!","review":"Ok - so I was in my late puberty years and Sarah Miles was the hottest thing on my mind - (BECAUSE OF THIS MOVIE) - I cannot forget this flick!

The media posted alleged reports of Kris Kristofferson's marital breakup as a partial result of the filming of this with Sarah Miles - later. There was a photo spread in at least one magazine - later. I am going to buy this one just to see if it gets me as moved as it did in the mid 70's! There must be some reason this flick has stayed in my mind all these many years, besides sexy Sarah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love story not for the timid","review":"The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With the Sea is an erotic love story gradually transformed into gothic horror. It brings together a lonely widow, a jaded sailor and a group of boys straight out of The Lord of the Flies.Scenes of graphic nudity and lovemaking along with an intense scene involving the boys and a cat make this a movie best suited for adults.The scenery and photography provide a beautiful background for a very disturbing tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"a old but great movie","review":"I have seen this movie many times over the years and enjoyed it each time.

They should not promise what they do not deliver.The link they give to get the download does not work. When you finally laboriously find your way to the download site you find that it's almost 100Mb, which takes a lot of time and money from London,England.

While the lack of demo product on the CD might be considered a problem, you can easily download the database and the WebDB (current versions!) from technet.oracle.com; this should present no big problem for anyone.The book provides a good step-by-step approach and takes newbies through all the steps to create a functional demo system.The authors should not and can not be held against the wall because Oracle has so quickly released new, improved versions (book talk to 2.0 and 2.2 is the current version). I find the comments from the few negative reviews to be baseless.This is still the best and only book that provides the needed information that the Oracle documentation does not address."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but not the BEST","review":"This book is good information source on the working of WebDB.

However, a side-by-side comparison with the14k Yellow Gold Akoya Cultured Pearl 6.5-7mm Necklace and Stud Earring Setshowed that the Akoya set had pearls that were all round or near-round, very well matched, and were not noticeably smaller than this necklace.

All it consists of are a few photos of Amy (no 'live' footage whatsoever) with a cheesy voice over droning on about irrelevant things to fill up the time. This is NOT a documentary by any stretch of the imagination. There is no film of Amy, no video excerpts, no concert footage, no interviews with anyone - nothing.

But at least I got a good chance to discover David Murray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad Really...","review":"I really don't know where to start on how bad this book is. It feels slapped together, by both writer and artist. If I ever see Doug Moench's name on another Batman book I won't walk, run, I'll flee from it. Moench has made a mockery of everything that Batman is supposed to be. There is no Bruce Wayne, and the Batman is nothing more than a Robin who's lost his feathers. The art, though stunning on the cover, is mismatched throughout the book. Some panels are painted, while others are penciled and colored differently. In one instance, a Hong Kong cop informs his police commissioner a white limo has arrived--and it's black! There's also the typical overreaction of clothes, people, and basically everything we come to expect from Asian artists in this genre.

Sim and RPG(role/playing game) lovers will love this title while younger children and favorers of action/shooting games should stay away from this game.....very far away. The game is more suitable for Gameboy Color owners, since those with regular GB would not be getting the most favorable experience with the game.

First things first this game I wouldn't reccomend for littler children because it can be frusterating when you make mistakes that can't be fixed. I liked how you could keep playing after two years but you can't pick up a bride or have a baby in this game which was one of the fondest memories I have of the SNES game and you can't explore the moutains either because they were taken out. You can however still breed cows and chickens but not as much. Another good point of this game is that it is game link compatible which allows you to trade seeds and livestock with friends. This is a great buy for someone who is not easily frusterated but you may want to opt for the new N64 version(I have not played this yet) or the SNES one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem - Solution","review":"I find this book to be totally unsatisfactory at providing an understanding of ADO.NET. Rather than attempting to teach the reader the basics, the author provides a series of problems with possible solutions. Additionally, what information the author does provide to the reader is given in sequential order, bouncing around from fact to fact in a way that would make it extremely difficult to retain the information. It's a bit like trying to read a dictionary one word after the other and expecting that the readers memories are nothing less than perfect. The examples provided do provide readers with a reasonable solution; but, unless you want to thumb through the series of problems and solutions, this book just won't cut it. If you're after a real understanding of ADO.NET, look elseware. If you're after an example based understanding (one that can only get you as far as the examples took you), this might be the book you're looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless fluff","review":"Utterly transparent plot and a 5th grade reading level make up That Camden Summer.

It was only intended to perform quick trims in the office when I didn't have time to shave at home and to handle stray mustache and beard hairs during long workdays. Two weeks later it was relegated to my junk drawer. Not only is it seriously underpowered, it falls apart easily and sucks the life out of batteries.

He answers questions that you may feel too stupid to ask your friends local guitar shop, since we all know that sales persons in the local guitar shop specialize in that. There are several basic lessons that work you up to a simple metal song, and you can go back to those lessons and work on them later, which is great. Yes, this is very basic, but a solid program.

Though it isn't in the category of a sim racing game (my fav) it is still addictive enough to warrant purchasing it.The only drawbacks in the game are the walls, no matter how many upgrades are put onto a car the wall still manages to make winning races impossible.Anyone who likes sim racing titles may not care for this game so much, since many of the opponents cut you off or brake so you ram them giving them a speed boost. In any event this game is fun, and it will keep you busy for many hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrible game physics, but you can't stop playing","review":"When Genki set about making this game, they must have spent all of their time on incredible streaming graphics (60 frames per second!) and not a bit of time on realistic driving. The car has far too much drift, and even somebody who has never gone 150 miles per hour will still be able to tell that the handling's incredibly flawed. Not to mention the fact that hitting a wall head-first at top speed results only in bouncing backwards, the car unscathed. Still, the graphics are superb, and though they didn't actually name the cars for legal reasons, they are still real-life cars, and are statistically accurate.

Next, in rapid succession, have come \\"The Ultimate\\" and now \\"The Essential\\", replicating many tracks. Some of Tony's best albums have yet to be released in their entirety. What about \\"When Lights are Low,\\" named by biographer Will Friedwald as one of the best jazz vocal albums ever recorded, and \\"My Heart Sings?\\" I did manage to find on EBay a Japanese version of \\"Tony Sings for Two,\\" a duet with Sharon.

Now I'll need to order it from amazon because this has also been disappearing from my grocery store. I cannot understand everyone's fascination with the chemicals that go into 'butter flavor' microwave popcorn! This has just oil and salt, and I've found that pouring it into a large bowl reduces the saltiness that others have mentioned here. Keeping it in the bag to eat from seems to keep that salty flavor more concentrated. But I don't think it's really that salty anyway. Obviously this is quite the matter of taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good popcorn!","review":"I like this popcorn. I was looking for something without added butter/dairy or a lot of chemicals. The label says popcorn, palm oil, salt, and mixed tocopherols. It reminds me of popcorn prepared the old-fashioned way with just oil and salt, which does leave residual oil on your fingers. (I am glad to see that palm oil is making a comeback.) It is a bit saltier than what I would prefer but certainly not as salty as other brands I have tried. Of course, the amount of sodium is given on the box for those who need to know the exact milligrams they would be eating. In my opinion, they could put just half of the sodium in this, and it would be just right. Overall, it is tasty popcorn with few and simple ingredients."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Popcorn","review":"I just LOVE this Popcorn. It's the only one I can find with NO BUTTER.

The pieces of popcorn are more oily than normal and a little saltier, but I have a low daily salt intake, so that could be the reason as well. I also boughtOrville Redenbacher's Smart Pop! 94% fat free butter microwave popcorn, 40 2.9-oz. bags 114 oz Boxat Costco and prefer it over the natural oil & salt, just because it is less oily and with the butter flavoring it is surprisingly less salty.

This is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great popcorn","review":"This is great popcorn. I do not know why that in this day and age, most stores stopped carrying or do not carry natural popcorn. They have 90 different kinds of buttered. How different can it all be?

I know that there are plain microwave popcorns out there, but this is not the one if you want a healthy snack, which is seemingly how it is marketed.On the plus side, it tastes pretty good.

It contains one definitive interpretation and several others that are worth having; on this disc, they can be had readily and cheaply. The definitive performance is Ofra Harnoy's 'Kol Nidrei', which I think has not been bettered by anyone and has only been equaled by Casals. The rarities include Steven Isserlis in Bargiel's lovely, unknown 'Adagio' and music of Elgar and Delius by Janos Starker. You also get major portions of the Dvorak and Schumann concertos in outstanding performances by Gregor Piatigorsky and Isserlis. Many people will also be delighted by Yo-Yo Ma in Tchaikovsky's Rococo Variations; it's not my favorite, but it certainly gives pleasure. All of this disparate music in one place for the price of a few dollars (including shipping) is a bargain beyond compare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw Soul","review":"This is one of the greatest live revue albums I've ever heard. Plus it gives the rest of the world, a chance to hear the raw soul St. Louisans have been privy to for years.It's not the smoothest, most polished live album, but from Tina's opening \\"Hello everybody\\", trying to get the attention of the audience to the last pounding beats of the band as the show ends, I was virtually transported to the Harlem Club, in St. Louis.Not only do you hear Tina at her funkiest, winning over the distracted audience, but they remaim captivated by an array of unknown, local talent that could stand up to any big named revue.Pay Special attention to Vernon Guy, Stacey Johnson, and Vanetta Fields. They gave me goose pimples with their gut-wrenching vocal masterpieces. And of course the tight, throbbing, and terrific, Kings of Rhythmn, tie it all together.The only reason I gave it 4 stars, instead of 5, is because it's not smooth and perfect, from begining to end.

Cost of repair information is excellent, but lack of frequency of repair information limits the value of said information. Way too much copy-and-pasting, and therefore not enough new information on each year and model. Also, enough editing mistakes and self-contradictions to call the whole enterprise into question. Two examples : Performance data in the article contradicts performance data in the data tables in more than one place. The parts list for the 1996 model has a great big label \\"Parts List for 1975 911s.\\" Jarring.The annual ratings are only somewhat useful, as they compare that year's Porsche with other contemporary cars, rather than comparing 911s of different years to one another.

It does serve in an introductory capacity for point shooting, however lacks the detail and diversity of methods employed by a multitude of ancillary police handgun courses.

This describes Lost in America. The title track is an American Classic -- simple, but sweeping with great vocals, guitar and drums. The rest of the CD rises to the occasion with Rhapsody in Blue an instant hit and Midnight Ghost a song that, finally, on your 20th listen you swear its the best thing you've ever heard. You should try this CD. It's more than worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome stuff...","review":"Lost in America is a CD that proves that there are great bands out there making great cds...that hardly anyone ever hears.Great songwriting, great music, powerful vocals, awesome lyrics (as opposed to just \\"words\\").

As other reviewers have pointed out, an organ is featured here - not always a feature for chant. This is done in the back, typically to establish a base tone for the vocalists, which rises and falls with the voices. It does become a \\"drone\\" of sorts and, indeed, is hypnotic and captivating. It is not bothersome nor grating in the least and, in fact, I find that it only adds to the overall beauty and increases the ability to fall into that state of worship, praise and adoration of Him.This is a stunning, two-disc collection.

I am CEO of my company so I think I might have some insight into what it takes.While some of the points were right on (like doing work on a plane or not having a drink with the gang), some of the points were silly and wouldn't project well on a would-be CEO. For example, take any job that is handed down by the boss. Well maybe, but Fox says to take ANY job even of it's watering the plants. Perhaps a better rule should be to find someone to water the plants, not to actually water them yourself as Mr. Fox suggests.All in all the book was too short and too expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wisdom, easy read, straight to the point","review":"I read this book in about 2 hours, almost in one sitting. The author writes brief conveys his message in brief, concise statements which sends the message across. The book is a collection of attributes that one must have to rise to the top of an organization. It briefly mentions each point and tells you a reason why you have to do so.A couple of key points surprised me, like the \\"Skip all office parties\\" rule and the \\"Eat in your hotel room\\" one.

This book is easy to read(can be browsed in an 2 hour or so) but does not have any substance. For example, it gives 'valuable' advices like 'Please, Be Polite with Everyone' and 'Be a credit maker, not a credit taker' etc. Most of the advices the author gives are what your mother taught you. The cover says 'National Bestseller' which is a mystery to me. But again, the author may be right in a sense, that we need to stick to the basics to 'Rise to the Top'."},{"rating":"1","title":"the writer has never been a CEO!!","review":"This book is complete nonsense. The author (apart from being a self employed CEO) has never been higher than a marketing director for a company, and it shows! His advice is pure opinion with no examples or case studies. This book is lazy and should be called ' how to play office politics'. No wonder he has no company CEO's to endorse this book, just a bunch of his friends to nod along. Its lazy and probably written over a few drinks one night at his countryclub.For example, in one chapter you are given a reading list of books to buy. Recommending we read the bible, C.S. Lewis and anything by authors.... REALLY! REALLY! We have purchased this rambling nonsense so that he in return can tell us to read other books, two beginning the most widely read books on the planet...

There are some hints of what not to do that I thought were very insightful, primarily because most employees of a company do the very things he says not to do. I do not know how far you are really going to get to being CEO w/o a high level of education and experience and political savvy, but this book tends to be more of a \\"attitude\\" and \\"methods\\" adjustment handbook in my opinion. However, it is definitly one for the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with, for US business culture only!","review":"This book has no application to the world econmony or job market. As the prior reviewer mentione the topics on social behavior are at best puritanical.

There is some decent generic advice however but not enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like his other books...","review":"This reads and looks just like his other books. I wouldn't classify this as rules for the CEO as much as they are rules for being a leader in business.

It is such an easy read, you can do just that ... read it over dinner (you may not want to do this if your spouse is eating with you). The berevity of the book is one of its key strengths.It's like a \\"101 Ways\\" sort of guide, with many small, short, and to the point chapters. The tips provided are more lifestyle changes than things to do. My favourite is to use the two most powerful words, \\"I need\\". This works so good!I quickly realized that most of the advice in the book can be applied to almost anything in life, not just moving up the corporate ladder.

The book focuses on creating work habits and work culture avoidance.

Clearly, Stokowski had a special understanding of the unique dynamics of this piece and the orchestra and singers felt every note from their synapses inward to their bones. I have listened to nothing else for days; this new (old) performance has opened my ears to what I thought I already knew about Orff's best known work and deserves to be in every serious classical music listener's collection.And two extra perks: 1.)Loeffer's \\"Pagan Dance\\" alone is worth the price of the CD because 2.)the CD is released at a price that's just so darned economical!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony camera case for T33..","review":"This \\"leather\\" case is a bad joke, shame on Sony.

I still like the product for the $60 I paid for it. Didn't want one of those circus looking models which are smaller and more cheaply built.This unit will fit 6 bun length dogs. It will technically cook the dogs in 8 minutes (after warm up) but I like mine more well done so I cook them for 15 to 20 minutes depending on the diameter of the hot dog.Mine also came with the power light broken (this is why the 4 star rating instead of 5) but I'll probably fix that myself after the warranty runs out. I think I can tell when the unit is on.I don't understand what others expect for $60. If you want a tank of a product then you should go spend 15 times more for a commercial unit.I like the product, its only 200 watts and I don't think you will find a better hot dog roller for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot Dog Cold Dog","review":"I was really excited to get my hot dog cooker only to find out when I plugged it in that it didn't work properly.

Basically, this book seems to say that there is absolutely nothing that can't be completely healed by Reiki, including cancer and problems with animals!The writer's state that the effects of Down's Syndrome, which they call Mongoloidsm, can be healed with Reiki! The mere fact that they refer to Down's Syndrome as Mongoloidism is offenseive. This book was written in 1985 and by then that term wasn't used anymore.Then there's the constant use of he, him, his, and mankind to refer to all humans male and female.There is some valuable information in this book, but not a lot.

This concept relieves us from the pressure we put on ourselves and others. When I think in terms of the trait system I seem to take my ego out of the picture, become less burdened and more effective.

I was sorely disappointed. The SpinSweep jams almost immediately, requiring you to bend over to hand clean it.

I ordered one after seeing it mentioned in the gardening section of the paper, but was skeptical that it would really work as advertised. I have a large stable with a very wide concrete aisle that must be swept daily, so it gets some serious use. It works soooo good! The brushes pick up debris and dust and even the dead lizards the barn cats bring in. It is easy to push and easy to empty the container, so that you can dispose of the material where you want, without having to use the dustpan. It has cut my sweeping time down by 75% and does a better job than a broom.My friends that have tried it have all loved it, and are going to order one too. Hoover needs to market this thing to horse owners!I have also used it on my garage and patio with the same great results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover Outdoor Sweeper","review":"This product does exactly what it says it will do.

I find it cleans up the biggest messes with ease. You really have to put a big pile in front of it for it not to do the job. I bought it to use in the garage because I hate dust flying around when I sweep. This product solved that problem and more. I find myself taking it outside which was never my intent. I edged my sidewalks with a shovel and used this product to clean up the mess. It handled it with ease, even the dirt and clumps of grass. It did clog up when I had swept the clumps into a pile, but I don't know of anything that could have cleaned up that mess. I just spread it out with my foot and my spinsweet did the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for gravel","review":"I was excited by other reviews and was looking forward to getting my L1400 to keep on top of the gravel in our garage and in my shop building that comes in on vehicle tires.

Unfortunately, it doesn't have the suction to pick up much else. Cat litter? Forget it. I have to clean the filter out several times whenever I use it because of the pet hair from two cats. I like that it lays almost flat to reach under furniture, but if it leave larger particles, grass, food, etc behind, it doesn't matter that it can reach. Because of the way the head attaches to the body, it won't stand up on its own, making storage problematic.

The vacuum is awkward and doesn't stand up on it's own, which can be over looked if it would effectively clean. The area on the head of the vacuum that sucks up dirt is so small that you have to go over and over with just that 2 in segment to get anything off the carpet.

My old Eureka WideTrak SuperLite had been faithfully picking up golden retriever hair and dry spills for years without fail. It was lightweight. Strong. Easy to clean. Held lots of dirt. Bagless. But it died when the handle broke off.I bought this Hoover Flair to replace it. At first I thought that we put it together wrong. Why would the handle be so heavy and the bottom piece so light. That doesn't make any sense. Also, the air coming out of the vacuum is so incredibly hot, it's like a hair dryer blowing on your legs.We took it apart and put it back together again, both times precisely according to the instructions. Performance did not improve. Because the handle is so heavy, it turn this way and that way without you wanting it to. I thought maybe I could get used to it. Not the case.

I like the length of the cord, how easy it is to clean, and how well it cleans!My only complaint, and it is kind of an annoying one is they didn't designed it so you couldn't rest it against the wall or counters, so you have to lay it on the ground while you're not using it.

We live on the beach year round and the little vac gets quite a workout all summer. We use it dailyfor sand etc. There are minor issues ie the belt and the filter could be more robust, but for $40 you can't go wrong.Note: we have area rugs on hardwood.

It will not suck up a grain of rice (long-grain, white, uncooked), unless one pulls the head off and uses the tube end (which is quite easy to do, and one can do edges that way too). That being said, it does a fair job with the smaller stuff, and the dust cup (or dog hair cup in my case) is amazingly full when one finishes. The cord is long enough for my purposes, and the aforementioned dust cup is handy - beats buying bags, though I imagine the filter at its top will need to be replaced at some point. I wonder if there's a stick vac that actually has good suction . . .Addendum May 2012: We got rid of this thing, since we found we never used it, since it didn't really work very well.

For $40, I thought it would be \\"acceptable\\", but it's actually quite good! Strong suction, looks good, is sturdy, cleaned up my apt nicely in no time with no hassle, and quietly too. Sucked up dog food, little stones from a fallen bamboo plant, a bobby pin (oops), and all the styrofoam that broke off when I unpacked it. The cord is super long for a little upright, and the filter was messy to clean but very efficient.One star off b/c the plastic attachments are definitely brittle and breakable, but I figure I will just have to be a little careful.

I have only had it for 24 hours and used it once, so these are just my first impressions.BUYER BEWARE: You have to hang this thing up for storage. There's really no other way to stow it in a closet. The head does not sit flat on the floor when you hold the body straight up, like a traditional vaccum. It is at about a 45 degree angle to the body.

Drat.","review":"Loved this vac, as long as it lasted. Slightly under one year. Tonight, happily swiveling round a corner, the housing broke as described in many posts below. So since I bought it last winter, did I get an old one or the new improved unbreakable one?Can I really repair it with duct tape, or is that just a preventive move? Cause I don't have enough money to get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stand up","review":"This item seemed great until I had to stop to pick something up, and quickly realized that the vacuum doesn't stand up on its own.

Very inconvenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good quality Hoover","review":"I purchased this in 9/09, and now it has been 8 months later and the vacuum sometimes does not start and the plastic cover is very difficult to put on and off to remove the dirt cup. The clip gets stuck and it takes a lot of patience to play around with it to remove. Also one of the front wheels keeps falling off. When this was working properly, it was only good on bare floors, definitely not for carpets! I would not recommend this vacuum.

All I can say is thank goodness I bought it from Amazon because I returned it to them and they refunded my purchase immediately!"},{"rating":"1","title":"quick broom","review":"I bought this vacuum from Amazon about a year ago because I have hardwood floors and rugs. It didn't have a rotary brush that sucked up the rugs. About six months ago the swivel head came off and ever since falls off just about every time I vacuum. Also the filter clogs up every time you vacuum. It's hard to get all the dust and dog hair off the material. I have to pick at it and bang it against the fence outside. You do have to wash it regularly. It picks up fairly good, but the swivel head is a real problem after it fell off the first time. I'm about ready to throw it away and get another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware!","review":"I had great hopes for this little, lightweight vacuum. As of today, I'm having to throw it away. The head broke off and finally can no longer be taped on, making it nonfunctional. The filter also ripped within the first month of owning it, partly because I banged the filter against a tree producing a small rip. The vacuum then sucked improperly with a $25 tag to fix it. Be gentle with bagless filters, no banging against rough surfaces! Considering how the head of this vacuum is supposed to swivel, a nice feature, it puts stress on the head joint and failed on me. I just ordered a Dirt Devil with a more substantial head to stick joint to replace this vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great until the head falls off.","review":"We have two of these vacs and they are fantastic until the cleaning head falls off. The first one came off and we had it replaced by Hover. Now the second unit has the same problem but it is no longer under warranty.When the head separates there is no way to fix it because the plastic that was holding it together has worn away. It is definitely a design flaw that will happen to all of them until they change the design.Now I have to find one that works as well as this one did, but won't fall apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does great job!","review":"I have 4 boys, 2 big dogs and 2 cats= lots of crumbs and hair.

I've even used it on the carpet. I am happy I spent a little more for this vacuum because it seems well built and meant to last. It is a bit heavier than others I've used and it gets hot during use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good deal for the price","review":"The stick vacuum is light and perfect for bare floors, which is what I got it for.It gets under most furniture easily and has great suction.Only minor issue is the vacuum head comes off at times, but over all it works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and easy cleanup","review":"I love the Hoober electric broom...... or stick cleaner as they call it.

I am still loving it! It gets the Cheerios, small pieces of crafts, stray Legos as well as the dustbunnies. Even glitter! I would recommend this to anyone with noncarpeted floors (tile, hardwood, linol). I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it stinks on rugs and carpet. So I still have to lug the old vacuum out for the throw rugs. But I mostly use it for my kitchen tile and hardwoods. The filter is easy to clean, too. Very light, can use on stairs, too. I am buying one for my Mom today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick Repair becoming a pain","review":"I\\"m running into a problem where the swivel collar & head assembly keeps coming apart.

I looked up some stuff about it, and started saving my money. It was the best purchase I ever made. It's so much fun. I've owned the game for a year now, playing very often, and just now am finding out all the secrets to the game.You can plant all types of crops, the festivals are fun, and you have to help a girl home when she breaks her ankle. What I like is, that opposed to Harvest Moon: Back to Nature, is that the girls especially will say random things so it's not the same day after day after day. For example, when Maria was at a Yellow heart, she was very concerned about herself and not being able to say \\"No.\\" She asked me if she should try to change, and she only asked me this once.

Also the wooing element.I had to look that one up in the dictionary.Also a 5 year old would get stressed out at it.I recomend it for ages 10-199.The idea of the game is to get a good rating when your father comes by at the end of the third Spring.Be nice to everyone.Even me and Gray are friends on the game now.Aside farm working there are 5 Beutiful (My favorites Karen)Young ladies to Woo.After you get more money and wood, you'll want to buy attachments to your house.After you buy all the attachments youll have one big party.The five young girls are Karen,Eli,Maria,Popuri,and Ann.Over all i give it a I love the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"I wasted 3 good twenty dollar bills on this game.

This game is fun, very addictive, and is much more than just a farming sim. Unfortunately, i'm a little bit disappointed because of so many shortcuts that were taken when they didn't need to be.... The N64 is a very capable system, and it wasn't used to it's fullest here. And if they didn't use the space for graphics, they could have used it for sound too... Like voices and such. But they didn't do that either.Don't get me wrong, i love this game, and i play it a lot! But i find it a bit disappointing that the playstation version will be so much better.

My sister rented Harvest Moon for Super Nintindo and I rented Silly Clowns for Super Nintindo. I told my sister that her game would be stupid. After I played it I loved it and it turned out that the game I rented was the boring one. After that my sister and I always begged my mom to rent Harvest Moon for us.

As a parent, I limit the playing time of video games. I do not limit the playing time of Harvest Moon 64. This is the neatest video game I have seen. The game is educational in the respect of the player having good work habits, good savings habits and they get to participate in festivals in the town. The player plants and tends their crops, chops wood, fishes, tends their animals (if they do not do this with care ~ it will cost them some of the earnings for medicine).

In this game you make friends and enemies and you can even have a wife and child of your own.

I hope you have fun playing Harvest Moon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peaceful RPG","review":"This is the first video game I've played with no violence. It even encourages and insists on making sure you are loving to your animals! You play a farmer and keep busy raising crops (different kinds in different seasons), taking care of your animals, attending festivals, and more. You decide how much work you do, I recently had to cut down for myself, I was too busy! This game is addictive, but I did get to a point where I wondered if I had any more goals to strive for, because after awhile feeding and brushing your animals day after day gets mundane. Then I realized I could have a carpenter add on to my house, so I am busy collecting lumber every day. Your farmer can get too tired and even get sick so be careful how much work you do. This game would be very appropriate for children as it teaches responsibility and lets them choose what they want to accomplish, and everyone in the game is nice to you! Good for adults too of course. A peaceful change from high-strung action games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harvest Moon is great!","review":"Harvest Moon is exactly what my son wanted for his birthday.

Because it lacks easy-to-forget statistics, numbers, levels, spells, etc., you see so often in so many other games. This one reigns supreme. This is a near-perfect simulation of a good life, which is as close as most of us will get. It's very relaxing, the animal care, the gardening, the festivals.

The book was lent to me without a dust jacket, so I had no idea what to expect of the story line. I was pleasantly surprised. I felt that the characters were well fleshed out and easy to relate to. I did however have a few quibbles. First of all, I thought that some of the writing was a little syrupy sweet.There was also a bit of an ick factor at work here...for me anyways. I didn't have a problem with Chris and Lee's age difference, but the fact that he had been best friends with her 25 year old son was just a little offputting. I did eventually get over it, but I also was a little bothered by Lee getting involved with a man that her daughter openly had a crush on.

Morning Glory was great and I read it five times. But this one! I actually happened across the movie first and was completely captivated by the storyline, so of course I had to read the book. And when I did I fell in love - with Lee, Lloyd, Anoka and especially Christopher. WHERE can I find a real Christopher Lallek??? His quiet gentleness and sense of honor reaffirms all the old values that are harder and harder to find today. Lee is admirable in her determination to transcend the many tragedies life has brought her. And their growing relationship is powerful to witness. This story and its people have turned my life around by teaching me that there is always hope and that it's never too late to find a true hero - even in today's world.

I'm no prude, of course I know this stuff goes on every day. And I've never read any other Spencer books, maybe they're all not so touchy-feely ad nauseum. In the back of the book is a bit of the author's successful professional and personal life, picture of the hubby and she on vacation, daughter's wedding. But this book is a downer. There's enough glorifying of the wrong thing to do in the general media as it is. Guess I had the wrong impression of this author in my ignorance - thought she might be a saved Christian, ha-ha.

I recently re-read it, and I still love it just as much! LaVyrle Spencer has the neatest ability to touch your heart and make you fall in love with the characters. And I totally fell in love with Christopher! He is truly the ideal man, and I would love to find a man just like him!! I have since read every book LaVyrle has written, and I have never been disappointed by anything except the fact that she has retired. I definately recommend this to anyone looking for a perfect man and a sexy but sensitive book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life-experience in one book!","review":"Family Blessings take you on a trip through a range of human emotions: grief, pain, loss, love and happiness, to name a few. This book comes bursting out of the chute on the second page and from then on you are on a bronco-busting ride through life. When Lee Reston finds love from an unlikely source she doubts herself and whether the feelings are genuine. Explore how it feels to trust your heart and not the protocols of society."},{"rating":"2","title":"sing through the Day","review":"Happy and Rhythmic songs sung by children. My children and I love this music. It is sung by kids who sound like real kids, not by professionals. It covers so many activities and rituals throughout the day from waking to chores to play. Very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD condition","review":"If you are going to sell a book that has missing pages, a completely torn binding, and looks as if it has been tossed around like a football, then the condition should be listed as BAD. The book I bought from this seller was far from good, and completely unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the wooden one","review":"Based on the description, I thought this was a classic wooden Thomas train set. However, what arrived was a smaller metal one that does not fit on the wooden tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be a movie!","review":"I read this book while vacationing in Hawaii and I totally enjoyed it. The characters come alive and there is enough action to keep you from putting the book down. I think it would make a great movie with Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey as the two main stars - as I read it - I could just imagine the two of them as the main characters. It was a very fun and quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"The biggest flaw of the film is its climax, when the identity of the murderer is revealed. And the reason that prompts the killer to perform the crime is ridiculous and flimsy, to say the least. Frankly, the climax is such an anti-climax!Music [Himesh Reshammiya] does not contribute in taking the story forward. However, the Adnan Sami track ' 'Kyon Mera Dil' ' is the pick of the lot. Cinematography is okay.None of the performances stand out, partly because of inept writing. Manisha Koirala tries to get into the skin of the character but ignites a few sequences only. Karan Nath doesn't look the part he's projecting. Rajat Kapoor is expressive enough. Netanya Singh hams throughout. Aman Verma seems to have a Bachchan hangover and it shows. Bobby Darling is a complete miscast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Album!","review":"John Stevens did such a beautiful job on this ablum. I would recomend this album to anybody.

No flare or razzle dazzle as was heard from the era he is trying to mimic. Be yourself and be unique. Come Fly with me is a song Frank would have had fun with. Someone to watch over me.

If you do, you're deaf."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A TERRIBLE ALBUM!!!","review":"Who would of thought that boring John Stevens from American Idol would ever get a record deal...his record label is wondering how he got one also!!! He is so boring and his type of music went out of date like 50 years ago...this album is not for anyone except his true fans from American Idol..and all 50 of those fans have already reviewed this CD!!! HA HA!!! His rendition of \\"THIS LOVE\\" by Maroon 5 is a piece of trash!!! He just drags along with deep mindless chatter...the only thing this CD is good for is going to sleep...after the opening track you will be in dreamland for sure!!! DON'T BUY THIS CD...WE DON'T WANT ANOTHER ALBUM LIKE THIS!!! A TRUE F !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Allowed to sing his music, teenage crooner shines","review":"Stevens brings his cross between Sinatra and Darin to a splendid compilation of crooning standards and some newer songs that work very well arranged for John's style (\\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\" and the delightful \\"This Love\\" [Foreigner, Maroon5]). If there is only one thing I could wish from this album, it's that it were longer. At 36 minutes, it seems to me that three more songs could have added. But then again, maybe that's the idea, because John Stevens definitely leaves you wanting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money, buy Bo instead","review":"no good. John can't sing very well. Maybe he'll be better in a few years.Save your money and buy Bo Bice's new AWESOME, AMAZING, album called The Real Thing! Bo will show you how it's done! Bo's the REAL DEAL folks! Bo blows all the other Idols who ever went on the show out of the water, makes them look real bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Red","review":"John Stevens does a terrific job singing the old favorites.

Hopefully he will release another album with this great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Album","review":"I read quite all the reviews before buying this cd, as I don't live in the US, I haven't seen the American Idol shows ... I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the voice, this is a very nice first offering, of course his voice will have to grow, but hey he was only 17 ... I like the colour of the voice, it is smooth and laid-back, you can't compare his voice to Bublé or Sinatra, why should every crooner be a Sinatra wannabe ... there is place for difference and I have to say that I like this offering, and I think if the show business give him time to grow, his career could be very interesing, there are not that many good crooner around anymore, Bublé of course and Ellig, maybe Dusk and the Irish boy Cormac Kenevey, so there is space for more ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds promising...and then","review":"I want this guy to succeed so badly, yet he just couldn't pull it off.His voice has a great sound to it, pleasant to the ears, yet his interpretation was just not there. His phrasing was very lazy and boring most times. It seemed like he didn't know where to start the next word. And he also sounded out of breath. He sounded so out of breath that I started gasping for air...I had to stop listening. To add to that, John's vibrato sounded washed out and faded in places where it needed to be stronger.I truly hope with age and experience he improves. There's no reason why he should not. He's not in the catagory of a Buble' or Connick Jr. yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music -- weak vocals","review":"I'd like to set something straight. John Stevens couldn't sing on American Idol and he can't sing now. I think the only reason he even got a recording contract is that he sings \\"Sinatra-type\\" songs. You would think that he is the only young guy singing this type of music. Luckily, he is not.John Stevens still has an extremely thin voice, sings out of tune (although some of this has been fixed in studio) and sings with absolutely no passion or feeling. He still sounds like the scared, young understudy that he honestly should be. Perhaps this adds a little bit of innocence to the sound of this disc, but I would prefer to hear a stronger singer.The only reason I gave this CD two stars is that I enjoy the music and I am surprisingly listening to this CD a lot. Unfortunately, the suave arrangements can't save the weakness of the vocals.If you want to hear a young guy who can sing and sings the same style songs, check out Michael Buble. Now that guy can really sing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best cd ever","review":"this cd is the greatest ever made!!! john stevns has such a great voice!!! he is my all time favorite singer ever!!! i am so glad he did good in AI or he might not have gotten a record deal. thank you AI!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Horror at a bargaib","review":"While not a high budget production it still manages to deliver some chills to the viewer.

It's only strong point is a bloody axe killing. I like Mary Woronov, but she is wasted here. The plot is slow and fairly confusing. And the movie only runs 79 minutes, but still feels overly padded. Rent Silent Night, Deadly Night 2 instead. Even Christmas Evil was slightly better than this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do the due diligence!","review":"Ex-pats going to Europe, have no fear, this book has been written for you. With globalization now in full force, more and more international business opportunities are becoming available. But beware, the way business is done abroad is very different than in the US. Don't make the common mistakes Americans make in Europe; ie. be formal, use Mr.(last name) instead of just \\"Bill\\". Do your homework. Even American giants such as Jack Welch of GE and the Chrysler Corporation have had trouble because they did not prepare. This book gives information on the various countries in Europe and will provide you with all the the \\"little\\" things that will make your business meeting or social gathering a success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good learning tool!","review":"I am a 2nd year psychiatry resident, and in that developmental period when differential diagnosis starts to become a real tool in your armamentarium. The book is informative and concise. The introductions to, and discussions of the various psychiatric symptoms are very informative and helpful. They are like having an experienced psychiatrist as your personal tutor. It leaves you wishing the discussions were much longer. The first chapter, which discusses the six diagnostic areas that should not be missed in a psychiatric workup, is a MUST READ for every psychiatry resident, and quite frankly, every resident/medical student regardless of the specialty. It is spot-on and uncanny in its accuracy, and will help make almost immediate sense of nearly ANY psychiatric patient. My diagnostic abilities increased dramatically after reading that chapter. Well worth the money, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"se borran las letras","review":"muy buena forma de ensenar a leer y escribir el espanol a los ninos mayores de cuatro anos, pero las letras de los cubitos se han empezado a despintar y yo tengo solo dos meses de haberlo empezado a utilizar por lo que no lo recomiendo ya que se borran las letras y ya no se podra utilizar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basis for my research","review":"Not only did I include this in the literature review portion of my research project on retention and turnover, but it really formed the basis of several aspects of my research on turnover and worker satisfaction. I enjoyed it so much after borrowing from the library and reading it that I had to have a copy for myself. Many are quick to reject Herzberg's two-factor theory, but it's hard to go wrong in using what you'll learn from his results and conclusions in dealing with worker motivation. This is an outstanding analysis of what motivates workers, satisfiers and dissatisfiers, and hygiene versus motivators. A true classic in every sense of the word!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's still true today.","review":"I learned the Hertzberg theory while in grad school. Finally, it was clear to me what REALLY motivates people. (Hint: It's not money.) Even though this book is over 50 years old, it's conclusions are still relevant and valid. Fascinating reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"blaming the parents again","review":"I read this book back in graduate school, and, knowing nothing then about living with an adolescent with anorexia, it seemed to me to be a perfectly fine text. However, now we've crossed over that bridge, and saw this develop in our daughter regardless of how we tried to prevent it.Blaming the parents is toxic, unhelpful, and thoughtless. Assigning causality (and thus blame) to traits you find in families going through these difficult situations when you should recognize that correlation is not the same as causality is really toxic. We no longer talk about the \\"schizophrenigenic\\" parent, and it is cruel to blame parents for their children developing a brain disease or disorder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a flight Sim that frustrating","review":"This is a game that very frusrating becouse of the play controls. You have to control every thing from the landing gear to the back rudders. This game is like flying a real plane so if your looking for fast action than this game wouldnt be for you. I rented it and sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted gift certificate...","review":"This is possibly the worst game to come out since the decline of the Atari 2600. The best thing I can say about it is that I got it with a gift certificate, so it didn't waste MY cash. I never knew that you could stuff so much crap into a jewel case so neatly. I would suggest buying this if you would like to have one more game than the rest of your friends. (If you spend a lot of time playing this, then you probably don't HAVE any friends). The jewel case does a great job of keeping my table level!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even think of buying or renting this game.","review":"Don't waste your time playing this game. Although it has a high detailed terrain but the game is too boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible!","review":"I wish they had a No star rating cuz that would definately be on my list. I had purchased the game 1 day after recieving my dreamcast. I got it out of the package and played it for about 2 minutes, Everyone else that said that this game sucked is ABSOLUTELY correct and those of you who liked it, I dont know what your thinking. Do not even recieve this game as a gift, if someone buys it for you take it back.I recommend NFL 2k because it is almost real. I am going to use The Aero fighter game as target practice when shooting my rifle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aerowings, Sega Dreamcast","review":"Expedient shipping. Arrived VERY quickly.

No apparent damage or scuff marks at all. Owned this game 8 years ago and I'm very happy to have it back!Thanks! Great seller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult and not rewarding","review":"This game seems like it was designed for an arcade stick, and seeing as how I do not have a dreamcast flightstick and have no knowledge of one or urge to buy one, I have to say that the dreamcast controller is not nearly adequate. Though the control scheme is fairly friendly, the sensitivity of the analog will send you flying into barrel rolls with a movement of a fraction of a degree, with no options that I could find to adjust this (though I didn't look hard, as I was far too disappointed with the game to keep going). Turning in formation is nearly impossible, and why would you want to if you couldn't swoop in on enemies together. Because there are none. No guns. No nothing. It's like cheese pizza: it's still kinda good, but you feel like it isn't complete.I borrowed it from a friend and couldn't stay on it for more than ten minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"The alternate name for this game, Aero Dance, describes how much fun this game is. It might as well be a game about dancing. If you \\"break formation\\" you have to wait through 30 seconds of loading, exit a replay, wait 30 more seconds to load, hit retry, and wait 30 more seconds. Don't buy, rent, or even steal this game; it's not worth it. This game should be called \\"Aero... through the wallet.\\" If you like fun games, I suggest Test Drive 6, Hydro Thunder, NFL 2K (blows me away), Toy Commander, or anything else but this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative to say the least.","review":"As an aspiring web site designer I find this book to be a great resource in my future developement.It cuts through all the technical mumbo jumbo thatcan be quite confusing to the novice.

I friend told me to mentally transpose the e and the a next time I shop for books to ensure I don't make the same mistake yet again. Out of 600 pages about half are filler, background stuff and other junk, that won't help you at all. Which leaves about 300 pages of which half are pictures and worthless examples. Toss out the 100 pages of fluff in the appendix and you are left with about 50 pages of stuff that you may be able to use. In the end you have to ask yourself do you really want to shell out $39.99 or whatever Amazon charges for a book that will leave you frustrated and feeling ripped off even after you search out the aforementioned 50 pages that may be useful"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk science is its worst!","review":"For a book that is supposed to help you, this one sure doesn't. Reminds me of a paint by numbers set my children would use. The only problem is that it has about as much detailed instruction as well. This book is an example of hand holding at its peak. The author walks you through the process of creating VERY basic tables, frames and stylesheets.Mixed in with all the hand holding are discussions that few beginners will understand. Sort of like the author has multiple personality disorder and one personality wrote for beginners then the second personality went back and added all sorts of stuff that wasn't explained to be spiteful. The book is written for beginners yet assumes so much that only an expert will have any idea of where the author is going with specific points. The only problem is that if you know the basics already you do NOT need this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, not very helpful","review":"I found that this book was terrible and didn't help at all with my web page coding.

This collection of songs gives me goosebumps and takes me back to the venue, where you could hear a pin drop as Bruce sang his heart out. Country but folksy and bluesy at the same time, easy to listen to but will get your foot tappin', this is down home music at it's finest. You might scoff at the title \\"Never Lost An Arm\\" but once you listen to the song, you will get the reference and meaning. His first album, Wheels Roll, is my personal favorite and I really wish we'd hear more from him soon. C'mon Bruce! How about the \\"Texas Has Miles and Miles of Highways song\\"? Seriously, if you like Lucinda Williams, Steve Earle, Robert Earl Keen, T Bone Burnett and others of that genre...give this one a listen. You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Violin playing at it's purest","review":"I had listened to Grumiaux's set for years before deciding to try out Milstein's. Am I ever glad that I did.

There is just something about Milstein's tone that suites these works perfectly, just as Josef Suk's playing goes perfectly with Dvorak and Brahms. I still think Grumiaux's performance is flawless (as always), but they just don't do it for me like these.

I've hooked it up to an XP computer, and now more recently to a server running Windows Server 2003 Small Business Edition. Same problem. When it does print, the quality and speed are good, but what good is a printer that doesn't print half the time, and ties up my time working on it when I could be working on real projects? By now, the lost labor of working on this printer would have easily been offset by buying a better printer to begin with. I'll be very wary before buying another Minolta printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Headache","review":"We've had this printer for our small business for about 6 months now.

I like that Sarah doesn't jam too many words in her songs, so that there is a spaciousness to this recording. There is a breathy quality to her vocals and she doesn't push them too hard. There is lots to discover on this recording and yet it doesn't take very long to grow on you. This is a gem that more people should know about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buildup fails, instead it's boring","review":"I think the main storyline failure is that chapter after chapter consists of the two characters arguing.

Not this one though. The back cover description makes it sound like Sam wants sex, what he wants is an explanation for the break-up, which he never got. Karen is running away from the death of her first love, a marine Gunnery Sergeant. So how believable is it that she would date, let alone love another one? Because that's what she whines about-'you're going to die, and I'm afraid' just about through the whole book. Sam deserves better. That's why it got 2 stars instead of one, cause I liked the hero-I just wish the author had given him a better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've read this 5 times!","review":"Great light read.

Finally, to satisfy my urges I went out and purchased one of their albums. I was hooked. Everyone of my friends has either heard of OAR through me or someone else and almost every last person likes them emphatically. I don't know what else to say besides buy this CD. If you've never heard them before, download one of their songs and check them out but do buy the CD as they aren't a huge band and they could really use your support."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?!","review":"I thought The Wanderer was the best cd ever. I wore that one out at parties until finally someone swiped it from me. Crazy Game of Poker was amazing. Then, I got Souls Aflame and had a lot of fun listening to that. So, I knew Risen, their 3rd effort, would be a sound purchase, right? Wrong. What happened?! They threw in a couple new songs, but the old ones have all been \\"Hootie'd out\\". Want to hear Hootie and the Blowfish sing Night Shift? Me neither! I was thoroughly disappointed. Risen wasn't as raw (or upbeat) as the first two albums, and the band didn't sound like they were having anywhere near the fun they used to. As a result, it was no fun listening to. Sorry, folks. The Wanderer and Souls Aflame should be part of every music lover's collection, but I wouldn't suggest Risen to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"just not very good.","review":"freinds of mine told me to check this band out, each with glowing and positive things to say. although plenty of people out there seem to enjoy o.a.r., to me this is a bland, forgettable album. they aren't great musicians, the singer is irritating, but the most glaring problem with the group is that they write boring songs that you swear have been written before (guster, rustic overtones, dispatch, and dave matthews band have covered this territory time and time again, and they are all much more rewarding and enjoyable than o.a.r.) there's nothing wrong with music that isn't completley original, but these guys just aren't getting any better with time. i hear they're good live, but they'll never be more than a college concert draw if they don't start making more interesting music than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"O.A.R","review":"First off...

I now own all of them (and highly recommend each one). Their music ranges from DMB sound, to something like Phish, or even the Dead. Not bland and every song offers something different.

Even got my wife to listen to O.A.R. now :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"KEY!","review":"Shh-Hoops the middle man...After listening to this CD, I completely melted into a mentally unbalanced pool of sweet feelings and rare emotions. The music created an inner sense never before experienced. The psynchopated rhythms published a luscious emission of unique flavor and vibrant sound. As I touch the collection of good vibrations, I can't help but feel absolute contentment. O.A.R. provides a liberality and a benevolence that you can't find in today's deranged music. As I sleep at night I feel an incredible anxiety to awake the next morning and joyfully depress the play button on my prosperous compact disc player. The combination of tone and rhythm is absolutely EPIC. I instantaneously recommend this beautiful euphony to any person living within or outside of a municipality. The minstrelsy is absolutely saucaceous and it is incredibly KEY to the unlocking of freedom.

The book originally sold for around $12.95 and I think that as a book that is what it is worth. I have the same sentiments for \\"Richard Schmid paints the landscape\\". If you are an artist I recommend the most recent book, \\"Alla Prima Painting \\" which is still way overpriced at $100. but if it is Mr. Schmid's technique and experience you are after this will help you to understand his thoughts, philosophy and technique a little better.

There is an incredible amount of errors that make this book lose all credibility. I would not trust any other book from either of these authors. I wonder if they ever had it proof read. There was a minimum of 5 errors PER CHAPTER! In my opinion, there shouldn't even be 5 errors in an entire textbook being used at universities. After reading just 2 chapters in this book I couldn't trust any of the information it was giving me because I was afraid it was another error. It makes the learning process take MUCH longer. If you ever have a choice, do not get this book. Plead with professors to use another book because this book will stunt your learning and put you in risk of getting the wrong information and a bad grade. AVOID THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Error filled","review":"This is the 7th Edition, and has an orange cover. There have been so many errors in this textbook as well as the solutions manual that our course professor gives extra credit to those who point the errors out first in the problem sets. And this is the 7th Edition? Give me a break.Errors include giving the wrong fractional values for specific genetics problems. Equations needed on the test are stated incorrectly in the text. The few answers that they give you in the back of the text book also contains errors. In the solutions manual I recall they were base pairing A with G and T with C, which resulted from a formatting error.How do you get to the 7th Edition of a book and have so many GROSS errors in a college level textbook? This leads me to believe that the source is Greed, when I see the price this book cost at the university bookstore and the gross negligence of failing to even proofread parts of the text before printing this error filled text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much fluff","review":"This book might be good if used as a secondary reference for an introductory class, but it is definitely not a title I would recommend for someone trying to teach themselves about the subject. I felt constantly like I was being talked down to. The authors waste your time with unnecessary stories about so-and-so with such-and-such genetic disorder, along with space in the book for accompanying pictures. Sentence structure is poor; the text feels as if it were written around a multiple-choice test.Another reviewer said that this text could be used for grad students; I would tend to disagree. Grad students are accustomed to getting a bit more respect from their textbooks. By this point in our academic careers, we aren't going to pay attention just because you threw in a picture of a cat (yep, see page 29)-- we're here for the science.Generally speaking, it's not a book to read if you just want to know the science of genetics and understand the moving parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written but pricey","review":"This book is written by two Harvard professors for their introductory life sciences course. I had to take this course because it's a requirement, and I'm annoyed that they assigned such an expensive, self-written textbook.Personal annoyance aside, however, I have to say that this is a well-written textbook. I'm not so sure it's worth the steep price, but the writing is clear, the diagrams are helpful, and it really assisted me in understanding and clarifying fundamental biological concepts. I can't say this for most of the textbooks I've used. (The textbook was certainly a lot clearer than the lecture, unfortunately.) Given that textbooks in general cost a fortune, I wouldn't consider this a bad investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A preventative must-have","review":"I keep this product handy, especially in the wintertime.

I would say as long as you have a good sense of humor your pretty much safe buying this.remember: its the stuff deemed 'unfit' for \\"my heart with always be the b-side to my tongue\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome DVD","review":"Release the Bats one of the craziest, nastiest, and funniest DVD's I have ever seen. If you like Fall Out Boy & the show Jackass you will probably like this DVD. The movie has some cool bonus features too, like concerts of other bands and some stuff from the Warped tour. The only thing is that you should not purchase this movie if you are under 13, you may not be mature enough for some of the things in the DVD. I love this movie and I am hoping Peter Wentz makes another DVD.~Nobody Puts Baby in the Corner:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book- unlike other guides I read it cover-to-cover. The author and his team have stayed at just about every property, eaten at almost every restaurant, and are committed to bringing an honest assesment of their experiences to the reader. The book covers everything from accomodations, the casino floor and restaurants to the basic rules of gaming (with an easy to understand explantation of the blackjack rules- I still pull it out when I can't remember the rules for my hand). The format is such that it is an interesting book to sit down and READ, while wanting to go back to certain parts for reference.

I use a thick kitchen cushion with gripping on the other side, and get better results.

But those promises were squished (pardon the pun) quickly. Within a month, it was about half as thick as it was when I received it! I'm not a heavy person, so I can't imagine how flat it would be for anyone over 130 lbs.

The wedge part did what I hoped, but the hole in the cushion makes your hips cave in and stresses your lower/mid back. Instead of sitting properly on your hip \\"sitz bones\\" (ischial tuberosities) the pressure is transferred to your soft tissue and spine.I'm neither big nor small; I'm about an average-size gal at 150 pounds.

The cushion still stayed decompressed which now makes it uncomfortable. It hurts my butt and I wish I had never bought this cheap product.

The incoming calls are crystal clear and I don't seem to have any problems with the customers hearing me. You can pay a lot more for a different system, but it's not necessary. You still have to have a corded phone to go with this system, but I already had an old phone and it works fine.

First the channels die (there are six on the side) currently only 4 of these work. The transmit quality degrades, noise gets introduced in both transmit and receive streams and the noise gets so loud while the receiving quality gets so bad, that you can no longer use it. I like plantronics, it is the best company out there, but this product only has a shelf life of about 2 yrs. I am now shopping for another plantronics product that works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A muti-taskers tool","review":"The Plantronics s12 Corded Telephone Headset one of the best tools you can have on your desk.

Luckily I work with a few other business owners that have their employees using several S12 headsets. When I initially plugged in the headset there was an echo, but that was due to my error in the way I set the headset up. I turned the volume down to the correct level and it has worked perfectly since then.

I promptly returned this product, and will never buy another plantronic product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"hands free phoning","review":"headset allows me to talk on phone and still be productive, only downside is it's corded, not cordless, though the cord is pretty long.

This product ended up being a hugh disappointment. The main problem with this headset is it frequently goes into a high pitched lock up disrupting my meetings. It is probably due to feedback between the ear and mouth pieces. So to give the product the benefit of the doubt I connected it up to another phone and it did the same thing. Unless you drop the gain down low enough so you can barely hear it will not squeal. Bascially making this product useless. The other issue was when I only wanted to use the handset it created a noticeable hum in the background."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product","review":"I purchased this product which was defective. I sent it back and received a replacement. The quality of the product is really bad. I believe that it may be more of a headphone issue than a headset issue. There was only one \\"channel\\" that worked out of the 4 or 5 that were available. (I can't remember the number but it was at least 3 and no more than 5 channels). In any event, of the one channel that worked, there was a constant buzzing noise in the background. I bought this specifically because I have a hearlng loss. However, this is not the answer. The loudness is there but the quality and buzzing are a complete distraction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Move Around A Lot With These","review":"I wish I had spent my $80 on something better.

I've had this for almost a 1 year now and have had issues with it. First the headset is WAY to loud, even turned down to the lowest setting. It puts you in position where you have to whisper into it and causes your voice clarity to drop. Not letting you to speak normal and let yourself pronounce your words correctly and loudly enough. Which is important in my profession...Also, the mute button stopped working after a month. So any time your on a call and need to clear your throat, sneeze, drink water, etc... I hit the mute button and the customer can still hear you! IT'S EMBARRASSING. It works sometimes and the other times it does not.

I need a headset as I am on the phone all day for my job, but I'm scared to buy another plantronics because I can't take that hum!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit and sound for my webcasts","review":"I purchased this headset because I have started presenting webcasts and needed to make sure that the sound quality was superior. The Platronics S12 meets that requirement (and exceeded my expectations) and gives the wearer great flexiblity to control the sound. My only complaints are the short cord between the telephone and the Platronics base and the flimsy stand used to hold the headset when not in use. Both of these problems are minor and can be corrected through a little ingenuity."},{"rating":"1","title":"had a very strong echo","review":"I have this same product 12, but this one seemed to be of less quality, very strong echo.

The design is horrible. The base can only sit a few inches from your phone so the phone and headset take up half of your desk. The flimsy construction makes it wonderful for children passing by your office who want to play with objects that mirror the weak carnival prizes they win at the ring toss, but not very good if you're trying to actually make a living using your telephone to talk to other people.

Never a problem, and I am on the phone 4-5 hours per day on conference calls, that is every day for over 5 years. I use it on a cheap GE single line phone - only issue is that you need to life the handset off the phone to dial - which is an inconvenience. The other is that the plethora of wiring tends to get tangled up amongst the phone cord and other items on your desk. After about 4 years, the ear cushion, which is a vinyl covered foam started to deteriorate and all of the vinyl (rich Corinthian leather??) has fall off. There are a couple of cracks in some areas along the mic boom. But hasn't impacted sound quality. Speaking of sound quality, the unit is excellent - and this not only for local conf calls, but for calls to Asia, Europe, etc. This is a pseudo professional headset and for anyone who spends 4-5 days working from home, it is a true workhorse."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is absolute garbadge!!!","review":"I made the mistake of buying this product without searching it out online first. I am a graphics designer and I needed my monitors calibrated. After using this product, my monitor ended up having a very bad pink cast as I later went out to read a lot of people are having. The company admits of flawed manuracturing and promises to raplace the device if you want to wait a few weeks. I could not get in touch with customer support, they put me in a voicemail marry go arround which circles arround in the same prompts... absolute horrible experience. I can't beleive that Apple Stores are carying this piece of garbadge, after the great reputation that company has. When a company admits to having flawed products, do not sell them for $130.00 people, discontinue it until you fix it. I would rather pay $300 for a model that works, rather then having to deal with this bs all day long, and now having to make another trip to the store to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissatisfied","review":"This would probably be quite a good product, and useful too, that is if the Pantone people bothered to tell you that it WILL NOT WORK with earlier versions of Photoshop (certainly 5.5 anyway.

You can re-install Photoshop, however, it's to no avail as subsequent fact finding has shown that the color profile it creates will not work with early Photoshop versions. All it takes is a warning from Pantone at time of purchase and in their many reviews. Now I have to buy a later Photoshop version (which I really do not need) in order to use Huey.

In example, if I take a blue box from screen one over to screen two, it will now be a duller grayish blue appearance. Reds end up with a browner appearance on one of the monitors. I tried the software and device on my wife's dual screen workstation - though the results were different, the screens still did not display colors the same.

I think they have serious manufacturing issues and decided to handle this case by case rather than a product recall which is a shame for a company with such a good reputation as PANTONE.

I submitted several tech support emails and have yet to hear back from them. I am returning it back to Amazon as defective product and let them deal with it.

I contacted Pantone, who said they are having trouble with defective HueyPro's, and that I should follow the instructions on their help site to get a replacement. Three weeks, two email follow-ups and two phone calls later, I have yet to receive a response from any complaint, or a replacement HueyPro.

Bad to note though, that I emailed the tech people at Pantone and they never got back to me. I plan on returning this product unless I can get them by phone and they can fix it.

The setting flexibility in the Huey Pro seemed worth the possible hassle.I got my Huey Pro and installed it. Had a red cast on my monitor and so downloaded an update from Pantone as a previous buyer suggested. Still a red tone. I contacted customer service online and reported the problem. Over 3 weeks, I updated my customer service request several times and called the 800 number but had to leave a message. Still no response.

Unfortunately, it was not compatible with my MacBook (2007 edition) or with a Samsung LCD screen (SyncMaster 152T). On both screens, the collor correction resulted in a reddish/pinkish screen. Even turning the huey sideways during the calibration process (recommended on some web sites) did not fix this problem.

There's hardly anything \\"pro\\" about this; it would be underwhelming even if described as being primarily for hobbyists and consumers. Like most other people have noted, this product turns your screen pink. And in my case, it did much worse: it effected the gamma to a point where everything had a bleached out quality. I, and several others, strongly advise against this product and please heed my advice.I have done my research, I have done everything correctly, and I have found forums and reviews were literally dozens of people have had the exact same problem.

I tried to manually adjust them to look more similar, but gave up after spending almost an hour adjusting and readjusting the on-screen settings by hand.Within half an hour after installing the huey pro both monitors were calibrated and the colors were spot on! Now I can use my photo editing software on either screen without worrying about the color differences. I also like the reminders for periodic re-calibration.As others have noted, the tiny suction cups don't always hold the device to the screen, so I usually just hold a finger on it during the 60 seconds or so of calibration. Not a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"As far as monitor calibration software/hardware goes, this is at the bottom of the barrel. It's not to say the product isn't good for the money but it's very hit and miss as far as an accurate reading goes. It will work brilliantly on some monitors and show a horrible red or blue cast on others as it over corrects. I still can't understand why. I've also come to realize that just about every one in about five of this piece of hardware that comes out of the factory has an inaccurate eye causing it to read false on ALL monitors.

I use it for producing cgi visuals for film and video and this is the closest I've gotten to 'true' color on a standard non-NTSC monitor. The calibration device is elegant, very well made and does a fantastic job of monitoring the lighting in the room + adjusting your color accordingly.Negative -- The KVM switch might be partially responsible here, but the Huey color profile doesn't always automatically launch itself on startup.

These are really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"These truffles are not as great as they are made up to be. I thought for the price they would have a greater taste, but they didn't have much taste at all. They are not worth the price, but had to find out for myself.

It was funny and very entertaining. TWO THUMBS UP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish and pointless","review":"I have a real soft spot in my heart for good chick lit, but unfortunately, this isn't it. I really can't believe that this type of writing would appeal to anyone beyond an inexperienced, starry-eyed high schooler. The characters are shallow, trendy, and apparently out getting wasted almost every night. Where's the smart, sophisticated heroine? Where's the well-written prose? Not here, that's for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best RDI book","review":"I loved the story line, loved the characters, and LOVED Ariella Papa's writing style. Out of all the RDI books, this is the one I could most relate to, with Eve living at home at the beginning of the story. This is one of my favorite books. I won't give it 5 stars because the ending was a bit far-fetched, but nevertheless entertaining, and good escapism."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"I am a fan of the chick lit genre, but I couldn't force myself to read this book. As a recent college grad who is still trying to figure out how my current career figures with where I'd eventually like to be, I thought I could relate to the characters. Instead, I found them shallow and generally unlikeable. The way the book was written was terrible- changing tenses, sloppy transitions and even some typos. I read about half of the book and, in retrospect, have no idea how I managed to make it that far."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING & SNOBBY","review":"Boring, snobbish, direction-less. Eve, the main character, has no substance; rather, she's stumbling along, with a boring life, marveling at her \\"Amazonian\\" friend who seems to get all the guys, and laments about her terrible job - which is, might I add, NOT a terrible job. I felt like I was wasting my time reading this book, and that's not a good thing. Anyway, save your money. This one is NOT like a Bridget Jones, or any good chick lit for that matter, if that's what you're expecting it to be.IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR THE TIME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY THIS BOOK","review":"I had high hopes for this book, but it is truly vapid. A waste of time, with little substance, humor or realism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, fun read","review":"This book is so easy to relate to if you are in your 20's, single, and working at an unchallenging job... and most of your time is spent going out with friends and on dates or at least thinking about those things. It is set in New York, and she is very descriptive about the city - I felt like I was right there."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"This book really isn't that good. I started it and within the first few pages had my doubts, but then the next couple of chapters started to get interesting so I went on. By the time I was about 2/3 of the way though I couldn't wait for it to end. The author could have done what she did here in about 1/3-1/2 the book and then carried the story out further. It's like she was writing to have a second book follow. The language is young and very obnoxious to read. Very strange book. Not that good in the end. Save your $."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the Verge","review":"I didn't even get to page 100 before I gave up on it. I bought this second hand and it didn't even looked like it had been read. They must've gave up on it too. I rarely give up on books. This one was rare for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh...","review":"I got to Page 37 and listed this book on Ebay. I don't like the short sentences and present tense that this Ariella Papa uses. Both characters so far (Eve and Tabitha) are totally unbelievable - but hey, maybe it's because I'm not an image-driven New Yorker. But I somehow doubt that every young person in NY is like this. I was trying to force myself to read this book, but I just can't. There are too many references to \\"my crotch\\" or \\"droopy boobies\\" and they never really seem appropriate. I guess it's just because out of 37 pages, sexual references have been used at least 20 times already. I think a good book needs to work up to this kind of stuff. And this, is definitely not a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassed","review":"I STRONGLY dislike this product for 3 reasons:1.

LEAKS!!!!!!I was wearing this product earlier today as I was in class and I urinated and this brief leaked horribly! It was humiliating I was in the front row of my calculus lecture and I noticed a large wet spot on my shorts and t-shirt. Not only that, but when lecture was finally over and I attempted to bolt for the door I could feel the brief noticeably sagging.Also, this is not a product that was designed with comfort in mind, I was only in this brief for about 2 hours and it wasn't pleasant. It bunched and pinched A LOT!Basically, this product is NOT discreet, comfortable or effective and thanks to the sub-par design of this brief I have experienced one of the most humiliating events of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"if you are like me and do not read the description closely, you will not get what you think. to me, a brief is something you step in and pull up. this is a diaper with tabs with tape on them. you try and teach an 80 year old adult how to put this on."},{"rating":"1","title":"i dont get it","review":"I struggled to finish this book, but i did. The story was weak and not believable. It is not a good travelogue. it is not a good mystery. it is not a good drama. I couldnt find myself rooting for or against any of the charachters.

So, I don't know how they can call it \\"Dance Mix\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sci-fi for young adults","review":"This book is written in the best tradition of Robert Heinlein. It is a well written story of a young man thrown from the dubious comfort of a failing public school system into the opportunities and dangers of young adulthood.This is \\"hard\\" science fiction. No magic space rays or mysterious alien technology. Everything works. I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It brought back memories of the books I enjoyed in high school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, great message","review":"Concern over a \\"right-wing\\" message is excessive, I think. As far as I can tell, this series' purpose is to try to inspire the current generation of young teens to get a real education and try to _do_ something _real_. Considering the impact juvenile SF had in the 50s and 60s, and even on myself in the 70s and 80s, I applaud Sheffield, Pournelle, and the publisher for giving it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jerry Pournelle and Charles Sheffield don't mix","review":"Stunk! Foul language & gratuitous violence ruined any chance of a decent story.Charles Sheffield on his own writes terrific stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"pants !","review":"I loved charles sheffields book 'Godspeed Base', so I purchased this one, expecting more of the same. But alas, how dissapointed I was. All this book shows is that you should have sex at 16, should be dishonest, should not trust anyone, should be pessimistic etc, which are hardly the things for juvenile readers to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-intentioned But Disappointing","review":"I bought this novel because it has been compared to Heinleins juvenile stories, which I rather liked. The books feeling, in fact, is right, but apart from that it suffers from an oversimplified plot, rather wooden characters and a hard-to-believe background setting. The science seems correct, but that does not make this book \\"hard SF\\". I do not know about Sheffield, but if you want to read a good Pournelle, stick to \\"Prince of Mercenaries\\" or other books of his."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important book, great read","review":"This book was published in 1996, but the ideas are amazingly timely. The hero, 16-year-old Rick Luban, is going to waste in a dumbed-down educational system and on a fast track to the vast pool of unemployed graduates. By luck, he is kicked out of school and receives a tip from the school's science teacher about a possible job. The rest of the book is a fascinating combination of adventure and apprenticeship -- two essential components of successful adolescent development.While presented as science fiction, the ideas are based on real, cutting-edge space technology and real, tragic failures in American schools. Pournelle wields a sharp knife. The characterizations of the teens are brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book To Miss","review":"As a Scotophile and history buff, I was looking forward to reading this new series-- and while the little character pictures are interesting, the first book itself was harder and harder slogging as the chapters piled up. The characters? Odd, and sometimes cartoonish; the dialogue? peculiar. I half-expected Edward I to twirl his mustachios and utter \\"Muwahaha!\\" before long.. so I stopped reading. It takes a great deal to make me lay aside a book, especially on one of my heroes-- but this one did it. It reads like a bad movie script, not a book on one of the crucial periods of Scottish history.Read the real thing:The Bruce Trilogy: A Superb Trilogy About Scotland's Greatest Hero (Coronet Books)'s Bruce trilogy, plus his bookThe Wallace: The Compelling 13th Century Story of William Wallace (Coronet Books)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The old days","review":"My grandaughter loves Tull, who wouldn't?

This is a very strange DVD that begins with two \\"Audio Only Songs\\", and then goes into 8 Videos, whch again is followed by three Audio Only songs.

However, there is no justification for the price to minutes ratio of this DVD. The point of a DVD is having video with the performance, not just random still photos over the music. Of the so-called run time of 95 minutes in the DVD description, only about half is actual live footage. No real complaints about the footage included, except that the video ends abruptly during an extended encore riff on Locomotive Breath. Very unsatisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't get ripped again!","review":"I was sixteen years old when I went to Madison Square Garden to see my favorite band, Jethro Tull, in November 1978. I had lousy seats but I didn't care - until the show started and the sound was so bad, the sections around mine started chanting, \\"We can't hear!\\"At the beginning of the show it was announced (I don't remember by whom) that the show was being broadcast in England and I thought, \\"Great, it's GOT to be a good show.\\" I was wrong. The set list was okay but the whole show was an hour long, no encores, AND for some reason they did Aqualung twice!Those tickets must have cost me 6, maybe 8 dollars, times two for my girlfriend, plus train fare and a couple of joints, comes to a total of about 20 bucks.I will not be paying for this show again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Tull is great","review":"Have been a Tull fan for a long time, and saw this concert in 78 on TV.

This is vintage Tull at there best. I have seen this band live many times, and this is the second best presentation you will find after catching the live shows. This DVD represents Tull in their middle years, and, as such, you will witness their music at its best (most matured)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Job On Satellite Broadcast","review":"What makes this dvd stand out to me, is the line-up with David Palmer and Barriemore Barlow. There hasn't been any other Tull dvds with those two members present. I consider this to be the premier line-up. Great playing under difficult circumstances being one of the first, or perhaps the first, world wide sat broadcast. Barries' playing is fiery and inspired. The band really seemed stoked to play. A must have, of course, for Tull fans and anyone else who enjoys seeing a band at the peak of their powers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like everything except the two-handed overly complicated remote !","review":"I bought one of these when they first came out to run the my mains out the pre-amp outputs to my Bose 901 EQ and then to my Carver 450W / ch Amp.

The two-handed remote with the big LCD screen ( Slammed in my ease of Use rating ) was always goofy but functional so - I dealt with it ! I never changed much after I set it up so remote was only for on/off, volume and input switching.I believe it has to be over 10 years old by now and it still functions fine.

Spunky tomboy Joanna de Mayo narrates her funny tale of growing from a sports-crazed kid with no interest in boys into a competitive tennis star linked with popular jock and rival-turned-boyfriend Rick Hendricks.With humorous dialogue, exciting tennis sequences, plenty of comic relief-filled subplots, and just enough of a feminist edge, the novel both entertains and extols the virtues of hard work, sticking to one's convictions, and ultimately of learning to back away from those convictions in the spirit of compromise. Even the normally irritating youth flashback sequences are enjoyable in this upbeat, winning novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong book","review":"I did not order this book.

However, I can see if you are too narrow it could be a risk. The reason I did not get the shoe a 5.... Pelle has to start indicating when a shoe runs a size small that one should buy up. I took a chance and got the size 13M for my normal size 12M and got a great fit.

Shes definetly a 'concious' emcee but on tracks like block party where she talks about blacks expanding their horizons, the sh*t she spits doesnt come off preachy but as matter of fact. She will instantly endear you to her because she seems like a normal woman whereas other female emcees live in a fantasy world, ms. grae spits facts and makes it sound good. she has a lot of potential to make a classic but this isnt it. the beats are mostly by nashym nameen (???), masta ace and the beatminaz. in my opinion they didnt hook up the samples right, and the mixing is quite poor, but its still a good album if you like concious hip hop"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Write Better Rhymes Talking In My Sleep!!!","review":"First off, this CD is the worst rap album I've ever heard.

The second chapter details setting up the SDK but after many hours of searching I can't find anyplace to download it. It uses the first (November 2003) release of the J2EE SDK and there have been 3 updates since then. The current release uses an entirely different database with an extensively updated web server.I'm looking to familiarize myself with J2EE 1.4 and this appears to be a very good book for that, but it's going to be a major pain when I'm forced to use different software."},{"rating":"2","title":"Playing Peek A Boo With Mike Tyson","review":"Playing Peek A Boo With Mike TysonMixed feelings here - Tyson and the fights are GREAT - I'm not sure if it's just the copy I have, but the quality of the DVD was poor - i.e. it looked like the fights were transferred from an old VHS tape and on to DVD - somewhat grainy and just not near DVD quality.The only other negative comment I have is that the fights are edited. It's not the full fights. It's highlights and/or a few minutes of the rounds. I would have preferred the entire rounds unedited.This is a must have for any Tyson fan. You forget how spectacular Mike was at the beginning of his career.

Hence, I was excited to receive this package. Once I opened it and played the video, I was dismayed with the editing of it. I was told that the fights were in there \\"entirety\\". This is entirely not true. The fights are broken, cut, & pasted. There seems to be no skill in this because sometimes when the fighters are mixing it up, the DVD skips to 10 seconds later. There are no interviews which is a part of the fight I like and no previews, which I use to like on HBO. But what really hurts the quality is that the fights are not complete. This in itself hurts this collection of videos as a \\"collectors piece\\" because their not originial in any sense of the word..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor video quality, & heavily edited fights - Looks like a cheap bootleg","review":"I have to wonder if this release is even legitimate. By that, I mean did the producer even buy the rights to the fights? If so, why does each and every fight look like it was copied from VHS? The best example of this is in the Spinks fight, where horizontal lines reminiscent of VHS tapes with poor tracking are clearly visible. In fact, the resolution looks even worse (more grainy) than VHS & more like something that was lifted from youtube.To say that I do not recommend this video would be a vast understatement. Moreover, the content is worth little more than the mere DVD media its packaging. This video is an insult to Mike Tyson, as well as the sport of boxing and its fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend by the Publishers of GLpro","review":"Finally, here's the book that takes a lot of the in-depth detail of the GLpro language by the horns and yanks them into an easy to understand context for professional multimedia development.

Most of these songs were not picked because of the songs but because of who performs them. Shakira at the time of this cd's release was considered the next big thing in female pop vocalists and she is. Moby (the most talented man in music today the guy plays ALL the instruments on his cds,mixes and sings) was selected because he took electronica out of the underground clubs and got it to the Grammys and MTV. I'd like to see NOW! branch out into say a double cd set and feature artists from more genres such as country, blues, new age. Sort of a potpourri of the best of all styles.

Better direction would have given us realistic character studies to help tell the story.

That includes this recording. He is most famous for his stint with Charles Mingus. He was the perfect Mingus sideman, giving Mingus the uncompromising creativity that Mingus demanded. He died at age 39, so any recording by him is to be valued. Here, he recorded with equally marvelous musicians, including trumpeter Charles Tolliver, pianist John Hicks, with Lenny McBrowne and Red Mitchell on drums and bass respectivly. What an all-star group! Tolliver is as deserving of wider recognition as Ervin. If anyone has not heard of the late John Hicks by now, do yourself a favor, and get any of his many trio recordings.

My only regret is that I did not purchase the less expensive (and less powerful) RX-397 as the power of this model is major overkill for my needs. However, the RX-397 has fewer input sources and I felt I should leave my options open in case I needed to add system components in the future.If you have a decent pair of speakers (I have 35 year old Bose 501's), this stereo will absolutely blow the windows out of a normal size home.

But, in Ebb, Nebraska, we meet Vernon Moore; and, HOW our world NEEDS a Vernon Moore! Shaffner's characters are as down home as your next door neighbors. You'll laugh aloud with them, cry with them, and, as you close the last page, you will, like the inhabitants of Ebb, be filled with hope. Not the hope of fairy tales, but a reasoned hope that will touch both your mind and your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful -- Touches your heart !","review":"This book was a wonderful change of pace from other books that I have read. Considering that I am not an avid reader, I was amazed that I sat down and read this book in one sitting. I found that this book was very easy to read and very thought provoking. The author touches on so many emotions, through his characters, that you can't help but be touched by the daunting issues that they have to overcome within themselves and with each other. With the help of a traveling salesman, they are able to face their fears and desires with faith and hope.

It had real potential with a fascinating topic and I kept reading because I hoped that it would give me something to enjoy. It really failed. Not only was the writing just slightly better than what a high school senior would produce but it was also condescending and didactic in the worst way. Shaffner didn't trust his audience enough to give them complex characters or an original plot line. The list of cliched characters includes the bitter hopeless father, the angelic dying child, the greedy businessman, the no-nonsence narrator and her sassy best friend, and the mysterious stranger who comes into to town and redeems them all with his Eastern philosophical outlook disguised as midwestern wisdom. Reading it made me feel like I was in a Philosophy 101 class being taught by the professor who wrote the text book and charged you too much for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for thought it","review":"This is a beautiful story with so much wisdom.

I've read many of the major books in the market and have been trading for quite some time and I found that I didn't get anything substantial out of this one. maybe a good book if your just starting out but not for anyone that has traded over 6 months. Pretty much all he talks about is buying stocks under ten dollars and setting limit orders. And the amount of time he devotes to Wade Cook is irritating. Ok yea its obvious who your mentor is but you don't have to quote him on every bloody page and then put the titles of every one of his books in the appendix including the books that he wrote that has nothing to do with stocks.

For example, I opened my account one month ago and have begun to roll two different stocks. In one day, I netted $85 on my account which by the way, contained a mere $400 in it.

However, after charting 100's of stocks, there just aren't many that match this strategy.

Also type in Wade Cook into your browser and see the websites of the people bashing him. That was a real eye-opener for me. Perhaps I'm just gullible.

It is truly a waste of money. The author paints a rozy scenario where you make millions with the system. Sure, it can be done, but it takes money, time and knowledge. You get nothing of those three from the book. Witt's only purpose in writing this book must have been to tempt the reader to sing up for those expensive Wade Cook seminars. Also, he touts big time the TC2000 software. That is a good package (I use it) but it is not the only one. Metastock has better formula control than TC2000, for instance. This is not the book to buy if you want to invest.

Of course it looks easy buying at the low and selling at the high when you look at a HISTORICAL chart - it already happenned! Doing so in the future is much more difficult, and the truth is these \\"strategies\\" are more wishful thinking when someone tries to enact them in a real portfolio over the long term. Witt/Cook don't cover some important aspects of bid/ask spread, fundamental reasons for volatility, etc. Refer to Cook's early books, and you'll note that of the dozen or so stocks he uses to illustrate his \\"rolling stock\\" concept, three are now bankrupt and all but one are now down at least 40% from where they were in 1996. Strange, but for those who bought these \\"rollers\\", there was never a chance to sell at the high...This book is full of wishful thinking, no matter how eloquent it sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Save your money!

So if you buy a roller and short it a few days/weeks later and we are in a bull market you will lose money! The writer should also explain more and better about stochastics and mov.averages.

I don't think Witt's book offers much valuable insight into analyzing the stocks technically or fundamentally. So the guy tells how to use stochastics... big deal.

The catchy title, the attractive front cover, and particularly the addition of drawings of ammonites at the beginning of each chapter appealed to me. It turned out to be a great disappointment. Half-way through the book, as I was reading about Smith's financial difficulties, I have to admit that I thought,\\"Who cares?\\". The reason is not that William Smith or his life or his research are uninteresting, quite the contrary; it is the author's style that is stuffy. He writes in a way that makes it sound as if the whole subject bored him out of his mind, that he couldn't wait to be done with it, and threw in a lot of fancy words to make up for his own lack of enthusiasm.I love geology, and I wish that William Smith and the seminal research he did were shown in a better light. This book doesn't do justice to either of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that reads as slow as the plates move...","review":"This is perhaps the most poorly written book I have ever read. I purchased the book initially due to a review in Business Week magazine. While the map the covers the book is beautifully and deliberately created through hard work by William Smith, the content of the book was obviously rushed and unedited by the author. There is no excuse for 10 line sentences that ramble on with a half a dozen commas to become a paragraph. The text has no natural pattern and is painful to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Life as Geological in Time","review":"As an ardent student of geology and paleontology for over 50 years, this book was particularly fascinating. It is the story of the birth of a modern scientific standard, the geological map, brought about by the efforts of a man, William Smith. By today's standards, he was an 'amateur', but he literally created the standard through his observation and study and analysis and patience and struggle. The story is told as a walk through time, both geological time and the time of one person's life. In taking us on these journeys, the author is magnificently successful and this is a book worth reading many, many times. Simon Winchester is at his best in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winchester rules","review":"Of all of the journalists who tackle history Winchester is the best!

Thumbs up!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely uncritical, in colloquial british","review":"This extremely fannish book (he actually calls Smith his hero at one point) is a biography of William Smith, the man who developed the first Geological map (of Britain). It details his difficulties, many self-caused, and his many \\"uniquely positive\\" incidents. (Yes, that was contradictory). Additionally, the extreme political correctness of the author (as with most authors/academics, it seems) makes him constantly abashed at the class snobbery of early 19th century England. Well duh! You can't judge the actions of people divorced from their culture.It also leaves the impression that the map shows the geological layers beneath each point, whereas I think what it actually says is that the map only shows the rock types of the top layer - a far less amazing accomplishment.Written by a brit to an colloquial audience that knows the geography of Britain well, as an american I found at least a third of the book incomprehensible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Map that Changed the World","review":"If you like to read histories of the great age of scientific discovery, you'll enjoy this story of William Smith and his development of the world's first geology map. The bonus is the dustcover is actually a copy of his map."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where it all began","review":"The thought that at one time people believed that fossils were simply gifts from God hidden in the strata is truly mind-boggling to those of us sitting firmly in the 21st century. We take many things for granted in our science and technology filled world and Simon Winchester does a nice job of taking the reader back in time, creating the context and thought of that time, and then pulling you through the transition to a much more modern way of thinking.Following the saga of how William Smith used coal mining assays he was doing to piece together the fossil record is interesting history. Understanding the influence on 18th and 19th century thought is pure social context and commentary. The book makes one wonder how many other \\"strata maps\\" are laying around to change our paradigms and thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-O-R-I-N-G + Poorly Written = Avoid this book!","review":"The Professor and the Madman achieved literary excellence with a focused and lively narrative coupled with word economy. This book pales beside its predecessor ... tangential, verbose, unlively and appears not to have been proofed. For example, on p. 123 there is a sentence of 79 words diced-up with 6 commas which comprise an entire nonsensical paragraph. This is typical for the story line is repeatedly doused with dead prose and thoughtless writing. In summary, this book is B-O-O-R-I-N-G and poorly written. John McPhee's writing deteriorated with geologic essays ... will the same happen to Winchester?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating character study","review":"A year ago I'd never believe I would read, and with such pleasure, TWO books about surveyors.

Winchester is to be thanked. Why on earth did we not all know William Smith and his epoch-making geological map? I recommend this book. A good read, even (in fact especially) if like me you know nothing about geology!The second book is THE MEASURE OF ALL THINGS, by Ken Alder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and entertaining","review":"Simon Winchester has rather made a name for himself taking offbeat and obscure topics and making them accessible and entertaining for the casual reader and I think this may be one of his better books. I actually read this particular history a number of years ago (and I recall enjoying it) but I think I got more out of it in subsequent reads. The difference, I think, is that in the interim between the first and later reads I also read a lot of books about creationism, Darwinian evolutionary theory and the impact an influence of modern geological science on those areas. After reading about the religious uproar which occurred once the immense age of the earth and the form of its structure began to contradict certain long held beliefs it was very interesting to see how the whole fuss got started."},{"rating":"1","title":"factual errors","review":"This book made interesting reading and I would say it was well written. However, it only gets two stars because of the sloppy editing... if I'm not an expert and caught some errors on the first read, how many more are there that I didn't notice. For example, the author states that stromatolites and trilobites were extinct by the end of the Carboniferous Era. Well, in fact, it's pretty widely accepted that trilobites lived past the Carboniferous, and stromatolites still exist today. After reading the book, I found Stephen Jay Gould's review of it; he noticed not only substantial errors in natural history, but in the accounts of people's lives and motivations. There's no excuse for this kind of poor work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree w/ tediously repetitive hyperbole by previous reviewer","review":"Hearing of the release of this book, I was looking forward to reading it. After stuggling through it, I thought I had missed something until I read other reviewers. Didn't someone edit this book? Many of the reviewers are correct; it is not a well- written book on an interesting man. In fact, if you read the acknowledgments (page 317), it appears that the author has ripped off the good stuff from Professor Hugh Torrens who was writing on the same subject. Let's encouage the Professor to finish his works. Maybe that will give William Smith's memory a better turn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been shorter","review":"This book presents the interesting life of William Smith, who created the world's first geological map.The trouble is, William Smith's life is not >>very<< interesting and the material doesn't justify a full length book.

The same can be said of Simon Winchester's other OK book, the Professor and the Madman.If SW could write a few more of these interesting lives, keep them at say 10,000 words each, and publish them in a collection , then the resulting book would probably merit 4 stars. As it is, 2 will do ."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Map That Changed The World","review":"This book is very easy to put down.

Anyone with a minimal understanding of geology will stand shoulder to shoulder with the knowledge I have thus far gleened from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tediously repetitive hyperbole","review":"Reading between the lines, I would guess that the author was unable to unearth enough material to really make William Smith come to life, in a narrative sense. So instead he substituted continual breathless assertion of the brilliance and audacity of Smith's accomplishment as though leading a cheering section, and repeatedly related those aspects of Smith's history which he *did* possess, in slightly different format, over and over again throughout the book. In other words, what could've been a fascinating magazine article was instead inflated into an exceedingly dull book, with a muddled timeline and so much hyperbole that I have come to dislike William Smith.Pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just read the dust jacket","review":"This is a poorly written, pedantic book about an interesting subject. But it's not interesting in this writer's hands. You can save yourself the frustration of reading his writing by just reading the dust jacket - it sums it up quite nicely.

William Smith was a self-educated surveyor and canal digger who overcame tremendous obstacles to reveal the very foundations of modern geology. Winchester tells this fascinating tale of intellectual history in a wonderfully accessible manner, using clear and striking language to weave a compelling historical tale. The subject matter truly comes to life in Simon Winchester's skilled storytelling.If you like intellectual histories/biographies such as Lesley and Roy Adkin's \\"The Keys of Egypt,\\" Dana Sobel's \\"Longitude,\\" or Giles Milton's \\"Nathaniel's Nutmeg,\\" then give this book a try and I don't think you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I think Simon must have read the excellent book Longitude by Diva Sobel, and then tried to write one just like it. It is the unoriginal story of the poor scientist from humble beginnings, who doggedly goes against the Scientific establishment of the day and eventually wins.I was hoping for a book just like Longitude, and the back cover lead me to believe it was, when in fact it really isn't, as the story is twisted to make it more interesting. I was also hoping to get a little insight into geology, but not a chance as in this book the science is minimal at best.Finally I would have to agree with other reviewers that mentioned the book is poorly written, and you would expect a higher standard of English from a published author.If you want historical science read Longitude instead.Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this a best seller?","review":"Disappointing sums it up for me. If I wasn't interested in geology already I would be even more disappointed. The author could have done more with this interesting saga in the history of geology if he hadn't tried to blow it up into something more earth-shaking than it really was. I think his editors were asleep with all the repetitive foreshadowing and over-the-top declarations of at-the-time unappreciated genius. For a good geology read try John McPhee."},{"rating":"1","title":"pass on this title","review":"I had many hours of flying ahead of me and this was the wrong book to have taken. The fact that it was the only book I had gave me great incentive to like it. I didn't. I left it on the plane for someone more desperate than myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadly dull","review":"I'm sorry, but not even Simon Winchester's earnest enthusiasm and lyrical prose can save this tale. It's just too dull. I got through about halfway, and couldn't finish.Winchester is a glorious writer in his twin histories of the Oxford English Dictionary. But here his subject is just too obscure and trivial, and try as he might, Winchester can't make it seem interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars for print book but give Kindle book 1 for DRM use: DRM Fail!","review":"I do not buy Kindle books or use Kindle e-reader devices. Amazon's Kindle is a Swindle because of its DRM. Products like these intentionally use DRM to dumb users down and restrict fair use rights. Therefore they are defective by design. I understand the convenience of using e-books and having an e-book reader if your traveling you don't have to carry 10 or more heavy paperback or hardcover books but at least with printed books you own a copy of the book not a license to access which can be revoked as Amazon has already done by remotely deleting George Orwell's 1984 from Kindles. It doesn't matter that in the outrage they apologized for it the fact they have the technical capability to do so is troubling and wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some interesting stories from a French diplomat in revolutionary Russia","review":"This is an old book. I started reading it to get an understanding of what was happening on a personal level in Russia. The author was a French diplomat who was in the embassy in St. Petersburg. He details the stories of the revolt that toppled the monarchy, and then the revolution that toppled the provisional government. His perspectives are interesting, like the time he stated that he preferred Lenin to Kerensky. As the story goes on, he figures out the reds are not as decent as he thought they would be. They steal cars, help themselves to liquor, etc. He preference is for the old order, which collasped and died in WWI. He also prefers the Germans to the Reds, although in the end, the Reds survived the Civil War.I recommend this book, just for the interest and perspectives of a French diplomat trying to serve his country in a difficult environment. I am surprised there has not been a reprint of this interesting story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Half Off Store Price","review":"Ditto to everything in the first review. Local drug store (CVS, Rite Aid) prices are in the $12-14 range last I checked. Costco almost faked me out on price by having a different dosage and number of capsules than the usual amount and labelling it \\"Extra Strength.\\" When I got home and did the calculations the numbers didn't add up as I had expected. Turned out not to be the bargain I had expected for Costco. So the box went right back. And now I know to just stick with buying these in quantity to keep shipping prices down. And in Southern California figure 10% for sales tax. So buy five to ten bottles at a time. Same as store brand there is a lot of empty space in each bottle. So if you want to save space you can put the contents of about three bottles in one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speedo Solid Ultraback Moderate Fit w/shelf Bra","review":"Customer service was excellent.The item is high quality and it suit to my necessity"},{"rating":"2","title":"good basic suit","review":"nice coverage, comfortable fit. good, basic suit for exercise, not so much for sunning. but who does that any more?

So when I found the Mizerak Maple Billiard Cue on Amazon at a very fair price, I took a chance on it. I found it to be a high quality product, and it didn't cost me an arm and a leg. The finish is excellent and allows the stick to slide smoothly through my fingers. As another reviewer pointed out, the weight is 19 oz, though this fact doesn't appear in the description.Based on other reviews, I think there is some confusion about the nylon wrap. This consists of black nylon thread wrapped tightly around the stick in the grip area. It is present on my cue stick, and provides a fine grip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"I don't actually play pool much, but now that we have a pool table in our basement, I decided I needed one that would make my transition from amateur to slight better than amateur possible. I love this stick! I don't know much about pool sticks but I know that the grip is great, the the stick itself has a nice finish on it that makes it very easy to slide back and forth on. Very good price for a very good stick."},{"rating":"1","title":"packed no good","review":"the item was recieved used. it was unpackeged , and not redone. it had been used. but the main thing i wanted was a 16 oz cue ,it was a 19 oz . nowhere in your add did it say what weight it was . none of your cue give that important info."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revisionism intrudes on Reality","review":"While Cumings makes interesting points, especially on the early days of Korea, his discussion of modern history is way too revisionist. The ludicrous idea that the United States bares the brunt of the blame for the Korean War ignores both the US attempt to save as much of Korea as possible from Stalinism, as well as Stalin's secret endorsement of Kim's invasion BEFORE it happened (known because Soviet archives have been opened).,"},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong!","review":"The author must learn about Korean history or East Asian history more carefully. Before 19C, Japanese culture always have been influenced from Korean culture. And Koreans had regarded Japanese as a 'barbarian'. So to speak, Japan always had been inferior to Korea in terms of cultural and social aspects before 19C. This book is a result from serious misunderstand on East Asian history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muckraking at it's most selective.","review":"When you ignore all evidence from North Korean escapees about life in the country, NK isn't that bad of a place to live. Great Job, Cumings.That being said, his history of ancient Korea is engaging, and help explains NK's xenophobia. And his histories of SK and the Korean war are muckrakingly delicious.But his piss-poor (almost muck-free) chapter on NK undermines all that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series","review":"Aaron Elkins is a great writer and his Gideon Oliver series is the best.

It's fun to see the animals bob up and down as the van is pushed. The woman's voice who identifies the animals and the rest of the other phrases has a heavy English accent, which was a surprise, but it grows on you. Overall a nice toy that lights up, has movement, provides several means of entertainment/educational elements, and an on/off switch!

Its not great, but I enjoy it. There are a couple of tracks (\\"Dance,\\" \\"Shake That Ass\\") that are very plain, and I usually skip while listening to the CD.I originally heard of this band when they opened at a concert I attended. It was a festival with close to 25 bands, and they had a half hour set, opening on the stage for all the headliners. Even though I had never heard them, I was immediately impressed. Honestly, their set was better than most of the bands there that day. When I finally bought their CD when it came out, i recognized some of the tracks they played (\\"Prepare For The Fight,\\" \\"Set Me Free\\").Overall, this is a good CD, and something fun to listen to. Chances are, like another reviewer here said, if you like Prepare For The Fight, you'll probably like the rest of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"review from Synthesis","review":"I hate to be so harsh, but Times of Romance just isn't that great. It could just be me, because I've never really been a fan of the whole electronica, beat-heavy music trend. None of the tracks really seem to pull in my attention, they just all drone on with a slow, draining, futuristic sound. The band claims to address times of romance, but the only times that come to mind are the \`80s. It has the complete feel of a slower-paced techno record, with lyrics that rant about sex and materialistic nonsense. If you're feeling a soft spot for the past, get this album, throw on some leg warmers and let loose.- Robin BaciorSynthesis.net"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album!","review":"I saw this band perform at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco, and their album is as great as their performance.

Thank you Dirty Drummer!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a case of Eternal Torment","review":"This is what I get for not paying attention to the publisher of a book. Save your money. The book is filled with fallacies from cover to cover. This is not a scholarly work. If you are looking for a scholarly discussion of Universalism this is certainly not it.For example, the author cites various quotations from early church writers but provides no references, so there is no way to check the text and context of the citation.The author plays instant Greek scholar by citing a concordance, rather than standard lexigraphical works.

I've also given this book as a gift to grandparents, nieces, friends... it's illustrations are realistic and beautiful, the rhythm of the story is lovely and the message itself is exactly what you want a child to learn about the meaning of the holiday.I'm thankful that I discovered this book 5 years ago, and that it's become a part of how we celebrate Thanksgiving each year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Thanksgiving book for young children","review":"This book is an excellen choice for young children.

The words are simple, sweet, and make for a quick read, unless you want to peruse the pictures in more detail. It's very general in its story about being \\"thankful\\" for many things (though it makes me wonder, thankful to Whom?).

Why on earth would anyone take a picture of the National Giro Centre, Bootle, Preston Bus Station, numerous Forte motorway restaurants and the Bull Ring centre? Perhaps these buildings and roads were something to be proud of when they were built - a brave new post-war Britain. I can see the point of a few of them, but some are just mind-numbingly boring and just plain odd. The oddest, in fact, is Basingstoke. Three pictures in one postcard, all showing the same view of construction work on a pedestrian precinct.Ahhh - the pedestrian precinct!!

He does have a chapter of famous losers like Nick Leeson who broke an English bank and Robert Citron who bankrupted Orange County California.

But the movie was worth the watching for a general idea of the experience, and the rigors they faced. It is an adventure, survival movie, and not a chic flic, but a chic and her positive influence do enter into the movie. Read the book first if you have the time, then watch the movie.

This movie certainly has them - don't give it 5 stars because that should be reserved for truly great classics - this movie is very good but don't rise to greatness (the movie does drag a little in spots and the ending is a little too sentimental).If you need big bang, corny dialog, wooden acting, but HUGE special effects - please stay away from this movie.

The movie takes the viewer across miles of territory and starving and thirsty humans, their survival and eventually death and separation of the gang.

I was hoping to do away with my tape adapter, but the tape adapter, despite its wire and tape noise, is still better than this hissing transmitter...

The book is arranged so that the odd pages are in Chinese, and the facing (even) pages are the English translation. I can only read English, and although the translation is at times a little bit bizarre, it does not take away from the beauty of the story. Even though the Amazon title calls this \\"Love Stories\\" plural, it is a single story of a goddess-like being who falls in love with a human man.

But it does work! Every night I listen to this on my iPod and I fall asleep to it and every time I do I'm able to sleep better than I do without it.

Mr. Wild's music is one of my favorite \\"paint brushes\\" I use when creating images in my digital darkroom. His music is some of the finest material that I have ever listened to. In some wonderful way it provides the escape that I like to unlock doors and bring forth ideas. Very little music today has the ability to create images in the mind such as his. Wouldn't the world be a nicer place if only more people would take the time to listen to his music instead of listening to 24 hour news stories.

Ambience Minimus, Balance and Unity are masterworks. Sleep, however, is frankly boring. There is nothing new here, no real progression, and it seems like Chuck is coasting.

While I think that this recording mildly succeeds at creating a relaxing mood, as actual *music*, it's lacking. It's just a lot of chord progressions that don't go anywhere, unresolved phrasing, random structure, etc. I realize this sounds like music geek babble, but these are just ways of saying that, as music, it's pretty annoying to listen to. As another reviewer stated, it's not very relaxing to listen to droning tones. If you are effectively relaxed by what I would call \\"calming noise\\", then perhaps this would work for you. But if you're looking for something that sounds like logical, calming, relaxing *music\\", I'd recommend something like \\"Sleep Therapy\\" from SonicAid's."},{"rating":"2","title":"RAW format","review":"Thsi is a correction to Mitchell Small's review and his comment about the Olympus Master software and TIF files where he states \\"You can save the image as a JPG or TIF, but there is quality loss involved.\\"While he is correct about images saved in JPEG format losing quality, TIFF is a lossless format.

His initial releases were well arranged and produced just enough to leave a sharp edge. The sound of Kweder went through several stages before he released what I would call the first real Kweder LP: Flesh, Blood and Blue. I don't know anyone who would have thought the mark of this rockin' streetwise punky kid would be smartly arranged horn sections. The next album had an even more polished sound almost totally abandoning his sneering, finger throwing, angst-ridden stage persona. Indre Sessions pulls out some completely new versions of older originals and adaptations. Kweder solidly delivers, sincere and with conviction where before he had a solid sneer and seemed ready to be delivered a conviction.

But never listen to it.I confess that I have only listened to samples of the songs, but except for some of them (Imbue's \\"Gentle Art\\" comes to my mind, and is one reason for 2 stars rather than one), all tunes are totally rip-offs, no arrangements, no personality injected, no added value. Just basic covers.If you didn't know Faith No More before, then buy the original albums instead, or at list the greates hits if you're broke.If you know Faith No More already, you know what I'm talking about for sure.

Come to think of it, getting nailed on the head almost sounds like a better option than listening to this again. But one thing worth noting is the appearance of the band TUB RING on here. There's a slight FNM connection there in that they have been produced by Trey Spruance of Mr. Bungle/Secret Chiefs/insert the other million side projects here. Honestly, if I want to hear Bungle, I go for Bungle, not for some band trying to sound like Bungle like Tub Ring or those other boys, Dog Fashion Disco.

These bands purposely did excruciatingly bad covers of Faith No More songs in an attempt to goad the band into reforming, right? I mean, that HAS to be the reason for this, doesn't it? Why else would goth bands with DRUM MACHINES want to do songs previously recorded by master drummer Mike Bordin? Are these really the only bands in the world who wanted to pay tribute to Faith No More? To hear some of my absolute favorite FNM songs (Malpractice, Jizzlobber, Midlife Crisis, Digging The Grave, Surprise!

I would have to be suspicious as to whether or not any of these \\"bands\\" even exist, or if one guy with a keyboard sampler and an iMac got a few friends to sing into his computer. Each song sounds the same- cheesy techno beat, bad vocals that are poorly produced. The only difference is the voice. Please do not buy this, ever, for any price.

While recording with her bandmate Greg Ellis for Vas, her voice shined through with so much possibility but, alas, the music that backed her just lacked a certain something for me.Enter \\"Portals of Grace\\", and we have found it. This album is a bit more straight forward than anything from Lisa Gerrard, to whom Ali is often compared, but it is stunnng none the less. The stark backdrops of sound that surround Azam Ali on this record support her perfectly. I have to say that the second track, \\"La Serena\\" has got to be one of the most beautiful recordings I have heard. The deep orchestral arrangements and rolling percussions that enter the track as Ali begins her wail of despair.... Breathtaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK, but get a real deal instead.","review":"If Loreena McKennitt and other new age via medieval stylists are your cup- go for it.

I have listened to it over and over again and used some of its songs for guided meditation work. Her voice is incredible and, though I have enjoyed her other CDs--such as her work in Vas and her second solo CD--having this work based on European chants and songs makes the past of Europe come alive in a new and refreshing way.My favorite on the CD is \\"Breton Medley,\\" though the song \\"Inna-I-Malak\\" has a certain note on it that sends an absolute shiver down your spine. The only other female artist that can do that, in my experience, is Lisa Gerrard, but there is something even more special about the music that Azam Ali picks to work with.I sincerely hope that she will choose to release another CD someday with a European focus."},{"rating":"2","title":"trying hard","review":"It took a lot of guts to make this CD, surveying as it does such a large geographical range of historically remote Medieval traditions. I like the results: logical but ethereal, and respecting both learning and yearning. Contrary to at least one of the other reviewers, I think the backing arrangements are just fine, contributing positively to the overall effect. Alas, there is just one problem: I don't think Azam Ali's voice is, strictly from a technical point of view, *quite* up to the challenge. But for this, this might have been a sensational CD, but as it is it is merely a good one. P.S.: Azam, I have always loved the way you play hammered dulcimer--might we hear more of this in the future, please??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Side to Oral Roberts' Ministry","review":"Patti writes openly about the stresses and realities of being a part of the Oral Roberts family and ministry.

I'm glad she and her daughters have moved on(both her daughters are grown and have children of their own).

A temporary marriage is socially akin to an illicit affair.When a man takes a second wife, he hides it.

It was getting to the point were we would go days without speaking because I hit the snooze alarm too many times. I never thought I would buy a DVD as a source of help for our troubles, but I took a gamble on this one. I was pleasantly surprised. I loved hearing the advice and stories from the couples that have been married for 50 years or more. Not only did it make me feel better, it has also improved my marriage. I still have to wake up 3 hours earlier than my husband, but now we can talk about our troubles in a more proactive way. There are so many heartfelt stories and useful strategies throughout the DVD that you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"My dog is actually the one taking the Zeel tablets for hip problems.

After being under Tramadol and Rimadyl for a couple of months and seeing no real relief from her pain, we took her to a vet that practices holistic approaches. Before trying acupuncture and chiropractic treatments, we decided to go with Zeel and Dasuquin with MSM. We still haven't gotten her off the Tramadol and Rimadyl, but the relief from the pain has been truly amazing after taking the Zeel. She's now able to get up from a resting position with ease, we see no more limping, and she's even running and playing again. Thank you Zeel and thank you Livamed and Amazon for offering this product at a much more affordable rate!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zeel didn't work. Try curcumin instead.","review":"I would give Zeel a zero because it didn't work at all for me. The review here doesn't allow me to put zero, so I had to select one star. Zeel didn't relieve pain at all, but I only used it once in awhile. I don't know if you have to keep using it to get the benefit. In all fairness, Voltaren didn't work either. Curcumin worked pretty well. I take a product that has 80mg each of curcumin, boswella, green tea, and CMO. I take two. My mom said tumeric works for her. I buy something called Re-Lev-It. If that name gets removed, just look up the ingredients I mentioned or at least try curcumin or tumeric.

Mary Twitty has a very folksy writing style, but what bothered me more was that at the end of each chapter I said to myself \\"who cares\\". I found little in the way of new hiking ideas, hiking guidance or hiking inspiration in any of the chapters. For inspiration on the Appalachain Trail, I much prefered the books by Ross, Berger or Setzer. As far as a diary of the hike, I find many of the internet on-line thru-hiker diaries better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Evil","review":"I read this book several years ago. The first thing I must say is that \\"facts\\" as depicted, if this book is by any means true, should get support from specific, traceable external documentation and copious notes. Though it does make a few references to New York Times articles from the 1980s (which I admit I have not verified), those are all Terry uses to directly substantiate his claims. A book of this scope having not so much as an index leaves too much for this critically thinking mind to question. TUE is a fantastic read, but that alone offers no credibility. Detectives who investigated the Son of Sam case have debunked any grand link between Berkowitz and alleged occult affiliations, but of course, I hear people saying, \\"The cops want to prevent panic!\\" Is Terry's account true? I do not know. I am, however, very skeptical."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love It!! hmmm... where can I rate this 25,000 stars...?","review":"I would recommend this to everyone!

There certainly are much more appreciated songs than that, and it certainly isn't one of their best. I wish they had \\"Red Is The Rose\\" with Finbar Wright singing in it instead of John Mcdermott for once. Maybe they'll have that on their next album they're working on!

I found Placher's chapter most helpful, followed by Brueggemann, with Blount in a distant third.All of the authors seem to believe that the Bible is unique and authoritative. This strikes me as a rather odd conclusion considering these authors find many things in Scripture to be culturally bound and therefore no longer relevant for the church today. One is left wondering how any major doctrine of the Christian faith can survive. Is it not possible that \\"backward\\" disciples desperately desired a God-figure and so divinized Jesus to meet that need? I think that is a ludicrous position, but I don't know how these authors could argue against it given their assumptions about the captivity of the Bible to all kinds of cultural bias."},{"rating":"2","title":"No More Lies","review":"I first started experiencing hair loss at 28 yrs old and I wish this book had been around sooner.

The source of the information is special.

The associate passed his information on to two independent journalists, who presented it to the editor of Share International Magazine for publication. In this book these teachings are brought together edited by Benjamin Creme. It is simple and deep at the same time. Central is the art of Self-realisation that can be practiced by the three practices honesty of mind, sincerity of spirit and detachment. Furthermore, through comments on the political, economic en social happenings of that time, Maitreya shows the working of the great Law of Cause and Effect.

Well Dan, I already bought the book and wasted enough money. And I'm looking for my refund...Don't even get me started on the crappily edited CD-Rom that came with it.

This book is the written version of going to see a career councelor.I read this book in 3 days after receiving it, and wish that I had ordered it a month earlier, before signing a 1 year contract for a job I don't really like. Now I have a full year before I can implement the guidance given by Dan Miller and find work that I really love to do.We all know ourselves, but most of us don't take the time to truly analyze ourselves and develop goals.

Because it helped me realize who I am and what I like to do. Yes, it's common sense, but Dan Miller brakes it up for you and makes it easy to see.Also this book gave me ideas.

It's a good thing for motivation and goal setting. Many of his techniques will work for many people, but not for others. I'm not a \\"hard sell\\" person, and will have to adapt some of his principles to fit my personality and methods.

While I thought the book was somewhat motivational and gave some useful ideas, it did not really deliver what perhaps I was expecting. My job search took a little over 48 days and I cannot say that I referred to the ook everyday during the search.I believe that while it may be good for some who are geared to some occupations and have some particular skill sets, it is not for all. So, while I am sure it has sold many books, partially due to Mr. Ramsey's recommendation, it is clearly not the panacea that one might be searching for. You still must find a job based on what you have done in the past and convince a new employer that you can make him money. Or you must start your own business based on your abilities and desires.

As other reviewers have pointed out, this is just an endless string of quotes and stories. Half way through the book I found a reference to a site that sounded like it might be some sort of a form to define your interests.

So, I took the 48 Days Career Profile the author notes in his book. After spending the money for the personality profile, stupidly, it offered no greater insights and looked like the same type of personality evaluation you'd get from the high-school guidance counselor. In fact I think the one I had in high school was more relative and penetrating. My opinion is that the book is purposely ambiguous and fluffy so that you do purchase more of the author's products."},{"rating":"2","title":"48 Days to the Work You Love Tops in My Book","review":"48 Days to the Work You Love goes beyond the usual variations on the same job search formula to the heart of the reason to seek a vocation, not just another job.After a recent lay-off, when I needed inspiration and motivation as well as up-to-date advice on resumes and interviews, Dan Miller's encouraging words were just what the doctor ordered.I plan to order several copies for high school and college graduation gifts and can confidently recommend 48 Days to friends and family who, for whatever reason, find themselves at career crossroads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest dinosaur lamp ever!","review":"There aren't a lot of dinosaur lamps out there to choose from, but this one is the neatest by far!!

In this book page after page is wasted on photos of extreme closeups of parts of horses: the extreme closeup of an eye, the tip of a nose, the end of a flying mane. Not just a few of them, but literally half the pictures in the book look that way. Very artsy, I am sure, but not what I wanted. There are only a tiny handful of really beautiful horse photos, of the quality I have seen in his ealier books. This is not a good book for a lover of horse photography.

Obviously nobody expects brilliant direction or camera work from a Wishman film, but her habit of focusing on something inane like a lamp while two people are talking gets irritating after a while, even if youre watching it because its bad.

Then I went for Hodgson's solo's. After only a second play I got hooked on nearly every track from \\"Open the Door\\" and \\"In the Eye of the Storm\\", but I was stunned at how different \\"Hai Hai\\" is. Except for \\"Land Ho\\" which is an old Supertramp single that never made an album, the best way I can describe this album is bubble gum music - and I don't mean that affectionately. Yes, Hodgson experimented with his sound, but it was a bad experiment. I play Supertramp for soothing relaxation and to put me in a wonderful mood - this is teeny booper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at Best","review":"I'm sorry, but this project does nothing for me.

The opening tune is smoking after its neo-Buddhist opening. That and \\"Jin-Go-La-Ba\\" are likely the two most danceable efforts. It is also great to hear \\"Gypsy Woman;\\" people always sing along with the chorus when this disc plays. \\"Choose\\" is not a terribly strong song, but props for having the great (and often under-rated) Bobby Womack sing lead . Other stellar guests include Vernon Reid, Alphonso Johnson on bass, and Wayne Shorter on saxes (Soweto.) I refuse to believe I am the only one who enjoys hearing a version of \\"Who's That Lady\\" which confronts the original and Ernie Isley's bad self on guitar. \\"Full Moon\\" and \\"Peace On Earth/Mother Earth/Third Stone\\" display guitar work which stand well with other efforts by Carlos. Once again, I think this is an overlooked gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Carlos Solo Effort","review":"This is the worst Carlos Santana sol effort. THe songs sound lame and are kinda poppy.

Shifting seamlessly from humor to drama, from reality to the imagination and back, the movie is a stylish, compelling and very intelligent work of a sophisticated and remarkable filmmaker. There are not many films that explore the quiet desperation of a family's crisis (or should I say any relationship's crisis) with such honesty, poignancy, and subtlety. Alan Rudolph masterfully explores the mysterious connection between two people, the ability to deal with its possible loss, and the secret longings in all of us.Campbell Scott is very impressive as an introvert Dr. David Hurst. He does not say much in the film but we feel all emotions he goes through - love, fear to lose it, anger, desperation, depression, and confusion. Hope Davis, Dennis Leary and three young girls all gave great performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"You should read the novella instead!","review":"This boring, rambling movie (with two of my favorite actors, Campbell and Davis) was a waste of my time. I loved Smiley's novella, \\"The Age of Grief\\" but this movie had an entirely different flavor and feeling.I thought that the characters were one-dimensional and were never developed enough for me to care about them or what happened to them. What was the point/plot? Oh, yeah....a guy afraid to confront the problems in his marriage....And I found the Dennis Leary character to be distracting and ridiculous.I was tired of the couple about 20 minutes into the movie, and it never got any better for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning, Authentic","review":"This film is a GREAT MOVIE...

In my opinion, this film was a real waste of my time and money.I didn't care what happened to any of the characters, who ranged from criminally annoying (the youngest daughter) to terminally boring (the Campbell Scott character). Same goes for story. I mean, what was the point of all the sturm und drang? I went because I've seen both Scott and Leary turn in some really fine performances.

Sweet's cover may look \\"professional\\" but they are downright ugly and is a sacrilege to the series. These drawings at least look like they were done by a fan who tried. The book also includes quite a bit of background information that simply couldn't be inferred from the series. At the very least, you have to admit it put to rest a lot of wild speculation. All in all, this is a must have for the fans who simply have to know everything and for those who notice every little discrepancy, well, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gods green Earth","review":"What on Gods green Earth would have R.J. approve of such horrible art work? I am not convinced in the least, that the artist/s even read the WoT series. To qualify myself, I am an avid fan of RJ's work and have read the entire series 4 times now, I am sure I now know what the characters are supposed to look like. Within the covers of this illustrated guide, is perhaps the worst depiction of character resemblance I have ever SEEN!!! It turns my stomach. As an example, Lanfear is described in the series repeatedly as possibly one of the most beautiful women ever... In the Guide, she looks like a pigs behind!! Due to the poor quality of the art, I find it very difficult to even read the contents. I guess I will just have to keep waiting for Path of Daggers!! If you want to see excellant drawings based on the the Wheel of Time series, I suggest checking out the work of Richard Boye and/or Dragonluv on the web... at least they read the series. -Kinslayer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Greatest","review":"I must say I would have been fine waiting a little longer for the 8th book rather than having to get this as a Wheel of Time fix.

Though there was info I was happy to read about, the writing style left a lot to be desired. i just gave up and haven't finished reading it, it's not worth anymore time to me.

I first browsed through it on the day it was release (yes, that is how excited I was to get my hands on it) and words can not express my disappointment. The artwork is terrible and the text is neither fresh nor revealing. I decided to come back at a later date to look at the book again (just in case my disappointment was just part of a letdown from waiting so long for it to be published). Alas, the book really is awful and is a sorry representation of such a fine series. If Tor or Mr. Jordan were hoping to use the book as a marketing tool to entice new readers to start the WoT series I am afraid they have failed miserabley. I own the entire series in hard cover- first editions but, I choose to act as if this particular book was never published. I expected more from Mr. Jordan. I hope his next book - \\"A Path of Daggers\\" is not as disappointing as this one was."},{"rating":"1","title":"ttog@mucho.ca","review":"I read this book thoroughly, and it discusted me. I think the Robert Jordan series of the Wheel of Time is the best series I've ever read. This book, on the other hand is full of useless facts, bad artwork, and nearly set me off the entire series. I'd advise you not to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a Travesty","review":"I have rarely seen such a wonderful idea go so wrong. The fact that a guidebook to the WoT world was needed was undeniable. But usually when an author is still alive it is possible to put together a book that actually contains more information in it than the books it is ment to describe. What we got, is something like the many weaker Tolkien world guides which just repeat what was in the books. The WoT guide lacked any analysis, a decent picture, or even a well designed structure. The book looks like it was the work of one morning. The only things that interested me was the older maps, and some of this history. If you are thinking about this book, DONT. Hop online and read the newsgroups, you'll get a deeper analaysis, and even better pictures!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I could cry in frustration","review":"I just can't understand why they can't use artwork that is accurate with what is in the books. Is it so hard? For almost fifty dollars things like artword and spelling do matter, and well, they should.

Horrible horrible horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOT - Waste of Time","review":"I do not think that I have ever had my expectations so high only to have them crushed this badly. I consider everything about the first 7 wheel of time books to be nothing less than excellent. Then I finally see this new WOT book on the shelf.......I was really excited...........until I opened it up. I flipped through it - thank god - before buying it. Of course, just like most people in the review previously stated, I put it back. It was HORRIBLE! I expected to see some of the really beautiful women that are described in RJ's books. But the only thing that I found was a bunch of lizards........that is really the only way that I can describe them. Not to mention most small children have better spelling and punctuation.

Yet another way for me to satisfy my Jordan obsession. I eagerly stood by bookstores as they hauled in those pristine white editions (some bound in plastic!) and shivered as finally were set down on the shelves, waiting to be sold.Then I opened the book.Okay, I'm being a little hard on the artist. I understand that it is a little difficult to meet some of the grand expectations that WOT fans have. And I do admit that many of the background sketches/paintings were really nice. However, many of the character sketches were indeed 'amateurish' (as some other reviewer had noted). It is disturbing when you see your favorite character looking like some kind of horse or ogre (especially if your fav chars are not Bela or Loial). In short, if more care was given in selecting an artist, the WoT Illustrated Guide would be greatly improved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't judge a book by its cover artist","review":"I have read the entire series so far, and have never been disapointed in the content of his books. He provides a rich and animated world of calibur not seen since Tolkien's famous works. This is not your average rehash of dwarves and elves, or any other fantasy epic. Well, there is a prophesy spoiler, given in the first book. This in my opinion spoils the ending of the book series, leaving the reader with a soap opera style epic. For fantasy readers looking for something new and original, this is it.As for the artwork, well, I usually put post-it notes covering them up. Since my time in art school, looking at pathetic artwork sends shooting pains behind my eyeballs."},{"rating":"1","title":"perfect for the younger readers","review":"I found this book incredibly helpful, considering I need all the help I can get reading Jordan's works.

Sadly, it gave neither decent artwork nor anything other than information already available by simply reading the novels. A disappointment in every respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not overly usefull and could spoil things for new readers","review":"While I truly enjoy the WoT books, I have to say this was a \\"Show me the money\\" book by TOR. The information in the book was primarlily a rehash of things readers discover or can infer through reading the series. In other words, for those that have read the complete series up to the date of this book there was not a whole lot of new information. For those that are just starting the WoT series, this book could spoil a lot of the suprises. I also have to admit that I thought the art was terrible and question wheter the artist even read the series.On the plus side, the Guide provides a handy reference for hard core WoT fans. It also provides a number of maps that the books have lacked.I would suggest buying this only after you have completed reading the series up to book 8 and have read the short story in \\"Legends.\\" This is a good reference book to have if your re-reading the series or just trying to pass the time until the next book is out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated References, but for huge fans it is a nice book to have","review":"I ordered this after I finally finished the series. I read previous reviews stating how the material dates itself (this was published about halfway through and certainly reads like it), but if you are not quite ready to let go of the series this is a nice read. Keep in mind, this is almost literally a reference book, so story telling isn't its strength. But I did enjoy just learning more about the history of the World that I spent 15 years in."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was great!","review":"Well, I really can't understand why all of you people are so dang picky. I've just started the series and this book is a Godsend, it helps me in everyway possible. A few typographical errors? Reading all of your reviews I've found about 15. No one is perfect, no one will ever be perfect, don't expect it. The pictures were fine, all you people are going crazy because someones eyes are supposed to be blue, but in the pictures they are blue green! Big Whoop!

There were numerous typos, and only little tidbits added on to what most WOT fans already know. And some of those pictures scare me! Lan was startling, to be polite, and when I saw that picture of Loial I almost screamed in horror! I thought that the person who was illustrating would have the characters at least SOMETHING like what I imagined. Guess not! When I first saw this book, I thought it was going to be great because of the very good summary of The Age of Legends, but then when I bought the book I saw that there was hardly anything that I didn't know already. This book is only good for people who haven't read The Eye of the World. I NEVER say anything bad about RJ's books, but this one really let down my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible artwork ruins what could have been great","review":"The artwork is, unfortunately, on par with the covers of the series. I never understood why Jordan and TOR couldn't get better art for the covers. And then when this book came out I was so incredibly disappointed to see the paintings and such were basically as bad as the covers of the series. No, they are actually worse. Nothing takes you out of a fantasy world more quickly when it looks fake or, frankly, just bad.Hopefully those overseeing the Wheel of Time series after Jordan's death can get some better artists involved.For instance, the art work in George R.R. Martin's Art of A Song of Ice and Fire book is a great example of the quality of art that Jordan's series deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extreamely helpful with explaining confusing history","review":"This book was extreamely helpful in explaining the complex history of The Wheel of Time. However, the artwork is poorly done. For example Egwene looks like she should be one of the Forsaken, and Lan like an ax murderer! It makes you wonder wether the artist ever read the books.(Though the maps are very well done.) Good for anyone who's confused on the history, If you ignore most of the artwork."},{"rating":"2","title":"not the greatest pics, but some really interesting info.","review":"A must have, for any devoted WoT fan, there is info in this book that you can find nowhere else, especially information from the Age of Legends and the Seanchan section... I don't wanna spoil it for you.. But some of the other info seems to be copied directly from the glossaries of the books. The pictures were ok, but some of them seemed a bit amateur. Also, I have seen great 2d, and 3d pics created by fans out there, that would have made this book a lot better... though i wonder why that didn't happen... But nevertheless a good reference and source of information."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for the Wheel of Time fans","review":"The World Of Robert Jordan is a great book detailing the history and peoples of \\"Randland\\" From the Age of Legends to Artur Hawkwing a must for any fan of the Wheel of time. The Book seems to be written from the time of the books, without getting too involved with Characters, but does hint at them. The only drawback is the portraits, which seem to fall short of the characters, but that's to be expected in such a fantasy epic. A great compainon to the Wheel of Time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The artwork absolutely ruins this book","review":"I can't believe I bought this book. The artwork is SO bad, that I can't even open the book just to read it. Did they hire a 3-year-old to do the art? What was Robert Jordan thinking???I've seen better looking artwork at the bottom of a toilet bowl!This review was only meant to cover the pictures in the book and not the written word...If you could get over the bad art, and you're a huge Jordan fan, you might like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Book of Bad Art","review":"This is known by fans as the big book of bad art for a reason. Its a big book and its full of bad art. A few snippets about the world that won't really influence events is ok, but the drawings are not accurate, and not well done. There's fan art out there that is a lot, lot LOT better than this, free for viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Big Thank You to Amazon","review":"I wish to thank Amazon for helping \\"the readers\\" decide by printing real readers reviews. I will not buy this book because of what I have read. Michael Jordan should be ashamed of himself to try to capitalize more money on this series, especially when he hasn't FINISHED the series for publication or hint of date of the finale.. Authors, take heed, we readers will take note on this type of fluff. We tire of the delays many authors exhibit. We may hesitate on any future \\"series\\" as a result. Again thank you to Amazon for printing the good and the bad. I hope authors take note and begin to respect us \\"the readers\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive and incomplete","review":"I was a big RJ fan until the money starting rushing instead of trickling out of my pocket for a continuing decline of quality. The Guide was one of the worst wastes of money I have been guilty of-and without any pleasure. The Guide only expands a bit on information that is already available in the series or can be extrapolated easily. I read that there will be another guide at the end of the series(if that ever happens). If you are thinking about getting this-wait. Get the true *complete* Guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference, but artwork...","review":"The info in this book is great! Details on the Age of Legends, Artur Hawking, Shara, Seancean, and the Sea Folk, among other things. One complaint: the artist's rendering of the characters portraits is horrible. For instance, they made Elayne a brunnette when she is actually blonde. Also, They all look basically the same. It makes me question whther the artist really read the book. But besides that, this is a great reference to those interested in the background of the WoT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good info, not good art","review":"There is a lot of original information here, on the mysterious land of Shara, for instance. If you like the complexity of the Wheel of Time series, you will like seeing the summarized information from the series too. The art work does not capture the personality of the characters, and sometimes it does not even reveal what sex they are very clearly. The characters described as most beautiful or handsome come off looking no better than those described as looking average. The faces have no expressions, so that there is little to distinguish one drawing from another. The maps are informative, and they are much better than trying to draw them out for yourself using hints from the series. Only for a die-hard Robert Jordan fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointingly low quality","review":"I have read all of the books currently avaliable in the Wheel of Time and, although - sometimes - Jordan's writing is not brilliant, it is a whole lot better than this. The style of writing adopted for the book is rather simple, as if the people who were to read it would not have already read most of the series (unlikely, I think). The information about the Age of Legends was new and interesting, but almost everything after was just taken striaght from the books, with no new insights added. The artwork was of fairly naff quality, and apparently the aritist did not bother to read the books: Verin's hair is supposed to have grey streaks, amongst other things. All in all, this was of a very poor quality and - since they'll probably write another one at the end of the series - I'm extremly pleased I made my Dad pay for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read through it first. Do not buy it first.","review":"This book is extremely disappointing, in a word. I'm a loyal (and somewhat obsessed) reader of the Wheel of Time series, and I pre-ordered this book as it looked really good. When I got it...well. While the information contained in the book is a good reference for someone as obsessed as myself, the artwork really, really brings the book down. The characters look like they have some kind of deformity (Loial with his head smashed in, Lan having some sort of nose problem) and it's in a style I, personally, do not like. To its credit, the book has some interesting information on the Age of Legends, etc, but please, read this at a local bookshop and see if you can get past the artwork. If you can, then go ahead and buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you taken by the Dragon?!","review":"I was honestly hoping for a source of information perhaps like that in Tolkien's The Silmarillian, and the accompanying encyclopedia. There was not art but a map of the old Earth, but it wasn't needed. Without spoiling the atmosphere, it perfectly added to the mythos of the Lord of the Rings. Instead I flipped it open to be horrified by the \\"portraits\\" within. Verin is ageless only due to the lack of detail, and Aviendha...? Reminds me of the lizard she spitted to show Rand. The sheer number of contradictions and typos is a quick turn-off, especially contradictory pieces within the book! Now that I've suitably bashed it, I ought to bring up the guide's good points. There is quite a bit of new information relating to Shara, Seanchan, the AoL, and the Forsaken. Overall, this book probably makes par... Par, however, won't win world championships any time soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting for book 8","review":"I really must add my voice to this only because I am a loyal fan who was very disappointed that this book was published. I only flipped through the book before I ran away in fear. I must say that we as loyal fans should not be dogging out Mr. Jordan. After all, we really don't know whether or not he just put his name on it or if he did have something to do with this travesty. Loyal fans stay away from this book and please urge Mr. Jordan to finish book 8 and the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"it can't get much worse","review":"As a WOT fan, I have always been used to the high standards that Mr. Jordan has kept up throughout his series. I was sadly disappointed by this book. The sheer lack of proper punctuation and spelling shows this book was thrown together hastily and in a ramshackle manner. Artwork is not impressive at all and colors are not consistent with the WOT book's descriptions. Your hard-earned money should be spent on something else. You are better off to figure it out yourself, leaving in the true element, fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"I am a fan of Jordans, the Wheel of Time series is a rollicking good read. This is not. Fortunately I decided to look through it, before parting with my hard-earned.My overall impression is of a pot-boiler, cobbled together in a hurry, to cash in while we readers drum our figurative fingers, waiting for the next book from Jordan's busy pen.The text is sketchy, the graphics are decidedly amateurish, and the content is slim.My considered opinion is that this is a fanzine with pretensions of being a coffee table ornament.Don't buy it, borrow somebody else's."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book Was OK","review":"I know that to a lot of you this was a disappointment but I liked it. I will admit, most of the information was just the stuff from the books in the series, but I think it was good, because when I got confused about something in the WoT books I could just flip to a page in this book, instead of searching through the pages in the other books. The Artwork was not as good as I thought it should be (kind of like the artwork in The Dragonlover's guide to Pern) but I think the information was worth it. I thought that the section on the Sea Folk and The Seanchan and the Shara was very good, it had great information. This book was worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, Very BAD art.","review":"I found the art work in this book to be very poor. The novels describe scenery and characters in such vivid detail, that I was insulted by the high school art class illustrations. The information in the book is quite good but after seeing the art I put it down and doubt I will pick it up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but artwork lacking.","review":"The book is very well done and an excellent compliment to the series. It helps clarify the history of the world and expands in many cases, such as one of my favorite sections on the Seanchan.However, the artwork is rather poor. Not all of the pictures well match the descriptions. I suppose if you want to see good artwork of the series you should look into the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately disappointing...","review":"Having read all of the Wheel of Time books (so far) I,like any other fan, love to imagine the world of the books in my head and I was very excited when I heard this book existed. Alas, it wasn't what I hoped it would be. Although it was imaginative and it clarified many of the points in the books in the end it just felt like the authors were writing this book with one hand tied behind their backs. They had no idea how the series was going to turn out so they had to write a very limited view of Randworld. In my opinion they should've waited until the end of the series to write this book. And yes, my god, they should've gotten a better artist. The drawings look like they were done by seven year olds. The faces are ugly, the bodies are out of proportion and the colors are dull and lifeless. Is it so hard to find good artists? Get Barlowe. Then we would have a guide worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Jordan's World - The Wheel Of Time","review":"A insightful overview of the kingdoms, people and creatures that you encounter during the series. I've only now discovered the series and found the book helpful in explaining some of the situations and characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of Time and Money","review":"I never thought I would say it, but this has \\"Sell Out\\" written all over it. I like many other Fools saw this book and bought it without hesitation. However, I will not make the same mistake again. Once I saw the so called picture of Loial, I calmly put the book down, hid it in the back of my bookshelf, and tried to pretend that I didn't waste almost 40 dollars on this garbage. I expect a masterpeice in book 8. And it had better offer some resolution that book 7 certainly did not offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book really helped to explain the way their world works.","review":"The book has great graphics and the explaination and past events help readers to better understand what has and will happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Hate","review":"I hate Robert Jordan simply because when he writes a book I have to read it in 1 day usually and then I have to wait for the next one to come along. He is the best by far. I just wish he would write faster you know......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wheel Of Time","review":"Artwork has nothing to do with the book. I create all the picturs in my mind anyway. If I want to buy a book for pictures I'll buy a comic book. This book however was great. In the large elaborate world of this series a guide is almost a necessity. I know it takes from some of the intrigue of the book. But there are so many characters that directly relate to the plot that I think some of the facts covered in this book will never see print in the series. I highly recommend this to all true fans. I have read the series almost as many times as there are book in the series. Maybe even more. I am unsure. But I still like the information presented here. Artwork is never as good as the pictures in my head anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"This may have been a good buy when it first came out . . .","review":"Widely reffered to on WoT (Wheel of Time) webpages, including \\"official\\" webpages, as the BBA (Book of Bad Art) this book (with the release of several more volumes of the WoT series) has become incredibly dated. It is nice to have some of this information in a readily indexed format, though.If you don't already have it, don't buy it unless you are a WoT fanatic, purchasing every WoT item that you can lay your hands on.

But at its current price, it's really not worth it. Biggest problem is that the whole book is in BLACK AND WHITE! Except for a few specific pages. If you know anything about films then you'll understand why this is a problem. Also, they often don't even define the terms they use in the book. They just use them in a sentence and expect you to figure it out on your own. If I didn't need this book for class I'd return it.

First off, she looks great -- trim and defined at the age of 50(!). Second, she sounds incredible and her band does too -- delivering as much heat and energy off of songs like Hell Is For Children and Promises In The Dark as they did 25 years ago. The only difference is that she now delivers her anthems with a nod to how fun they are to belt rather than taking them too seriously. The flaws? The concert looks as if it were staged just for the production of this video (so it feels somehow less live and spontaneous) and the occasional new song (Out of the Ruins) is just not my cuppa.

He is a brilliantly constructed ravenous half-orc hero. He is always hungry and will eat almost anything, including giant arachnid legs, because, as he says, \`food helps Nergal think'. McCloskey shows us inside this creature's mind, as he joins a band of human adventurers to eliminate a compelling series of obstacles. Nergal possesses brute force and a simpleton's brain, which made me chuckle often. He is also very acquisitive, and whenever he finds something and can pocket it for himself he does. We see things from his naive perspective, and so his journey and the ending have a specific developmental focus. And Kantru, the main villain of the piece shares features with Frankenstein. But you will have to read on to see what I mean!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine fantasies can have improbable heros!","review":"\\"Slave of Chu Kutall\\" is a witty, action-packed story that twists the conventions of fantasy until the notion of a heroic orc seems quite plausible. The story arc follows the unlikely evolution of the main character, culminating in the Noble Orc as savior, guardian, rescuer, and hero, while to his own nature staying true. Nergal can be as duplicitous and cantankerous as any of his cronies, yet serendipitous events conspire to make him the Forrest Gump of orcs, always in the right place at the right time. Like Forrest, he uses his limited \\"smarts\\" very effectively, traveling with an idealistic and sometimes naive band of heros who are all-too-eager to demonstrate their open-minded acceptance of their odd companion. Nergal is slowly enlightened by their example, yet the simple charm of his uncomplicated nature stays consistent to the very last line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I was in for quite a shock when I bought this as I was subjected to one of the poorest written books ever published. I kid you not. It is an uninspired story of tired overused characters in a cliche world. It fails miserably to entertain.The first problem is McCloskey's prose. He writes with a total lack of imagination. Every paragraph seems to drag on, and go no where.The next problem is the dialog. It is simply poorly written. Who talks like that?

I would not recommend this game for at least several months to see if UBI get all the bugs fixed.

It's so rare to find a gay movie lately without gratuitous male nudity or a totally sex-driven plot. In Make the Yuletide Gay, that's exactly what you get - a story that puts the physical aside and focuses on the emotional journey of two boys who love each other, as one of them deals with coming out to his parents and the other deals with being shunned by his. Great performances, silly puns and a deep message make this movie a must see!

I seemed like a stereotypical tale of a very out gay man who's closeted to his parents. However, the more I watched, the more I actually started to buy into the plot. The young protagonist tries too hard to appear straight, his boyfriend grudgingly goes along, and his parents appear so oblivious to the obvious: the boy doesn't like girls. By halfway in the movie, I was curled up beside my boyfriend, engrossed in the mother's several \\"you betcha's\\" and the double entendres spoken in each scene.Overall, it's a cute film and best enjoyed in the company of many people with a sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"It's about time they made a gay movie that isn't all about trying to find someone to sleep with!!!

Seeing it had won awards, I had high hopes it might be a good story with good production value. Well, surprise!

The ONLY saving grace was the fact the boys you see on the DVD cover are both cute (though I'm pretty sure one is straight, playing gay) and their acting abilities fair. Do NOT buy this film.

I will not rehash the plot which is covered in detail by a number of other reviews. My mistake was purchasing this DVD for my collection. It is painful to watch. The characters are not believable. The chemistry between the gay boyfriends is very weak. The protagonist's mother punctuates most every one of her lines with a nauseating laugh/ giggle that may be cute the first or second time but quickly grated on this viewer not unlike the sound of fingernails being dragged across a chalk board. Near the end of the film the reaction of parents to their son coming out is so absurd it lowers the film to rock bottom. For those of you unfortunate enough to suffer through viewing this trainwreck I will not reveal any of the \\"surprises\\" it contains. However, your time might be better spent viewing \\"Ishtar\\" or George Lucas' \\"Howard The Duck\\" both considered among the worst films of the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Great Quality brand new and wrapped.

The premise wasn't that original, but it was not boring, and it was it entertaining. And if a movie can be entertaining, it met one of the main requirements. This isn't the greatest movie ever made, but it's a fun gay Xmas movie.The parents are hoot with their mock Minnesotan and Wisconsinite accents, and there are some fun scenes.

Stephen Blake who served in the English army does a bank heist with his Irish pal Tommy and IRA sniper Stapleton. The botched attempt sends Blake packing to New York City, and then west to Las Vegas and Tucson. Extreme violence and hard living are the currency in the modern noir (and sometimes real) world. The whacko Dade addicted to Tammy Wynette and dope is sure to become a classic villain like Hannibal Lecter. Fans of George Pelecanos and Bruce Springsteen should enjoy reading Mr. Bruen's seamless, satiric, and, yes, unsettling American Skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you like Tarantino or Guy Ritchie films?","review":"Then you are going to love American Skin. Normally I would recommend an author by saying read this if you like DeMilles work or something, but this is a cinematic novel. Hell, if they make it into a film, Bruen has already created the soundtrack with his constant musical references. I have not read any books by Bruen previously. I was drawn to this book by the subject matter, and I am not sure that I would enjoy his books set in Ireland quite as much. He is a master at creating colorful characters though. When he gets into a lot of the Irish political references I unfortunately get a little lost. That is like calling myself stupid, I know. I think I have to go back and reread Trinity. Not that the book wasn't revealing concerning Irish culture and not that I did not enjoy the scenes there. But I have to admit that I enjoyed the passages that took place in the states a bit more. Nonetheless I almost gave this 5 stars. It was a fun and very quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice nasty crime thriller","review":"If you like your crime novels Irish and rough, this is one to go for.

Maybe.But when I see things like this in novels I wonder how much time and effort was really put into them by the author, the editor and the publisher.I've read all of Bruen's stuff and there seems to be a precipitous downhill slide.

Procter & Gamble's Febreze Air Effects Citrus is an odor eliminator, it removes all of the bad odors & they don't come back. I found that the Citrus works like a Vinegar spray without the harshness. It is very good at eliminating odors against both litter box residue & my Uncle's stinky Cigars. Febreze also has a variety of sprays to remove Allergens & breakdown pet odors that can linger on fabrics.Anyone who has had a Terrier{yes I love dogs too!} come in from the rain that got away from them before you can dry them off & they land on your sofa will know what I mean.

Ban and Ginji go through some hard times for very little money, but Ginji's power to use electricity with his body and Ban's \\"evil eye\\" make things a little easier. There are some sad moments, especially when the old bum who gave them a serious job dies.The reason I didn't give the book 5 stars is because I'm a girl, and I don't necessarily enjoy the LARGE breasts of more than half the girls in the manga. There are also so parts that involve the groping of said girls from the bad guys. So if you really dont' like sort of thing, plus mild female nudity (meaning half covered) then you might want to reconsider.

I ended up liking Elvis more than ever after reading this hilarious book. I think Goldman's treatment of the Colonel as the Carny was right on the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not entirely accurate.","review":"This book tries to drive home the fact Elvis committed suicide. He was supposed to have \\"saved up\\" his \\"attacks\\", as he called them, of sleeping pills and demerol injections. He then alledgedly took three doses on an empty stomach and expired. People who know Elvis insist he would not have done this because of his love for Lisa Marie. Granted, his death coincided with the release of the book entitled \\"Elvis, What Happened\\", written by members of the \\"Memphis Mafia\\". Also, there was no note left by Elvis... something very hard to believe would have been omitted had he taken his own life. For the true Elvis fan, a definite waste of time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Elvis book: Typical Goldman trash.","review":"The late Albert Goldman first established himself as the king of trash bios with his conjecture-ridden, wholly inaccurate Elvis biography in 1982. He later retained that title with his stupid and unfactual John Lennon bio (in which he accused Lennon of murder!). This new book about Elvis carries on the tradition. This book takes incredible liberties with facts and completely downgrades the person of Elvis as a cultural icon. The stuffy and elitist Goldman mocks Presley as a fat, no-talent, drug drenched, Southern redneck good ole boy and falls just barely short of labeling all Presley fans as dupes and fools. A complete waste of money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Treat for the Eyes","review":"These are some of the best photographs you will find anywhere of the wild places of America.

They did an excellent job of researching the era that most of the music is released. Where I got confused is during the <?> mid-to-late 80s. Like the scene where they go to the dance club with Kyle M who plays the randy professor. I think they would have synth-pop playing other than Depeche Mode \\"I Just Can't ..\\" This song is from 1981-82. I assumed that it was a few years later.

The book is a bit dated (as other readers have noted,Anafranil is now available in the U.S.),but still an essential reading for every victim with OCD (no matter how severe the symptons). The book only costs $6.99,so even if it doesn't help you (I highly doubt this),it's not like you wasted $20. Other compelling OCD books are Getting Control by Lee Baer,and Brain Lock by Jeffrey Schwartz. As a final note:Good luck OCD victims on your recovery."},{"rating":"2","title":"The author was a pioneer in the study of OCD","review":"Some of the other reviews down this book, saying it is out of date, but it was written in the 1980's. Dr. Rapoport brought relief to millions suffering from OCD. I did not find it depressing at all. She worked with both children and adults. The stories from the patients are both helpful and fascinating. At the time there was only one drug approved for OCD. And she introduced it to millions suffering. Prozac was mentioned in her book but it was not approved for OCD at the time of her publishing.If you read later books on OCD, Ms. Rapoport is mentioned and is quoted in about 80% of them! She was the first to write a book just about OCD. It was extremely helpful! She had stories about actual patients of hers and the agony they and their families had gone through until the drug Anafranil was approved by the FDA.Yes, it is now outdated.

As is true with many prayers that are offered by Christians, the prayers in this book seem to be written as an excuse to sermonize and teach the reader, rather than to earnestly communicate with God. I thought that they were very poorly written.Of course, it is extremely difficult to write prayers for others to read and pray. Prayer is such a personal exercise, that this concept of written prayers almost always seems stilted and forced. The exception to this reality are prayers that come from the Bible, like the Lord's prayer.In any case, I did not find this book to be very helpful.

We ordered 4, and when they arrived, one was already non-functional. The design is absurd- the \\"hook\\" you see in the picture is supposed to allow you to hang it on the edge of an aquarium, bucket, etc. but it is also supposed to lock the lid/battery compartment closed. Fat chance. Hanging it by the hook means the lid will open at the worst possible time, dunking you batteries in water (i.e. DEAD) and none of ours have recovered, even with new batteries.

One thing I did like on the unit was the \\"Beep\\" to let you know you had a message and that you didn't have to acutally go to the machine to find out that you had no messages.

It is nearly impossible to record a custom announcement message that callers can understand, and recorded messages left by callers are often garbled and also difficult to understand.The real problem for us is that when a phone call is answered from an extension phone while the answering machine is either performing it's announcement, or receiving a caller's message, this answering machine won't shut off. Having to ask the caller to hold on (If they can understand you over the garbled noise of the recorded announcement, while you run to the answering machine to turn it off is a real pain... especially when you can't turn it off in such a situation.

I took it home and hooked it up. Recorded our greeting, played it back - sounded like I was in some kind of cave or underwater - very echo-y.

After 1 week, my son has attempted to wear out the door getting in and out. If I would let him sleep in it, he would. He is almost 19 months old.

He returns to his native Detroit, a frequent setting for his novels, for this one. The plot need not be revealed here lest it be spoiled for a prospective reader.

He ha not slowed down as the years have passed.Mr. paradise is another truley magnetic group of unusual characters whose dialog sounds as if it came from off the streets of Detroit. The homicde cops seem real not cut out of cardboard and glamorized.I highly recommend this book and anything else written by the master."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate To Say This","review":"Pound for pound, I think Elmore Leonard is one of the best writers living. He doesn't always write great books, but the reading of them is a joy. That said--this one, I am sorry to say, is a wet fuse. It simply lacks everything I read him for. But after so many good books, even he should be allowed a dud. Don't start with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Read","review":"I've read a number of Elmore Leonard novels, and I would classify myself as a fan. Unfortunately, this novel just doesn't live up to the standard of fine fiction that he has created over the years. While most of Leonard's novels are short, I found myself constantly checking to see how many pages were left in the book, a rarity with his novels. The characters were unlikeable, and the plot twists were convoluted. Pass up on this novel and concentrate on some of his better novels, such as Maximum Bob or Rum Punch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping and eye-opening! I loved it!","review":"As a medical technologist, this book had special meaning to me. Hogan does a great job of exploring both major personalities in the novel, while at the same time showing a decent understanding of the viral world and medical technology. It catches you up in the evolution of this killer virus which displays its own personality throughout the novel and really becomes a character in and of itself. It is interesting to imagine when those of us in medicine/science will have to leave our labs and take more militant action in defending the human race. Hogan does a great job of portraying that...it kept me up many a night!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book delivers the goods!","review":"I cannot say enough (good) about this book! Not only does it \\"deliver the goods\\" in terms of adrenaline and suspense, but it has poetic language and uncommonly lovable characters. There's plenty of scientific, thought-provoking discussion, too. The book makes no bones about the fact that humanity is really straining its leash in terms of invading the environment. Also: I LOVE Dr. Peter Maryk! He does for the needle what Jimi Hendrix did for the guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"New fan of Chuck Hogan . . . .","review":"I've just started reading Mr. Hogan's novels and I like what I have read so far. This is the third book to read after Prince of Thieves and Killer Moon and have also read the novels \\"The Strain\\" and \\"The Fall\\" with Guillermo del Toro. Awesome books and I recommend them to anyone. Looking forward to reading the rest of his books and to books coming out soon! I am definitely a fan of his!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain scary","review":"In Hogan's future world, overuse have rendered anti-biotics completely ineffective and blood becomes sacred. Could never happen? Don't bet on it. The pace is fast, the characters are very well drawn and you are hooked from word one. The future Hogan describes is completely believable. Don't start this one at bedtime unless you are prepared to see the sun come up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great thrilling read","review":"This book caught me by surprise, I honestly enjoyed this book. Had twist and turns and was enjoyable to read. I would recommend this book to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible, logistically flawed, but worth finishing","review":"Curiously, I work at the CDC in Building 6, room 156, which would put me directly across from the room the two good (?) doctors from this tome inhabit. Not surprisingly, the resemblance between the two buildings is marginal.Although there are plot twists aplenty, and even given likely technological advances between now and the future setting for this novel, most of the scientific underpinnings for this book are implausible. Viewed in the context of science (or speculative) fiction, the book semi-succeeds. As a heads-up for future dire bioterroristic possibilities, it fails. Miserably.The characters are poorly developed, there are plot disconnects everywhere (e.g., even on-command military transport could not get these people where they were supposed to go in the timeframes noted).I really hoped for a lot more from this book. For a much more persuasive read, try The Eleventh Plague, by John S. Marr."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOORing!!","review":"What a waste of time; I am glad I checked this out at the library rather thasn buying it. The characters are cardboard...never feel that you know about them or care what happens to them. I like good science fiction and good medical suspense thrillers, but this wasn't one of them. A \\"human virus\\"....please!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely the worst book... total waste of time.","review":"The best thing about the book is probably the cover. The story starts out ok but has the worst ending ever. Hogan has the two opposing doctors/scientists, after they get infected with the virus, turn into monsters (or whatever you want to call them) and basically fist-fight it out. Come on... that might be ok for a comic book, and is something I may have liked as a kid, but for a novel for adults, it's terrible.Absolutely the worst book I have ever read.Instead, read \\"The Hot Zone\\" by Richard Preston. Much much better... and it's nonfiction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of reading time","review":"Horrible. Just plain horrible. A little hard to follow. No characters that I really cared about. Hyper unrealistic actions and motives. It was a waste of my precious and limited reading time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upton Sinclair's The Flivver King","review":"Upton Sinclair has given the reader a general overview of what life was like in Michigan when Henry Ford revolutionized the world with his invention of the automobile. Sinclair does this through following Abner Shutt from child to old age and his involvement with Henry Ford. Shutt is totally sold on the ideals and ethics of Henry Ford, but does this last? The Shutt family is consumed in the Ford machine, and every daily action revolves around Ford, the man and the machine. This book is very well written, and lets the reader view history as though he or she were living at the time with the Shutt family."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine and helpful introduction to Mark's structure and narrative!","review":"Veteran Dutch scholar Bas van Iersel has provided a fine introduction for readers of Mark's Gospel. His analysis of Mark's overall structure is oft-quoted, and I find it persuasive, even though, like many others, I am not always convinced by his attempts to find similar concentric structure within various sections.Van Iersel has obviously given years of attention to Mark, and this work is full of helpful observations on and about it, that beginners and scholars alike will find helpful. He expanded the work in his laterMark (Academic Paperback), which is much longer and more technical. I have yet to read the whole.Again, this is a fine, accessible, and enormously helpful introduction to Mark as narrative, from a real 'Dutch master.' Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of good information in this book","review":"This is a strong, well written book full of good news for those who are grieving over the loss of a loved one, but toward the end of the book, she got a little too mystical for me. However, that represented maybe 7-8 pages. The rest of the book is a solid treasure.It is also a book for the living, in that she expresses in very clear language, our reason for being. There's a lot of spirituality in this little book and it is a quick read. I found it very helpful and it reminded me that Life is all about love, nothing more, nothing less.I'd recommend reading it a time or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"On Life After Death\\" is captivating, comforting","review":"Elisabeth Kubler-Ross relates her lessons learned at the bedsides of of literally hundreds of dying people in her touching book, \\"On Life After Death.\\" This pioneer in the study of death and dying shares first-hand stories that simultaneously chill and comfort. Kubler-Ross makes it clear that none of us -- even if we die in the midst of the desert -- dies alone. She shows how we are greeted by loved ones who preceded us in death (even if by moments). I frequently give this comforting work to bereaved friends whose grief is tempered by Kubler-Ross'powerful words. I can't seem to keep a copy on hand -- they all go to those who need its message of hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Support at A Difficult Time","review":"I found the essays very comforting when faced with the death of a beloved family member. Believing, if not knowing, that \\"you don't die alone\\", that it's only sad for those left behind, that practicing Unconditional Love is the reason for our existence makes the death experience less frightening. After reading this I can more fully celebrate her life rather than mourn her death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast reading with no nonsense...","review":"This book is best described as the Generic book on Life After death. It cuts out the details of -if death happened like this then you will be recieved like that. It is the basis the foundation for all the other books on this topic. It would be a good book to start out with if you are just beginning to read on this subject or it would be a good in-betweener to absorb other things you have read previously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close, But No Cigar","review":"In this extremely brief book consisting of four separate essays, Kubler-Ross talks about her meeting with a deceased person (this almost made me put the book down thinking that she was nuts! ), the process of grieving over parents, personal growth and her own mystical experience and near death experience. The book is interesting, but suffers from an extreme bias. It is not dispassionate at all and she seems to wish to push her opinions on others. She claims to have collected over 20,000 NDE reports, but all of her evidence is anecdotal and cannot be backed up. Still, she insists that \\"there is no death\\" and uses this as part of her life's philosophy. She may have greater justification than other people for this, but I can't help but thinking that her arguments are a bit weak. The most interesting part of the book was her account of some very odd experiences which she herself had. A nice addition to the literature of near death studies, but I was not much impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, unknown singer","review":"We know her in NYC, but apparently the record companies don't.

It's great to have a book that helps you find good snorkeling spots, and it includes good information for getting to each location. However, I found I used the book \\"Maui Revealed\\" much more for information as to which locations to visit. While this book provided what for me was an informative second opinion, I think some of the information is vague or even inaccurate. The other book pinpointed more clearly the spots in each location that were best, and I agreed more with its evaluations as to the quality of the sites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best snorkeling book for Maui","review":"I stumbled across this book at the Maui Aquarium.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent guide","review":"This book is a great value for the plethora of info it provides. The directions and maps and advice seem very accurate, and you can tell these authors love to snorkel. Their snorkel book for the Big Island is also excellent. There is a little inconsistency in their \\"ratings\\" (eg, \\"good\\" vs \\"excellent\\")for the same snorkel sites in various parts of the book, but that is okay with me, given that conditions can change wildly from day to day anyway. A terrific addition to the travel bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Great book, had all the information I could ask for... we snorkled every day at different locations as described in the book.

Some of the sites were wonderful and off the beaten path.(None of the other books or the dive shops had ALL of this information.) Well worth the small investment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great guide","review":"This book will guide you to a lot of hidden places that are well worth the trip.

The only thing that prevents me from giving it 5 stars is that some of the maps contain small inaccuracies. Nothing that you can't figure out when you're there, but a little disconcerting. Still, an extremely helpful book. If you like snorkeling, and are going to Maui, you need this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete","review":"I thought this was a good guide to snorkeling on Maui until I got to Maui and my brother had \\"Maui Revealed.\\" Maui Revealed is a guidebook that is not limited to snorkeling, but surprisingly, its coverage of snorkeling sites is much more complete than Snorkel Maui.

Highly recommended if you're planning a snorkeling trip to Hawaii."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not found yet","review":"When the writer of a book on the greatest sporting celebrity since Muhammed Ali is a bit of a celebrity himself, there's a clash of egos. The problem with this book is that Tom Callahan, author of In Search of Tiger does not find Tiger Woods at all. Tom finds Tiger's father and a tiny part of his mother, and he does find other players (quite a lot of them) but this book reveals little about Woods himself. There is no question that Tom Callahan is an excellent writer who knows the sports industry intimately. Anyone who loves the sport of golf will probably enjoy this book. It is an easy and worthwhile read. But for anyone looking to reveal the mystique behind Tiger Woods, this book dissapoints."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess!","review":"This is NOT a book about Tiger Woods! It's nothing but a collection of bits and pieces about golf and golfers throughout history. It might be interesting to golf fans, but I was looking for Tiger, not every other golfer on green earth.

Thanks for nothing, Callahan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for basic and intermediate repairs and maintenance","review":"I had an 1989 Eagle Summit which was the equivalent of the Mitsubishi Mirage, and this book covered the general maintenance and the small couple of repairs I did on my own. I'm not sure how useful it would be if I needed to do something major, but it's got a ton of pictures and tells you exactly what tools you need for each job. My only beef is that it covers 5 different models through 10 model years but only has photos of 1988 models and parts. Usually I didn't need a photo of what I was working on because the text description was enough, but I would look for the manufacturer's manual if you need to do something major."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read, good descriptions","review":"Easy and light, so a good choice if that's what you're in the mood for. The text is in short sections, sometimes only a quarter of a page, which makes it easy to stop and start but hard to keep track of the action, which skitters around, as do the characters.The setting--the English country estate of minor aristocracy in the mid-1960s--is interesting and sounds mostly accurate, though I wonder if English fathers and teenage daughters really discussed extramarital sex casually and openly in those days. A turn-off for me was the reminder of how that class, at that time, indulged in extreme cruelty to animals. (It's not in every scene, of course.)All in all, the journey was a bit bumpy but quite fun, and I never considered abandoning the book.

For the first time I heard rembetico songs in 1993, in a open-roof taverna near Naphpaktos (Greece) and it was unforgettable. Now the music that we know as rembetico is very popular among large audience but it was born in 19-century in ports, in hashish dens and in prisons. It reflects the sadness and the cynicism of the time, but also much more complex feelings. I really like the lyrical song Vlamissa, which is a slang word for a girlfriend (who is also a tough chick and a sort of comrade in the underground) and which comes from Albanian word for blood sister, I believe. It's really touching. It is also nice to hear the encouragement remarks from the musicians to each other during the record: Yia sou, Stellaki mou!

It is astounding to realize that kind of information was the purpose of the investigation to begin with. These pages are full of smut and non-important information. It should be rated. Clearly Starr was hired to slander the president not just bring justice to the highest office in the land. The lying is the only pertinent information necessary in this report.

It is so burdened with irrelevant, gratutitous, graphic and salacious descriptions of sexual encounters based solely on Monica Lewinsky's grand jury testimony (under the blanket of full immunity for her past prejury, etc.) that only one conclusion is possible: its purpose is to damage President Clinton. Starr should be ashamed, as should the House of Representatives for putting this material on the Internet where young children could read all of the sexual allegations in graphic detail.

It starts out very juicy with some questions answered. However, after about 40 pages of the accounting of Lewinsky performing oral sex and Clinton fondaling her breasts, the whole report gets old. The testimony selected is very sparce and coming from very limited sources that only told the story the OIC wanted to come out. Most of the stories told barring Lewinsky's testimony would be easy to pick apart on a cross-examination by any attorney that has passed the bar. His chosing to believe only the people that coraborated his view of the events might just be Kenny Starr's critical error and his accusations don't even pass the giggle test on substanciality.

Arguably the single most influential individual in music in the 20th century, as he had his hands on the faders of so many GREAT recordings of truly inspired artists. This documentary boils down the essence of his career to a fine syrup of love, respect, and admiration that all the artists, engineers, and producers felt for this largely unknown giant of the recording industry.

This is an endearing examination of an affable, 70-something whiz kid. And the next time a drunken lout holds a lighter in the air and yells \\"Freebird!\\", blame Tom Dowd.

Dowd was a highly intelligent audio engineer and innovator, as well as a renowned producer later on in his career. Atlantic records cut some of the greatest music ever, and Dowd was there every step of the way. He was also the unsung hero of bands that rank among my favorites--Cream, the Allman Brothers, and Lynyrd Skynyrd. Any fan of this music owes it to themselves to rent or buy this DVD. It's quite interesting, and plenty of the musical artist heavyweights for whom Dowd performed his services weigh in with their own insights and stories about this legendary music industry figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Dowd was amazing","review":"I have this on VHS and it tells the great life of Tom Dowd.

It was definitely more entertaining than Daredevil. There wasn't much substance to the storyline or the dialogue, but there were a few cool scenes - plus, it was fast paced enough not to really bore me. Maybe I wasn't as disappointed as some other reviewers because I never read the comic books or because I didn't expect much.

If you like ninjas, assassins and comic book characters you will love this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this","review":"But, try as I might, I can't buy Jennifer Garner in the lead role. She's simply not tough enough to be the least bit credible as an international assassin. She's neither athletic, nor much of a fighter, two qualities essential for an action star in this kind of role. Between the way the film is shot and her lack of moves, she comes off more as a model than an actor in this role. She was better in Daredevil... what happenned? There are a few nice moments here and there (mostly with the Hand), but there is not a particularly compelling script here to rescue the performance of the lead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elektra - Not even close as good as Daredevil","review":"I just watched this dvd and I have to say I wasn't too impressed by it. Although, I really enjoy Alias and think Jennifer Garner is a great actress in her own right, there wasn't much to this movie to really show her true talents as an actress. There wasn't a plot to this movie at all and there were so many flashbacks, it makes for confusion the whole way through. The action scenes were hardly entertaining and leave you wanting to see more. Daredevil was a far better movie and I think they should have brought some of that movie into this, even if it just meant her remembering ben affleck's character. All it showed was her childhood and nothing concerning that part of her life in daredevil. It didn't really make a lot of reference to her coming back from the dead either.....I think this movie should never come out with a sequel. Too bad for Jennifer Garner....maybe there will be a Daredevil sequel and Elektra could come back then."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a great movie!","review":"I read the negative reviews here on Amazon, but I ordered Elektra anyway. The main reason I ordered it was because I am a huge fan of gorgeous Goran Visnjik, but when I watched the movie, I was really impressed. It was exciting, well acted, and it wasn't your typical action movie. I loved the way the story ended, and it was awesome having the main character as a strong female."},{"rating":"1","title":"a childish waste of time","review":"No.I'm not going to spend too much time on this. All I've got to say is, who's ever idea it was to to come up with that little twist for Abbie needs to be terminated. Her little secret was one of the most poorly done twists I've seen in a movie. It wouldn't have been as bad had she not done that little pose, because that's what sent it over the top. The instant that moment manifested itself on screen, I instantaneously lost an additional 10 IQ points as my brain processed what my eyes were seeing. I felt embarrassed to be a human being at that moment in time.Whoever gave this movie 5 stars, well, good luck with everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Jennifer Garner but not this movie","review":"Jennifer Garner can play a superhero conviningly - just watch Alias. However, writing is so important and this movie was flat out bad. Poor script and not engaging to watch.Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preposterous Action Scenes","review":"I like Garner and think she's an appealing actress, and I liked her in Daredevil, but in this movie the action scenes are so weak and unbelievable. She is supposed to be a great fighter, but we hardly see anything, it's just implied that she is able to get past an army of ninjas or armed thugs. Then the battles with the superpowered guys are even more absurd, because any one of them could end the fight in a second. The story?.. not much there, there's a young girl who is supposed to be a good fighter so she protects her, and something about her learning from a blind teacher. Not as bad as Catwoman though."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a MISS !!!!!!","review":"What a shame what a miss,The special effects were mildy entertaining, the fight scenes lacking, in addition they tried to make Jennifer into a dark moody/broody kick butt woman.

The red sheet sequence is totally spectacular! Although it starts out a little slow, and some things are not explained, (who are these bad, weird people after her, anyway?), the film has a lot of martial arts action. Jennifer trained hard for this film I read somewhere, and she looks fantastic in action! Although her character is a little quirky, Jennifer's acting is quite good.This is a must-have for any super-hero - or heroine - fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE COMIC BOOK MOVIE OF THE YEAR!","review":"Frank Miller's legendary heroine explodes onto the screen with spectacular action and a surprising pathos.

It was made as a longer running \\"R\\" rated movie, but FOX then edited down the original movie into this shorter, tamer, and less entertaining version. It's okay, but it left a lot of us less than thrilled.Where is the director's cut FOX? Give us the real movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jennifer Garner Looks Hot","review":"And.... that's the best thing about this movie. Jennifer Garner, who I love to watch kicking butt in Alias, looks really sexy and fierce as the mega-butt-kicking Elektra. Other than that, the story is too full of flashbacks (which are not informative if you have not seen the ultra-lame DareDevil) and has plot holes you can drive a truck through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone wake me when it's over","review":"I remember the previews for this movie and they seemed very action packed. I put off seing it at the theater and rented it instead. Boy am I glad I did. I thought the movie just dragged along and had no plot. I'm not a big fan of action movies, but there wasn't even enough action in it for me.

Good flick glad I finally bought it, goes with the daredevil I own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to watch...","review":"This Movie was atrocious! I love bad movies but this one was a real stinker. Jennifer Garner was miscast in the Daredevil movie and certainly did not warrant her own spin-off film."},{"rating":"1","title":"ELECTRA?? COME ON YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING!?","review":"First off the fact that this movie got made before an Iron-Man, Thor,Captain American and The Avengers, and the list goes on movies is ridiculous!I thought Daredevil was good, it could have been better,but I was fairly happy with the end result. I bought the director's cut ,but have not gotten around to watching it yet.I have heard it is much better than the original. OK now back to Electra. This movie is boring, stupid, poorly acted and.....do I need to continue? They should have worked on Daredevil 2 instead of this piece of garbage! Unless your a completest Marvel movie nut,avoid this one at all cost!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining plagurism on the big screen. . .","review":"Seriously, I said plagurism. Why? Well the Hand's special forces seem to be a direct rip off of the Eight Devils of Kimon from the classic anime film \\"Ninja Scroll.\\" A demon with skin of rock, a demon with living tatoos and a woman with a poison kiss...hmmmm. . . . identical.You can also delve deeper: Kimaguri (closest I'll get to spelling it right) in Elektra is an art that allows its masters to bring the dead to life. Sounds a lot like the reincarnation skill that Lord Genma possessed as well.But, that all being said, this movie is as good as a movie that could have been done after the Daredevil fiasco. Personally I had more fun picking out the Ninja Scroll similarities than actually watching the film. Definetly a renter not a keeper.Since when did Elektra have OCD in the comics? I grew up on Daredevil and have no recollection of this quirk! Am I wrong?"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun!","review":"Elektra is well worth a look. Garner is HOT and this movie definitely entertains.

Much better than some say it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Elektra\\" should have been released straight to video","review":"I was looking forward to see \\"Elektra\\" on DVD since I missed it in theaters, so I rented it today and I am glad I resisted purchasing this one. Jennifer Garner looks good and all (hence the 2 stars instead of 1), but even that can't save the lame story, dialogue, and special effects. This is truly one of the worst comic book adaptations ever and shares that spot with Halle Berry's \\"Catwoman\\". If you want to see an extremely great comic book film, go out and witness the masterpiece \\"Sin City\\" which I have already seen twice. That film is worth your time and money, so pass on Elektra.

The opening scene builds her up to be this super assassin that is unstoppable, this later proves to be fraudulant. She stinks. They say in the beginning that she whispers in the ears of all her victims....well she doesn't when she's about to assissinate the dude and that anoying chick by plugging them with a crossbow. It's like they spent all the effort on the first 10 minutes and called it a day. The fights seems are kinda meh. It ends all stupid and luvy duvy. I do kinda like the way that the hand ninjas(is that a parody of the foot?)turn into poison gas when they die. I wish I did that, that would rule. Don't see this movie because just like daredevil and ben affleck....it sucks real bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elektra shortcircuits","review":"This is the worst superhero film I have ever seen. Remember how promising the character Elektra seemed in Daredevil? Well, forget it. Jennifer Garner is lucky to have survived this boring, illogical mess. Can someone tell me how Elektra manages to set off a natural gas explosion inside a house without burning the entire house down? And then there is the climactic battle between Elektra and the evil ninja in a room full of flapping sheets to disguise the action or lack thereof. Forget this one. It makes Halle Berry's Catwoman look like Citizen Kane."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT SUCKED!!!!","review":"I am now more than ever fully convinced that many of the people who post reviews on this site are shills working for the movie studios. How else to explain glowing reviews for unmitigated dreck like Envy, National Lampoon's Dorm Daze, and other garbage? True to form, several people have already posted a positive review of Elektra. I love comic books. I have loved comic books for almost thirty years. It pains me to see bad comic book movies because I know these movies contribute to negative public perception of comic books. Elektra was a bad comic book movie. I feel bad for Jennifer Garner. She demonstrated a lot of enthusiasm for the character and was not shy about telling interviewers about how she enjoyed reading the Elektra comics. But this movie is plain awful. The story plods along with very little action. It is just plain boring. I saw this movie with three fellow comic book fans and we were all bitterly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed heroine in a classic tale of good and evil","review":"The main reason I watched this movie was because Jennifer Garner was in it.Jennifer Garner does not disappoint with her multifaceted portrayal of the emotionally scarred Elektra. During the movie we see tiny snippets of her past - a past that caused her to end up using her powers as a hit woman. She ruthlessly carries out hits until she is ordered to kill a single father and his 14 year old daughter. Instead she becomes their protector.I think the only thing that made this movie watchable was Jennifer Garner's portayal of Elektra. It made an otherwise dull action film, more multi-dimential. We see her character heal and grow and that is ultimately the satisfying part of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad comic book movie..","review":"A horrible movie altogether ranking down there with Catwoman! Its a shame a talented actress like Gardner attached herself to this awfully written predictable piece of crap.Can you guess what happens when an assassin is assigned to camp out on an island who's only other occupants are a widower and his smart ass daughter? And after these two defend the assasin.....guess what her assignment is that she feels forced to turn down is?!?!?!!Not horrible as it is not only nothing like the comic book character but the plot is worse than a bad Laverne and Shirley episode!

I will reconsider doing this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Director's Cut, just as bad as the Regular Cut","review":"I was hoping for more with the \\"Director's Cut\\" then just commentary and extra scenes. the Daredevil \\"Director's Cut\\" was 30 minutes longer and the changes , back to the directors original, made the movie better. as for Elektra, it just didn't do that well as a spin-off.The director makes the action scenes unexciting and just a collection of poor CGI, meanwhile using music in a hamfisted attempt to make the audience have any emotional attachment with the product. Even die-hard Garner fans will struggle to enjoy this dog....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"Of course, there isn't much deptto this film, but I'm sure itwas designed to be just a fun actionthriller. In that respect, thismovie is a solid winner.Jennifer Garner is wonderful asElektra. Some of the fight sequenceslook a little stiff, but overall,she does great. I love the use ofcolor in this movie and there aresome very interesting charactersalong for display.This film is highly recommendablefor a good time. Enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sucked so bad","review":"All she did was run from the evil assasins, and there should have been no way she could defeat them with the way the movie portrayed her, but of course she does.

How in the world could that defeat the supernatural and superbly trained assasins? Give me a break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the trailer","review":"When I heard this movie was coming out, I was stoked. Then I saw the trailer, and I thought, \\"Man, that looks as bad as Catwoman.\\" So I didn't go see it. I rented it this week, and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. It was much better than Daredevil. More character-driven. And Jennifer Garner did a fantastic job with the fighting. I enjoyed it as much as Alias, much more than Daredevil, and as much as any other martial arts movie I can think of off the top of my head. If you like action movies, this is a good one. And the tattoo guy, that seemed so silly in the trailer? It actually works really well in the context of the film. I'm going to buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystic. Supernatural. Suspenseful. Beautiful.","review":"I liked Elektra for its intrigue, action, martial-arts motif, and, yes, the acting. Maybe I'm just soft on Jennifer Garner. She portrays her characters so well and with such a great heart, she elicits sympathy and support. You really, really want her to win every fight. And she does!In comparison with recent comic book films, Elektra is not quite as good as Spidey 2 but much better than Daredevil. I didn't miss Ben Affleck a bit. The film is on par with Xmen 2. In fact, the viewer will recognize very similar handling of both special effects and special \\"super\\" powers of the villains: Stone, Typhoid Mary, and Tattoo, courtesy, I suppose, of the same director for both films.Jennifer Garner is a heart-winner. She is beautiful, talented, and winsome. And so sweet. I must admit, playing a cold-blooded assasin like Elektra is a bit of a stretch for her- even her solid acting skills can't cover up that great heart and sweet spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elektra","review":"I saw this at the theater and just watched it on DVD.

But as it ran with superhero speed from the movie theatre to rental status, I began to wonder. Unfortunately, I was right. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Yes, Jennifer Garner looked spectacular, but she sort of wandered through the film with a glazed look, probably wondering when the real script was going to show up. The \\"bad guys\\" where cliche, and some of them seemed straight out of X-Men and Spiderman. I am usually a Marvel fan, but honestly, I'm hoping that DC will bring us a really good Wonder Woman movie to redeem woman superheroes. Come on, guys, you can write better than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrated My #$$","review":"This is awful! The film, in its orignal form, was a disappointment to its predecessor Daredevil as well as the Elektra Comics. I was actually suprised, but this is actually the same movie, I saw no deleted secens, nor any Unrated material (which can be expected, or lack there of). I assumed that while not actually being sexy and violent, it would have a luke-warm new scene, but NO! A waste if you already have Elektra!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Consideraly better than I Expected! \\"Must Have!\\"","review":"I went into theaters with my standards pretty low for Elektra, but to my suprise, i came out of the teathers substatinally satisfied.

I liked daredevil and i enjoyed the different marvel films but electra really disspointed me. It was short on a real plot and didn't really make anything interseting. It seemed to me that they really could have made it more appealing like what the prieviews showed. It made you belive it was going to be an awesome movie and i actually nearly fell asleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie...","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. There wasn't much happening in the first quarter of the movie, but once they started the ball rolling, it was very action packed. Unlike some action movies, they did a good job of establishing a good storyline to base all the action sequences on, instead of just making it a typical bad guy vs. good guy movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like E-Suck-tra...","review":"This was one of the crappiest movie I have ever seen in the history of movies. The boss fights were stupid, the final boss, stupid, The tatoo guy that was supposed to be TOTALLY sweet died way way way too easily. She had this stiff pissed look the entire movie which just made me fell Stiff and pissed.

Jennifer Garner is one of the reasons why this movie is good. She does a great job of presenting a cold, darker version of Elektra . Her performance to me was not flawed in any manner.

Thank goodness for accidents.The accompanyment is crisp and clear and flawless. The lyrics are sweet, and her voice is smooth. In terms of 'who is she like' I would have to say that, and only smooth-jazz/pop-vocal purists will get the reference, I would liken her to Kevyn Lettau, but without the Latin influence. Style-wise, definitely similar to Lettau. Her voice and the choice of songs are a perfect combination, the choice of these smooth songs fitting her light, clear style. All in all, this is definitely a worthwhile release.If you're a fan of good, pure, lite jazz, (or if you are a fan of Kevyn Lettau) give this one a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"pastel pretty","review":"The Dragonfly Shower Curtain is very pretty.

What will the Tooth Fairy bring Blue?This colorful story features Joe, Green Puppy, Periwinkle, Purple Kangaroo, Magenta, and Miss Marigold (Blue's teacher) as Blue wiggles her loose tooth and proudly shows it off to her friends.This is a whimsical story that shows a brave Blue losing a tooth and then receiving a visit (and present) from the Tooth Fairy. It's quite colorful, and features actual photographs of Joe. It seems geared toward older children as far as reading level, especially with the smaller font and longer sentences and paragraphs.If you're looking for a book to take the fear out of losing a tooth, this may help. However, if you want to introduce a child to the concept of going to the dentist and what that entails, you're better off getting Dora the Explorer's Show Me Your Smile!

Now that I finally own a pair I must say they do deliver solid performance. The highs are crystal clear with out being harsh. This makes them well suited for home theater usage as well as for listening to music. (I boost the treble slightly for home theater.) The mids are warm and natural. The bass response leaves something to be desired but they don't claim to produce killer bass. They are rated from 85Hz to 25kHz. Pairing them with a sub-woofer helps round out their performance. They handle the wattage (100 w) from my Harmon Kardon 210 quite well. The high gloss finish gives them an attractive appearance. They come with a threaded socket for wall bracket mounting. These speakers can also be used as rear satellites, coupled with the super twos for the fronts. Do these speakers live up to all the hype? Maybe not, but they are a great choice if you are tight budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"muddy sound, audiophile quality alright","review":"I brought a pair new, mainly due to quite a few positive audiophile reviews.

While the first few stories start the collection off slowly, by the time you listen to THE VIADUCT you will be hooked! My favorites include STICKS (about strange wooden configurations found in the woods), THE WORDS OF GURU (about a child discovering the demons all around us), and especially Ray Bradbury's THE SMALL ASSASSIN (about a new mother who believes her baby is trying to kill her). Most of the stories are genuinely horrifying, and the audio production throughout is excellent. I would definitely reccomend this for those who like short horror stories like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for Seniors","review":"Jacob's DVD is a good introduction to gentle yoga for those with minor physical issues preventing one from doing a more strenuous Yoga practice.

Since then she has continuted to amaze me w/ her soulful voice. This, her latest effort, is probably her best work to date. Each song showcases her beautiful voice, which is smooth, soulful and rich. Standouts include the radio hit \\"Sigo Intentando\\", the title track, \\"En tus brazos\\", \\"Noche tras día\\", \\"Socorro\\", \\"Si crees en mí\\", \\"Tal vez fuiste tú\\", and \\"País de nunca jamás\\" which is quickly becoming my favorite song on the album.

Barrett probes beneath the dancer's skin, and the trust and sense of freedom revealed in each photograph makes us feel as though we all have the ability to move in this way - alas, we do not. Tutu is about artistry and love and lust. It is a book about beauty. I defy anyone not to get stuck on page 99."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tutu","review":"The tension between the formality and the intimacy of the photography in Tutu is mesmerizing.

What galls me is that on his web site he defends his dubious methods and from the reviews for the version 6 edition of the book, as evidenced elsehwere here at amazon, he doesn't really make many changes in the new edition.

I had a QuickTime metronome before that worked well (yes, you always start at 100 BPM and then adjust it up or down, which is a bit annoying), and therefore thought this one would work for me, as well.However, this metronome has been designed to beat in a meter: either 2/4, 3/4, or 4/4. You have to pick one of those three meters, and the metronome will then click with a higher pitch on either every second, third, or fourth beat. This makes the metronome completely useless for anyone practicing music in odd or changing meters. The meter function would be fine if it were optional, but you can't turn it off.If you KNOW that you will never play music with odd or changing meters, this metronome might work well for you, but more advanced players should stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto the rest...","review":"I can't believe I purchased such a horrible product.

The volume does not get very loud either. It is also impossible to get rid of a \\"main beat\\" click so you must always hear the BEEP-click-click-BEEP-click-click-click (or similar in 3/4 or 2/4 settings), but cannot get a simple click-click-click-click that is helpful when practicing mixed meter pieces.I would recommend buying a slightly more expensive metronome with more options - it will be worth your investment in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap.","review":"The beat of this metronome is irritatingly loud, to the point where it distracts from the music you're trying to play. The LED display bouncing-ball pulse is muddy and difficult to tell when it's trying to beat. There's no volume control, only a mute button. It looks like it has a dial for bpm-adjustment (an extremely desirable feature) but it doesn't.There is no power switch, resulting in terrible battery life.A complete waste of money.For a budget metronome, I suggest you check out the Korg MA-30, or if you want the dial (and can live without volume control) then the Matrix MR500 or Seiko SQ50 is a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"This is a low quality metronome that is difficult to use and broke after two days of use.

I found this book to be utterly insulting to an intelligent thinking person. Romkey asks the reader to suspend his knowledge of history so much that it almost becomes ridiculous. Yes, this book does require some imagination due to the ficticious subject matter but to claim that Jack the Ripper, Rasputin, Hitler, Mozart, and Tatiana Romanov are vampires is just asking us to expand our rational minds a bit too much.I found the diary format more interesting to read than regular chapters, but I just couldn't get over what Romkey was asking me to believe.

Hiassen does not share any of our concerns about our children's character, but instead says that if he had to choose between Disney's greed (which he hates, and which he has written the book about) and between moralists, he would side with the greedy Disney company every time!

I found the book disappointing and felt that he did not make a good case at all for something he obviously feels strongly about. He presents the reader with a lot more emotion than facts, picking out 5 or 6 incidents, some of which he admits that Disney was in no way at fault in. It boils down to a few perhaps unethical and undesirable things that just about any big corporation, not only Disney, has probably been guilty of. I'm not a big Disney fan, by the way. What I see as dangerous is any company's taking control of so much of the media that their views and values can be imposed on society whether we want them or not.

All who read this book should heed it's message loud and clear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Next Level","review":"I wanted to take my swing dance to the next level after watching movies like Swing Kids, but didn't know where to start. This gave me a leap start into the world of aerial dance moves. Though definitely not for beginners, Daniel and Tiffiny break each move down, address safety concerns and make the execution easy. This series teaches to many moves, and the instruction is so in depth, I can't believe it doesn't cost more than it does. I go back from time to time to brush up on moves, or how to make them cleaner and present better. Highly suggest all the videos in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"be not afraid","review":"As a layman, neither linguist, theologian, nor Hebrew expert - just an amateur of the Hebrew Bible, I found Sáenz-Badillos book to be a challenging, fascinating revelation of a whole new level of scholarship which not only informed me, but inspired me to put it on my schedule for a re-read, and to take another stab at Genesius' Hebrew Grammar, the very opacity of which is a delight to the jaded who may have come to think they've seen everything.The writing is wonderful; it has a crisp clarity of style that propels one through the sometimes difficult text. John Elwolde's translation is in and of itself a work of art. It seems impossible that the book was not written in English.It would be a shame for anyone interested in the subject to miss this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a Regular Brush","review":"Nothing special about this hairbrush, it is a typical brush.

The characters are sort of drifting towards an eventual destination, but Heartfire is a mess, without most of the elements that normally distinguish Card's work.The plot: Alvin goes on trial, again; Calvin gets in trouble, again; and everyone has long conversation about what interesting characters they are. Alvin decides that the Crystal City should have fair laws. Alvin's trial and Calvin's goofing around each turn out ok, and Alvin picks up some more disciples.Back in the good old days, Orson Scott Card novels were full of original premises, difficult moral dilemmas, and were gripping the whole way through. Recently, _Pastwatch_ met all these criteria, and was well worth 5 stars. On the other hand, _Heartfire_ feels like it is just marking time until 1846, when Alvin will presumably lead his people West. At this rate, it looks like a long, boring wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alvin has lost his way","review":"Card spends two thirds of the book exchanging banter between characters, none of which advance plot or advance character development. We then end up with Alvin waiting around in jail (again) and an impending courtcase (again). Oh woe the day Verily Cooper was introduced so Card could stick his books into a court case to explain what he wants to tell us.I loved the 1st 3 books, was okay with the 4th book (but only okay), and this book made me angry. And this book did little, if anything, to advance the overall story arc of The Tales Of Alvin Maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-Alvin buffs proceed with caution.","review":"Card's not doing much exposition at this point: either you know what Alvin's about or you don't. Not much knackery going on either, compared to some of the other books in this series. Alvin brings Calvin back from the dead: nothing new there. Wonderful character development, as usual, both fictional and historical (John Adams, John C. Calhoun, John-James Audubon). Lots of loose ends, of course, given that this is a series. At this point I suspect Card hasn't any more of a clue as to the final form the Crystal City will take than Alvin does. I, for one, will enjoy the discovery process over the next few installments. A warning to those who are picking this up midstream: if American history is not your strong point, you might want to either look elsewhere or commit to a fair amount of catching up, 'cause at least 50% of the enjoyment of this series is already knowing what REALLY happened and comparing it to the \\"Alvin\\" version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Triple Tripe. What a waste. I regret I bought this book","review":"this was tghe worst book i read since the earthborn series that card also forced us to read and buy. His writing is worse and worse with each passing book. even the last speaker of the dead book was a stinker. what's the metter with you orson? You seem to have lost the will to tell a story. Instead you books are entirely composed of people discussing the weather and meaningless tripe. What happened to plot? action? dialogue? [needless to say I really liked card's early work, and like many of you, always think that his next book will mark a return to quality].MP END"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great necklace!","review":"I saw these adjustable chains at a local jewelry store and fell in love with the idea of having a chain of every length.

Along with the on the fly flam, roll, and hold per pad setup, mapping effects to the x-y pad I had a whole different sound in comparison to my midi keyboard. The light effects for each pad as well as velocity control make me feel more in touch with my sets, as well as make it a bit more fun for shows.Not being DAW guru I still have a lot to learn about this pad, but find it worth the price and would recommend as a necessary in terms of drum pads. I believe BOSS makes a similar pad, but I've never used it so I don't have much of a comparison otherwise. I've heard back and forth reviews about KORG's nanoPad so I decided to step it up and go with their full version, hence my purchase.Needless to say I'm pleased with my purchase and the new capabilities offered."},{"rating":"2","title":"A steal!","review":"I had high hopes from this controller (or should I say Kontroller) and it stands up to the task!the individual 4x4 pad grid is not too big to move around in real time performance and not too small so you know what you are doing.a red indicator lights up under each square when you press it and I found that to give great eye response in situations where you can't hear everything.The controllers themselves are very sturdy and durable. you get a velocity indication when you hit the pad on the 3 digital numbers on the top left corner which is also a nice touch.XY pad is a great add-on to this pad and very much worth the extra money.The entire controller is super customizable yet super easy to use. you can change banks with a turn of a dial and every botton can be customized.I am very happy with it. I get great feedback from it in real time.highly suggested!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Book","review":"I was having a hard time finding a simple baby journal.

Each story illuminates some aspect of faith in a non-didactic way. These are NOT a series of inspirational \\"feel good\\" stories about God.

It is the fascinating story of a young man who voluntarily emigrated to Russia in the 30s. His father was an Italian immigrant who made himself annoying enough to be deported, and he chose to go to the 'Worker's Fatherland.' The communist community collected money to sent the whole family there later on, and the author got his chance to see communism at work from up close. He was arrested on suspicion of espionage and sent to the GULAG for 8 years (the first time). This is an intense and personal story rather than work of scholarship, so it does not have all the statistics about the GULAG system etc. 'Dear America' is a the perspective of an American suddenly thrust into another world, a world he longed for and then discovered was just a hoax.

The connecting cord that comes with this device does not fit well into the standard mini receptacle on the Blackberry and i am sure it would not work any better on any MP3. It was cause for a lot of static and other noise. I actually bought a shielded cable with the proper fittings on the ends which helped to clean the sound up a lot.

If you're looking for a book to read before, during, or after a trip to Yellowstone, you'll be glad you chose this. The characters are very appealing; the setting is magnificent; and the fact that the novel is shaped by the characters' correspondence is a nice touch. It is somehow easier to appreciate the timelessness of Yellowstone when reading these letters written so convincingly in nineteenth-century voices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Nice jacket cover..established well known publisher..my copy is in a second printing..Excellent reviews on back of book jacket..good Amazon reader reviews..so why is this book so awful?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dippy - Why Should I Believe This?","review":"If only this author had included a preface or afterward explaining the basis for her fiction. Did she read real letters? Were there really such botanical missions? The main character's coy use of initials to hide her gender is too cute as is her ability to rescue a man in a snowstorm. The men in the book are without exception pains in the neck. I wanted to like this, but I couldn't believe in it, or lose myself in it as I did in Andrea Barrett's books of the same style. For a real trip to the 19th century west, read \\"A Lady's Life in the Rockies.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully beautiful book that you just can't put down","review":"Letters takes place around the turn of the century in Yellowstone National Park. It is about a young female botanist who has to fight the tides of the times to earn respect in her chosen field. It is an interesting and beautiful book that is so descriptive the reader feels as if he is IN Yellowstone! This is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully engrossing historical novel","review":"Ms. Smith takes us to Yellowstone at the turn of the century where we spend a summer with an unlikely cadre of disparate personalities. Through their correspondence to the outside world, we are treated to their often contradictary perspectives. Essentially the story of a young female botanist, the book richly portrays the majesty of Yellowstone as well as the complex internal conflicts of it's explorers. Neither a light-hearted romp nor a heavy-handed effort, \\"Letters\\" is a subtle and satisfying portrait of their often turbulent experience...and the profound changes brought about by their inter-relationships and by the unique power of the park itself. Really good stuff!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete is right...","review":"Well I guess I can't say this book is incomplete...since it's completely boring and completely glosses over every subject it contains. In one day of owning the book I jumped around and read the whole chapters on religion, economics, and american history and came away knowing nothing of substance. It would be more enteraining and more helpful just to go back and read school textbooks on these subjects. Which shows you how enjoyable this book is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"Hard to use as a quick reference guide, filled with sarcastic anti-Bush comments, a complete turn off.

Should have learned according to whose opinion is the question? This authors, apparently in order to sell books. I ordered this book, reviewed it and then returned it. It is packed with factual information, but 90% of it is irrelevant and you will never have the use for it.

For example: Gerard Manley Hopkins is not even mentioned in the section concerning the British poets and in the chapter on religion, the authors make the boorish mistake of confusing the doctrine of the \\"Immaculate Conception\\" with that of the doctrine of the virgin birth of Christ. It might seem trivial to some, but if you want to write a book purporting to illuminate such topics, you better be up to the task, especially when your style is on the snide and cynical side. Maybe corrections were made in later editions, but I wouldn't count on it. Certainly a better read for this purpose is \\"A History of Knowledge: Past, Present, and Future\\" by Charles Van Doren, which Amazon also stocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was so disappointed with this selection. Granted, I knew from the onset that this book was not the end-all book to learn everything in the universe. I was hoping for a serious look into some terrific topics I knew little or nothing about. Instead what I got was too much tongue-in-cheek. Too much sarcasm. Too many snide remarks that we readers can't even understand because we are not smart enough to be *in* on the joke. I found it condescending. I planned on buying another copy of this book for my best friend as a birthday present.

Probably a great read or reference in hard copy, but the chart format for some topics are not fully displayed on the Kindle screen. You cannot see the entire entry for some subjects in a section.

I would recommend it for print-on-paper reference reading, but not for Kindle users. How do I get a refund?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This work is terrible - the string of inside jokes and parenthetical statements are so outdated that it makes for very distracted reading. Written in long winded sentences in the second person, the authors come across with a pretentious \\"I know all about YOU\\" attitude that rarely hits the mark (\\"Fortunately, you have cable - and a Stouffer's lasagna in the freezer\\"...um, no, I don't). While the goal is a noble one, the authors fail to follow through with the golden rule of writing: \\"love the reader.\\" If they had written in a clear, thoughtful style, this work would have gained a 5 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad.","review":"Well, I was really looking forward to it, and read a fair portion of the Religion section, but found the tone of it really annoying, not enough depth on the subject, and the author makes too many inside jokes. If you get the jokes, you already know the information and you don't need to read it. If you don't get the jokes, it is leaves you as an outsider and learn nothing.I'll keep reading it, and amend the review if I have to.My advice:Go to Barnes & Noble and take a look (and just to be fair to our host, consider ordering it from here).

Much of the information is piece-meal and incomplete, just enticing the reader a bit and then leaving them wondering where the rest of the story is. I was also surprised by the frequent and glaring anti-conservative messages, which were often unrelated to the topics being discussed. I understand that historians are human and have political leanings, but in this book too much opinion tainted the historical message. I was hoping for an informative new take on the topics included, and as I say, I was disappointed.Bill Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything is a much better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"An 'incomplete education' after reading \\"An Incomplete Education\\"","review":"Topic coverage is all too, too cutsey.

It also has the Hebrew text alongside the English text.It has fabulous illustrations that bring the Jewish Festival of Freedom to life.It ends off with the songs sung on Pesach including the song well known to children in Israel - Chad Gadya- One Kid.

The book begins by showing over 22 photos of riverbanks and trees. This repetition quickly snuffs out the interest the reader has on the topic. Much of the following information has been printed time and time again in newspapers and other underground railroad texts. The text and photography do not come up to the standard of Mr. Burke's earlier works and unfortunately do not do him justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast ride with slow women","review":"Great video for those nights that need some good taste -- Wish that the game was better and the free video was better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guns, Drugs & Monsters is a Winner","review":"STEVE NILES writes a mean hard-boiled novel. He also writes a wicked horror novel. What makes NILES unique is that he does this in the same book!

He knows this because he hunts them. Well, a guy has to make a living somehow, doesn't he?NILES skillfully combines the best elements of CHANDLER and HAMMETT along with a dose of KING, plus a good bit of humor as well. I read through Guns, Drugs and Monsters in nearly one sitting [it's that much fun]. It also features spot illustrations by ASHLEY WOOD that are the icing on the cake.

Calling it \\"yoga\\" at all is a bit of a stretch (ahem).

Occasionally I've had neck/shoulder/sternocleidomastoid sprains from overexercising. The tapes in these series are done by physical therapists who specialize in spinal pain. They are thorough and professional. I recommend them for anyone looking for an alternative to other pain relieving options for the spine. The only reason I didn't give them a 5-star rating is because they are a bit on the boring side and don't have music like Rodney Yee DVDs (He's my favorite yoga instructor)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use caution before buying this DVD.","review":"I would recommend a slower-paced, more gentle DVD if you are new to yoga, are older, are not as limber, and/or have painful joints (like knee pain with kneeling.) While the instruction and explanation is good, the actual work-out is fairly quickly paced. If you hurry and do the positions without doing them properly for your body, you will end up possibly injuring yourself. Although I am older I have exercised most of my life, yet both of the Kraftstow DVD's were difficult for me. I was disappointed to pay almost $50 for both of them, which I can only return for a partial refund.

The motor is powerful and the reamer design is extremely effective getting out all the juice. However, there is a problem over which I am returning mine. The larger \\"orange\\" reamer does not replace the smaller \\"lemon\\" size, but nests on top of it. That gives one more item (beside the bowl and stainless-steel filter) that has to be washed. More seriously, that puts one more item (a total of four) between the orange and the motor. So, if anything gets at all out of alignment (such as if a piece of pulp gets between two parts, or things just tilt a bit) pressing on the orange half may not engage the switch that starts the motor.
