I live in Ohio but have spend many summers and holidays in Georgia because my parents were born in this state. My brother moved to Atlanta and it has a wonderful spirit with the West End community she describes perfectly. She allows me to visit through her eyes and develops characters that you feel that you know intimately. The ability to weave a tell that creates a feeling of familiarity of the community and an understanding of the characters is a gift of a great writer. I have read all of Ms Jones' books and find her to refreshing and creative. I am looking forward to her next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Boring","review":"I hate that I wasted my money on the Untelling. I heard so much about what a great writer Tayari Jones was and people were really lying. The story had loose ends, the main character was supposed to be educated but came across as the opposite, the over-quoting of Dr. King, the lack of resolution at the end. Just because someone uses a bunch of big words doesn't make them a good writer. No wonder her books aren't selling. Maybe her next one will be better if she concentrates on learning how to actually tell a story that doesn't put you to sleep. Better luck next time but I won't buy another of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best TV i've owned to date.","review":"I did several months of research and comparisons before pulling the trigger and spending 4 grand on a TV.

What a mistake. I was expecting a huge improvement in my DVD playback, since I could finally take advantage of the Progressive Scan output of my DVD player. I spent hours playing around with different settings, trying to get an image as sharp and clean as I used to get on my tube TV. But DLP projection technology isn't capable of it. The image is terrible. Lot of grain, noise and ghosting, and way too many motion artifacts. I'm glad I didn't pay money for this, but I wish I'd simply donated it back to the charity I got it from.

Whilst generic lonely planet guide blueprint is limited, the layout employed here is quite confusing and random, with maps, route descriptions, silly anecdotes, natural history, local culture and general travel advice thrown in together in a very messy fashion which limits the usefulness of the book as a reference material. The content itself is extremely bloated with superfluous info and suffers from inconsistent writing - at times it feels more like a disparate collection of internet postings than a trekking guide. Whilst is great to see the alternate and no less spectacular routes getting a mention, some serious thought needs to be given to the editing process - it is a difficult task to write a concise and informative guide, but this is what is necessary to stand out from the dross."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get educated and entertained all at once","review":"I've owned the cassette version of this for more years than I can remember.

What I wasn't too thrilled about was the casting decisions and how they differed from previous Spenser flicks and the old \\"Spenser: For Hire\\" TV series: I could live with a new Belson (done once before), a new Susan (done twice before) and a new Quirk (the original actor died), but even with the recastings done in the Lifetime Spenser movies, they retained Robert Urich and Avery Brooks as Spenser and Hawk. Mantegna's a little too Brooklyn-sounding to be Bostonian, and Sheik Mahmud-Bey is way too friendly to even be considered a successor to Brooks. Also, all the police uniforms featured herein are Canadian-style; Captain Healy's Massachusetts State Police uniform isn't even close to the real thing. However, this new film is significantly edgier than the previous ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Cast","review":"sorry, but urich and brooks are the only two who should ever play these roles. despite Parker's opinion that JM is a better Spenser, he doesn't at all fit the bill. he looks nothing like how i saw the character in my mind even before the original show (while reading the books). he doesn't bring to mind an ex-boxer/street tough. he looks more like an accountant. and NO ONE could ever ever play Hawk the way brooks did. Avery Brooks IS Hawk. Just as Robert Urich IS Spenser. watching this film was like ordering steak and getting liver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very exiting.","review":"I have an image of Spenser from reading the books - that of a big guy with an 18 inch neck, 50 inch chest and 18 inch arms. Very strong and above all, very physical. Joe Mantegna is a good actor but (for me) just does not cut it as Spenser. He is just not big enough! Robert B. Parker himself, plays 'Ives' in one scene and it is clear to me that he based Spenser (at least physically) upon himself - although he denies this. Sheik Mahumud-Bey is too nice to be Hawk whom I see as menacing but articulate. Casting aside, the story was slow and quite frankly boring. By the time it ended I did not care what happened to the characters. It was treated as more of a love story between Spenser and Susan than a detective story."},{"rating":"1","title":"No hope for UK Parker fans.","review":"This film is not available in a format compatible with uk systems.

The sidewalks were a breeze and kind of fun to do. As expected the chord is a pain to handle but that is an issue with every piece of electric outdoors equipment, not the fox's fault.To re-cap, the fox works better than expected, is light, easy to handle and powerful enough.

I finished the rest by hand, packed this unit back into the box and returned it. I was totally dissapointed in the workmanship and would not recommend this product to anyone. However Amazon was great in handling my problem & I will continue to use thierservice which has always been #1 in my opinion. Hope you found this very helpful.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Performer","review":"Rare instance of a product that performs better than advertised. I used it in a 6 to 8 inch snowfall and it worked well. For the heaviest snow (beyond nominal capacity), it works best if you take a half-width cut or tilt it up so you are taking the top part of the snow first. It also works best in heavy snow when you blow the snow out straight-ahead -- it blows further and cuts best."},{"rating":"2","title":"MTD Snow Fox","review":"This product is better than I expected for the price.

I did not receive notification that it would not arrive, and when I contacted Amazon about it, all I got was a refund notification. I want the item, but am leary about using Ace via Amazon again. By the time it arrives (if at all), it will be in Spring when snow is not an issue.

I replaced it with the snow fox when the blades started to where down on the Toro. It looked like a step up and it was. I was able to handle the medium snow as advertised. At the end of last year the electric motor froze. It kept tripping the built in circuit breaker. The internals of the electric motor had a short and the unit is useless after two snow seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does a good job for the size","review":"The fact that this is electric powered appealed to me because I wouldn't have to mess around with gas cans, but dragging an extension cord around is kind of a pain. This did extremely well in light, powdered snow at one or two inches. Unfortunately we were having some pretty heavy snowstorms and my neighbors laughed at me because it was like trying to cook a Thanksgiving dinner in a Susie Homemaker Oven... not too effective! But if you keep on top of the snowfall, this is a perfect, economical alternative to shoveling. The machine is light, easy to use, and doesn't take up much storage space, and performs as advertised and expected. But do call a snowplow for the heavy days!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It works until the time I can't return it","review":"It looks as a descent machine and did its job 3~ 4 times. Even though I always have the trouble to start it (I need to push the button and lift and loose the bar to start it), I did figure out start it 5 times.

After two more uses the crack developed into a two inch C shape tear. An auger should not be made of flexible plastic. The operator's manual states the machine has a two year warranty. I contacted MTD to get a replacement part and they stated I had to go through a repair dealer to correct the defect. The dealer after repairing the machine told me I would have to pay for the repair because MTD does not warranty this part. I contacted MTD, the technician told me it is my tough luck they do not cover the part. DO NOT PURCHASE MTD snow throwers, they are made so cheaply and do not stand behind their product."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"We only used this item twice in about 3 inches of snow and it kept shutting itself off. The auger that throws the snow seems very tight and hard to turn. It would only work for about 15 minutes and shut down. I think we must have received a defective product bacause all the reviews I read before making this purchase were excellent.I had difficulty getting customer service help. I was given different phone numbers to try. We've had this item for 35 days. We have to drop it off for repair at a store that will service it in the next town over. Very inconvenient and dissapointing. We made this purchase to make life easier for my husband with back problems. Now its one more project to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing next to a shovel","review":"I had the pleasure of using this snow fox when we had 12 inches of snow and drifts up to 20-24 inches. My son came over with his Snow Fox to dig me out and wasn't sure if it could handle the deeper snow. To our surprize it cleared the entire drive with only slight adjustment on our part to take a few inches at a time. It was easy to push due to the light weight of the equipment and I can't wait for another snow to use MY Snow Fox. I ordered it the next day after our use on the 12 inches and it came within the week. I would recommend it to any of you single ladies who may or may not have a kind son to assist in an emergency. And thanks to Amazon for the quick response to my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for our mid-Atlantic winters","review":"I looked around at other small snow throwers and decided on this one for its light weight and small size (hangs on hooks on a pegboard in our garage). It is really perfect for the small snow falls that we typically get in the mid-Atlantic. We even got good use out of it this year despite the unusually snowy winter. It is very easy to use. Yes, it does have its limitations as other reviewers have noted. You need to use it when snow is no more than 4-5 inches. The left and right throwing angles don't project the snow very far (but the straight shot sends the snow well clear of where you need it to be removed from). Get a good extension cord. A Rigid brand extension cord was recommended to me in Home Depot and it was a good purchase - it doesn't get stiff in the cold. We really are happy we selected this and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A winner any way you look at it.","review":"I don't know if Eleanor McEvoy is in touch with her feelings. She's certainly in touch with mine.Anyone who listens even casually to the words on Eleanor's album \\"Yola\\" is sure to find an emotional connection there. Listen closely, and you may wonder if she's been tapping your phone or reading your diary. But no, I suspect the real truth is simply that Eleanor has the soul of a poet wrapped in the body of an incredibily talented singer-songwriter, and the combined package is hard to beat.The music is simply, but elegantly arranged, backing Eleanor's compelling vocals with her own guitar and fiddle licks, co-producer Brian Connor's keyboards, Liam Bradley's percussion and backing vocals, and Eoghan O'Neill's bass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful recording from a wonderful artist","review":"I picked up this SACD and have recently listened to it.

He's apparently seen every bad one in the book. And if you're a player stuck with one of these lousy coaches (they're all lousy, by the way, none of them are interested in helping kids, they are all in it for themselves), his advice is glib, snide, and misguided.Imagine a guy who thinks he's Dennis Miller, stretching every joke to the last possible descriptive metaphor. Imagine a guy who seems obsessed with the idea that all coaches only volunteer for Little League so they can turn their own sons into the MVP of the team. Imagine a guy who thinks kids need to be armed with cynicism, not idealism, as they enter Little League.Imagine a guy who finds \\"Field of Dreams\\" to be a waste of celluloid.That's who you're dealing with here and it translates into a really boorish, frustrating book that serves no real purpose except letting a frustrated coach/writer vent his spleen. Maybe he needs a blog. Or a hobby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money or your time","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. My 10-year-old son received it as a gift, and I now wonder about the intent of the giver. It's snarky and sarcastic without being witty or clever, and is pretty much limited to exploring some broad negative stereotypes about types of players, coaches and parents. The cover says the book is \\"For parents, coaches and players,\\" but it wouldn't appeal to most kids of Little League age. For an adult, it takes about 10 minutes to read, so isn't worth buying. I got the feeling that the authors had bad experiences as Little League players and/or parents, but rather than write about whatever those issues were and possible solutions (which could still have been done in a light and humorous manner), they wrote a book that had hardly anything positive to say about anyone involved in the game. Oh, except for \\"the perfect coach,\\" who, surprisingly enough, resembles one of the authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent travel/history book about the Armenians","review":"Mardsen's book is a unique combination of present travel storytelling and history. Few books have explained the Armenian people, how they think (and why), what they have been through, and what they hope for, so well. By visiting different Armenian Diaspora groups, he gets a unique perspective from Armenians everywhere, not just Armenians from the Republic or the United States. The reader can tell that Mardsen is entranced by the Armenians and their culture and this creates an extremely interesting and good read. It is also filled with quite a few interesting and little known facts about Armenians. This is a great book for anyone interested in Armenians and their culture, past and present."},{"rating":"2","title":"First person account of a journey of discovery","review":"Charming and well written book of a young Englishman's voyage of discovery among the middle eastern diaspora of Armenians and then through the Balkans and across the Caucasus to Armenia itself.

The 2nd or 3rd time I backed up, it said the storage was full, and I knew there was no way it was full. I emailed tech support for SimpleTech, and the guy recommended doing a full backup instead of an incremental one to start over. That was a bit of trouble, as I needed to move files around to keep from losing some, but I did it,(and lost some anyway that I'd forgotten about) and it was fine for a couple of times after that, but once again, it said it was full. Support said do a reformat.

Then I began working through the stretches and breathing exercises along with Mirabai and I felt as though I had spent a couple of hours at one of those lovely day spas. The music is soothing and Mirabai's voice is gentle as she guides you through the routines. There is a short explanation of the physiology behind this workout with some excellent graphics.

I purchased this lens based off of the reviews and I just couldn't be happier with it. I am having so much fun using it, and after doing a lot of comparison with other lenses that are comparable, I am happy that I chose this one. It is built really well, is cheaper than others in it's class, and the zoom option makes it an extreme fisheye or just a wide angle. I love it. It's a no brainer. The only thing I could see as a downside is that the lens is hyper-sensitive to light. I actually like that feature because of the artistic things that can be done with lighting, but being a novice, I need to make adjustments to the lighting with this lens, that my others don't require. The lens cap is ugly, but works well. Overall, Well built with beautiful results."},{"rating":"1","title":"a month old and AFis not working","review":"it has not even been a month and the Automatic Focus is not working!maybe its just mine"},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere for greeting card paper","review":"This paper is okay but for two things.On the plus side, it is a nice bright (but not too bright) warm white that takes ink well with no significant bleed-through.But there are two things that kill this paper for practical use. There is a Kodak trademark printed in the lower-left hand corner of one side of the sheet. The intention is good: they want you to have the score line facing the proper way to get a really sharp fold. The problem is that you absolutely must do one or more test prints (hopefully on less expensive paper) to make sure you have the right side up for your printer. This is a needless pain.Second, the paper used for the envelope is so thin that the design of your card is clearly visible, which removes the surprise element.I would suggest exploring other brands for your greeting card needs.Jerry"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good classroom resource!","review":"If you are interested in this book, I would highly recommend reading it before using it.

This carrier is very well made and also well thought out. It squishes down to fit under the airlines seats that sit lower. It has a D ring inside so you can tether your pet from a panic bolt down the airport. It opens top and from the end so you have lots of access. The cat got nervous but the unit was easily cleaned up and dried. It really made the trip \\"uneventful\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY FOR CATS!","review":"During the first part of a connecting international flight, the cat ripped through the mesh lining, several times and nearly escaped in the process.

It worked well for our Airtran flights, fitting under the seat in front of me pretty well (had to smash it down just a little), even though the dimensions are slightly larger than the Airtran guidelines. I would like to have a small opening somewhere so that I could reach in to give my dog a treat or a pat without unzipping one of the main openings. Overall, this carrier works as well as I could ask."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two years strong!","review":"I've had the medium-sized Sherpa bag for two years and I am very happy with it. My 12 pound cat fits well in this carrier and even has room to turn around. Also, kitty never overheats in there because it is well-ventilated.For air travel:All of the openings are zippered so there is no chance of a mid-flight, stealth cat escape (if you've traveled with a cat, you know what I mean.) It's easy to carry and I have never had trouble getting it on an airplane, though, it does stick out from under the seat a bit. Normally, it is my only carry-on because it has enough room in the extra zippered pockets for my wallet, tickets, a small towel, magazines and a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it a 0 if I could","review":"I'd give it 0 if I could..., August 28, 2006Reviewer: Carole (PA, USA) - See all my reviewsI must say, I was willing to pay this amount because I thought I was getting a better quality item.

I tried several times and ways to fix it, but it would not stay up.I contacted the company and they told me to \\"stuff it with wet towels and spray it heavily with starch...\\" are they kidding? Then I found a reference to this problem under their web site FAQ's. So, they are knowingly selling a defective item and expecting the customer to then fix it. They never responded to my second email... I could not return it because it had been used.This is a company that does NOT stand behind it's products.

My mini doxen loves going in there all by herself. I am sure she can't wait to ride in it when we use it in the plane. There is a good sized pocket in the back and the strap evens doubles as a leash.

During this first use, the mesh on the bag developed a rip, despite the fact that my cat was shockingly calm during transit and didn't attack the bag at all. My cat is 12 pounds - well within the weight range for this product and one trip is hardly excessive usage. This is supposed to be a quality product and I'm very disapointed that instead it's damaged after a single, non-intensive use. I'm concerned that it won't be secure to carry my pet during an international flight, which was the reason I purchased it. Although the top and side openings proved useful, I just can't trust a product that breaks immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential discography","review":"An excellent discography that fills a gap in music research. These bands represent the ground between country music and swing and are direct forerunners of rock and roll. While most hot string bands are here, it would have been nice to see Leo Soileau's various groups and the Alley Boys of Abbeville included. But maybe that indicates just how rich this field is. Great job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creates a Bible that's more easily understood!","review":"When I read a typical Bible, I wouldn't be able to connect verses about a specific event or prophecy, as they'd be stated in books or chapters that could be hundreds of pages apart. But with The Daily Bible, the stories, teachings and events come together in a sequence that makes sense. For example, when David had an experience, the psalm he wrote will be placed with the event so they're connected! And I didn't realize some of the prophets lived at the same time and prophesied to the same cities. But it's the New Testament that really came alive for me. When the verses from different gospels are joined together regarding a teaching or person Jesus interacted with, it's like the pieces of a puzzle forming a complete picture. I'll never read the Bible the same again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Small print ... very small print","review":"The book is absolutely wonderful! ... but the print in this compact version is far too small ...

It is such a pleasant representation and refreshing read each day you delve into God's word. It has the author's narration about the context of the culture/history between each day's readings.

I appreciate the devotional comments that give insight to the historical context or how the lineage is significant. And I'm really noticing a lot of things that hadn't occurred to me as I'd read these passages before. Reading through at the same time as a friend does is an added bonus because we are able to discuss what we are getting out of the daily readings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish It Was on Kindle","review":"I really like this version because it enables me to read the Bible as one complete story that follows a chronological order of events. I have the green bonded leather version which is really nice. Not sure they still sell it, though.Anyway, one thing that really makes this one more enjoyable than most is the commentary provided by F. LaGard Smith. Yes, it's one person interpretation of things but his commentary does make me think about what I'm reading. He kind of connects everything. I did get The Story, NIV: The Bible as One Continuing Story of God and His People and I am enjoying it so far but it does leave out huge chunks that are part of the overall story. It's also missing the commentary. That's why I will wait - somewhat patiently - for this one to become a Kindle version instead of getting something else that isn't entirely what I'm really looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Daily Bible is a Blessing","review":"I have ordered several, one for myself and others for gifts,each person is so delighted.The order is shipped quickly,packed well and in great condition.

This film needs the MST3K treatment. There are some mostly silicone-enhanced women to ogle, but the story is so badly written and confusing that when the main characters' lawyer-friend explains to them what's going on about 3/4s through the film, it feels like he is explaining what's going on to the audience as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quentin Tarantino would be proud!","review":"If your a fan of Quentin Tarantino then you will love this movie.

Too bad they got the shaft from their record company. Their lable never pushed the album so the band never made it. I saw this band at the CD release party for another great Dallas Band called 'Spot' in 1995 or so. They rocked! I waited for months for the CD, when I got it, it was good, although it really failed to capture how awesome the band was live. The CD lacked the same energy, but was still very good. Best way to describe it is Alternative Rock with a heavy emo influence...but NOT emo. If you, like me, think that 1995-96 were the best years for music especially in Dallas, you will love Tablet....but if you like all the crap called 'Alternative' today, sorry, this CD is way to unique and creative for you and sounds nothing like Coldplay or Creed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I have ever seen","review":"This was the worst movie I have ever seen.....and to think I even saw it in the theater!! I read the Isaac Asimov short story, which is a classic, and believe me, this movie was nothing like it. I can't even give it one star, it was so bad.It made no sense, had no plot, and the acting was horrible. I was so disappointed, because I am a HUGE Asimov fan, and was expecting so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible movie","review":"Can't believe anyone could give this movie even a single star. It claims to be based on the greatest short sci-fi story ever put on paper by Isaac Asimov, but really, except for an event called 'nightfall' and the names of a few characters, the two stories have *nothing* in common. I would recommend that people stay far, far away from this utter travesty of a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzz","review":"This set a record in my life's movie-watching experience: I rented it three times, always willing to give the benefit of the doubt, and three times I couldn't stay awake through the first hour.Asimov's story is a classic; this is a classic dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Screenplay jumble","review":"First of all, this is for mature audiences only due to some moderate nudity. I enjoyed the script immensely bacause it gives me pause to think of how CHANGE affects people. It is an apocalyptic type of movie without the destructiveness of some recent movies on the market. In fact, it is really about how people respond to change in nature. I was befuddled by the screenplay because it skipped around a lot with a constantly changing flow of images apparently related to the telling of the story. The trick is in zeroing in on the major theme between the rational leader, Aton, and the usurping influence of a doomsday cult. Overall this movie confronts one's own fears about inevitable change that occurs in the natural realm and how one may handle one's actions. For this reason I gave it a 5-star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Cavalia Live","review":"We attended the show and enjoyed it - the Video looses the \\"live\\" aspect of the performance.

Knowing of my irreverent nature, a friend copied a story from it and gave it to me. I took it and read it while getting my car washed. People at the car wash must have thought I was crazy because, while reading, I was laughing out loud so hard. And it is not only funny; it can be profoundly thought-provoking. I want to buy a case of \\"Beware of God\\" and give it to my friends. I also want to drop off copies at the exits to all the Creationist theme parks.

(\\"The Blessing Bee\\" is one of the most amazing short stories I've ever heard - poignant, heart-breaking, and hilarious all at the same time.) Beware of God, however, is a totally forgettable, rather immature screed against religion and God. While that could have been interesting, the stories are so yowlingly strident that I couldn't help but compare them to what you might imagine a heartbroken 16-year old boy would write about girls after his girlfriend dumps him for another guy. If you're looking for more of the \\"The Blessing Bee\\", you'll be sadly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bitter Aftertaste","review":"This book, like Auslander's other work, suffers from what appears to be his own self-hatred and complete disgust with all things Jewish. Whenever I read anything by him, I find that his bitterness, apparently resulting from his resentment over the way he was raised, ruins his attempts at humor. Those who would buy his books based on some comparison to Woody Allen, Philip Roth or the like should know that unlike those writers, he is unable to find anything positive to say, ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no Foreskin","review":"If you're looking for another Foreskin's Lament, this isn't it.

CCR was probably one of the first really \\"rocking\\" band to win me over to rock and roll. This is undoubtedly their best album. I agree with one reviewer that the album cover was cheesy and didn't really reveal how good the contents were. If you can only own one CCR album, this should be the one. This is an essential for your collection. This is good music, even though \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" does get a little tedious before it ends. A little shorter version might have been a good idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"One great song after another.","review":"It shouldn't take long for one to realize that many of the CCR tunes he/she heard on the radio all of these years came from this album. The band's original lineup would not last much longer after this release, so it seems almost fitting that they seemed to pull out all of the stops. Somehow, the opening bone cruncher \\"Ramble Tamble\\" has been overlooked as one of the best songs ever recorded by CCR (or by anyone for that matter, as it's one of my personal favorites). \\"Run Through the Jungle\\", \\"Up Around the Bend\\", and a great version of \\"I Heard it Through the Grapevine\\" (don't believe some of the other reviews on this one) are all here as well as a lot more. This is a great place for any potential CCR fan to start. Enjoy and play loud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CCR at the Highest (Sound Quality) level ever.","review":"Fantasy/OJC continues to push the 16bit sound enevelope. Their K2 (a JVC process) remasters of mostly jazz titles are without a doubt the best sounding CD's made. They are better than the now defunct Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs, DCC or Chesky \\"audiophile\\" discs. Fantasy knew they had a small goldmine in their back catalog and someone there knew good sound when they heard it (JVC K2 process). They put them both together to re-release the whole CCR catalog in this technologically superior format. As a CCR fan, I chose COSMO'S FACTORY as my first remaster purchase. The sound is INCREDIBLE. I defy anyone to listen to this disc without the obligatory toe tapping and head bobbing. But try and keep your head in one place so you can hear the CCR/K2 magic. On a high resolution system it is nothing short of amazing. On the Stereophile rating scale, I give it 5 stars for content and 5 stars for sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great album but mostly redundant with Chronicle","review":"There's not a bad song here, but seven of them are also on Chronicle: The 20 Greatest Hits. That leaves four, which other reviewers have described. If you're a big fan, you're going to have all seven studio albums, certainly including this one. For me, since I have Chronicle, I'm going to simplify my life and not keep Cosmo's Factory.

Lots of versatility here, with some great shared lead vocals by Jean Terrell and Mary Wilson. \\"Floy Joy\\" has always been one of my favorite Supremes singles (if any Supremes single could be described as \\"sassy\\", this is it!), and on the LP you get the FULL LENGTH version (including the neat little riff at the end) as opposed to the single which fades out a full 18 seconds earlier (I never understood that particular edit, when the full song clocks in at a mere 2:50). Enjoyable listening all the way through, but like many Motown LPs that were reissued on CD in the late 80s-early 90s this didn't stay in print very long, so be prepared to shell out some $$$ if you're looking for this on CD nowadays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"Totally biased book based on the pros and cons of Nuclear power.

If you loved HOOVES you must get this new version. retails at 19.95."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW, well done graphics Hoever EURO style","review":"This was some incredible design job and the graphics are truly incredible as are the sounds and sights. Its like a virtual reality day at the Races.The only slight drawback to this game is that even when you select a race in the USA, all the races arr in Euro distances and measurements, making it tough for many of us to be sure of the distance.However that said, this game is complete in every other way and a must buy for the Horse Racing fan.I would tell the programmers of this one to go back to the start phase and make a USA Version of the game and use American Tracks, and this one will sell like hotcakes !

Buy 2 horses in national level , male and female, and of the same type.2. Race them until you get them international level.Want more than 2 int. racers? Breed them, train the foal, then race it until it is international level!Pro's:If you breed your international mare to a international stallion that isn't in your barn, you honestly get a champion foal!

Although I was dissapointed at the fact that the only graphics are in races. The graphics are good though. Also, it is ALMOST impossible to make money in the beginning. But there is a way: Go to the ball with the money in it. Click it, then click the upper option, then click loans. select the amount of money you want to borrow. But BEWARE, you have to pay back more than you borrowed. So this will only temporarily fix your problem. Another way to help is buy a horse,than put speed training for 5 weeks, than give him (or her) 4 weeks of rest. Do this for about 1 game year. And please, do not give up on this game if it proves to be hard. This is a that needs to be figured out, because the manufacturer doesn't tell you what to do. Thats why this game is so cool, you actually get figure it out. DO NOT USE THE RACE AND BET MODE!! Both suck a lot! And, do not give this to a person under the age of 8, unless they have a huge IQ.

I really hate to give it one star, so to be clear, the one star is to draw attention to the fact that Sony has TOTALLY RUINED this disc. This is a copy-protected DVD and will only play in standard DVD players.I have tried to play this with a number of DVD programs in Windows and it fails every time. This was confusing to me until I looked at the back of the DVD case and saw the little Sony copy protection logo. Makes sense now. It's truly, truly baffling why Sony does this to legitimate, paid for DVD's. I have a hard time convincing myself not to buy bootleg DVD's that work better, everywhere, at a third of the price.I have since figured out how to play this movie on my computer and the irony of it will keep me entertained well into my sunset years.Good job, Sony.

His road to completing this film was such a bumpy one, that one can only appreciate it even more. His struggle with some of the animation sequences, and solutions... my only wish was to have dedicated a short period of time on how they went about the work with the voice actors, which I thought was great.There's also a small sneak peek at how Plaid worked on the music for the film.Also appreciated, the various tracks of subtitles and audio tracks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tekkon Kinkreet is an awesome movie and watching it in Blu-Ray makes it more worth it","review":"Tekkon Kinkreet is a really great movie I enjoyed the story very much.

The 3d environments were beautifully created, without that typical CG look and the character animation was excellent. Excellent character design. Everything is very fluid and alive. In terms of the plot, I enjoyed it thoroughly for the first half, until the entire mood took a very dark turn and remained that way until the end. It got to the point where it wasn't enjoyable anymore. Maybe if I was expecting that to happen, I may have taken it better. Overall, a very well-made anime in all respects."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN IN YEARS!!!!!","review":"I saw Tekkon Kinkreet at a screening in the MOMA a few months back.

If you're a serious Holiday decorator, there aren't that many ideas (not worth the price of the book anyway). You can get more ideas out of a good Holiday magazine. Not a Santa, a snowman or vintage decoration to be had; this book is filled with natural flora and fauna for the most part.What really bugged me was the publisher kept recycling the same photographs - - the wall sconce filled with red stuff was in there on 3 or 4 different pages. That seemed cheap, like why not show different closeups?The decorating was pretty but generic. And not enough of it. I was dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"SPARKLY","review":"This is frothy, glitzy decorating, classic with a modern twist.I can't say you are going to get plenty of ideas to decorate, especially if you are the crafty, shabby-chic kind of person. But even if you are, and are in the mood for something more \\"comme-il-faut\\" this year, then this is a good book to start. I spent a very pleasant afternoon going through its pages. Ms. Garrity has a very comfortable house and the photos do everything they can to showcase it. So gold and red and homey, you will smell the orange-cinnamon upscale perfume oils.

This is the first of her books I have read and it will not be the last. The scenes are well written, right down to the smells -- you can picture every thing in your mind. A wonderful, exciting love story and a refreshing change to read about Outremer (Israel) during the crusades.It was wonderful seeing Sabin grow and mature from a young hellion and womanizer into a caring, loving husband and father, while at the same time being a fierce and noble warrior. The fight between Sabin and the Arab where all Sabin had to defend himself was a wooden shield was heartstopping.The final chapters were some of the most thrilling page turners I have ever read. An incredible rescue, and according to the author based upon true events, except that Sabin and Anais are fictional. An excellent read, I cannot recommend it enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least I was able to get through it....","review":"This is not the first Elizabeth Chadwick book I have ever read, (thank goodness) because I would probably not pick up another one. The characters are one-dimensional, the fight scenes confusing and disjointed, and the ending was disappointing. There was not a steady sense of rising action and climax, but rather spurts of action and long strings of boredom. The love between the two main characters is believeable, and I think that is the only thing that kept me reading this book. Try one of Chadwicks other novels, or if you want really really great fiction, go for Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courageous and Creative","review":"I have never read a book on incest that has been able to so thoroughly keep itself away from bleeding-heart prose.

I thought it would be a great idea to invest in a 'better' instrument, but have been very disappointed in this particular whistle. As another reviewer mentioned, the high pitches are totally lost, and the lower ones get airy. The whistle only works for about 75% of its range. I am not sure why a cheap plastic one would work so much better, but it does. This one definitely looks better, and is more impressive, but if it is pitch or exploration you are working with, this particular instrument or brand isn't your best choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Let's Pretend Whistle","review":"The metal slide whistle I ordered from Amazon was purchased by my radio drama company, The Midnight Mystery Players, for two performances of Let's Pretend, a classic children's program from radio's golden age.

In \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" the whistle told listeners when the beast turned into ahandsome prince."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"Zhou Yu's Train is a very slow film without any real narrative flow. It is also over-long and exceedingly boring. Close-up shots of Gong Li \\"thinking\\" or slow motion shots of her running seem to go on forever.My main problem is that Gong Li's character comes across as a selfish and spoilt bitch. Just because she is beautiful and everyone wants to \\"have\\" her does not make her likable?She sleeps with a man and when he asks the stupid question \\"Do you like me or the poet?\\" She replies quite coldly the poet. This is almost verbal castration and extremely cruel.The film is beautifully shot but the settings are cold, ugly and modern.This film so wants to be a poetical and profound but really is nothing more than a humourless and far from entertaining exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRAIN IN VAIN","review":"Part of the problem may be Gong Li's superficial performance as a young artisan in love with a poet. She flirts well with the camera but does little to reveal the complexities of her character, likewise her dual role as an older woman who serves as narrator of the film, is lacking in depth and conviction. Beautiful cinematography and thoughtful editing can't make up for the overall emptiness of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddled Train Wreck of a Film","review":"Twice a week, Zhou Yu (Gong Li) takes the train to visit her lover, a poet, Chen Ching..................that's it!!!! Nice cinematography and soundtrack keep this train wreck afloat. Gong Li is absolutely wasted as a actress in this Sun Zhou directed bore. A film that counts on the \\"ravishing\\" Gong Li closeups and endless shots of railroad tracks is enough to make this a one way no return trip. Positively silly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zhou Yu's Train Wreck","review":"If you liked Gong Li's previous movies you'll hate this one. It is a tedious story of constantly oscillating emotions in a pair of romances that are hard to care about. Gong Li's title character does little but ponder her life and kiss a few men.

Leung is decent in her first role, but plays the part mostly through facial expressions - there aren't a lot of lines for her. Simon Yam, who is always fun to watch, plays her boss. Expect a lot of Hong Kong style action, with over the top violence and brutal fights. Unfortunately, the acting by the Caucasian cast is absolutely dreadful and seriously detracts from the overall movie.

Note that the illustrations are purely for amusement rather than providing visual explanations of the idiom. Some of the idioms are more popular than others but overall a good selection has been made. Each idiom is explained in detail and with example sentences and a larger context.Older readers will want to spend their money on a more comprehensive idiom dictionary, but this is perfect for children and those who enjoy reading to them. My only criticism would be that the idioms are presented in context and the examples are written at a higher level of English than what the overall genre seems to suggest would be appropriate. This book could be used with older/more advanced learners because of this, but the publisher seems to have aimed a little wide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thin, delightful, and satisfying","review":"American idioms can cause confusion and frustrate many English language learners. This thin, delightful collection 101 idioms uses humor, clear drawings, and witty captions to illustrate the real meanings of odd phrases. Many English teachers love the verbal and visual humor, and add it as a supplemental text for intermediate or advanced ESL students. The mocking tone, however, probably annoys the more prudish folks. Other adult educators might also feel that their precious class time is better spent on more practical life skills. I understand their reservations, but still strongly recommend it as a real treat.

Not only is she described as being beautiful, petite and has caramel complexion, but it turn out that she was also a virgin. Why must the heroine of IRs always have a caramel complexion or light skin or be biracial. The author makes it seem as if white men are only find black women attractive if they are light skinned.Not only that but i felt that there was no real chemistry between the main characters, the pacing was slow and the sex scenes really drag.Now i'm the type that usually devours IR but this one i could not get into at all.

The process of falling in love and working out differences is entertaining; especially so if humor is used to advance the plot.No Commitment Required, by Seressia Glass is not an easy read. It was cumbersome and hard to maintain the attention of this reader. I was especially disappointed with the character development and even the storyline. Most disappointing of all was that I wanted very much to enjoy this book as much as I enjoyed the book, The Color of Love, by Sandra Kitt or others I have read, I simply did not enjoy this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"It started to be an interesting read, but it fell apart","review":"When I started to read this book, I thought that I was going to enjoy it. It was such an awful book that wasn't worthy of finishing. Yvonne and Michael were irritating to me with their constant whining. My favorite character was Michael's dog. If I wanted a better written interracial love story with greater character development, I can rely on Sandra Kitt as better a read. What a...waste of paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't judge a book by its cover...","review":"though you'd think that the graphics department was po'd with the author for putting such an unattractive cover on this lovely book.I found that this book by Seressia Glass along with Three Wishes were really good reads. I'd have given it five stars except for that darn cover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!","review":"I bought this book because it got good reviews. When you read so many romance novel you can usually tell by the second or third chapter if its going to be good. I tried soooo HARD to like this book and finally I just had to put it down. The characters were shallow and not developed, the storyline just didn't hold my interest. I didn't feel a love connection between the main characters, and I also thought the story was hard to follow. Once again I got burnt by reading the previous reviews. If you want to read a good I/R novel, read \\"Being Plumville\\", \\"Blindsided\\" or \\"True Season of Love\\". This book was awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time or money.","review":"This book was horrible...It takes a lot for me not to finish a book. Yvonne was too whinny and the story line was boring. This will be the last book that I ever read by Seressia Y.Glass. Not worth your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic","review":"The book just left me feeling flat. I couldn't relate to Yvonne on any level. We've all suffered pain, tragedy and loss. Yes, it hurts and it devastates your life but you have to move on. Yvonne was content to wallow in her self imposed, self pity. I couldn't empahize with her charcter and I kept wondering why someone as wonderful as Mike would put up with her.I felt cheated. This book was not worth the time or money I invested in to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for the IR collector.","review":"Truly a must read for the avid IR reader. This book showcased the relationship between Yvonne a successful black businesswoman and Michael a white business consultant. These two have some very heavy emotional baggage which leads them to believe that it would easier and less messy to be in a relationship that requires no commitment. However they both learn that commitment is the one thing that they do want. In order to make such a commitment they will have to confront their demons regarding their fears of becoming close with another individual due to their painful past.By the way the love scenes between these two are HOT!!!!!! What I found somewhat different with this interracial storyline versus some others was that race was not issue for those around them; there were no disapproving friends and family members which was somewhat refreshing. I will be looking forward to this author future literary works."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST PAPER TO USE WITH CANON PRINTERS","review":"I print many photos. I have been using Canon printers for this job for 2 years now. I have tried other papers with the printers and most do a okay job. But I do notice a difference in quaility when closely looked at with the Canon Pro paper. I print a lot of 8 X 10\\"s. And the Canon Pro Glossy just really jumps out at you. If you were going to print a bunch of wallet size photos you can probably save a couple cents by using the cheaper no name paper. I have even scanned a bunch of B&W snapshots that my father took during WWII and enlarged them and printed them on the Canon paper. They all looked great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Written Book","review":"One of the best things about Peter Tremayne's Sister Fidelma mysteries are the well-drawn plots. This installment certainly lives up to expectations. Valley of the Shadow is a book steeped in Irish history and the different opposing religious and ideological factions that existed in that era. The author combines a deeply textured and fascinating background with multi-dimensional characters and a fast-paced, twisting plot in which you can't guess the solution to the mystery until the very end. I especially found the historical background very interesting. Tremayne has obviously done a great deal of research for this book. I greatly enjoyed reading Valley of the Shadow, and I suggest it as a wonderful read for any history buff or mystery enthusiast out there- and even if you are neither, I think you will find this novel intriguing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked okay pushing a RF P3 sub for about 6 months...","review":"When pushing a Rockford Fosgate P3 wired to 4 ohms, the amp would overheat and turn off after about 30 minutes of use.

The 41 mm design was classic, and I think it could be worn in multiple occasions. However, I had some concerns about the particular watch I received. This Aquaracer is described as having a unidirectional rotating bezel. The one I received had a fixed bezel. That in and of itself gave me enough concern to return it. I was also concerned about the watch band. This may be unique to Tag but the band felt hollow. It did not have a solid feeling, and had no weight.

It does more to try and scare you from herbs, than it actually tells you the benefits. In every single description of every herb, it tells you basically if you don't see results within 2 weeks, to stop and call your doctor.

This is almost ALL tools, not the 200 piece sets with 175 screws, nuts and nails. The fact that everything fits in the carrying case is a major plus. The few hand tools that I feel should have been included (this will vary by user) I will keep in a pouch where I store the case.

The first gaunt shot of Oscar stepping from the shadows is priceless, and Sim and Gerhard create new levels of creativity by melding their two artforms togetherEven though the narration is taken from actual letters, the pace is still suspenseful, even though the reader knows Oscar is going to die. But above all, Sim's story is about life and people doing what they do normally, and he showcases it all brilliantly. This is possibly one of the finest comic works ever written, ranking up with Sim's previous Jaka's Story, Moore's Watchmen and Miller's Dark Knight Returns"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read","review":"All of the previous reviews have very good points. This is a departure from the main storyline, Cerebus does not do a great deal in it, and the story was written before Dave Sim ever set his pen to his easel. But look at the other side of the comments, not one of them really regrets reading the story. This is one of the shorter chapters of the saga, and as a result it displays an agility and a skill level from both artists that is truly inspiring. This departure into the life of Wilde works very well with the trauma that Cerebus is going through and adds a greater depth to the storyline as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent drawings but the story is lacking......","review":"I bought this book to help my daughter with her fears of going to daycare. This book was recommended by an article i read on the problem and how to deal with it. We recieved the book and i have to say, i am pretty disapointed. The drawings in the book were nice but the story, specially the ending, was pretty pointless. It does a decent job of showing the childs fear of his parents leaving him at his baby sitter, but the ending, where the child realizes everything will be ok is just shown in pictures and not text, therefore the person reading the book has to explain to the child why the boy in the book is happy to be left with the babysitter. I could have gotten the same thing by just sitting down with my daughter and trying to explain things. If you are looking for a book to help ease the fear of going to daycare or a sitters buy the book The Kissing Hand by Audry Penn, it does a much better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Good Bye Book\\".","review":"This book was surprisingly bad. With my daughter going through separation issues this was recommended to read to her. Well, it's totally not helpful and seems like it's made more for adult humor. The sarcasm and negativity that pretty much is the content of the whole book except for the last page.

Even though the keys fit my hands nicely the wrist rest gets in the way of the shift key and the spacebar. My hands are cramping just from typing this short message. I could probably adjust to all of this, but the biggest problem is the 10 key. I have used a ten key for over 22 years with no problem and no matter how I try to position my hands on this keyboard I cannot hit the zero key! This is very frustating! Another big problem that I have is the rubber grips that should hold the keyboard in place don't catch on any except the center one so the keyboard is sliding all over the place while I am typing.

First, the poultry is brined and a high heat is used with roasting. This rotisserie is a major disappointment. One of the reasons it was purchased was to spare the oven. It needs to be cleaned after roasting as the high heat method does cause smoke (does not impact the taste). BUT, better that than inferior results. So, I am back to using high heat roasting that roasts the chicken in an hour. The second reason it was purchased was the \\"CLAIM\\" it can handle a 15lb turkey. My 13lb turkey was bigger than the rotisserie. WHAT A JOKE!!!!!I will buy another product that has a poultry tower AND roasts in an hour without having the chicken tied \\"just right\\" and positioned \\"just right\\" so it doesn't get burned.

Id be too embarassed to sell it. For starters, I know how to roast meats/chicken, and despite the \\"set it and forget it\\" claims, its not simple to use, more trouble than its worth, another gadget to take up counter or closet space. Even when you do the video, read the pamplets, its not easier to use than your oven and a good roasting pan. The item itself is VERY POOR quality manufacturing - an \\"easy bake oven\\" Rotiserie wanna be. The whole unit is not insulated, and it heats, so you must exercise extreme care. And use near your stove hood, because the smell isnt contained in the item. The concept is good, but the item is just a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product","review":"It is flimsy and the motor will start making a noise after a couple of uses.

I was outside shoveling snow. I wasn't even outside that long! You can't set it and forget it, you have to watch it (carefully). After that, I got up enough courage to use it again, and there is no way to set the temperature on the unit. I don't like chicken that is burnt. Even if you take it out faster, it stills burns it. I also hate all the cleanup. You have to wipe the entire unit down (even when you put foil in the drip tray). The regular oven is still the best way. I am an experienced cook (cooking for over 25 years (people love my cooking and ask me for recipes, and ask how I make my dishes) and hate all the cleanup with this unit.

What a mistake! after watching the video we carefully put the meat on the wheels making sure that it was balanced properly. We then placed the meat into the Ronco Inventions ST1000 Showtime Indoor Rotisserie & BBQ and watched it cook. After about an hour we noticed that the meat was no longer rotating as it should!

As a new owner, I was looking for any excuse to use my new rotisserie and used it several times. The problem came when after about 10 days the gear wheel broke. I immediately contacted Ronco because as a good customer the first thing I did when opening the box was to go online and complete the warranty registration. Boy was I ever shocked to find out that they would not replace the broken part. They said that the retailer I purchased it from was responsible and the retailer said that if it had been used several times and wasn't defective from the start that I needed to contact the manufacturer. This was eventually settled and the retailer took it back but I will not waste my money on another Ronco product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tasting chicken","review":"We had never heard of this product before a friend made us a chicken one day, which tasted great (like the supermarket rotisserie take-out). We bought one the next day and have used it frequently since, but only cooked chicken so far. It is easy to use and cleans up easily. Some things to know: You need to inject the chicken with marinade to get the best flavor. You will get your hands greasy handling the chicken and putting it on the spit. It cooks one chicken better than two (it's hard to get the center of the chickens cooked with two on the spit). The kids like to watch it cook and turn (which helps explain the quality of TV), and it makes the house smell great.Definitely worth buying if you like this kind of cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Information regarding operation.","review":"Bought item for gift.

At first, I was rather pleased... but after several uses... the machine started making squeaky noises as the wheel would turn. After that, I noticed that the built-in timer wasn't accurate. The metal vegetable compartment is a real joke. Vegetables turn out dry and the container is cheap. Cleaning is a lot of trouble. The metal reflector behind the element becomes very dirty & practically uncleanable.The good side to the rotisserie is that the poultry comes out delicious. On the other side... shrimps & fish are less miraculous. Them too, become very dry.Another bad point to the rotisserie is that the metal structure around it becomes extremely hot, making it dangerous if you would accidently touch it while it is in motion.Thus, I give it a 4 on 5 because of it's convenience... but not 5 on 5 because of it's small defaults in the construction."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome","review":"after being in the poultry industry and also being in the comercial I still hear nothing but wonderfull things from people all around the world about the Popeil Showtime BBQ.My family uses it weekly"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Kitchen Appliance","review":"This is one of three kitchen appliances that every bachelor should own (the other two are: 1) a microwave oven and 2) the George Foreman Grill).

It does a good job on chicken, roasts etc. However it is very messy to clean. Also, maybe it was the one I got but it just was not constructed sturdy. After about the third use, the knob cracked in half. We glued it together and so far it has held up. Then chunks of it have been falling off the back--the part where you wind the cord around. I don't beat it up so I don't know why that would happen. I do love food cooked in a rotisserie but I will not be getting another Ronco.

These fun stories, told in first person for added effect, carry the elements that has made American tall tales a unique literary genre (i.e., a mundane setting made extraordinary, the wild exaggerations told in all seriousness, vague references to others who can substantiate the story).

So I rented it. To be sure, there were some cool fights, but long, tedious scenes of the \\"top bad guy\\" yelling at his inept henchmen and plot over-development kept the fireworks from happening until the end and even that was a little weak and stunted.The plot device that kept getting in the way was the hallucinagenic drug theme. Snipes' character, Dean Cage, is injected with a drug that makes him believe he's in a past combat situation and his friend is in danger. Any suggestion is automatically believed - at one point he's told \\"You're on fire\\" and immediately we see his legs burst into flame. That was sort of neat, but they bang on this drum and rely on the theme that Cage is a poor hapless dupe so much - so sad for a renter who expected to some serious ass-whooping.

This might be acceptable if the author had balanced out the massive seas of empty text with massive seas of examples.

After trying many times to install the driver, I found out that the printer cannot work with a cable longer than 10 ft. Just to prove my research from other message posting that this was true, I hooked up the printer to a shorter USB cable and the driver and printer installed perfectly.

At first I was skeptical about this, but I connected it from my laptop to a multifuction copier/printer/fax, and it worked perfectly every time I printed. Allowed me to put the computer on one desk while the printer is on another across the room.Due to electromagnetic induction and data speed requirements, I think the USB standard's normal maximum cable length is roughly about 5-6 feet or so, but this cable seems to defy the all the odds. I'm amazed at the quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works with MAC","review":"I use this to feed to a Belkin 7-port hub. It works fine and there is no speed loss: some cables say the speed is limited to USB 1.0; there seems to be no loss of data transfer speed with this cable.

They informed me that they would not consider my request because the return window closed on 11/30 (Fri). Customer Service refused to make good on a $6 item ... sad.I wish I could rate the cable, but I was never able to use it! I would have been thrilled to post something positive for Belkin.

This book is such an insult for aspiriting writers turing to her for advice. She doesn't give it. Holding to her chest all her cards about how to really get published, she instead thinks she can sidestep that with advice on life in general. Title is great, the reason for the title is great (her brother was overwhelmed by a report on birds and the father said take it bird by bird) but that's where her depth stops. Too bad because there are so many people with a real desire to help and guide writers but this isn't it and neither is she."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"Managed to read one chapter with great difficultly.

This is my second favorite. I love the author's unique sense of humor, candor and practical advice. If you're looking for a warm fuzzy self-help, inspirational type book, this isn't it.

The simple language and clear, as well as humorous descriptions help you loosen up enough that writing just begins to spew out of your pen rather than it being forced out. Through the chapters, we uncover that Lamott is a real person with problems and joys just like us and not some faceless writer we can't relate to and therefore learn nothing from. Incredible ethos and a simple read. I recomend it to anyone looking to enhance their writing, no matter what skill level they are at."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have book for all writers","review":"I cannot say enough about this fantastic book by Anne Lamott. Bird by Bird is a must for all aspiring writers. It is inspirational, enjoyable and funny. I couldn't put it down--as if it were a novel.

Shes honest and guides you through the ins and outs.Definitely a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest book on writing and creativity","review":"As I tell my friends: this is likely the most under-rated book of all time. From organizing your thoughts, to finding your creativity, to getting it all onto a piece of paper, this book serves as a guide for every person that wants to improve their ability to communicate. Anne Lamott is a talented writer, but an even more talented teacher. Get this book if you'd like to improve every facet of your writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Step by Step","review":"the book is more than Excellent, it gives a wonderful tips for writers and for life as well. The concept of bird by bird (step by step) is good for all life elements.It is outstanding book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good grief...","review":"I was relieved to see that there were at least a couple of negative reviews here, so I wasn't alone. A much better book for aspiring writers is Julia Cameron's \\"The Right to Write\\" (or any of her other books, for that matter), Eric Maisel's \\"Fearless Creating,\\" or Rita Mae Brown's \\"Starting from Scratch.\\" These at least take for granted that the reader has some idea that you know why you want to write and are not trying to make you prove that you're \\"worthy\\" of Being A Writer. Frankly, I found Lamott's writing crude, her self-absorption depressing, and her advice on writing not terribly useful (what little there was of that). Although she certainly seems to love \\"teaching her classes\\" I have to wonder how much regard she actually holds them in, given that she's mocking their anxieties about publication at every turn. I'm not sure what she thinks aspiring writers are looking for, but it's not here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of course it's a partial autobiography...","review":"Anne Lamott writes nothing but. As the case with most autobiographies, it depends on whether or not you like the voice, and I don't. I don't see the wit and graceful humor of such phrases as \\"one reviewer said I was a treadmark on the underpants of life\\" or \\"spider puke.\\" (Seems these reviewers may have had a point.) Nor am I interested in her alcholism, her politics (hates Republicans--big surprise there), her eating travails, or her extremely superficial spirituality. What saved this book from a one-star rating was that she had decent advice for writers--just sit down and do it, write badly, carry index cards, etc. But that's probably been covered elsewhere without having to sit through the debris of Bird By Bird."},{"rating":"2","title":"SELF ABSORBED.","review":"Much of the book is autobiography. The author writes well and the book is full of humor, but it's a sad book overall. And it's an angry book. The author isnt fond of Southerners, evangelical Christians, and anyone who is more successful than she is. She comes across as another flake from Marin County in California.Still, she has plenty of good advice for newbie writers and the book is entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Lamott ever","review":"This is my favorite Anne Lamott book. She is just so fun, so real, so laugh out loud funny. I have used the \\"bird by bird\\" story many times, with my own child in fact - hope that's ok Anne."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bird by Bird Fitting Title","review":"The title's perfect for this book: Bird By Bird offers a bird size portion of writing instruction. What it does provide is a hefty serving of hope for any writer with nothing to say, little talent, and a lot of pages to fill. What's sad is the author's total lack of respect for emerging writers. She cares little about teaching, and instead uses her bully pulpit to justify a very troubled life. Anyone can sympathize with a sad past, but does leading such a life qualify one to advise others? I think not. If you want to learn to write buy any other book. If you want to support those who need helpp with addictions, donate to a worthy charity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever","review":"I was duped into buying this by all the glowing reviews. Not only is the material lousy but I became so disgusted with the author as a person I couldn't stand to read another word. She is a pitiful person and I cannot imagine anyone wanting to read a word she writes. This is a book about her sad life much more than about writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"I found this book very depressing. Anne Lamott's constant self-deprecation throughout the book caused me to really doubt myself as well. I know she is doing it to show that she's human just like the rest of us, but I think she can show that without hating on herself every chance she gets (saying the 9-year-old version of herself looked like a neurotic cat woman, etc.) despite what she says about how you shouldn't do that. It's like hanging around with a bunch of anorexic models, it gets to you.This is not a good book for people who are not sure they are writers. I am not a writer but I am interested in writing and I would very much like to write fiction but I have a lot of trouble writing authentically. Lamott sends the message that \\"As long as you're a writer, as long as you're in our secret little club, everything will be okay!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Bird by Bird Review","review":"When my English class first began, we were given two choices for books to read. I chose Bird by Bird and I fully regret my choice. I found the book boring and useless. It was more about her life story rather than about writting. She taught me NOT to write because I will fail at it. She also taught me that most writers are mostly insane. Anne Lamott came off as a crazy woman who hates writing and is dooming herself to fail. If you want a good book on writing I recommend Stephen Kings On Writing. That is a good book to learn how to write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tossed it in the trash in just 30 seconds.","review":"Received the book today, opened to a random page which discussed finding a helper similar to her friend who loves to kill cats. Excuse me??? I threw the book straight into the trash can. I won't give people like that the time of day let alone take writing advice from them. If I want to be around cat (or other animal) haters and people who think cruelty is funny I'll return to software engineering (or go work for the NFL)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Necessary for any writing career...","review":"I first heard about this book from members of my writers group, and I now agree that this is an essential book for any writer. Lamott is funny, irreverent and reassuring for any writer -- beginning or experienced, amateur or professional. During a particularly dark time in my own writing, I found myself laughing and crying at the same time with recognition. It helps to know your problems are universal to all writers. It helps that someone can see the humor when you can't. I go back to this book again and again whenever I need a reminder, and I buy copies for all of my writing friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, go out to lunch instead.","review":"I have to say that from the start of the introduction I was disappointed. I was put off by her descriptions of her father's habits. Trying to give her the benefit of the doubt, I continued reading. With each passing chapter, I grew more and more disappointed and disgusted. To say that this book is repetitive is an understatement. All the tips given can be explained in a total of 300 words. Each chapter has a tip to use for \\"better\\" writing that is then followed by pages of stories of her sad life. These stories have nothing to do with the point of the book. The part of the book that made the author lose all credibility with me was when she told a story about her using cocaine. Needless to say, the book has been returned. There is no way I would buy it and let the profits support her lifesytle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite book--highly recommend it","review":"This is a great book. I wish I knew Anne Lamott. I reread it several times and went on to read her other books. Really enjoyed every word!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"I did not care for this book. It read like the writer's attempted to mix humor and personal stories about her life with some writing tips (many of which I felt were poor).Switches frequently from stories about her personal experience, references to God, and advice on writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did she have to tell the writer to act like a 'big autistic child'?","review":"Really? It happens in the first thirty seconds and totally put me off the rest of the book, I returned it to audible and told them why. In this day and age, an editor didn't tell this woman that would be offensive to all us parents of 'big autistic children'? Is there not another way to say a writer must become single-minded in their pursuit? I really wanted to like this book, instead it put me in a crappy mood and I cried. What a waste, and shame on you, you're an adult, you should know better. Now go act like a big developmentally disabled child yourself, and see where it gets you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writer About Writing","review":"Having struggled the issues of writing she discusses here, I wanted very much to find some guidance from Ms. Lamott. Unfortunately, there was precious little of substance. It is rather a collection of riffs on the standard topics covered in writing classes. As others say here, this is not a systematic guide for wrestling with writing, but rather her thoughts and impressions on the process. There is an audience for this kind of book, maybe writers like her. Scattered, mildly amusing, telling more about her than the difficult craft of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Money","review":"I also bought this book due to its positive reviews, but found instead- a bunch of rambling by a neurotic and possibly bi-polar woman. I did like some of her humor, and yes, I probably share some of her same mental illnesses, but that is not going to help me start writing my book. She gives maybe 4 or 5 pages of advice on writing, and little advice on life. I was hoping for a combo of a self-help and how-to book, but just an autobiography of a woman who wanted to purge her problems. Stephen Kings \\"On Writing\\" is the best how-to book I have read as of yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for Both Writers AND Readers!","review":"Lamott shows by example what good, even gifted, writing is; her writing is accessible and expressive. she is a bright writer who is not afraid to show her imperfections or to reveal her fears. This book is a practical guide for writers and those wanting to write. Bird by Bird, though, is far from the usual dry and academic writing manual filled with how to's. It is about a writer's passion, and therefore is inspiring. It is also highly entertaining, and it is for those who appreciate good writing and want to know more about the guts of the process. It is for those who read, not simply for those who seek to begin or improve their own craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Bird by Bird \\" would be a perfect English Composition text.","review":"I wish that I would have known about Anne Lamott while teaching Freshman Composoition. What a great textbook, \\"Bird by Bird\\" would be starting with \\"shitty first drafts.\\" So many times one sentence in a student's paper shone, \\"That's what your paper is about,\\" I would say, or \\"What a great idea,\\" or \\"I hear your voice here.\\" As Lamott points, out all that writing was worth one good sentence and perhaps is the only way to achieve it - get the words down, even if most are cast away in a later draft. \\"Bird by Bird\\" provides guidelines for the writing process from a writer who has been there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that impressive","review":"This wasn't what I was hoping for. It left me with a who cares and where are we going next response."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh-out-loud funny","review":"Whenver people ask me about books for writers, this is at the top of the list. With her wit and wisdom, Lamott offers a peek into the often wacko world of writers and writing. Some of this is laugh-out-loud funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight on life and how to tell others about it","review":"Anne shares her plight of being an author and how you can join in the suffering. She shares her struggles, victories, and obstacles and the effect they have on life. Practical how to's are woven into delightful stories that open up your mind and heart. Start writing, start today and do what is in front of you. Bird by bird indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to your broccoli","review":"I've read a number of other books on this subject, and none of them comes close to this one in wit and enlightenment. Not that I profess to be a writer, but I do believe that it is one of the hardest, lonliest, and most punishing of professions. Ms. Lamott's honest yet encouraging depiction of the travails of anyone crazy enough to try his/her hand at this, ALMOST makes ME feel crazy enough ... A bonus is her eloquent musings on the-meaning-of-it-all, equal to the efforts of famous philosophers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"Lamott tells it like it is. Don't expect any more than a shi**y first draft when writing a screenplay (one of the chapters is called \\"shi**y first drafts\\"). You polish it up on the second draft. Lamott is able to keep a writers expectations in check while also giving right motivation to finish a screenplay. I'd recommend this book to any writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book on Writing","review":"She is an amusing and informative writer. I enjoyed some of the jokes, and was moved almost to tears by some ofthe stories and anecdotes. I really enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"This book is about life, death, writing, jealousy, school lunches, voices in your head, and everything in between. Lamott is funny and witty and entertaining. I've never read any of her work before, and after reading Bird by Bird, I want to read all of her other books. Even if you're not a writer, this book is worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing or Group Therapy?","review":"For writers? I don't think so. This hodge-podge of \\"how do I feel today\\" stuff is really for the weak of mind who can't handle the notion that writing is a craft, not a group therapy session. Most often, Lamott references movies, NOT BOOKS, to make the points that her insipid writing cannot capture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, Occasionally Obnoxious, but Never Dull","review":"I think she could have written the actual writing advice in half this book, but at least she did the rest (partial autobiography) in an entertaining way. The first section and the last chapter were the best, but the other parts...were...what...? She urges the reader to write about one's childhood, but what if the aspiring writer doesn't want to begin at this point? Lamott lost me once she started describing character and plot...maybe, I'm just not that smart but she spoke in concepts and I just didn't click with her style. Found Julia Cameron more useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-indlugent trash for the self-preocupied.","review":"If you are a writer haunted by self-doubt and keep battling the daemons that haunt your ego, this book might give you a couple of insights on how to start writing. There are some useful tidbits for the rest of us, but these are difficult to find, and force you to read the rest. You will find no guidance as to creating a better plot, or characters, as the chapter names would lead you to believe.I expected a book like \\"Structuring Your Novel: From Basic Idea to Finished Manuscript\\" from Meredith and Fitzgerald, but with a personal spin. But instead I got some new-age drivel. Its nice to see that the author found solace and escape in her writing (and if you believe the description of the accompanying video, other things), but I wished she would have given us more of a book on writing then one on her personal pains."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"This is a magical look at writing. Lamott is a one of a kind writer and person, and every year more of my students discover this wonderful book.The Tao Of Writing: Imagine. Create. Flow."},{"rating":"1","title":"A surprising disappointment","review":"Wow. I so disagree with so many of the reviews. Though well written itself, I found the book meandering and without purpose, certainly not living up to the sub-title, \\"some instructions on writing and life.\\" Better writing books abound, and as for instructions on life, well, all it inspired in me were periodic eyeball rolls.Natalie Goldberg lite. And I realize the irony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"Despite the vulgarity, I managed to stick with this book until she got around to mocking the reader about \\"the myth of publication.\\" Hmmm--nice that myth came true for her. Just read that her next novel is getting a 1.2 million advance. I can't imagine that her students are really less talented. Buy Julia Cameron's books instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, come on....","review":"Very over-rated. I find an overwhelming anger coming through this book--it's kind of scary....."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for anyone who wants to write but isn't","review":"If you are already writing consistently and have no problem getting to the page each day, pounding out pages and are confident that you are doing great work, you might not get anything out of this book. For everyone else, this book could provide you with nothing short of revolutionary inspiration. This book, along with Julia Cameron's \\"The Right to Write,\\" finally convinced me that I couldn't stifle my creativity anymore and that I would never feel truly fulfilled until I got to the page each day and wrote. Thereputic and motivational, this book doesn't necessarily offer any earth shattering wisdom, but instead delivers it's teachings in a way that it is almost impossible not to \\"get.\\" Be warned, it is a little slow going at first, but if you stick with it you will be rewarded. I have given this book many times to frustrated writers and have never gotten anything less than an exhuberant response. Plus...it's hella funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BORN WRITERS...","review":"I enjoyed this book. It felt more like a collection of essays than a chronological piece. Lamott offers encouragement but also lets one see just how difficult it can be to be a writer. Reading her tales of misfortune and misfire were inspiring; even people who are \\"born\\" writers are not necessarily born writers. Her narrative showed that it takes effort and dedication no matter how much one likes to write.I found this book inspiring. Also, she's quite funny at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought this when I was in middle school...","review":"...but I never got past the first few pages.Thankfully, I recently picked it up after graduating from uni this year. I have to say, the timing couldn't be more perfect. I'm glad whatever \\"cosmic\\"* pull forced me to buy this at a young age, and equally glad I waited this long to read it. Heavily recommended for new writers, old writers, and most importantly, those of us experiencing a certain emptiness--whether regarding writing, or life...although I'm sure Lamott (as well as myself) would argue the two are inseparable, anyway.-b*I put this in quotes not for irony, or humor, but because Lamott often uses the word in humor & seriousness. It's just a fun word."},{"rating":"2","title":"great creative writing tool!","review":"Got this book as a required text for a writing intensive English class. The book is full of helpful tricks and tools to aid in creative writing. If story, memoir, or any fiction writing gives you trouble, or you are just seeking advice or supplemental perspective, this would most likely be a helpful and entertaining read. Very quick and easy read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The brutal, honest truth about being a writer","review":"Anne Lamott gives practical instruction on the process of writing and takes the reader on a journey from wishing to be published to writing for its own sake as art. She does so in her own funny, neurotic way, alternately making you laugh out loud and thank God that you're not as loony as she is on her sanest day. Her book will encourage real writers and miff those who just want the fame and glory they think will inevitably result from being published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Step by Step","review":"This book is a great tool. It gives new writers some beginning directions, and provides continued advice for continuing writers. The book is conveniently broken up into five parts to help you find your way back to your level. In addition to the highly credible instruction that is provided the anecdotes and analysis will help motivate you to the next level. This step by step approach is exactly what you need to help you get started. Anne cuts through the mystery of a lot of aspects of writing and lays it all out there for everyone to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange title, huh?","review":"Great book, though. I was assigned this book for class; I had to read it. That said, it's one of the best I've ever read. Sometimes the title of a book can be misleading or can suggest that the book's contents aren't conveniently or understandably arranged. While Lamott's book definitely reads as a novel, it can be read gradually and could even be treated as a text for a class. My teacher approached it in this way, ignoring the book's basic premise: a book to read about writing. But hey, it worked. My teacher's great, Lamott's great, and I leave inspired. And I think the same can happen for anybody if for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks","review":"I was at the Student Academy Awards watching these award-winning films and wondering why I rejected so many of my script ideas. As I saw these movies, I realized that many of them had thinner premises than my rejected ideas. When I shared this insight with the person sitting next to me, he recommended that I read the chapter on Perfection in Lamott's BIRD BY BIRD.Well, not only did I read the chapter, but I ended up reading the whole book. It is an entertaining and inspirational read. There is nothing in here that isn't \\"common sense.\\" However given the uncommonality of that particular virtue, I recommend this book to anyone insterested in reading a good book or writing a good book (or script).Thanks Akshat for recommending this book. And thank you Anne for writing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"writing and life","review":"I truly enjoyed this book, it is a humorous take on writing and life. Bird by Bird is a magnificent motivational tool for the aspiring writer because of the personal stories that provide helpful hints. This is a book that i will definately read again and again. A must read for anyone who wants to write a great american novel or someone who wants to read a great american nonfiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Briefly on Bird by Bird","review":"There are many wise suggestions here and people would regard each of them differently. For me there were two helpful insights that stood above the others. First, successful and even famous writers aren't flawless people - in life or their careers. They make mistakes, struggle, and experience the darkest depths of despondency. But what sets them apart from those who don't succeed is they persevere and don't quit.Secondly, we have to be truthful and care about what we write. Otherwise the audience will spot the inconsistencies and shun us.Bird by Bird is more inspirational than anything, and in order to have a fuller understanding of the craft it should be supplemented by a more technical book such as \`The Techniques of the Selling Writer' by Dwight V. Swain, or 'Keys to Great Writing' by Stephen Wilbers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bird by Bird","review":"The book came in good condition, and in a timely fashion. Excellent selection for new writers, or those who need to re-vamp a down-turn in motivation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want to be a Writer? Read this Book!","review":"For anyone who wants to become a writer, or just get some practical advise from someone who has \\"been there, done that\\", this book is for you. Witty, honest, and down-to-earth, Lammott's work doesn't disappoint.Well worth having on your shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generous Writing Advice","review":"I enjoyed Bird by Bird and learned from it even though I write nonfiction. Lamott details the emotional and financial ups and downs of being a writer without sugar coating anything. She discusses the real payoff that is artistic or intellectual. And, as Lamott says, most writers \\"pay through the nose\\" for that payoff. The book also gives helpful and humorous advice on writing techniques. I would recommend this book for any writer.Lamott has been there and done that in writing and publishing. She generously shares her joyful and painful experiences and the wisdom she has extracted from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensible and Practical Advice","review":"With so many failing writers out there trying to cash-in on the how-to market, I assumed that Bird by Bird was another superfluous rendition of the same old junk published in Writer's Digest.I misjudged this book.Not only is Lamott's offering candid and witty making it a pleasure to read, but her perspective on managing the difficulties all writers endure was fresh and insightful. This is a book that, if you do write, you will readily relate to. Lamott does not purport to cure these inevitable maladies. What she does do is demonstrate a humorous philosophy for minimizing the negative effects these problems can have on, not only our writing life, but, our life in general.In comparison to the many other books professing answers to the myriad difficulties of writing, this humble and modest work stands alone. Bird by Bird is neither a how-to or why-to manual, but rather a rare glimpse into the mind of a writer dealing with the pains and pleasures of being a writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book on the writing process...that helped me.","review":"It really inspired me to write seriously and to be meticulous about the details.Highly recommend it for serious writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live \\"Bird by Bird\\"","review":"I adored this book and I'm not a writer, nor planning to be one. It was so funny and brought me to tears. Anne Lamott's work is useful and uplifting. Living your life \\"Bird by Bird\\" is excellent advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the best book ever written about writing","review":"This is a book for people who care about words, about sentences, about the craft of writing. Artful and interesting, analytical and yet somehow deeply personal, you'll love every carefully written word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly a Milky Way of stars, actually.","review":"This is a must for anyone who wishes there really was some sort of instruction manual not just for writing, but for living. Of course, every writer -published or not- must have at least five copies. One to read yearly and others to loan and never get back. But I think orthodontists and house painters and paralegals and bird watchers would do well by it. It's wise, is the thing. It truly is like sitting down and hearing some really good advice that you really need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advice from a self-absorbed neurotic","review":"Anne Lamott's book has some useful advice for writers. Unfortunately, this could be summed up in about 500 words. The rest of the book is supposed to contain profound and insightful advice on life. I suppose whether you like this will all depend on whether you want advice from a self-absorbed neurotic. I would suspect that if you are fairly well adjusted and can deal with life's ups and downs with dignity, you will find the author becoming more and more annoying as you progress through this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotionality, no meat","review":"Besides being an English Lit. major and spending large dollars for \\"writing books\\" and a \\"wall of fame\\" with all of the diplomas, this much-lauded book butts the rear-end of the caboose. Inspirational maybe, good writing - yeah perhaps, but no cigar. If you need inspiration or minor spiritual development, go for it. But beware, 'cause you may feel even more neurotic after reading it! If you prefer practical, meat and potatoes advice, don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bird by Bird. Some instructions on Writing and Life","review":"I was happy to spot this book on amazon.com as I dream to become a very, inecredibly famous writer one day. The title also intrigued me as the play on words \\"bird by bird\\" in the title was a great idea. However, the book itself dissapointed me. How an experienced writer, someone who teaches other how to write could use the word \\"writing\\" 5-6 times on half of the page? There is also an overwhelming feeling of ...depression and sadness almost on every page...The author underlines it everywhere that writing is difficult and will bring nothing but unhappiness to the unwise person who will undertake such an dangerous and devastating task. It is a mixture of personal history (sad one) and some tips on writing.Unfortunately not my type of book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expert writing advice with a funny and easy style.","review":"This author is a new find for me, but I will surely read much more of her. She is fabulously funny, incredibly informative, and absolutely generous with her thoughts and feelings and expertise on writing. The book warmed me, and made me feel that I could continue my writing with a stronger and better perspective. For aspiring writer's everywhere, and for writers published and not, this book will take you on a journey and offer invaluable advice for your hard work. It will help you revive that natural urge to write and keep you plugging away at the keyboard during the very worst of slumps. You will also laugh with Anne Lamott, the author, who is hilarious and honest and very witty. The practical and real life advice will stay with you as you struggle to become the writer you already are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time and money is better spent elswhere","review":"Very little writing advice. This is more about the authors feelings an experiences than any thing else. Her fathers advice to his son writing a book report about birds is the best part of the book. The worst is her telling you to give male characters three inch penises."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rehash of Another Author's Book","review":"I can't believe that no one else has recognized that Bird by Bird is nothing but a rehash of Brenda Ueland's book, If You Want to Write--A Book about Art, Independence and Spirit. Only Ms. Ueland did it so much better--back in the 1930's. The original author teaches us how to write--without all the self-serving rhetoric of the copycat.Grab a copy of If You Want to Write--get the real McCoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining But Slight","review":"Bird by Bird is an instructional guide on writing with a good helping of life on the side. The title \\"Bird by Bird\\" is taken from her father's advice to her brother who was agonizing over a book report on birds: \\"Just take it bird by bird.\\" Lamott's suggestion on the craft of fiction is personal and pragmatic: worry about the characters, not the plot, getting rid of jealousy, the anticlimax of publicaiton, etc. She wisely advises writers to form support groups pieced together with family, friends, and other writers. She observes that sometimes you won't get good support from writing groups, but you'll need them to keep your sanity.If you are looking for hard core advice on writing, you may find this book a bit slight. Some of the chapters are only a few pages in a small format book. But if you are looking for entertainment, diversion while you are stuck in your own writing, inspiration, the word on the path taken, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"eating for the enjoyment of it","review":"Norris encourages eating for enjoyment (physically, mentally, spiritually) He sets a stage to do this and uses baby steps to build on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I thought this book was the personal journey of the author's weight loss. The text goes on spiritual and New Age tangents. I am sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"VAluable tool!!","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone that has lost and gained hundreds of pounds! I googled 'spiritual weightloss'... and this is what i got!!! I still follow the eating plans (food pyramid).. in this book and find the spiritual information/suggestions to make the difference between this...and just another diet book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I think with anything if you apply the principles you will be able to reach your goal.This book helps you lay out the much needed principles of losing weight and when I followed it...I lost the weight!If you start back your same eating habits then this book or no other will help you keep the weight off!I know I have to start back getting in shape!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not clean floor what so ever","review":"I purchased this in about December... I took this to my mid size kitchen and dinning room after sweeping. Yes there was dirt on the pad. Then i was curious to know if it had even cleaned anything. So i got on my hands and knees with a lysol dual action wipe. As soon as i touched the floor with the wipe you could see the dirt through it. It was uterly disgusting. I refuse to use this mop again. You think your floors are clean but in reality its just spreading the dirt around and only picking up what it wants to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst floor cleaner I've ever used","review":"I purchased the starter kit, and before I could finish the 4 pads that came with it the handle broke. I didn't abuse it either. It seems like not all parts of the pad touch the floor. I squirt the solution, mop and I can see that parts of the floor had solution smeared on it, and other parts where still dry. Then, when I'm done mopping the floor, I can do it all over again. This is the worst floor cleaner I have ever used. I miss my Swiffer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Mop Ever","review":"In sum the product is not good at all. I feel like you really have to scrub twice as much as you do with a regular mop. I clean my floors everyday so it is not like my floors are super filthy. And the streaks that it leaves make it even worse. I am not impressed and I am actually adding it to my yard sale this weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was really disappointed with this video. There was not enough introductory stuff for the beginner and basically no useful information for an advanced caster. White says in the beginning of the video he will teach you how to be a more efficient caster. This will reduce the amount of false casting you need. That was it! He didn't mention how to reduce false casting at all. In fact, 99% of his casts were false casts! If you are even an intermediate caster skip this video. And try one from Lefty Kreh."},{"rating":"1","title":"gasket was wrong","review":"I don't know what I received, but it was not the right gasket for my car.

Another remarkable feature of this guide is the detailed history given to each town or monument or region listed. It's a little shy on maps, however, because although there are detailed guides of certain sections of the city of Barcelona showing buildings, streets, and recommended walking cultural iteneraries, there is no good map of the entire city on one leaf. It also leaves a bit to be desired in the \\"rest of catalonia\\" category. For example, only a short vignette is given for the fine Roman city of Taragonna. Overall, I'd recommend this guide to anyone planning to visit Barcelona."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Travel Guide","review":"I always buy the DK Travel Guides. They have the perfect amount of history, maps, and photos; sometimes more info then what you will receive when at the tourist spots..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A one dimensional story","review":"All the characters in this book are very one dimensional. You \\"see\\" what they do and \\"see\\" where they live, but you don't get much below their surfaces. The American couple is stereotypically unable, and unwilling, to assimilate with the \\"foreign\\" culture around them and the animosity between the cultures, in my opinion, never gets resolved. The wife's character develops as close-minded and neurotic instead of sympathetic. I felt the book was a visual essay that put me in the location, but wouldn't let me talk to anyone! I finished the book wishing I knew more about the lives and motivations of everyone in Ibarra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stones for Ibarra","review":"This is one of the best novels I've read in the past few years.

I didn't think it was dark at all until I read some of the other reviews..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow...","review":"Is really the best way to describe this book. There is no readily identifiable plot to the novel. Aside from the colorful descriptions of Mexico (which certainly adds something to the text), there is really little entertainment value in this read. If you are looking for a fictional escape, this one deserves a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Stones Thrown","review":"I came online to order this book for the book club I'm in in Grand Coulee, Washington (Quite a Motley Crew living along the Columbia River). I read Stones for Ibarra a year ago. It simply was one of those books that I couldn't put down. I have reflected on content in this book several times since that read. Thank goodness Harriet Doerr weaves her tale in a reasonable number of pages without submitting to the temptation to overtell or persuade. I wasn't bored and distracted like usual with many contemporary novels. This book is written beautifully. What I didn't understand intrigues me more about this book than what I did think I understood. This book merits discussion with the gals and guys of all races and creeds that read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Nature of the Book","review":"The Nature of the Beast is a fantastic book. Written by Janni Howker, it is set in the north of England during the Winter of Discontent. It centres on a semi-nuclear family (son, dad and grandad) living in a milling town called Haverston. The mill where the inhabitants of Haverston work is closing and at the same time a \\"beast\\" is terrorising the neighbourhood. When a reward is offered for a genuine sighting of the beast Bill Coward and his friend set out to gain proof - and get the money! All does not go as planned however, and from there on in Janni Howker sets up a superbly twisting story combining the natures of Bill Coward and the beast, his dad and his grandad, culminating in a gripping finish. This book will keep you reading whatever your age, and is money well spent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the price","review":"I waited 10 days after purchase to write this review because I wanted to test the accuracy of this watch. I can safely say that the time gain is about 10 seconds, which means on average the watch gains one second a day. Even by COSC standards (the Swiss time-keeping institute that awards certificates to superlative chronometers like Rolex and Breitling) this is very good indeed. I believe the movement is in-house made, though the base caliber is probably from ETA/Valjoux. My version is blue, though black is equally handsome. Note that the latest versions have \\"Aquaracer'' on the dial but I don't think it makes any difference performance-wise. Also note that Longines have just a couple of months ago released a line that looks similar and is about US$300 cheaper but the finishing on the TAG is much better.

The theme of the book is essentially demonstrating how Senna, faced by ever inferior equipment, still conjured a world championship and a string of brilliant race wins- culminating in 1993 when, despite having no chance of winning the title, he still managed 5 wins in his slow Mclaren-Ford. This compared favourably with the 7 managed by Prost in the all conquering Williams-Renault. More than just a record of Senna's brilliance the book also captures some of the essence of his enigmatic personality and the effect he had on those who followed his career. Not a complete picture but perhaps the best Senna book- showing him in a few short years doing what he did best and showing why he will forever remain peerless."},{"rating":"1","title":"average","review":"In my opinion,Mr.Hilton has a great literature talent,but I don't believe that he completely understood or understands Ayrton.There are just too many contradictions in his telling mostly because he himself wasn't sure what Ayrton ment when he said or done something.Mr. Hilton is a great writer but not so great psychologist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great single","review":"Tracks...1) Pic-A-Nic (feat.

I'd recommend it if you need a serial mouse. It isn't anything fancy, but it gets the job done. I certainly wouldn't recommend this mouse if you have a PS2 or USB connection. Not that there is anything wrong with this mouse, but there are better mice designed for newer interfaces.

The games are for children from 12 to 24 months. I bought it for a 2 1/2 yr. old and he's pretty far beyond many of the suggested games. For a younger kid, it would be pretty good. All the games feature stuff that's laying around the house and they are very short games, which is great for kids with an attention span of about 2 seconds! I would recommend this book for anyone with a baby, but be forewarned there's a lot of gushy stuff in there like \\"sit back and watch your little cherub have fun!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better options available to you,","review":"It's not a bad book, there are just better better options, I enjoyed the following and use as a reference:The Encyclopedia of Infant and Toddler Activities: Written by Teachers for Teachers.

There are a handful of interesting, thoughtful games, but mostly it is totally ridiculous, like - go outside and feel the wind in your hair and hold a worm in your hand, or build a tent indoors with a sheet draped over a couple of chairs. Maybe useful to someone who has never played before, but there is almost nothing in this book that is new or interesting for any parent who was once a child or has spent even a minimal amount of time around children. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was diappointed in this book. I expected a whole bunch of ideas for simple games. What I got was a book which spells out what we already do with our daughter.The \\"games\\" consist of things as obvious as pointing to a toy and naming it then having your child point to their toys as you name them. I mean, who doesn't know to ask thier child \\"Where's your kitty toy?\\" or doing this little piggy with them.Those are not \\"games\\" so much as simply interacting with your child.

The Cape League was pretty big back then, but has climbed to new levels today, and Touching The Game gets it right. I loved the human interest stories from the summer of 2003, and look forward to seeing if any of these players make it to the Major Leagues. And the stories from such baseball luminaries as Nomar Garciaparra, Todd Helton, Frank Thomas, Buck Showalter and Jeff Bagwell are classic! But the film is more than just baseball, it accurately portrays what summer is like on Cape Cod, especially for the kids. If you are familiar with the Cape Cod Baseball League this film will be a terrific depiction of what you remember. If you just love baseball, and want to learn more about this great league, Touching The Game covers all the bases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understated piece","review":"Not many people can wear silver and have it look really good.

Don't waste your money on this or it could cost you as much as 3-4 times as much. However, I guess I'd recommend it if you have received numerous red light tickets in the mail or you run redlights every day.

Honestly, I didn't over tight the screw.I put it over my front license plate (I live in Illinois) only to protect myself against Laser radar. I think everybody who installed this cover over the license plate take a chance to be ticketed for obstruction the plate as it can be seen clearly only when you look at it absolutely straight. If you have a cop looking at your plate at the slight angle, at least couple digits would be distorted or hidden from being seen them at all.

I don't care for the shine, if I'm in a public area and need a knife for somthing I like to keep a low profile but the shine almost draws attention. The lockup is O.K. when opened but don't put too much confidence in it because it will close if there's too much pressure on the spine. The pivot screw did loosen up on me easily which made the blade rest on the liner but with some blue locktite I was able to secure the pivot screw and center the blade. Since I used the locktite I must have opened it a couple hundred times and haven't had any issues with the pivot screw loosening any more. The blade does not keep an edge at all and needs constant sharpening after almost any use but you can get it razor sharp fairly easily.I have mine in the junk/tool draw now and only use it for small tasks. For the price it not horrible but it won't hurt to shop around a little"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites.","review":"Being an amateur collector of knifes, I snagged this a while back for the minimal price tag. With free shipping and $11, not much to put into it. But man, I definitely got my moneys worth. This is the knife I carry on my pretty much all the time. It is a tough puppy.There is little to no blade play, but if there is any, you can tighten the torx screws on the side. I loosened my just slightly to make it slip open a little easier. The pocket clip is in the perfect place in my opinion. And a minute issue, but the knife is a beauty.This knife is easily operable with one hand. I can open it with a flick of my thumb completely. I did get one little knick in the blade from everyday usage. I sharpened it a bit and it looks almost good as new.Overall awesome knife and definitely worth the $11."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Steal","review":"I've used this knife as my day-to-day pocketknife for over 6 years now. It's the blade is as sharp and the action is as smooth, as the day I purchased it.Just so you know. It takes the perfect amount of pressure to open. Just a light thumb-flick. It has no squeaks, nor wiggles. Just a smooth slide with a light click when fully extended.The close is solid. I've never had it open unexpectedly, or felt is slide partially open in my pocket.It might be hard to tell by the picture, but there's a machined scale-style grip ground into the metal. The texture is nice, and it helps maintain control of the knife. (Smooth knives tend to slide around in my hands.)I would recommend this to anyone.

And it operated smooth as butter.After opening my new one from Amazon... I am frustrated as to how difficult it is to get the knife \\"opening\\" initially with the thumb stud!

I was so happy to see that she is writing again, but this book does not hold a candle to her earlier novels. I found it disjointed; Lynn tries to tell too many stories, none of them satisfactorily. Just as I became engrossed with one set of characters she dropped them to focus on another group. She attempts to give depth and background to each of these people by off-hand references to earlier events in their lives, but this is more annoying than tantalizing. Perhaps she needed to make this into two or three books."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Good to have her back, but cruel and violent\\"","review":"In her previous books, especially Sardonyx Net, we saw a writer dealing with issues of slavery, power exchange, and physical and psychological cruelty. In Dragon's Winter, the physical cruelty is on the ascendent and seems sometimes more important than character and plot. She is a wonderful writer, and she develops characters and makes you care for them a lot before they are brutally dispatched. I haven't read too many fantasy novels since the late '80's, so maybe the genre has changed and I'm behind the times. This is a really good book, and I look forward to the second one, but I was put off by the violence and cruelty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's all the action!!!!!","review":"A massive disapointment! The fact that none of the main characters were safe from Lynn's overkill habit, meant that I could not settle in to the story.

Not everything on this CD appeals to me and production values are not always consistent. But, it is truly worth the investment if you like great jazz piano.A few years ago I needed a music score to accompany a news documentary I was producing. Rob Mullins, who is a Grammy nominee, seemed right for the part. He was a delight and eager to be part of the project.I've got most of Mullins' work on CD.

In fact I already took and passed the test, and this book really did help quite a bit. My disappointment lies in the fact that much of the text information is not on the quizes or tests themselves. (ex: nothing about fiction and drama were in the practice or the real exam re: plot, characterization, style), so I felt that it was a waste of my time, as I could have concentrated more on MLA information, which is minimal in the text, but present in all tests. The other thing that was disappointing was the Software disc. It is compatible solely with Windows, information not found on Amazon, but in fine print.Anyway, it is what it is, but you asked and I figured this info could be helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough.","review":"There are obvious grammatical mistakes in this book, which is a little scary considering the content it's supposed to be teaching. However, if you can look past that, the Freshman Comp review section is pretty decent. I didn't use the tests in the book but I did use one of the tests on the CD. It doesn't work on Mac so I had to switch over to the Windows side. Not a big deal but kind of annoying. You don't need the CD past installation so that's nice.Overall, I read probably 3/4 of the review section and got a 74 on the multiple choice test.

Sad to say, this CD, recorded in Rio in the late 70's, does neither of them justice. The playing wanders along aimlessly, with both men sounding like they're not quite all there (which they probably weren't.) The recording quality is appalling. In sum, this CD is a mess in every way.If you want to discover (or rediscover) these giants of Brazilian jazz, you'd be better off looking at their other (ANY other) recordings.

I haven't met a woman who wants to devote the time and energy to learn this properly. Most women go to groups (or take a few private lessons) and learn a few steps, but cannot execute moves and adornments that make tango fun. Just walking through tango steps is NOT dancing the tango. Obviously a man needs a good partner, someone who can improvise and supplement his moves (energy), but in my experience I've found it frustrating. The Tao is all about letting go, and being one with creation, but struggling with a woman who can't move is NOT how to do it.In Argentina, children learn to dance the tango early in school. There is no fairy godmother who'll tap you with her magic wand. If you think you can dance the tango after reading a book, supplement this book with a private coach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding the Power of Balance","review":"The Tao of Tango is successful because it probes the right questions.As the result of \\"feminism\\", we can enjoy a fairer balance of power with men, but what femininity is still remains a complete mystery to us. The book dares to praise passivity, surrendering and following, and reminds us that those words can still carry derogative connotations. At the same time it tells us about male and female energies present in each one of us and with that, it frees us of limiting patterns of behavior.Dancing Tango is a beautiful way to play, rehearse and observe how we are as women and men.

There's a good flashback about one of the characters summers spent at a lake, it was well written and hard to put down for the first few days, then after that it all got a bit confusing. Nothing is really well explained, there seems to be about five stories in one, you wonder whether Laymon was thinking about keeping it in just to prove he had a lot of ideas, at one point during the book where Diana goes into the house full of old hags, I felt like putting the book down it was so far-fetched.

It's very enjoyable feeling it develop and following the various themes that he develops and periodically revisits. If you're a veteran, read this one, it's still pretty riveting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior Layman","review":"There's a reason why Layman didn't publish this book while he was alive. It comes across as a lot of ideas, many completely unrelated, awaiting the editing required to make them a cohesive novel. The whole thing starts out as a murder mystery concerning a teenage girl being terrorized by a cleaver wielding maniac who kills her boyfriend, then, half way through, this entire storyline is abandoned as we find ourselves mixed up with a police officer who may, or may not, be a vicious serial killer. The plot is fuelled by ridiculous contrivances and coincidences, and character behavior is unbelievable. Anybody familiar with Layman knows that his female characters will take all manner of insane risks in the pursuit of sex, but those in 'The Lake' go even one step further and frequently jeopardize the lives of all around them just for a quick shag with a good-looking stranger. Of course, the whole thing is compulsively readable, as Layman always is, but it's definitely a second rate effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good at all","review":"this is the only richard laymon book i have read...and i think i will give him another chance, despite this book. it was really terrible. while i was reading it, i said at least 5 times to whoever was around: \\"this is probably the worst book i've ever read.\\" i could not get over how many plot mistakes were made. i believe someone mentioned this, but in one scene, deana tries to use the house phone and finds that the line has been cut. then leigh gets home, discovers deana is missing, and she picks up the phone and calls someone. leigh identifies the body of the chef killer in the morgue but then somehow he shows up shows up at her house a few days later and asks for money. there was mention of people having cell phones, yet no one ever seemed to use a cell phone. i still do not understand the point of the old lady down the street. i do not understand how this novel got past the editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lake starts solid, but eventually drowns in plot twists","review":"I've been a fan of Laymon's for quite some time, but this book was definitely not one of this best. While the first half of the book is wonderfully written -- especially the segments chronicling the romance of teen temptress Leigh and her innocent prey, Charlie -- things eventually go terribly awry. There are a few too many plots unfolding at once, and more than a few details simply ring wildly false. (For example, a woman hangs in a hot tub and has sex several times with the new man in her life over the course of several days, and yet apparently at no point notices that the hair on his head does not match the rest of his furry body... which is a major plot point.) If you're a fan of Laymon's and insist on reading everything he writes, there are certainly worse books out there.

The times when you got pumped up and into it were so few and far between that the in betweens seemed endless and longwinded. Maybe because I'm a fan of Edward Lee I've gotten use to non-stop action and suspense that anything else is dull, but I don't think so.The ending was so predictable that when I decided to quit reading I jumped to the end to see who was \\"the bad guy\\".SPOILERYou have a killer who likes to take pictures of his victims, and you have a cop, who is close to the case, who likes taking pictures of his girlfriend in unusual poses.....HHHMMMM.

By the way, the \\"good advice\\" I referred to earlier, just so we're clear, is small and practical and usually not necessarily altogether hypnotherapy-related; for instance, for those who haven't been there before, keeping a small blanket in your office is good advice, not only for those occasions when a client may feel cold, but also for those occasions when a client wears too short of a skirt..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"How To\\" for professionals","review":"For those who have ever met the author, they will recognise the same wonderful conversational tone in his writing, which is what makes this book so easy to read and useful.

I respect Mr. Banyan as a hynotherapist and businessman, but writing is clearly not his best talent. This book is poorly written and there are several typos, which is unprofessional looking. The author has also employed a hypnotic writing technique at the start of each chapter that states everything \\"you will learn\\" in the following chapter. It is annoying and time consuming. I don't want to be told what I will learn, just give me the information.While the book has some merit, most of the information can be gatehred by reading the free articles on his website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for amateurs","review":"Do not buy this book if you have any interest in learning about hypnosis or hypnotherapy.

The author's writing style is laborious and tedius. Like many of the newer hypnosis books on the market, it is a rewrite of the existing best seller's like Elman's Hypnotherapy whom have come before. It is not written for a beginner. I would recommend saving money and picking up Dave Elman's Hypnotherapy, Hypnotherapy written by Kevin Hogan or Hypnotherapy by Roy Hunter. John Watkin's books regarding Hypnotherapy and War Trauma illustrated with casework will provide the hypnosis practitioner as well as the layman with a well grounded foundation in the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooring (yawn)","review":"So you see, taste differs.So much stars, I thought: This must be good, let's listen.But no, this is not my type of music.

And I'm not even factoring in Brown's homophobia (which, even as a straight guy, I found annoying) or the fact that a chronic alcoholic-- I'm sorry, _heavy drinker_-- could function as well as this reporter does. The ending, in which the reporter keeps the killer at bay (for several hours!) is deliciously bad in the best tradition of wretched pulp fiction. I recently read a few W. R.

Of course there are many places to learn organizational skills once the need for them is recognized.

Still, I nearly tossed the book, and it would have been a shame because part two is where the filler ends and the valuable content begins.Ultimately it's well worth the money, and it's a shame that it isn't in print any more.

We get lousy action, boring sequences, low-budget effects, and sub-par acting. Last but not least we get a story that is totally dull and has practically nothing in relation to the original.

The photographic cinematography was as horrible as Beverly Hills Cop 3; however BHC3 had a score that they used throughout the movie. The movie score at the beginning of the movie was reminiscent of Conan or other slayer movies, but it was hardly used in the movie. The grade school stage backdrop sets were as laughable as the CGI. The story would have been ok if it would have had Talon and his mighty mercenaries save the queendom; however Talon does not appear in this movie. The Stranger, Lee Horsley, was a nice scene, if only he was used throughout the movie. You just have to wonder if Lee Horsley, Kevin Sorbo, and Ralf Moeller lost a bet.

WRONG!!!A few nick-picks about this movie: The biggest one is this... Every single 'big scene' or 'battle' or 'fight' was just simply narrarated. The narrator herself has some obsucre connection to the movie that is just.. confusing. It is confusing because the whole \\"Final Battle\\" was just simply talked about by the narrator.You'd expect the \\"Oda\\" charactor by Michael Pare to be \\"Talon\\". He is \\"Talon\\" in all but name and even have the three bladed sword. But Lee's charactor is just a cameo called, \\"The stranger\\" and that was confusing also.Another thing.

It's also not sharp in low light (probably because the flash has no range) and the shutter speed does not react fast enough for any action shot--very disappointing on a recent ski trip.

I am not a heavy user (only the occasional vacation and special events) and I certainly did not abuse the camera. I believe the camera would be out of warranty by now which means I would have to pay Sony to ship it to them so it can be fixed.

I just realized that might be the red eye reduction which does seem to work fairly well most of the time to some degree but it's tough on kids.- No date stamp.

Sadly, I cannot think of a way verbally to describe the music for other potential buyers, so caveat emptor.Also, I note that Amazon told me only one copy was left when I placed my order, and now only one copy is left again.

I am sure we have all had fears of being paralyzed for life and the torment and helplessness that it would subject us to. Doug makes us rethink about God, about prayer, and about how we lead our lives and the consequences we face in the next life.

Homes Music for Torching is a dark, twisted book, a satirical disection of a seemingly normal suburban couple and their lives. No one is faithful in their neighborhood and all hide deep, dark secrets, yet all carry on as if they just walked out of a Norman Rockwell painting. The story is told in a snarky, sarcastic tone with very amusing results. Some scenes are stronger than others, the best being devastatingly funny satires of suburban barbecues and dinner parties. Music for Torching is not for all readers, just those who enjoy twisted dark comedies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A.M Homes is a soothsayer!","review":"And I thought her short story about a teenage boy having sex with his sister's barbie doll was outrageous:Music for the torching goes even farther. With painfully realistic, flawed characters, Music for the Torching has a climax which left me speechless: where in a nine year old boy takes a classmate hostage in the cloak room and shoots him in the head. I wanted to be re-assured its only a story, that things like this don't happen in the real world, but all I have to do is flip on the T.V. or buy a newspaper to see that indeed such extreme violence is not fantasy but fact. On the brink of the Columbine massacre, Homes is dead on target. She couldn't be more timely or realistic. And not only are her plot and characters incredible but so is her method of story-telling. Homes is by far one of the best writers of our generation and she has already been a great influence on my own writing. I can't wait to see more from her."},{"rating":"2","title":"AM Homes is a soothsayer","review":"I recently finished reading A.M.

Homes takes us on a malefic joyride through American suburbia, devolving every aspect of this sacred territory with each page.

With the characters she first intoduced in her short story collection, THE SAFETY OF OBJECTS, A.M.

Homes is such a hugely talented writer, it is a shame that she wasted that gift on this story. Provocation is one thing, stooping this low to sift through humanity's dreck is quite another: spouse abuse, rape-like sex, chronic infidelity, child abuse, nervous breakdown and child murder--all in one story. The characters are universally unlikeable, the plot contrived, and the ending way too long in coming. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst piece of fiction I've seen in years.","review":"What was she writing, a screenplay? We're apparently meant to be titillated by the characters actions, but there is absolutely no attempt at describing a single thing. The characters are speaking, but what else is in their world? How can we decide if it is them, or the world they live in that's deplorable?Surely an axe murderer such as Raskolnikov, would make A.M. Homes quiver. But he offers a chance for the reader to see a much greater picture than Homes can even pretend to comprehend.For torching, pass me the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"haunting... you'll be thinking about it for months after reading.

Homes. I honestly cannot see how any person would want to finish this dark novel....I certainly didn't. Homes is a good writer but she needs to find better subject matter and lighten up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another vote for \\"boring, stupid, and trite\\"","review":"I had to force myself to finish it. It wasn't just that I disliked and felt no empathy with the characters (I didn't like Hannibal Lecter, either...well, actually by the end of \\"Hannibal,\\" I did sympathize with him). Homes simply failed to tell a story. The book felt like a Robert Altman movie, only more disjointed. There's no motivation behind anything anyone does, and by the time I was halfway through, I couldn't care what happened next.. Second, the book was trite. This is territory that's been covered by Updike and Cheever, but much better. Finally, the book lacks credibilty: in this age of self-help, with support groups, videos, websites, and books availble without limit, it's hard to believe that adults could careen so impulsively and cluelessly from one inept misadventure to another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book is bad. Why follow up with characters that had no redeeming features in the first place? There was no need. Moreover, it works against the simple understated style that leaves the audience filling in certain gaps for themselves. Further, the author is trying to get cute with us - it isn't enough to re-hash old stories, she feels compelled to refer to her other characters as well (like Claire from In a Country of Mothers). This story left me empty and annoyed that I'd spent the money. A major disappointment from an author who usually provides compelling, thought provoking stories delivered through good writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda bland.","review":"This book dramatizes what happens when you realize that your life has been slowly creeping up to smother you. I'm still not sure if I am disliking this book because it is dark but without other rewards (e.g. supple prose, delicious epiphany) or if it has done it's job with unlikeable, miserable characters that you'd like to give a good shake. They all seem so stagnant that the author, at a loss for a conclusion, seemed to throw a big movie-of-the-week finale on the end. That, I am sure I did not like. Then again, was I supposed to take the ending with a big wink-wink? I like that even less. This book wasn't painful, but it wasn't a depressing delight either."},{"rating":"1","title":"So, where is the music?","review":"The topic is by no means extraordinary nor the social satire. In life is impossible to avoid conflict and regardless of the location of the planet where you live you will find it. So here the couple feel that their existence is boring and meaningless, but if we look closer the reason for their drama, it is never really brought to life by the author. It does not seem to me that she wants to denounce anything in particular about human experience in suburbia, or to open the mind of the reader to issues that somehow live hidden before our daily lives. The burning of the house is an empty act that leads nowhere. To some degree it was not even necessary for the development of the story. Nothing in the book rings true, and that is the problem, the book might be fun to read but it fails to move you or to provide any type of insight. As always the praises that we see from the critics are just part of a marketing show."},{"rating":"1","title":"What????","review":"I still don't get how you come to the ending of this story. I think I read someone's review that likened this book to a car wreck that you cannot help but slow down to look at. The characters are incomprehensible and sad, yet I found myself laughing quite a bit, feeling like I should apologize for my own rubbernecking."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm getting deja vu","review":"This stuff about the infidelities and the warfare of suburban family life has been done in numerous movies and books. This is why I didn't enjoy this book, because it doesn't distinguish itself from a book like Rick Moody's Ice Storm (which has more masterful prose) or contemporary women authors like Lorrie Moore. The prose is so-so, mostly dialogue and simple descriptions. I give this book 2 stars instead of 1 because the last ten pages or so were pretty good, but not enough to redeem the whole book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, captivating, voyeuristic read","review":"Wow. I can understand the uneven reviews above. Funny, sad, pathetic, true. Is it a satire, a week in suburban life, a biography, a guide to family values? At times I was reading, saying no, no, no, yet couldn't put it down. I love a writer who can make the most bizzare events and behaviors seem normal, and in some ways, rational. Hell I don't know what to think about this book. I need more time. I know it moved me, is making me think, and will be with me for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Despite the book being well-crafted in terms of prose and dark humor, the story itself is old and tiresome.

I likedThis Book Will Save Your Life, and recommended it to others, but it didn't make me want to rush out and read everything Homes has written. This did.This book is definitely not for everybody. It's raw. Homes isn't polite. She's aggressive and in your face, and I love it. It's definitely not for the sexually squeamish.It's not heavy on plot, but rather people. Stuck people. Trying to make it through another day, grasping at little bits of happiness and then being left with just the echo of the moment as reality sets back in. The people felt so real to me, even though they were slightly exaggerated versions of those we know in real life. Ourselves. Our parents. Our neighbors.I would never have guessed how it would end. And I'm glad for that. I was completely taken off guard. How often does that happen in writing anymore?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dysfuntionality","review":"The book was terrible, the characters were insipid and not developed at all. The characters were dropped into the story in full dysfunction without any background of how they got that way. It was not a case of one or two dysfunctional characters, but an entire global universe of dysfuntionality.The book was ended with a terrible scene that did nothing to resolve any of the issues brought up in the story. In fact, not one issue brought up in the story was resolved. Even the \\"blockbuster\\" closing was left open-ended.All in all I found the book totally disappointing and unsatisfying. So much so that I will go out of my way to avoid books by this author in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shallow wade through sexual waters","review":"I picked up this book because of a review on the Today's Show which touted it as dealing with the current concerns over child violence in our schools. Well, the book totally does not deal with that issue. Rather, it is a more in the vein of 'Diary of a Mad Housewife'. The preponderance of the book is consumed with lurid and detailed sexual acts (which do indeed keep your attention) but are not very well wrtitten erotica. If erotica's what you want, try Anais Nin's 'Delta of Venus'. If you want to read (yet another, yawn) a 'Wah, Wah, Wah, I'm a Bored Housewife' story, then here's your book complete with philandering husband, lesbian experimentation, and general malaise, boredom, and lack of fulfillment. It's a light read devoid of depth, insight, or even a new perspective on an old and very trite story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torch This Book","review":"Wow, what a clunker. Unimaginative and filled with the cliches of modern life in the cul de sac, where all children all sullen, all housewives lead lives of pill-fueled quiet desperation, and all husbands play hide the pickle with soccer moms.I could forgive the hackneyed themes if the writing itself were masterful but it wheezes along with the grace and wit of an upper-level land grant university literary seminar. The best thing about this book is that its memory won't linger with me for any longer than it takes for me to toss it in the dumpster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Zero","review":"There are few books as empty,shallow and pointless as this nonsense.It is strictly meant to shock,but fails.This is the type of literature found in two-bit magazines and in college writing courses.Homes also seems stuck in the mindset of an adolescent with her laughable attempts at erotocism and/or provocation.Her characters are strictly cardboard fronts and cliches;the dialogue is sub junior high school level.Worst of all,the novel is totally beyond being in the realm of the believable.Even more,the author seems confused on what she wanted this book to be.This book reads like a satire and total farce one minute and the next it grasps for earnestness and fails miserably on every front.This is a true waste of time and paper.Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant, disturbing, and not worth the time or money.","review":"This is one of the few works of fiction that I could not force myself to finish. I couldn't muster up a thread of interest or compassion for these despicable characters, and I am truly perplexed by the generous praise this author receives. I find Homes' prose flat and childlike, with cheap attempts to shock. There is wonderful fiction out there. Spend your money and your precious reading time on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Stinks","review":"AM Homes only appeals to book critics who are so bored with their jobs that they get all titillated when someone tosses every imaginable horrible human event into one book. Who are they kidding? This book is dreck. Homes writes about repulsive people who bear no resemblance to anyone I've ever met. With so many things to think about in these complicated times, you would think that Homes would try to say something important, resonant, thoughtful--OK, just funny. But I guess it's a lot easier to just take the shock route and leave any real thinking to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cat Barked?","review":"At some point in our lives, we all wish to be someone else.

Several activities are given for each song. Activities are geared for ages 3-6 and are clearly defined and easy to re-create. I bought this book a little early - I find I use \\"And The Cow Jumped Over the Moon\\" by Pam Schiller and Thomas Moore more often right now as I have toddlers at home, but I look forward to my children growing into these fun activities.

The writing seemed to drone on without any real punch and it never did foster any real excitement for the evolving story of New York as the center of the art world.

The word \\"dialectic\\" was used much too many times.When I finished the book I'm not sure what I read.

As an amateurish preventative measure, I \\"lined\\" the bag with a down jacket and several baby blankets to prevent damage to the seat and was VERY pleased to find that neither the car seat nor the travel bag was harmed. The zipper still worked and the material, though a little more brittle for the wear, remained in good shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking bag, but unreliable","review":"We purchased this bag from Amazon in May 2008.

I cook a lot and I always like to try other people's creations and cookbooks. I found this book to be incomplete with cooking instructions and oven temperatures. The book also doesn't explain why we would want to eat a pie made with raw egg yokes. There is a process that takes place when you blend lime juice, in this case, with Key lime juice and raw eggs.The lime juice literally cooks the raw eggs without heat as in Fish Ceviche.It is an age old process and is quite safe.A good book author would have included such information and made every recipe precisely clear and easy to understand. With so much public scare and bacteria in our foods, we should be informed about cooking with raw foods."},{"rating":"1","title":"A calculated rip-off","review":"Another reviewer pointed out the fact that this bundles some items for the original Zire and others for the Zire 71, so unless you own both models, half the included stylii and screen protectors are useless to you.

If you want your child to be an average, ordinary, everyday person who is content with reading insultingly easy little stories that are complete gas and bunk, go ahead. The inanity of this magazine would be amusing if it weren't so pathetic. Don't get this magazine! Your brain is a special thing-don't let it deteriorate completely. You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless and unenriching","review":"As a child I remember finding this magazine at my doctor's office and reading it because it was the only thing available. It has not changed much. There are no redeeming features to make up for the dated and patronizing content. This Magazine will neither stretch your child's mind nor keep him entertained. It only teaches the child what he already knows and feeds him what he has already seen. In the coming era of global connection, children must become aware of other parts of the world and lifestyles alien to them. Only telling them what is already common in their everyday lives helps to foster racism and xenophobia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still spamming after all these years","review":"I loved Highlights as a kid, and my older children (now grown) loved it also.

You have got to be kidding me. No way, no how, would I ever again knowingly do business with this company! Their business practices are unethical. And they market to children - go figure.

The graphics look like something from the 1960s, and the stories are moralistic and boring.

Its stars shine as a memorial to the era. At her elegant best as an opera singer seeking to save her brother, a young Jimmy Stewart, from a life of crime, Jeanette MacDonald follows his trail to the Canadian Rockies. There, Royal Mounted Police Sgt. Bruce played by Nelson Eddy, committed to his duty as an officer of law, uses MacDonald, (Rose Marie) as a decoy to get his man. Their words of love are painfully sacrificed in the echoing hollows of the magnificent Northwest. The music haunts the story throughout. The pace of the drama is flawlessly done, directed with total honesty to Friml's artistry. No detail is overlooked in this poignant drama of idealistic love, so masterfully commanded by both MacDonald and Eddy.

There is no question that these professional women possessed the drive and the talent to establish interesting careers, and yet most of them fell into obscurity except perhaps on the regional level. The history of Modern American Art has generally been associated with the east coast but this book is a revelation and a very juicy one at that. So many different visions expressed with competence and flare.

Those deadly battles in the Hurtgen Forest have been overshadowed in military history and popular imagination by the more famous \\"Battle of the Bulge\\", and yet the gripping depictions of combat, terror, and the revelations of lethal blunders in A Dark And Bloody Ground make it a truly recommended resource for avid students of Military History in general and World War II Studies in particular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Some parasitic infections (like heartworm for example) can be deadly for your pet.

One Of Deanna's Best Films.","review":"This movie is full of good things: an escapist story line, a good supporting cast, lots of laughs, and six good songs. We get two helpings of \\"Beneath The Lights Of Home\\" a popular song at the time, and still popular with members of \\"The Deanna Durbin Society\\" today. The plot is uncomplicated: Robert Stack is Deanna's boy-friend, who shows more interest in his car than in her. Enter the older man Franchot Tone. He's a representative of a scientific organisation and has come to do business with Deanna's father. Deanna becomes attracted to him, and so on...The video ends with the song \\"There'll Always Be An England\\". This song was only added to the film on British release. Deanna sang it direct to the audience, and no doubt her English parents would be just as delighted as the British film-goers who went forth into the black-out feeling uplifted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great capacity and a good price.","review":"Recordable media is now an extremely important factor in the computer industry.

Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great opportunity missed","review":"This could have been a brilliant book - the subject certainly has spectacular prospects - but it was not to be. Fifty years on there are few survivors of the legions of the Kempeitai, and even fewer survivors of their victims. It could have been a timely piece of scholarship. Instead we are treated a poor collection of anecdotes which lack suffcient breadth and analysis to be evidence of anything other than the incidents they describe, not the Kempeitai as a whole, nor their operations. More disappointing is the author's unconcealed antipathy towards his subject, as a result of his father's wartime experiences. If you need a book on the subject then consider buying it, but otherwise look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"kempeitai: japan's dreaded military police","review":"Japan's military police were as evil as the more well known german geatapo. The daily lives of the military police and their prisoners is glossed over. More detail is put into the administration and organization of the military police. The book is very dry reading and not much of a story. Time moves quickly in this book, with not many pages devoted to any one area or incident, but with only 168 pages i suppose that is to be expected. An interesting title, reduced to very boring reading, i am disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Important chronicle of World War II History.","review":"The author talks more about atrocities than the counter intelligence role that the organization played. The only intelligence type stuff they discuss is the Ricard Sorge(Soviet Master Spy in Germanys Tokyo Embassy) capture and interogation. The author does catelouge the atrocities committed by this organization well though(Hence the title Japan's dreaded military police). The author explains the disgusting things that this organization did like make sex slaves out of Korean and other Western Women captured by them during the war, decapitating allied airmen, biological experiments on POW's, stuffing prisoners in Bambooe baskets and liteing them on fire. He also explains the sickining fact that many in this organization went unpunished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dry, and very uninteresting.","review":"The writer is a serial author, who claims to have close to 50 books published. Although the topic is very important and few writers have tackled this subject, he makes it very uninteresting. The Kempeitai killed many American POWs and experimented on bacterial agents with jailed inmakes. These are also the guys who kidnapped women in conquered countries to serve as comfort women to the Japanese armed forces.The shortcomings of this book are many. Perhaps a few more established true stories about how and why prisoners suffered. The author tries to tell the organizational side of this terrorist organization and spends more time using the Japanese words to describe the various ranks.

I have played both of her Gabriel Knight Mystery Games (Sins of the Father and The Beast Within) am now currently working on the third one (Blood of the Sacred Blood of the Damded). Millennium Rising's plot is nothing like her Gabriel Knight Novels, it is more ambitious. It's a conspiracy to conquer the world!!! The issues involved ranges from Religious to Political, fantastic!!! This book is very engrossing and addictive, you have been warned. My only one dislike is that it's too tragic, the Pope dies tragically, not exactly ideal for the Catholic readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has Millennium Rising mutated into Judgment Day?","review":"This seems to be a re-titled re-release of Jensen's terrific first novel, Millennium Rising. Preachers and prophets of many faiths gather in a tiny Mexican village where they are visited by visions of Armageddon. As each hurries back to his or her flock they set in motion events that will either save or doom them as cataclysmic events wreak havoc on the world. Is it the end of the world or is there a vast international conspiracy that has set in motion events that could get entirely out of control? Father Michele Deauchez was at Santa Pelagria but even though he had the visions (uniquely tailored for each participant) his cynicism leads him on a quest to visit as many of the world's spiritual leaders he can find. Starting out like an end of the world apocalyptic novel it wraps up in the finest of SF tradition."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Lucked Out","review":"I just happened by this book while looking to use up a gift certificate.

I only wish that our political and religious leaders would read this one as well. Please, give yourself a treat...READ THIS BOOK. And, Jane Jensen....please write more!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent plot, exciting themes!","review":"I have long been a fan of Jensen's Gabriel Knight mysteries, but was leery of her seeming millenial frenzy. Don't let the cheesy title scare you off! This is a great thriller - it's what I would imagine it would be like if The X-Files investigated the Apocalypse. Even halfway through the book when a big chunk of information is revealed, Jensen keeps you guessing until the last chapter, when you finally understand how all the details (seemingly thrown in for background) fit together.The themes of redemption, trust, faith, and honor run throughout. No one is evil or saintly - the reader can at least understand, if not agree with, all motivations. Deauchez's personal journey - from skepticism to faith in the human spirit - really drives the story.This is not just a religious or apocalypse novel (and doesn't have too much to do with the millenium). You won't want to put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting Reading!","review":"I love books that catch your interest beginning with the first paragraph, and Millennium Rising does just that.

It is the battle between good and evil, told in a way that will not let you put it down. The blend of religion, New Age beliefs, the echo of aliens from outer space, and memories of Woodstock are all there.This is a blend of political intrigue and corrup-tion. The title of the book fits the story perfectly.

I found an average 1 mistake per page, causing me to question every word written. As examples, according to this book, Vitamin D is 25 hydroxylated in the kidney (should be liver), alzheimer's has equal prevalence in males and females (F=2M), classical C5 convertase is C4b2b3b (should be C4b2a3b), Myesthenia Gravis is a result of desensitization block of Ach receptors by autoreactive antibodies (antibodies do not act at the ligand binding site, but serve to cross link receptors --> increased internalization), and this is just to name a few.I recommend choosing another book for your studies."},{"rating":"2","title":"LESS IS MORE","review":"If you ever study for the USMLE and you want to have a single book to give you the confidence that you are covering the basics, pick this one. I recommend it as a starter. There are many tables and high-yield diagrams. If you want to have the \\"synoptic\\" and \\"big picture\\" companion to the selected high yield topics in First Aid to the USMLE, then do pick this one. Big printed text and relaxed style makes reading a breeze. A confidence builder. Admittedly, not exhaustive but remember the maxim: Less is more."},{"rating":"1","title":"About as much depth as a newspaper headline.","review":"It is clear that this book is not meant for those taking the boards exam seriously.

There is just not enough depth for a lot of the things covered by the boards. Also, there are quite a few errors in here, and no errata published by Princeton Review. That means that everything written in it must be checked elsewhere and confirmed before it is useful. On the plus side, for a broad and nonspecific overview of topics like gross anatomy, genetics and immunology, the book did a good job.

Still a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun tale","review":"I feel like almost every fantasy I pick up these days is a massive epic. Sara Douglass' Beyond the Hanging Wall was a joy to read because it was so simple.Without giving to much away: The story follows a doctor's son who must go with his father into the prison mines to tend the sick as an apprentice. But after he learns more about the prisoners and their treatment (especially one prisoner in particular), he must choose to act or let the evils of the world be as they are.The story's not too exciting, it's not too epic and it's not too great. It's just a good fun weekend read for just about any light fantasy lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of a yawner","review":"I have enjoyed some of Douglass' books, but I found this one to be a disappointment. There was never any character development - the main character was the same at the end as he'd been at the beginning. There was never any suspense - the outcome was never in doubt for a second. For example, when proof of the prince's identity is needed, someone shows up within minutes (it felt like that short a time, at least), with the only object that could prove the prince's identify in his pocket.While the book kept me busy for a couple hours it didn't have me riveted to my chair. I kept hoping that there'd be some real action, or some reason to actually care what happened next, but nothing ever really developed. I was sorry I'd spent money on it, as I doubt I'll read it again. Save your money and wait for the paperback if your library doesn't have this book on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"I love Sara Douglass's works (start with the Axis Trilogy if you're new to her)! Not always the best quality of writing, but her characters and story lines are captivating.I totally missed this book and read the Darkglass Mountain books first.

I did use an organic greek yogurt as a starter(bought in grocery store), no need to buy special starter. I think that if you did not use a fat free product the yogurt would be very thick-but I don't need the fat! and it was fine for me. I use it in smoothies, on cereal with fresh fruit.Yummee"},{"rating":"2","title":"Salton Yogurt Maker Is Very Good","review":"I am making yogurt for the first time on this Salton product, and it is performing exactly as described.

Great recipes on the Web. C.H."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken jars","review":"I have to echo the complaints of several reviewers about the fragility of the glass cups. After chilling the yogurt and removing the lids from several of the jars, I broke off a large shard of glass. Are the lids simply too tight? Why aren't the jars Pyrex? This is a terrible problem. The yogurt maker itself works all right when the desired yogurt recipe is used. But what good is the delicious yogurt if the glass shatters when you want to use the yogurt?"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 jars broken in two weeks? Buy a different yogurt maker!","review":"The yogurt is indeed delicious, and the machine works quite well. The glass jars, though, aren't tempered like Pyrex, so they don't respond well to the combination of temperature changes and tight-sealing plastic lids. One jar chipped, a section about the size of my thumb, when I peeled the lid off a few mornings after I made the second batch. I thought I must have been too eager to get the thing open, or that I put pressure on it from just the wrong angle. When another split all the way to the base after the fourth batch, I realized the glass jars just aren't a good idea. Maybe another brand or model's glass jars are sturdier? I don't know, but I wouldn't recommend this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"badly designed lid","review":"The lid is lightweight, flimsy, & irregular in shape which makes it slip off easily and since it's clear, it's difficult to tell that it's not closed all the way. There's no handle on the lid to hang onto, so when it slips off, be careful it doesn't drop onto the floor & crack or shatter. The yogurt turned out just fine, but I suggest buying a different design."},{"rating":"1","title":"JR Cancelled the order.","review":"I ordered this yogurt maker for 19.99 and with Amazon Prime sold by JR. Waited for 10 days to get it shipped. Now JR called me this morning telling the company stopped manufacturing. I came to Amazon and voila.. this is being sold here for 29.99 by another seller and no mention of company stopped manufacturing. Within a week? Did the company really stopped making it or each seller is just selling their stock. I am loyal Amazon customer for many years but this is not a good way to serve. I see other people just got this recently from Amazon. Better check the stock with seller before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"Following the simple recipe and procedure outlined in the booklet that came with the yogurt maker resulted in delicious yogurt. I used Dannon plain fat free yogurt as a starter along with fat free milk and a half cup of powdered milk as suggested.

Nice quality and easy to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality - Not worth the money","review":"I was excited to start making my own yogurt again, as I use to do about 20 years ago. When I got this machine I thought it would do the job, I was wrong!! First of all the machine stoped running after about 4 hours, and the heat from the bottom unit would not spread out to all the jars. I followed all the directions and my yogurt came out watery. Too bad there were no ratings on this item when I bought it.

However, after I made my first batch, one of the cups shattered in my hands as I was opening it. As another reviewer said, I'm a small person, and I manage to use glass items all the time w/o breaking them, so I don't think it's me. I have returned this item and ordered a different yogurt maker. I would not recommend this item because the cups break so easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salton Does it Again!","review":"The yogurt is kept at a constant temperature until it is creamy and delicious .

I usually make 1-2 batches a week, using yogurt as a starter, and always get great yogurt. My kids devour yogurt, so I figured making my own would save some money - and it does! Sometimes I use greek yogurt, other times Stonyfield. It always comes out delicious, even when I forget I'm making it and leave it on for too long.Very durable. None of the glass cups have broken, though the sides of some lids have split. They still fit tight, just look used. I really like that this machine uses glass cups, instead of other brands that use hard plastic. With all the hoopla around BPA lately, I feel safer using glass.I liked it so much, I bought two more for my sisters as gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salton yogurt maker","review":"The product seems to work fine so far.

In my case, this is a good thing, since I stay on campus between classes to get a head start on my homework. It has holes for insertion in a variety of binders, folds almost completely flat, and weighs next to nothing.Granted, it feels to be on the fragile side, but I guess that's a trade off for the portability.I also like the width of the book holder. Most of my textbooks this semester are large but soft-cover. Other portable book holders are narrower and don't provide any support for over sized soft covers.Overall, this thing doesn't give me a lot of confidence concerning sturdiness and longevity, but it's perfect for my immediate needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy product.","review":"Its made of flimsy plastic, and all the parts snap on.

Although being quite thin for a book stand, it can support my iPad or textbooks without any problem. I can easily pack this in my backpack without adding much bulk because it is thin and lightweight.However, the bottom of the support where it touches the desk is a bit slippery--there is added black material where it touches the desk, but that material is just another piece of plastic instead of, say, rubber. So when I happen to push the book stand while reading a book or iPad, it sometimes slides back. It doesn't happen very often and it doesn't bother me much, but worth noting I guess.Also two plastic tips which can be pulled up to hold a book in position is a bit flimsy. It does the job, but if you pull it too far out is sometimes pops off. You can put easily it back though.Overall, a nice book stand for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily handles an 800-page Chem text, but be careful.","review":"I needed a copy holder that could easily withstand the weight of an 800-page Chemistry text, yet be small, light and easily packable in my bag.PROSThe plastic is extremely light, and sufficiently sturdy enough to handle my Chem text and the solutions manual (which I sometimes prop up on top of my Chem text). It has perforations across the top, perfect for keeping in a three-ring binder. In addition, it's easy to fold down and transport.CONSMy only complaint is that, despite its sturdiness, I can tell that it won't hold up under consistent, heavy use. In addition, the small flip-up page holders on the bottom don't seem to work well; they must be aligned perfectly in order to extend them properly. It wouldn't take much to snap off one of the pieces.In all, for the price, this is absolutely adequate for my needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to the negative reviews, this is a great product","review":"It's really too bad the front page reviews for this are so negative.

Easily will fit in a backpack or bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more neck strain, a little flimsy","review":"I agree with some other reviewers, in that it may be flimsy. The rubber stops which prevent it from sliding have fallen off, and the page holders are worthless.However, this stand holds my 1500+ page hardcover constitutional law book very well, and I can highlight the book while it is on the stand without it collapsing. It does what it is supposed to, and I do not miss the page holders at all. The main reason I bought this is for neck strain. My books are elevated now, I don't have to bend over to read.

Overall, it's still probably the best deal for the price range.Pros:- Good value- Holds open books of most sizes and style- Folds up into a nice compact piece of plastic that you can keep in your bag- Material seems sturdy (not the crack-able hard plastic)Cons:- Pegs fall off- Kind of difficult to adjust the height, but this doesn't need to be done too often"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed.","review":"Grea for basic student use.

Based on that I estimate that this is a totally worthless product to anyone needing to go through a manual or training book more than five or six hundred pages. If you don't anticipate needing it for a book that big then just glue the rubber feet on, keep an eye on the page retainers (these are the parts that fell off) and you should be ok.

Thus far this booklit has served it's purpose well. I have had many sizes of books and it works for every one of them.

It sticks to its description - I've had no problems with large hardcovers at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I love this product, it is not only very useful for reading, and very adjustable, it's also very compact.

It felt like a real love since it wasn't based just on sexual attraction but a mutual admiration for the other's skills, consideration, and bravery. Both the H and h are people to admire. I do like the world building with the Gaian culture where the Gaian men are always faithful once they've attached.I've also read Miller's other Gaian stories: Girl in a Box and Beloved Stranger and recommend both, but this one is probably my fave so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"disgusted","review":"I'm angry I wasted my time and money with this one!

Repeat. Mouse clicks are also bad, sometimes you have to click 15-20 times for it to \\"take\\".Keyboard commands are also compromised.Trendnet tech support had nothing to suggest other than the usual litany of \\"what cable are you using, have you tried a different keyboard and mouse\\" etc. Of course we are using Trendnet cables, have tried 4 different brands of keyb/mouse, and still no usable results.I can't condemn the product wholesale, perhaps the PCs we are using have some magic, voodoo settings that preclude their use with a KVM switch (he said facetiously).

However, after first saying that he agreed with Dr. Bob, this author went off on another tangent completely. He talks about a series of sentences that one can repeat to one's self daily, either by writing them, reading them or on tape. However, he says that taping them yourself is not recommended and that the most effective way is to buy his tapes. He continues to discuss his tapes throughout the second half of the book. Come on, this won't work unless we spend more money? I don't think so. A waste of money on the book was enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but cheaply made","review":"I really think this a cute toy but it is so flimsy and seems like it will break very easy. When its closed up as a mac truck it doesn't latch together well, so when my son goes to push the truck it pops open. Every time you open it, you have to reassemble the ramps and ledges. They also just lay there loosely and fall off often. The plastic is hard and thin so it seems very brittle. If it were made better, this would be a great toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only One Good Song","review":"Here is another CD from Hell, you buy it because you really like one song \\"Got You\\" and all the rest is crap. The Flys have talent and a good sound, but only for that one good song. Also, the video that comes on when you play it on your computer is neat to see the first time, but then who really wants to see that every time you stick the cd in to play? Not that anyone would want to play this one very often. Sorry but this one is going to get traded in. Not worth the money I spent on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"if a fly has no wings is it a walk","review":"The flys new one is constantly on the verge of taking off. The rhythms are a solid mix of several styles played well, but it comes off as slick and simple. By the time the chorus comes around you already know where the song is headed, musically and lyrically. The flys have a good mix of punk, ska, some swing and straight up pop, but every song sounds like one you've heard before. This CD was always on the verge of exciting me, but instead just came off as predicatable and boring. This CD has no loft and isn't worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I can't tell you people how bad this album is. It is plain bad.

I can't think of a worse insult than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"\\"Got You Where I Want You\\" is by far the only song worth listening to.

It's not in stores anymore. Use to listen to it in highschool. It's alternative 90s experimental rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Band!","review":"Before they were the Flys, most of the members of this band were in a band Mozart. I was really impressed with the music Mozart made and when I found out they had morphed into the Flys I was really intrigued to hear what their sound would be like.I admit that I did really like the song Got You Where I Want You when I heard it on the radio but did not recognize them as the band I formerly enjoyed. After listening carefully to this song I definitely hear the old sound mixed in and enjoy it even more now that I know it is derived from the band I really missed.I am starting to enjoy the rest of the album also but slowly I'll admit. My next favorite song is Sexual Sandwich. I am sure the rest of the album will grow on me as I listen to it more because of the talent and uniqueness of this band!I am rating it a 5 and giving 4 of the stars because of their talent and how much I enjoy Got You Where I Want You and 1 star for how much I am anticipating enjoying the album in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly fun","review":"This album rocks. The diversity of material that apparently puts some people off is a definite plus for me. Few groups can create feel-good, Sly and the Family Stone-ish, ga-roo-vy tracks like \\"The Family,\\" and \\"Sexual Sandwich\\" is a hoot. Their rock/rap stuff is a lot of fun, and very, very infectious. I've listened to this album at least once a day since early this summer, and I'm not yet tired of it. If you like variety in your rock music and appreciate wicked tongue-in-cheek humor, get this album--it's definitely for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now this is original!!","review":"This band doesn't sound like every other band out there, and any band that can do that deserves five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD of The Year","review":"Everything about this album makes it worth the 15 bucks. They added a second singer for this album, and his voice and artistic influence shows itself over .25 (25 cents). The lyrics are very solid and the singing with the distortion add a degree of dreaminess (closest thing I could think of). With this album these boys will be #1."},{"rating":"1","title":"The CD is redundant, and a complete waste if time and money.","review":"I dont know what possessed me, possibly I just didn't look hard enough, the stupid song titles and lame cover should have told ne something.

Sections of pages cracked right out of the binding. Also, the edition has some strange text/typing issues which didn't bother me as much, but by all means spring for the other, slightly more expensive version.I won't expound with a full review here, however this book is worth reading, especially to die-hard Balzac fans (of which I'm one). Learning that the piece was culled from unrelated stories made the somewhat shaky plot lines defensible, but it's strength is in just a few fantastic passages on women and age. A short read with some gems of prose - and how can you beat plot twists involving pirate queens? You'll see . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I enjoyed reading this book.

She's had modest success as an actress and singer and its a shame her ex-record label has released this CD inplying she's done.Clearly she's not ready for a \\"Best Of\\", especially a CD that does not collect anything other than whats on her records. She's had songs on mixtapes and soundtracks and none are found here. So who'se going to buy this? Clearly no one, as those interested in her one worldwide smash (\\"Dip It Low\\") have already bought the single and the fans have nothing here for them to grab.Hopefully her career will rise from these ashes and this CD will be seen as her lowest point in her career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mints","review":"The only problem with the mints was that the plastic still kind of stuck to the plastic even though the shipper did put a bag of \\"ice\\" in the box.

Of course, the murder of Kelly Ann Tinyes is an abhorrent tragedy and my heart goes out to her family for the suffering they have endured for nearly 24 years. But the man who wrote this book and his editor did a horrible job with the writing, proofreading and editing. It was difficult to read not only because of the subject matter, but because it did not flow. Simple mistakes were made using the wrong words. For example, in one spot where the word \\"year\\" should have been in a sentence, instead the word \\"war\\" appeared. The book is absolutely not worth the $4.99 that I paid.

He is one of the best songwriters out there right now. Whether it's the rocking \\"Drowned Like a River\\" and \\"16 Days\\" or the beautifully simple \\"Tennessee Mtn. Angel\\", this guy knows what he is doing. I have had the opportunity to hear the entire new album, Pneumonia, due out 5/22/2001. This album will definitely be an instant classic, albeit a posthumous release since they have since disbanded. Ryan seems to like doing his own thing these days. Check out his solo album as well. Saw him perform as Ryan Adams and the Pinkhearts in Austin, TX at SXSW Music Fest. Hard, \\"In-Yur-Face\\" rock. The home-made shirt of the Pinkhearts bassist ironically said it best: \\"Who the [heck] is Ryan Adams?\\" If you don't know the answer to that, you soon will! Buy all the Whiskeytown and Ryan Adams you can buy and look for re-runs of Austin City Limits featuring Whiskeytown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Ryan Adams is Terrific Stuff","review":"I really liked this CD.

Everything about it was great.Great sound, great harmony and very lo-fi. I've since been collecting everything I can by The Go! Team, and I have to say, I can't wait to see what they do next!(...) Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternative Glam?","review":"The previous reviewer is right. It's very hard to compare this band to anyone. Their music has some elements of funk-metal in it, but almost ventures into hair metal territory. Combine that with 90's alternative rock and then you've got Luv Junkies.Their songs are solid and the musicianship is very good as well. Unfortunately for them, \\"Smudge\\" was released about 5 years too late. Had this album come out in the early 90's, Luv Junkies could have been the next Faith No More(truly a genre crossing band). As it stands, \\"Smudge\\" is a great album. One that still gets frequent visits to my CD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Quantity Theory of Drug Intake","review":"Sit down and write a clever, although overdone, Twilight Zone-esque short story. Great. Now you have to write a dozen or more short stories to fulfill the contract with your publisher. Oh, the pressure! Just whip out the heavy drugs and let them do the writing for you. This appears to be the strategy that Will Self took in this understandably out of print volume.It is the rare book that I don't finish once I start it. But the stories just kept getting more incoherent, and I had to put it down. The author just got obsessed with the idea that the only difference between the sane and the insane is that insane people do more crazy things than the sane ones do, and couldn't let it go.If you are looking for a quirky collection of modern short stories, go with The Acid House by Irvine Welsh and avoid The Quantity Theory of Insanity for the sake of your own sanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stories about Beyond Belief","review":"This book was really magnificent.

This album opens with an explosion of beauty in the first song, \\"Da Gama,\\" but the rest of the songs are a little different from \\"Da Gama\\" and similar to each other in style. Not that that's bad; it is pleasant music to relax to. I saw other Cusco albums but bought this one because it was at a lower price and seemed to be sort of a \\"greatest hits\\" album. I might not buy anymore Cusco albums, but I am VERY glad I made the choice to get THIS one. It has excellent songs from the albums of these very talented musicians.

I was a pain to unscrew the salt shaker from the top and fill it with peppercorns because there were 2 plastic gaskets that had to be put back just right. Finally I screwed the top knob in to much and the salt shaker park cracked badly, resulting in way too much salt coming out. I managed finding this pepper mill salt shaker combo at a kitchen outlet store. Wow! I couldn't believe how fast this pepper mill ground the peppercorns. It has to grind at least 5 times faster than the Martha Stewart.

Damn, the media has so much power. This kid is alright, she's an alright songwriter, she's not anything amazing on the guitar with her basic chords. But that's not the problem, its the voice.... MTV shouldve at least waited, but then again if they had there would be no novelty in saying a 16 year old songwriter.... YEAH!Don't become brainwashed by this shit"},{"rating":"1","title":"The day has come...Too bad for us.","review":"Tagged as a singer-songwriter, Cheyenne Kimball sure does disappoint. The \\"geniuses\\" at MTV make her out to be this deep Tori Amos/Sarah McLachlan type girl, but all we get is a pre-packaged pop star. The lyrics are so juvenile, and they weren't even written solely by her. \\"So what if they're juvenile, she's a teenager and her music is marketed towards teenagers.\\" Well, listen to Fiona Apple's 'Tidal', or Bonnie Mckee's 'Trouble'. Both of those albums were released by talented VOCALISTS in their teens who didn't have a team of songwriters behind them. Don't fall for the Avril Lavigne formula (\\"she's a songwriter\\"). And if you saw Cheyenne's performance on TRL or her duet with Sheryl Crow, you know she can't hold a tune. Don't contribute to the dumbing down of society by buying this CD. Do yourself a favor and stay FAR away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, the day has come... now shoot me...","review":"When will MTV learn? and when will anyone ever come to reality? Who in the world told this child that she could sing? She can't! Yes I agree totally with someone on this review the girl is just as nasally as I am when my sinusis are backed up. My cat can sing better then that... Heck why not let me do a reality show you don't have to know how to sing all you need is just a pretty face. And that sums her up in a shampoo bottle. She's young, pretty, petite, and talentless. I say CAN Cheyenne!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The girl...cannot...sing. Period. End of story.","review":"First of all, I concede that there's something to be said for her as a lyricist. But as a singer, she is horrifyingly, almost comically bad. I saw her on TV and thought she was just \\"having a bad day\\" (as that other song goes), then heard the CD and realized that even under studio conditions, Ms. Kimball is dreadful: a thin, grating voice and a near-utter inability to stay on-key. (In the back of my mind, I keep thinking I hear Randy shouting, \\"Whoooaaa, girl, kinda pitchy there....!\\") To think, NBC a few years ago anointed this girl \\"America's most talented kid.\\" Yikes!And this is what we look up to today. How sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"In key please? Can we get her some lessons?","review":"Firstly this girl is fifteen, so I should be gentle when reviewing her? No. I may have been upset to see Michelle Branch go hillbilly when she was so close to leaving the pop-world for something meaningful, but to see this talentless little thing step up to ascend into her place is annoying.This child cannot sing, period. Her voice is untrained and her natural ability is a karaoke night blitz at best. I've heard chalkboards stay in key more efficiently. If she wants to make pop garbage, throw away, bubblegum music for the forgetting masses, fine. There's a market, exploit it. But where some have talent, some have only looks.This girl is a gorgeous, cute young blond put out there with a guitar to give the guise of a serious musician, but the record company is selling her looks because she has nothing else to sell. One can only hope she'll catch on to being used and either give up or get some vocal lessons and actually learn to sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucks","review":"this album is a load of steaming dog doo. Do not waste your money on it. The songs are cheesy and cheyenne sounds like a cat who has had her tale ran over by a city bus. The Mtv show only played short clips of the songs on the album. They have no melody and the recording sounds like it was made in an outhouse. This girl better get ready to ride the strippers pole as soon as she turns 18 because the singing dont look promising as a career. My dog taking a dump at midnight sounds better than all of the songs on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy & healthy","review":"I eat a lot of beans & this sure is a handy way to make up a batch & put it in the fridge - I just measure equal beans & water, & make about 3 cups. I don't have a car, so otherwise I'd be buying cans of refried beans at the store. Cans are, for me, much more of a pain in so many ways. By the way, you can recycle these plastic bags, along with any others, at the plastic-bag recycle bin in most grocery stores. I admit I haven't calculated whether the canned beans are cheaper, but I doubt it, since so much of the weight is water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great taste with little effort.","review":"I actually bought these for my parents since they are going to be visiting India for a while. Mexican food is not a hot commodity there!! With all of us being vegetarian, these are such a treat! Mom's told me that these beans are super tasty and very easy to make. It's a great value because you can easily control the consistency of the beans with water, make as much as you want, and there is no 'taste addition' you have to do. She likes them so much, I will be buying them again for her very soon....and this time I'll have to buy extra so I can keep some for myself!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good substitute for homemade.","review":"Homemade refrieds are clearly the most desirable. Canned refrieds are unacceptable. These are a good alternative to homemade. Easy and quite good. I add a little butter and olive oil to the vegetarian. It makes them richer and smoother.

You don't get much but what you do get as a great flavor when you don't have time to make your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Salt","review":"Sorry to say the beans had way too much salt. They also had a burnt taste. Since they are not returnable, I am going to try mixing unsalted can beans with them. I am trying to find beans that taste like Taco Bell beans and these just weren't the ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious!","review":"These beans are amazing! I grew up with a Mexican babysitter who made her own refried beans and I could never get enough of them! These are the FIRST beans that have ever come close to that homemade authentic flavor! I love them.... sooo much better than canned. These are fairly big bags and made about 3-4 cups of beans (about the size of 2 cans). I'm buying more now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Vegetarian. Stores long-term. Makes about a pound, the same as a can of beans. Cost is right around 1.81 per container. In comparison, a can of high quality, non-freeze-dried refried beans from Whole Foods is about 1.30. But these are great for travel/trips and storing as emergency rations. Tastes better than canned too. I thought people were a little nutty for raving over these. But they really are good. Salt content is a bit high, so be careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"clinically based review","review":"I think reviewing cases is the way to go.

I didn't know they were able to express a shyness of young lady in a dance. This DVD is doumentary. This is why I gave 4 stars. You can't see the marvel of each dancer. I wish that Amazon Com would look for a complete piece of each of these dancers. And moreover to prepare DVDs with region code all/free. You can't imagine how much I pay for a DVD with region 1, first the price of DVD then for its dubbing.

Talking is, after all, not what dancers do best. And the need for subtitles for what they do say further diminishes the \\"text,\\" since content is always lost in translation. Too bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the ballet!","review":"I bought this DVD because I have seen \\"Raymonda\\" and wanted to relive the experience. This NOT a presentation of the ballet. It is a series of interviews with people associated with the ballet (including Nureyev), but those interviews are all in French. You can turn on the subtitles, but they tend to go by quickly, so that's difficult to follow.Here's the funny thing - sometimes the person on-camera is speaking English, but there's an announcer translating their words to French. The subtitles are cearly retranslations back to English, because they rarely quote the original interviewee's words.If you only have passing interest in the performance, and if you want to practice hearing French, this DVD is for you. But from what I know, that's a small audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"beautiful but not exciting, i want the full length of this ballet!","review":"it was very exciting to watch raymonda ballet, and im a fan of paris ballet opera, i almost have the complete collection of paris opera ballet dvd. but when i purchase this item i was very discourage! im expecting more superb performances, cause the cast are my favorite dancers, i was hoping that i can watch the full length production of this ballet, but what i see is a sort of documentary.

Most people reading this know that Oteil refers to Oteil Burbridge--truly one of the all-time bass greats(who also played w/Col.

This book wasn't like a lot of the other books I read... it was interesting and unpredictable, and it wasn't so much about D.J. playing football as it was about how she grew up in one summer. Football brought the plot along, yeah, but it was still only a half-plot. I still liked the book a lot, though, because it was sweet in a way, and the characters were unique and different.Not sure if it was the best book in the world, but it was great in it's own way, especially for a debut novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book bored me","review":"I know some like reading about the farm life, but I didn't. I found it a bore. The book is 274 pages and seems to DRAG on. Like you keep thinking \\"is this book ever going to end\\". And I definetly don't think that with all books- I've read books with 400 pages and up (and liked them). Anyway, It takes FOREVER to finally get to the main plot of the story.This book can be funny, \\"ha ha\\" funny not \\"laugh till you cry\\" funny, but I still didn't think it was worth it.Two stars.EDIT:the other reviews-The reviews seem to be coming more from adults who are taking a deeper look at the writing. I don't know any teenage girl who would read this book and say \\"what nice character development it has\\".We want action. Adventure. SOMETHING.Ugh, I remember I could read this book to put me to sleep at night. Development shvelopment. Hurry up and get to the dang story, Murdock!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read it before your daughter does","review":"It's been a while since I read this, but my reaction to it is still strong: I put it away until my daughter hits high school (say, like a junior or senior). It is not high on the morality scale, and young teenage girls are just too impressionable. It has good bones, with an interesting plot, but with too much yuck thrown in. The football element makes it a fun read, but it is a romance, not a sports-related book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've left this book on the shelf...","review":"I bought this book about 6 months ago and finally have enough time to read it now. I should've kept the book on the shelf. The stories fell flat. The 2nd part of the book wasn't as bad as the 1st though. I just couldn't get into Hilde's character. She was so annoying! One sentence she says she loves her husband Sigurd, the next sentence she says she hates him. This went on from the beginning of the story all the way to the 2nd to last chapter! I really wanted to like this book because I love historical romances, but just couldn't get past the main characters' behavior.

While no one claims that Peelu does this, its less-abrasive (and fluoride-free) nature appealed to me. I figured, at least it's not hurting my gums as much as more abrasive pastes.Well, Peelu cleans my teeth at least as well as other toothpastes and does it without the harsh abrasives.

I will not give much away but to say there are a few surprises. Being a TV movie you have your soap opera elements but not as bad as I had expected.

Even Darwin, Newton and the father of television Mr Logie Baird cannot escape the sharp wit of Mr. Scarfe.I would recommend this to anyone who likes acerbic wit and caricature, even if you are not familiar with Mr. Scarfe's work.My copy happens to be an autographed one which I purchased while visiting the actual exhibition connected with this book in London."},{"rating":"1","title":"Again...smelly","review":"The scent made me almost sick to my stomach...I can't use it anymore.

Being able to push the leaves down the down spout without getting on ladder. The problem is we got completely wet. We still needed to get up on the ladder to get everything.

It washed into my downspout and got stuck there. And you can't buy just a replacement spray head.I wrote to the Orbit company and they sent me a whole new unit (nice guys.) Then after 15 minutes of use, the spray head fell of the new unit again! It's made to easily screw on and off, but that means you have to constantly tighten it and make sure it's not about to get loose. I've given up using the spray head. Instead I just use the wand and the U-shaped pipe, which by themselves are fairly useful. The wand has a solid on/off switch for the water and the water comes out powerfully (probably varies with your household water pressure.) But I wouldn't buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Powerful Enough Plus Mechanical Problem","review":"I bought this product in the hope that I could just blast out all the dead and decomposing leaves in my gutters. But I found that the stream of water it generates isn't powerful enough to do the job by itself. I wound up picking the gunk out of the gutters by hand (one-story home, thank goodness) and then using the Orbit to wash the remaining debris out. As other reviewers have noted, you do get quite a shower using this wand, so be sure to wear rain gear or old clothes! I also had a mechanical problem with this product: the part that is supposed to telescope is stubbornly stuck in its original position. I was afraid to try to force it to telescope, for fear of breaking the unit. So I was unable to extend the length of the wand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work well","review":"This wand would not clean up my gutters, I end up just standing there getting wet.

It could have been a little longer, but still has a reach that will make most eaves and gutters. It is well constructed and is easy to use. The shutoff valve on the bottom is a nice feature.

All-in-all, I am very happy with this gutter cleaner wand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but leaf blower attachments work much better.","review":"This item will clean your gutters, but using water is a very messy way to clean gutters. I would rather get on a ladder than to get wet from wet leaves and overspray. I took this back. Gutter cleaning attachments that hook to your leaf blower work, MUCH, MUCH, MUCH better. Dry leaves blow out much, much better than wet ones and you don't get wet in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"The product did not work as advertised","review":"We bought this from Kotula's in late November.

He challenges both typical top-down and ground-up authority as going against Christian teaching. This book will stimulate your thinking, probably shift your way of viewing the Apostle Paul, and certainly the process of submission as promoted in most Christian and patriarcial societies. I have mixed conclusions about what he writes, but would recommend it to someone who thinks they have thie concept of leadership down pat. Servant leadership is the focus of this short book. He makes a distinction between authority that is assumed and dictatorial and that which is compelling because of the servant relationship which governs the mutual relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Emerging Church Books","review":"This book should be a required read for all emerging churches. Viola is ahead of his time in this seminal critique of traditional leadership. What I found refreshing was that it wasn't the same old trite teaching about what leadership should be, \\"leaders are servants, not controllers.\\" That is obvious and no one would disagree. Instead of stating the obvious, this book probes the root very deep on what leadership is and isn't. Surprisingly, the book makes a compelling case that leadership in the early church was shared by all of the believing community. I believe the emerging church is in danger of falling into the same trap that the Jesus Movement fell into three decades earlier. That is why I feel this book is required reading. Who is Your Covering?, along with Viola's Rethinking the Wineskin and Pagan Christianity, should be on everyone's reading list who is part of the emerging church discussion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pastor Niko","review":"\\"There is only one mediator between God and man... this man Christ Jesus\\"Great job using scripture and biblical principle to outline the foundational arguement for the position of the beliver priest under the headship of Christ vs. under the authority of a pastor / priest."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"I was very disappointed with the quality.

During this battle only 50.000 of communist were involved and 15.000 were killedd and 30.000 deserted!Recomend : buy The Long March by Sun Shuyn ISBN 0 07 054471 9 and you will discover that from 86.000 comunist which started, only 4.000 arrived in Shanxi and of Mao's 4 Red Army 20.400 were killed and only 400 arrived & survived in Gansu. This seems that interpreters forget to mention and Mr.S. played an ignoramus. George."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading the Reader","review":"Mr. Salisbury makes it quite clear where his sympathies lie in the Chinese Civil War. I find it disturbing that he expresses his political leaning in print, where he has a reputation of impartiality.This book ignores the ugly realities that was the Long March in favor of perpetuating the myth that was one of the cornerstones of Communist China. There are other fact-based accounts of the Long March out there that will point out that--whatever your political leanings--the Long March was deadly (most of the Communist soldiers who started the March perished), the retreating Communist Army savagely oppressed the inhabitants of every region they passed through and occupied (a taste of things to come, sadly), and Mao used the March to brutally consolidate his hold over the Communist party."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great CD","review":"I bought this CD basically for the Everwood theme which I just love.

Because these are some excellent songs. But the covers are just pale imitations of the originals.The Cat Stevens covers are especially poor. There's a reason that many of these artists are largely unknown if their original pieces sound anything like these.There are a few bright spots on the cd. Jason Mraz does a good cover of Summer Breeze. The *original* theme song is included here, which I always liked much more than the overly orchestrated one it was changed to later on in the series. The Treat Williams song is fine, as is the song by Jump Little Children (which is an original). But these aren't enough to make the album worthwhile.

The movie is one of my top favorites, and Morrell's book is by far grittier; the best part of both is the lack of a true protagonist or true antagonist; who's the good guy, who's the bad guy?

Many years have passed and I finally got around to reading the book again; after all I've seen reruns of the movies many times over.I had forgotten many details of the book, but I still think it is superior to the movie and I liked the movie. I had forgotten too that the book really did put Teasle and Rambo as equals and both were neither evil or good. They both had their own idealism and each did what they felt like they had to do.The book ends differently than the movie, but the movie folks knew that they had a planned sequel and they worked accordingly.

It certainly is the best I've ever read. I was, and am, a fan of the movie with Stallone, and read the book back in 85, after Rambo II (groan) came out. How could I have known that the book would be so much better. As usual, the book always outdoes the movie. I've read it twice so far, and am beginning to feel it's almost time for number 3. I became a big Morrell fan after reading First Blood, having read about 10 of his books so far. I like his no-nonsense writing style and his fast-paced plotting, but none of his other books, in my opinion, have approached the great work he did on First Blood.

When they told me the book was different, they weren't lying. Wow. It's not different as far as general plot (Rambo escapes from jail after being harassed by the sheriff). But its different as far as events and character details. I love that there are no clear villains or heroes in this book. Teasle and Rambo are both flawed. They are both right and both wrong. If you love the movie, you must read this. I'm glad the movie ended up the way it did. But this is a nice alternate Rambo story.BY THE WAY!!!!!!! Do not read the introduction of the novel.

In \\"First Blood\\" I felt the matches were fantastic...Stallone portrayed a Rambo that personified Morrell's word picture of the Vietnames warrior and hero to a T.Madison, Kentucky, a small mountain town is practically wiped out when all the chasing and shooting finish and we wonder if there could have been a different ending if Will Teasle hadn't been so intent on getting Rambo out of his town at all costs. There is a degree of psychotic behaviour involved, but the real question is, which of the two protagonists has the problem.

The characters are wooden and flat and the plot is plodding and slow. There is very little connection between \\"point of view\\" jumps and the \\"action\\" is laughable. We don't really understand Rambo's motivation to destroy the town or make stand, but it really does not matter to this story.I'm career military and sent this book to a friend in a combat zone.

I was wrong. David Morell's \\"Rambo\\" is an uninspiring, terribly written book that any fourth grade English teacher would have failed. You can't identify with the characters and the entire novel lacks any type of description or analysis to seperate it from the worst of action movies. Just because this a book involving action, doesn't mean it can do without intelligent writing.

Because I had already seen the movie, it was impossible to not picture Sylvester Stallone and Brian Dennehy as the two main characters. The book differs from the movie in several ways, but its main difference is how the author focuses on the mental battle taking place inside the minds of the young war hero, fresh out of Vietnam, and the old police officer, who is also a war hero, but from the previous generation's war in Korea.The story starts off great, has some slow points, and then has a great ending.

In the book, Rambo can't seem to do anything without a gun. In the movie, you see Rambo as a trained and controlled worrier who can kill with anything he can find in nature. The movie also does a much better job explaining why Rambo flips out and runs for the woods. In the book, when Rambo escapes, he's completely naked. He remains naked until he happens across someone brewing moonshine in the woods. If you found a naked man running through the woods with a gun and straight razor, would you give him clothes? No wonder it took so long for this book to become a movie, they had to rewrite the [stuff] out of it to make it good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want a Great Time?","review":"If you want a great time be sure and read all three of Effie Wilders books about Hattie McNair and her FairAcres gang.

I haven't listened to it in several months, so I'll give it another try later. My initial impression was that of disappointment. Too much slide (I've never cared for Mikes slide playing), and his straight guitar work is too few and far in between, and very tentative sounding at best. It makes one wonder if this was recorded during Mike's \\"illness\\" (out of respect I'll refer to it as such). After purchasing this, I ran out and bought the \\"Don't Say I Ain't Your Man\\" compilation, and was blown away by the excellent guitar playing throughout. It seems to be absent here. Maybe it's just me. Hmmm....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"First, let me say I am a huge Bloomfield fan; I think he was one of the best electric blues guitarists ever. His \\"Don't Say that I Ain't Your Man\\" is an absolute classic, desert-island choice, and a great over-view of his playing. I have also played guitar for close to 40 years. I regret saying that I find this record absolutely unlistenable. I thought I must have missed something, so I went back and listened carefully. Same conclusion. I think someone had these tapes from a bad night during not a great period for him and decided to make some money. I have no doubt that if Mike had lived, and someone had come to him years later with these tapes, he would have buried them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures the genius of his talent.","review":"Mike Bloomfield as witnessed by many live was spellbinding. His talent for articulating the passion of the blues is without a doubt the most riviting. Unfortunately his recorded legacy only hints at this fantastic talent. This CD is very rare in that one is transported to an intimate setting where Michael plays with abandon. Further the quaity of thew digitally mastered tapes are crystal clear and his fellow muscians are out there all the way. Most muscians are aware and followed Mikes's insperation. Listen to this and you will also realize why he is considered a master of the guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"the title of the album is a misnomer..if you will take a careful listen to the album ,you will notice that Mike is not singing,and his usual tasty guitar licks are absent.in addition to that you will be surprised for the very poor recording of the album,,considering it is a legacy/sony release.the only good thing about this release is the packaging with pictures and liner notes,,nothing more ,nothing less. buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"One good song, the rest so-so","review":"Michael Bloomfield was a notoriously spotty performer. I saw him on number of occasions. Fortunately, I saw some great performances. After 1973, he was a hit or miss player for me. This collection goes south quickly after the opening cut, \\"Sweet Little Angel\\" and even having said that, one has to wade through Roger \\"Jelly Roll\\" Troy's overblown vocals to enjoy Michael's great playing. Troy was never my favorite. I have given this two stars because I am a huge Bloomfield fan but I can't recommend this CD.

But still dont let that shy you away from getting this if you're more of the crunk style fan because they havent let their loyals down, and \\"Put That Thang Down\\" is a sure club hit for the summer, and \\"Pull My Hair\\" which comes off as another \\"Wait\\" is definitely that x-rated style that they do well with also.

This book is a compilation of just over 20 fairy tales, retold by some great writers in the fantasy and horror genres. I will definitely keep these authors in mind when buying future books, because of how well written the stories were. There are so many styles of writing and different fairy tales in this book that each story felt very diverse. Both retellings of Little Red Riding Hood were my favorites from this book. Each story is dark and beautiful.VERDICTAnyone who loves fairy tales and horror will like this book. I loved it!see more reviews at kaitlinmichelle.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I adore anything that even comes close to being a retelling of one of my beloved fairytales. Silly, sentimental...I don't care I just love fairytales. I eagerly picked this book up at the library for a little light reading between exams and papers. Boy, was I disappointed! I felt horrid reading this stuff. I just could not finish it. I'm sorry, but I do not find it entertaining in the least to read about adults lusting after children...a theme found in several of the stories. Sleeping with the mother while attempting to seduce the young daughter. Feeling up a child who is clinging to you because she is afraid of the woods. Raping children!!!! This book makes me sad. I only gave it one star because I had to."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Will See Red if You Waste Your Money on This","review":"Retelling fairy tales we all grew up with is a sensational idea which has been done extremely well. Just not here! In other books yes, but here unfortunately no. The stories in this book do have one thing in common with the original motive of fairy tales. They will put you to sleep. These are some of the most boring low quality stories ever written. Also avoid the books A Wolf at the Door also edited by Ellen Datlow and Fractured Fairy tales by A.J. Jacobs as they are no better than this.If you do want really good retelling of classic tales rewritten in sensational format buy Once Upon A Crime or Politically Correct Fairy Tales. You will find what you're after in those books. The fairy tale is over success was not achieved here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Fairy Tales for Adults","review":"This is not the first book that Datlow and Windling have edited that I have read. The first book of theirs that I bought was \\"Black Swan, White Raven.\\" I expected this book to live up to the standards set by the first book I read and I was not disappointed. It's a wonderful collection of fairy tales for adults, ranging from dark to poignant to humorous, and were frequently erotic. These fairy tales are much more satifying than the \\"once-upon-a-time-happily-ever-after\\" fairy tales that most of us were accustomed to hearing as children. It has a wide range of brilliant authors, each offering a unique perspective to different tales. It is a wonderful, well-rounded book that I was loathe to put down. If you like fairy tales, then this is a *must* for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"the authors try way too hard to be edgy","review":"When I first started reading this book, I thought the premise of giving new twists to old fairy tale was such an awesome idea. But the more I read, the more the stories felt contrived. It was if the authors were trying to come up with something really edgy and hip, and they didn't quite make it. After you read a few stories, you begin to see that all of the authors use sex and violence as a way of \\"re-telling\\" the tale. Consequently, all of the stories begin to feel the same. The book is supposed to be new and innovative, but after a few stories it just the same old thing over and over again. I suggest you skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"adult\\" disappointment","review":"I totally agree with Illana's review of this book:we, readers, don't get a deeper retelling of these traditional tales, but a veneer of sex and violence that gives them an \\"adult\\" appearance. While I found the sex and violence were totally superficial and unnecessary, and they didn't manage to move my profounder feelings, I felt deceived in my intention of going deeply into these beloved stories. I think that good fantasy writers often succeed in a deeper view on folk tales without announcing their intentions to the readers, but subtly letting them find similitudes in theme and characterization. Maybe this is because good fantasy writers let themselves be carried away by the powerful archetypal potential latent in everybody's mind and explored since the dawn of time through folk tales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delta soap dish","review":"I finally put this soap dish on my wall.

It's not a history book, but rather a \\"keen\\" review of the times and how the changes following WWII defined the era. I particularly like how the book starts off asking, \\"What were the Fifties?\\" and \\"When did the Fifties actually begin?\\" It also helps the reader understand that, while today the Fifties are criticized for being too conservative and suppressive, people living back then were quite privileged. Families were enjoying luxuries and amenities only dreamed of by previous generations, especially coming out of the '30s and '40s where Americans had to deal with the hardships of the depression and war. The Fifties really were simpler times and this book lets you experience its joys all over again, or for the very first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalga","review":"This is a great book if you grew up in the 50's or early 60's. It is nicely divided into sections which flow evenly and make sense. Spends great amount of time not only on 50's icons, architecture, products BUT also why the 50's were the 50's. Great in depth analysis.However, it is a paperback with about 150 pages. The sellers who are aking $900 for a book I bought in my local bookstore, new, for $19.99 is absurd. Contact the publisher, you can order from them. It is through Chronicle Books in San Francisco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right on target","review":"This book has great pictures and is very readable as well. I have enjoyed it very much. Of course, the world wasn't perfect in the fifties, but, for a generation that had never known anything but depression and war, it was time to enjoy life. From the time that the Great Depression started in 1929 to the end of WWII, Americans had endured hard times when most people could barely afford to buy necessities and during the war, things were rationed or not available at all. After the war, Americans were ready to enjoy life and have things that they and their parents had to do without before. The world wasn't wonderful for everyone in the fifties, but it was a good life for middle-class America. This book does a great job of showing and describing the good things about that time in America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great.","review":"Plugged in a bluray player and turned it on.

It is great to watch Campbell in something other than a supporting role, but this is a TV cheapie. On the plus side is a strong supporting cast that includes Ernie Hudson (as Campbell's mentor).The DVD image is full-screen and nothing to write home about.

This one was the most horrible one I have ever seen. There is about three tornados in the whole movie. All of which are just a little computer ink. At the end of the movie, they end up inside this F100 tornado. They take a look around and say \\"We're inside it!\\" They stand up and take a look around. Apparently there is no vacume inside the twister. So they can just stand up and walk around, and only worry about the side of the tornado which spins so fast it will carry them away. This movie is so stupid!! If only there wasn't so many reviews around me that said it was better than Twister. Buy Twister instead of this pathetic one. Oh, what's my saying of this movie? It stunk!

I have never had an issue with my DJ skills. If you are new to DJing and want my truthful advice, Get the real deal and do not waste your money on this piece of something or other.

The questions at the end of each chapter help make the material relevant and practical to students. The sidebars and recap sections help students understand how material in one chapter builds from another. This is important since the book is about the systems perspective of organizations.

Armand has to choose between his honor and his heart, and he chooses, forcing SP to clean up the mess, at great physical cost to himself. There was interesting character development for Armand, and I also liked the scenes with Sir Tony, who is my favorite of the peripheral characters. If you've seen the SP production with Anthony Andrew and Jane Seymour, part of the plot is taken from this book. Try it out!

The good old days of moldy stored food and spoiled meat. The good old days of no greens in Winter and vitamin deficiencies that killed children and old people. Agribuisness is awful, save for the fact that it provides us with inexpensive nutritious food.

Michael Pollan devotes the first half of the book to criticizing the corporate agricultural machines of Cargill, ADM, and Monsanto, and the politics (subsidies) behind it all, but then weakly offers the solution as independent smaller farms utilizing a grass-based system versus the giant corporate machines utilizing a corn-based system. The fact that a McDonalds meal is actually 60% carbon molecules derived from corn doesn't tell me much. Is a carbon molecule derived from corn any less healthy for me than a carbon molecule derived from wheat, or from grass? A balanced diet in either case is probably what is essential.

Reading The OD was an affirmation to invest in high quality meat that will nourish ourselves, the environment, the animals it comes from, and the farmers who care enough to do things the right way - not just the most inexpensive and convenient. It was a reminder that meat is a treat, something that should be eaten with gratitude for all that enables it, and that everything about eating at McDonald's is unnatural, unhealthy, and overall an utter lack of consciousness and knowledge.

It has gone from a pastoral to an industrial farm with \\"inputs\\" of fertilizer and pesticides and \\"outputs\\" that are inputs for other industrial farming processes such as cattle feeding. We rent the farm house to a man who works in a nearby slaughter house. The barn stores cars he rebuilds. This book explains how these not uncommon changes came about and how the fundamental changes in the food chain leave us vulnerable to disease, crop failure and taxpayer subsidized food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and never dull","review":"Pollan is an extraordinary writer: here he takes a subject that could easily be dry as dirt and turns it into a completely absorbing, thought-provoking tour de force. Though very occasionally overwritten, this book is never boring. It will teach every reader to think twice about both the source and the true cost of the food they eat. Recommended reading for absolutely everyone; even more particularly for anyone with a real interest in food or simply in developing their social conscience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new way of thinking","review":"Pollan managed to change what I eat and my philosophical understanding of food and it's significance to our lives. If I could, I'd have every U.S. citizen above the age of 12 read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, Convincing, Inspiring","review":"I was scared to read this book. Already a health-conscious and picky eater, I worried that with the knowledge in the book I wouldn't be able to maintain the ignorance required to eat the occasional candy bar or slice of bacon. And I already have a hard enough time eating enough calories in a day.But it turns out that ignorance is not bliss, and as Pollan states in the introduction, \\"this is a book about the pleasures of eating, the kinds of pleasure that are only deepened by knowing,\\" and he is completely correct. Your body and the earth will thank you for acting on some of the knowledge that can be obtained from reading this. Not only is it fascinating, it is a page turner and an easy read. Pollan has done all the work of connecting ideas and following thoughts to their many logical conclusions. He is one of the most curious, thoughtful and empathetic writers I have ever read. Now buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should win a Pulitzer","review":"This well-written and researched book teaches a tremendous amount about our food chains (pun intended). First is the Industrial Food Chain. I had no idea that the Industrial food chain existed, though in retrospect of course I must have been aware somehow. This chain leads to McDonald's. The second chain is the Industrial Organic -- the Whole Foods, Wild Oats suppliers. I will always think about Pollan wearing a moon suit when visiting organic chickens. And \\"free-range\\" no longer means anything to me. The Beyond Organic section looks at Joel Salatin's Polyface Farm, and made me want to start my own farm. Finally, Hunting and Gathering--the shortest food chain. I didn't want to read about hunting, but Pollan got me there, too. I was fascinated throughout, and I am very thankful for this intelligent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked it More Than I Thought I Would","review":"I've been meaning to read \\"Omnivore's Dilemma\\" because I've felt like I should: If you're interested in books about food, this one seems unavoidable. I was hesitant because it's become such a lightning rod that I was concerned it was going to be a highly political jeremiad against modern agriculture, which I actually think is necessary to feed the world. Reading the book, though, it became clear to me that while Pollan certainly has strong opinions of how the world should work, he is not nearly so condemning of alternative views as either his supporters or detractors make him out to be.For this reason, I think it's a good read. Should Michael Pollan be made Secretary of Agriculture, and should this book be required reading in schools? Um, no. Let his supporters make those silly points. He himself is not silly, and I respect that."},{"rating":"2","title":"What we see is what we eat","review":"Reading this book is kind of humbling. Industrial agriculture produces plentiful calories, given its inputs of fossil fuels, water, soil, weed killers, patented seeds and sun. It makes possible the world we got used to and on balance like. It presents easy, unhealthy choices as well. Yet there's no going back to where farming was 200 years ago. Looks like we'd do better to eat less meat and change how our meat is produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book - Quick Delivery","review":"I received the Audiobook quicker than I had anticipated which was great. I had a fourteen hour drive to make which is why I ordered it. I listened to the majority of it, and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable education about where our food comes from","review":"I bought this book after hearing an interview with the author on NPR. I am so delighted that I did; since then, I have purchased three more copies for Christmas presents. Every time I try to describe what this book favors, I fail to be able to summarize it. Pro-organic? Pro-small farm? Anti-fast food? The author touches on all of these, but is sufficiently objective to leave you thinking about everything that you eat, the reasons that you eat it, and the costs that what you eat imposes on society.Along with The World is Flat, The Omnivore's Dilemma is one of the most influential books that I have read this year. I heartily recommend it, and while professionals in nutrition may have nits to pick, the rest of us can enjoy the excellent writing style and the message contained within."},{"rating":"2","title":"An omnivore's delight","review":"\\"What should we have for dinner?\\" A simple and complex dilemma that is the center of this wonderful book, the best non-fiction I've read for years. Pollan's writing is balanced, erudite and engaging. He is first and foremost a very good writer. The chapters on corn and the ethics of eating animals in particular are beautifully written. This book is more than a scientific thesis, it is bedtime reading, dinner conversation, and a necessary classroom textbook . Pollan attacks the topic with energy, curiosity and humility, which is how we should eat each and every meal. Bravo Senor Pollan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for those who are interested and those who dont know where their food comes from!","review":"I am a big supporter of agriculture and wanting to learn more about where our food comes from and how we can improve it.

A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful information","review":"Omnivore's Dilemma presents very useful information in an easy - to -read manner on the prevasiveness of corn and soy in our food system, and how all \\"organic\\" food is not necessarily organically produced. We now check food information much more closely. It is disastrous that two mega-corporations control almost all of our processed food chain from planting to manufacturing and marketing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone recommended this book","review":"Not having much time for reading books, I picked this up on CD. At times the book drones on about something which I found it fairly easy to tune out. Some of the details I found very interesting ... but suffice to say that on no subject did I find myself needing to reference to another place for more information (save where to find food locally).Overall, the message was pretty interesting and my wife and I changed many of our eating habits. I also now tend to avoid anything with \\"high fructose corn syrup\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading","review":"If I could afford it,I would send this book to everyone I know. Mr. Pollan manages to enlighten the reader about how food is produced, discusses the merits of organics, and provides much food for thought in an interesting format. I appreciate how he presents the facts and doesn't have an axe to grind. I feel I have made more informed food choices for myself as a result."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to know about where food comes from. The book goes a little overboard on some subjects, such as the corn. It is very informative and makes you think about the food you are eating, but I haven't changed any of my eating habits."},{"rating":"1","title":"long-drawn-out, rambling, interminable, wordy, verbose,","review":"Do not, repeat, do not believe the majority of reviews about this book. I should've known better as I first read \\"Botany of Desire\\", and gave a review. I thought that book was interminable, and this is even worse. Don't get me wrong there is some information within the pages, however, it goes on and on, almost without end. I persisted till I was almost, but not quite finished, and just could no longer bear the boredom. I persevered through \\"The Corn\\", barely got through \\"The Grasses\\", and almost made it through \\"The Forest\\", but the story on Fungi got the best of me, and \\"The Perfect Meal\\" did me in. I actually put the book down and stated aloud, \\"enough - I can't take it anymore\\". Life is too short, and time too valuable to waste it on this tripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough and amazing!","review":"This book is fantastic! I read it about six months ago, and I still quote it and think about what I learned all the time. A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but need a broader context","review":"The writing is really clear and I learned a lot from the book. Many reviewer had already said many good points about this book. So I would only share one disappointment here: the book was too much US centric. I would like to know more about how food is produced, on a global scale. Maybe your breakfast tomorrow was made in Brazil... With the currently trend of globalization, it is indeed relevant to US consumers."},{"rating":"2","title":"we need to know more","review":"Though the book was a bit slow going in the beginning, I was intrigued by the rest of the book. I realize that we need to know more about where our food is coming from and how it is raised. I'm looking forward to the author's latest book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Omnivores Dilemma","review":"This is a great book and everyone should read it. Michael Pollan is an inspiring writer and explains the issues very well. Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Onmivore's Dilemma","review":"I actually ordered this book as a gift and have not read it...but the person to whom I gave the gift is very pleased and has thanked me repeatedly. After buying it as a gift I learned that many of my friends have read it already and rave about it as well. Having not read it (yet) I can say as a gift-giver that I was pleased to find the hardcover copy handsome and sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort on facts. Long on bias","review":"Like many I read this book based on the recommendation of friends who felt it was a shocking exposure of the food inductry that offered a path to the salvation of mankind. I made it to about page six when I recognized that the \\"facts\\" had either been cherry picked from questionable sources or had been invented by the author. That does not mean that everything in the book is necessarily untrue, but it does mean that anyone familiar with agriculture in this country cannot accept this book that is being presented as nonfiction. This author has an agenda and appparently will do whatever is needed to excited those who lack knowledge and will sell books. The author quickly loses all credibility, which makes it impossible for me to accept anything he has written."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap","review":"Not a speck of good data or a study to validate argument. It can be used as a good discussion book because it is so lacking students would learn from dissecting it. Otherwise, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and predictable...","review":"The \\"reality TV show\\" of novels. As a field biologist (botany specifically) for twenty plus years, I haven't found any of his books engaging, and in many cases they are off the mark scientifically. He really just states the obvious to anyone in America who isn't sleeping their way through life. Just study the life history of any species of plant in your front yard, or hanging off of your 10th floor building's cracked-wall, and you'll understand the whole book without ever having to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I was semi-vegetarian for the last few years. After reading this book I think I more than ever commited to stay out of any othe kind of food."},{"rating":"1","title":"KINDLE PRICE IS ABSURD!","review":"The paperback of this book can be purchased for $7.49 with free shipping via Amazon Primes and I can get it in two days. If I get the paperback, Amazon and the publisher have to pay for printing, shipping several times, handling, etc. And I get a book I can resell or loan out.aBy comparison, the Kindle version costs an outrageous $12.99. With that Amazon and the publisher pay nothing for printing, shipping, handling, etc. I may get the book electronically within seconds but for the privilege of that I am supposed to pay 85% more? That is ridiculous.I like my kindle, alot. But it is going to grow dusty on the shelf if Amazon prices Kindle books at almost two times the paperback price (probably more than 2x once I add the value to me of the ability to loan or resell).This is a great book but I must seriously ding the Kindle version as way over priced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my taste","review":"Not what I was expecting. It was recommended by a friend, but it was more like a textbook than an informational read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A spoonful of truth, an avalanche of conspiracy theory","review":"This is truly typical of the journalist that studies something and far too early in the game considers himself a World Authority. In this case he studied it long enough to become familiar with the terms but not to the point of actually knowing what all of them were, or hoping the reader doesn't. He uses compounds like citric and ascorbic acid and lecithin to instill terror into the omnivore's heart and, I suspect, would have us all become vegan organic farmers.Nice try, noble goal, but get real. Better nutrition by terror is an old, hackneyed theme. I actually think the author cares a lot more about making a bunch of money by selling his book than educating consumers about their food choices. If you don't already know what ascorbic acid is, do yourself a big favor and steer clear of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow!","review":"The Omnivore's Dilemma is New-Age sophistry peppered with inaccurate scientific-esque observations written so as to titillate the reformed hippie and the uneducated acolytes that worship at the alter of misinformation and Mother Earth. If you want a New-Age fairy tale, read The Omnivore's Dilemma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"Umm you can watch a movie that is on the web that covers all the info that's in this book. I understand that we need to eat more sustainable products, and that we should stay clear of GMO food products. this book was a waist of money, and the info enclosed in its covers is readily available on the web. Any foodie should already know the information that is in this book.I'm a chef, and I guess this is a good read for a high school kid that's interested in the negative effects of humanity on the environment pertaining to food sources. I thought this book was more of a historical reference to the concepts behind the multiple course meal, I was wrong, hence forth the reason that I'm giving it 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating read","review":"A great read if you are interested in where your food comes from and how that has changed in just the past 20 years. Should be on every required reading list at every American high school. It would have such an impact on the way kids (and all of us) make choices about what we eat, where we buy our food. Such a basic part of being a huiman being."},{"rating":"2","title":"eye opening","review":"This book is informative, not preachy and has changed the way we eat. I read a lot about nutrition. The ideas in this book are compatible with _The Paleo Diet_,_Food Politics_ and the latest Scientific American article on starvation and obesity. The first three meals that he traces were of more interest to me than the last one, but there are still several interesting bits in the last section. For related topics, see http://www.slowfoodusa.org/ and http://www.localgrowers.org/links.html."},{"rating":"2","title":"More corn anyone?","review":"This book is an interesting and factual account about the American food system. It is about the prevalence of corn in every thing that we eat. The author's first hand experience gives the book credibility. The book was extremely captivating, I could not put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing","review":"Few things come along that truly shake up your view of the world. This book, surprisingly enough, does just that. It reminded me that I really do not know \\"where that has been\\" so to speak about arguably the most important topic of all... what goes in my body. Having worked in economic development for twenty years, mostly in rural areas, as well as on environmental issues, this books ties it all together. If we adopt his suggestions, our communities will be healthier for all of the big four reasons: economically, environmentally, personal health, and even spiritual health. Read it today... believe it or not it will change your world view."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read if your interested in food","review":"This book is a must read if you are interested in the food you eat, where comes from and whose behind it getting to your plate. Micheal Pollan crafts a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting book exploring a side of agriculture that you didn't know","review":"As the granddaughter of a farmer, I always thought that I truly understood the world of agriculture and FDA labeling. Turns out, I was incredibly wrong. This is a well-written and entertaining read while informative and thorough. It has opened up my eyes about the realm of 'posh eatery'. I'm an avid Whole Foods and Central Market shopper, but have since learned that not only isn't it always the best option, but may not truly be what we have come to think of as 'organic.'It won't ruin your appetite, the author isn't spreading a great message about the culture of food. Rather, it's an explorative and entertaining journey through the world of food and nutrition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed my way through!","review":"This book was great. Michael Pollan's humor came through so well. You can picture almost everything he is doing. Many times my roommates gave me weird looks as I would be cracking up in the corner over the section on mushroom picking or pig hunting. A really great book, great read. Plus a good deal of useful information, I learned a lot about the path of our food.MUCH better than the botany or desire."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read and an important book","review":"Even better than \\"Botany of desire\\"!An important book to read and a real eye-opener about what we eat. You will be stunned to learn WHAT you actually consume, which way it was produced and how it came to be that way.But be advised: this knowledge is not going to make your life easier when you are standing in the supermarket. However, if you use it wisely, it might help you to improve the healthiness as well as the taste of what you put on your table every single day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Insightful","review":"This book has to be the most insightful, most investigated, most interesting book in its field. A must for anyone who questioned the anything about the food on the dinner table.

It got me really thinking about food in a different way. This book examines in detail our food choices as well as where our food comes from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my world...","review":"I recommend this book to everyone I know. The information is so enlightening you will never be able to look at the world the same way again. Michael Pollan takes an ocean of knowledge and makes it completely understandable, interesting, and at times amusing. I felt more like I was having a conversation with Pollan rather than reading a nonfiction book. I went on to read \\"In Denfese of Food\\", which is an absolute MUST to read as a sequal to \\"Omnivore's Dilemma\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true must-read book!","review":"This book sheds light on our food system in a way that most books fail to, whatever the subject. It is not a diatribe against eating meat, as many wrongfully assume. Rather it is an honest glimpse into the life cycle of food. This sounds bland, but the book is flavorful! Pollan's writing is completely engaging, the science and journalism presented are fascinating, and the journey he goes on to bring us the story that he does is an adventure. You simply can't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book on our food supply","review":"Focusing mostly on corn this book just drives home the point that corn subsidies have ruined the American farmer and made us fat.

A great book along with Fat Land, Fast Food Nation and Don't Eat this Book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pollan for Secretary of Agriculture!","review":"Pollan does an amazing job of focusing light on our shadowy industrial food system. He sees the big picture and makes the reader see it too, and without condescension. His criticisms are balanced with positive alternatives, which keep the reader from spiraling into despair. Pollan's writing has the power of truth behind it. I hope Washington is listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book sucks","review":"This is one of the biggest mistakes in all of publishing history.

Read The Botany of Desire and skip this sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should read this!","review":"This was a great book and very eye opening. Since reading it I have really started to make a serious conscious look into what I eat and where it comes from. Since reading it I also have picked up a few of the books written by Joel Salatin the owner to Polyface Farms.The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because of his hunter gather sections. He got into all of this philosophical whiny stuff about hunted animals and his internal struggle blah blah. Plus besides the hunting compared to the rest of the book this section was not too realistic for most people to do anyways.All in all a great book and a must read (you can skip the last section though)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I found it too boring to continue after having read about 1/4 of it.","review":"While I was interested in the topic, it simply could not hold my interest.

His writing is easy to read and he draws you in with the progession of corn from it roots, so to speak, to it's ultimate control of this country. From being force fed high fructose corn syrup to the manipulation of the diets of the animals and fish we eat. The sections on eating wild are funny and factual. Did you know you can catch yeast out of the air to make bread???I am even more convinced now, than before, to eat local food whenever it is available.

Micheal Pollan does an excellent job of tracking down the history of food laws & policies in the U.S. and revealing how that history impacts our national eating habits today. Most of all I liked the ending, which wasn't doom and gloom but rather a positive recounting of the author's own completley home-made meal. He seemed to really challenge himself, and ultimately enjoy himself, while writing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is no Dilemma, just a great book of knowledge","review":"The book came on time and in great condition. I am still reading it now (on meal three) and finding out a lot of things that I did not know and other things that I have just turned a blind eye to. If you want to really get your intelligence started in finding out what you are eating and how it has changed from the good ole days...start here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor research; appeals to emotions rather than intellect","review":"This book presents a very weak argument that is supported with \\"facts\\" that turn out to actually be opinions because they are unsupported scientifically. \\"Professional Aggie\\" has written an excellent review on this book, in fact, there is a long discussion about it here on Amazon presenting both sides of the issue. It is worth a read and you will get more out of the discussion on Amazon than out of reading the book...you'll save money, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made it to chapter 2","review":"I could not even finish the book. When the author began talking about how corn could not exist without humans I just had to give the book up. Clearly he is making assumptions with no facts to back it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"First half of book is stellar","review":"I knew almost nothing about the growth of food in America prior to the reading this book. I thought it was interesting and easily accessible book. I found the first few parts very interesting, and a good way to explore different ways to feed the population. However, the last portion on him creating his own meal appeared to be more of a personal diary entry than an argument or discussion on the benefits for the population as a whole. As even he said, he knew that hunting and gathering is not a realistic way to feed the population of the world. Regardless, it is a good read overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my way of thinking","review":"This book completely changed my way of thinking about food. I've always been very interested in the consequences of our food choices, but Pollan took me several steps further into that process. Pollan didn't write this book to convince anyone of anything, and I really appreciate that. Instead, it represents his own search for the truth and meaning behind our daily bread, and as we travel with him, our own search. There are no clear answers, no absolute rules to adhere to, and Michael Pollan fully respects that.When I read this book, I couldn't help but telling people what I learned, and saying \\"You've really got to read this.\\" On so many levels... It's a fascinating and utterly compelling read on the one hand, and full of things you want everyone to think about on the other hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad about all the rave reviews","review":"I read this book three years ago and finally decided to post my reaction. Michael Pollan's research and engaging story-telling fascinated me, in the first part of the book. But then, I found his blinders sad and his false statements disturbing as he misrepresented the practices of farmers and judged vegetarians/ vegan diets as unhealthy and unsustainable.Also, it was little disgusting that his advice ignored many disadvantaged people lacking time or resources to grow a garden or buy quality food, much less designer food.The New York Times recommendation is becoming a red flag for me as the non-fiction books they rave about are often, like this one, hurriedly sent to press with inaccuracies and glaring bias.I rate this another bestseller that will eventually be abandoned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nutritious Reading","review":"I recommend this for book for anyone interested in getting a good general feel for how food production currently works and exploring ideas of sustainable food production.

It is a story of my life since I have seen the transition from farmers living off 160 acres to corporate farming which consists of either hundreds, sometime thousands, of corn and soybeans, or, animal and poultry confinements. An entire rural culture has changed over the last sixty years. What Pollan says in his book is sadly true.

The audiobook made it easier to get through some rather heavy and over-descriptive material. But that is the beauty of Pollan's style. I have certainly become more informed about mass (\\"industrial\\") food production in the USA.

Obviously, this book is based upon the false premise that homosexuals are denied the right to marry. All homosexuals have the right to marry, so long as their object of matrimony is of the opposite sex. This begs the question...do any of us have the freedom to marry who and/or what we want? Of course not. I can't marry my computer, sister, brother, car, etc. There are restrictions in marriage for everyone.It doesn't take too much work to see through the author's flawed thinking in this excercise in futility.

I know I'm going to be crucified (get it? Crucify <now there's a good song>) for this over at my Tori web ring, but its true. They are both draggy and slow. Its like the same song broken into two tracks. If your diehard tori fan like me, buy it, but don't expect to listen to it more than once. Otherwise spend two more bucks for a good single, or ten for one of her CD's, caz I can see why she did't include these songs on Boys for Pele, and it wasn't diskspace!

It has a dream-like quality that most artists can't even touch. Put this on with your morning cup of coffee, really.There's also something about the piano in this song that sends chills through you. It's beautiful and if you are a fan, you must hear it. (If anyone reading this was at the Salt Lake show for the \\"Venus\\" tour, you've heard it. It was one of the last songs she sang before her encore. It was a rare arena experience.)-- If anyone would like to hear the story about her playing Never Seen Blue in Salt Lake, email me (blankfrank71@hotmail).

This is by far one of the best singles Tori has released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tori fans, rejoice","review":"\\"Jackie's Strength\\" is no doubt one of Tori's best songs. \\"Never Seen Blue\\" and \\"Beulah Land\\" compliment it perfectly, and they make this single worth owning. So many bands/artists slap remixes on singles and call it good. Tori is known for putting never-before-heard songs on her singles, making them a real treat for any of her fans. \\"Never Seen Blue\\" alone would be reason enough to buy this. It has gorgeous lyrics and, of course, wonderful piano. \\"Beulah Land\\" is a little less breath taking but is amazing none the less.

We followed all the directions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!","review":"My son received this as a Christmas present. We opened it and it looked fine, sent away for the ants which took approximately 8 weeks to arrive. When we reopened the gel farm it was covered in mold. I went out and purchased another one and after 2 days the ants hadn't made any tunnels at all. Just went up and down the the holes we created for them and walked across the top. I felt sorry for them so we went out and got the sand farm and that was much cooler. We transferred the ants to that farm and they began to make tunnels all over the place. With the sand farm you do have to feed them though, so keep that in mind if you opt for the sand farm. I would not recommend buying the gel one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed boys","review":"My boys received this as a Christmas present, and being that we live in MN, I waited until mid-April to put in my order for ants. I opened up the box again in mid-May and found out that 1/4 of the gel had gone moldy. I called the company, somehow actually got through, and they promised a sand conversion kit. Today we received our ants and no conversion kit. They conveniently are too busy to answer the phone today and haven't received an email reply either. In short, don't waste your time or money. Product is worthless and customer service is the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused Colony","review":"What an exciting toy to get as a gift. My son was so looking forward to this product that he kept asking me if the ants had arrived. When they did finally arrive only 2 of the 20 ants were moving, the rest of them were dead. Within one day, they were all dead. We have gotten a second batch of ants but they are totally confused. They are not lazy they just have no idea what to do with the gel. We have dug the holes as instructed but the ants just group themselves together not moving.There is a gap on the side of the gel between the gel and the wall. Many of the ants have fallen down the crack. In order to save them we had to lean the farm on it's edge so they could move. I tried giving them water and food - which really did perk them up but only for a little while. There are no tunnels, there is no digging, there are only very confused ants trying to escape. A real disappointment for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please DO NOT buy this!","review":"I don't usually write negative reviews. But this 'Toy' is so sad that I really feel an obligation to warn people not to purchase it. The ants usually arrive dead. We were lucky once and had 3 that were alive. My children were so sad for the ants that were missing heads, legs etc. Then some of the dead ones fell between the gel and wall and started to mould. I could not remove them and the surrounding gel turned yellow with streaks of white mold growing around, this area got larger and larger until I finally threw the whole unit away. The ants never dug tunnels, they merely slid down the sides between the gel and habitat wall. Mostly they just stayed on the top. My children asked me to get rid of it because it made them feel 'yucky'.I really don't think this should be sold at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money like I did!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought this for my 5-year old for Christmas, and waited until spring to order our ants. It took about 5 weeks or so to receive the ants, which was frustrating- but WOULD have been worth it had the ants had behaved as they claimed they would. I, too, received about 25 ants- 8 were D.O.A. That was a bummer since you alledgedly need a group of about 25 to live in the colony. We weren't discouraged at that point, and followed all of the instructions to a T- INCLUDING not moving/touching the habitat, so that the ants wouldn't \\"feel\\" harrassed! The most disappointing part- even though the ants lived from 1-3 months (which isn't even that great), they NEVER EVEN TRIED AT ALL to tunnel on their own. They lived miserably on top of the gel, playing with the dead ones and eventually piling them in a corner which became a grisly moldy scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"4+ months waiting and no ants","review":"My son was thrilled to receive his ant colony for Christmas and couldn't wait for the ants. So far, all we've received is a series of lame postcards saying they're still waiting for ants to ship. As my son said \\"In a couple more weeks, we can find our own!\\" I rated it 5 stars for durability because it's sitting on the shelf abandoned at this point. This toy was a total bust and I would like a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"ant farms need ants.","review":"It took 5 months for the ants to arrive, by that time the gel had dried significantly. Fortunately all the ants were dead, so no problem. Customer service was kind enough to send a new gel farm and more ants. 2/3 of the new ants arrived dead and they remaining 7 barely do anything. My son is embarrassed we gave one of these to a friend as a birthday present and is very disappointed with the toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What ants???","review":"I ordered the ants in December (Christmas present), and although the temperatures were unseasonably warm here throughout January, no ants arrived. I have called several times, with the same excuse. They have my money and won't deliver the ants.I would suggest any other company besides Uncle Milton Industries."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"In the instruction book it says you can connect any ant farm brand habitat together using the antway travel tube connected to the antports. I connected my Uncle Milton's Ant Farm Gel Colony together with my regular Uncle Milton Ant Farm habitat. I followed all included instructions when setting up my ant farms. The ants did not tunnel in the the gel colony at all. Instead, they transported sand from the regular habitat through the antway travel tube and piled it on top of the gel in the gel colony. This caused the gel in the gel colony to get very moldy. Now my ants are dead and my ant farms are full of mold. If you are going to purchase this product do not connect a gel colony with a regular colony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but Harvester Ants can bite and STING!","review":"This is an attractive item, but great care must be taken with the Red Harvester ant colony mailed to you. These ants are aggressive and they bite and sting. Their venom is dangerous for those people who tend to be allergic. The pain of the Harvester Ant's sting has been compared to that of a Paper Wasp! Check it in Wikipedia. OUCH!!I can't believe that these are for kids! Give 'em a ladybug kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for a faulty toy","review":"I got this ant farm for my son and it was not worth it at all. the ants showed up dead so we caught our own. within two houurs they escaped without our kowledge. there is a small pin size hole above where the tubes go, and they all got out of it. the next thing i knew, i was squishing ants in his room. such a rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried to rate it zero stars","review":"This was a Christmas gift for my grandaughter. The ants were to be shipped when the temperature was warm enough and we received an email stating the ants were on their way, two months ago. I thought the ants would be mailed to us because we paid shipping, but this must have been traveling money for them to walk here. Every day we go to the post office to pick them up, and every day she is disappointed. Uncle Milton is a mail order scam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with gel colony","review":"I just wanted to give my review on this product as I'm sure lots of folks out there will spend money on it for their kids... if it worked it would be very nice.. but as others mentioned the weather has to be \\"just right\\" for them to ship the ants which means the gel may or may not be in the right conditions when they arrive (even if it is wrapped in plastic which it was). The ants took a very long time to arrive. After a week or so I too had the white moldy stuff growing everywhere on my son's ant farm. Recently, I just couldnt look at it or the dying ants any longer, so I let them go in my backyard. If I bought a product like this again I would get the sand version as that's what I had as a kid and I remember it working fine.. Good luck to all!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"My son received the ant gel farm for Christmas. I knew the ants weren't included and that I had to request them ASAP since I live in Southern California and it said that they'll ship the ants weather permitting. Since it gets to hot here. I sent the 4 dollar check in December. It has been two months and we haven't received the ants or when we might get them. But they sure cashed the check in time.Since its taking to long, we got some ants locally. We caught them in the park. I used this type of ants before in the sand type ant farms and they worked okay. With the gel farm the ants didn't do much. I poked the gel with the stick and they only did a 1/2 inch hole and thats it.Don't waste your money with this product. It was a big disapointment for my son."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Take home message: If you want a gel ant colony invest in a more expensive version like AntWorks!I bought 6 of these farms for a school project, and I chose them because they were the cheapest of the gel variety. And well, I got what I paid for. After enjoying other great gel colony products like AntsWorks, I was quite disappointed in \\"Uncle Milton's\\" product. First, the gel smells God awful. Second, the tops of some of mine had a milky goo that the ants got stuck in and died. Third, the gel did not fill the entire enclosure and some ants got wedged between the gel and the wall...and died. Fourth, the lids are quite hard to snap on and make me question the \\"escape proof\\" claim. Fortunately, I didn't use the coupon to buy the ants. If you wants ants fast, go to Antsalive.com. They're a great company and you'll get ants in under 2 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"mold on dead ants","review":"Ants took forever to arrive. They arrived dead or perhaps very cold I thought. Put them in the farm. The next daythey were yep still dead except one was growing an incredible amount of mold on it. Yuck. Trying to get a full refund. By now the gel is unuseable and who knows how contaminated the farm is. Complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad & cruel","review":"Had an ant farm as a kid and the ants lived a long, long time, creating tunnels, hauling little branches around, eating the provided food.This product is just torturous and cruel. Avoid it like the plague. No kid should be taught that this is an acceptable way to treat any living creature. Really sad and cruel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeffsjen","review":"We received this ant farm as a gift for my son's 5th birthday and it has been a lot of fun. It did take a while for the ants to come after I mailed in the card and I sure wouldn't waste any extra money on joining the \\"Ant Club\\" for $10, but the ants themselves arrived healthy. After about 2 months, we have no less than 20 interconnected tunnels and we enjoy watching them. They have definite sleep patterns and they sleep huddled together in the middle. Very interesting. We have not had any suffocations or suicides, as other reviews have experienced. The only thing I would caution about is that the top of the farm does open easily and smaller folks may figure this out and accidentally let the ants out. Overall we are very pleased though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shortlived","review":"It also took us about 8 weeks to receive our ants. When we received them, they were all alive except for one or two. I didn't count them, so I don't know exactly how many there were alive. We followed the directions precisely and the ants started to dig tunnels, but then they all died within three days. What a disappointment after waiting so long to get them. I'm going to try to return the item, but I'm concerned it's been too long since the purchase date. After reading others' reviews I'm not going to try to deal with the company. Great idea for a product, but not what it advertises to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"my daughter loves it","review":"I bought this product before I looked at the reviews, so I had little expectations since it had such a low rating. As stated before in other comments, the ants took 8-9weeks to arrive in the mail. Set up was easy. Within a week the ants started digging a tunnel, and now a little over a month later there are several tunnels throughout the gel. There was a little bit of mold from dead ants at the top, but I scooped it out with a clean metal spoon, and there seems to be no problem since. My daughter received this as a gift from us for her fifth birthday, and loves it. Everyone who comes to our house is fascinated by ant farm. A great educational gift. I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for warm/humid climate","review":"Like others have noted about this product, you may have to wait awhile for your ants depending on where you live. My son received his ant farm for his birthday in June, but due to the heat here in Houston, he didn't get any ants until October. Unfortunately, the gel started to mold a couple of weeks after we put the ants in it and I just ended up dumping the whole thing into the yard yesterday because the poor ants were overwhelmed with mold in their home. The gel was fine while we waited for the ants to arrive because I kept the original plastic cover on top of it, but as soon as it was exposed to the air for a while, it was a mess. We're going to try a more traditional sand farm next time,...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...","review":"Several ants arrived dead, or died shortly thereafter. The surviving ants never tunneled, they just climbed down the side, got stuck and died. I suggest renaming this item the \\"Uncle Milton Ant Gel Cemetery Colony.\\" Very disappointed with the product and will never buy Uncle Milton products again. The seller shipped timely, but should reconsider carrying this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to beat a dead ant, but ...","review":"Like most of the other reviewers have mentioned, almost all of the ants arrive dead, and it took 6 weeks to get them. There were only 2 survivors out of the first batch. After several attempts, I finally was able to speak with someone at Uncle Milton. He told me he would ship a new batch. The second group came within 2 weeks, but it also only contained 2 live ants. I put the new 2 with the original 2, based on the advice of the customer service rep I spoke with, and the next day was back to just 2 live ants. One of the groups either killed the other group, or the 2 new ones didn't make it through the night. Now, one week late, another one has died so I have only one live ant. I have called them again and will receive yet another shipment -- but it will be several months. I guess I will give it one more shot -- but I'm not holding my breath. This was given to my son as a gift, but based on our experience I would NEVER buy one of these for anyone. It's just cruel."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO TUNNELS","review":"As others have mentioned it took several months to get the ants. My son was so excited when he got this for his birthday and was disappointed over and over again when he asked when his ants were going to be here. The ants are living on top of the gel and not digging tunnels. A few attempted to move away from the top only to get stuck in the gel or fall down the sides and die. My husband finally put a little sand on top for the 5 ants still alive and they are moving around a lot more. However, after reading other reviews I expect that it will start molding. The frog habitat stinks too. We had more luck getting tadpoles out of a fountain and keeping them in a bucket. I have to agree with my 5-yr old \\"they want you to buy their toys and they don't work!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless and frustrating","review":"We had no problems receiving our ants - they came promptly and were healthy. For a day. Within hours the ants just started dying - the survivors piled all the dead ones in one spot on the top of the gel. A few valiant soldiers last for a couple of weeks, but they NEVER started tunnelling - they just crawled around on top of the gel and their dead friends. My sons were VERY disappointed in this experiment - I might be inclined to try a traditional ant farm - but never this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"7 months waiting and dead ants","review":"I bought this item for my daughter as a birhtday gift.

They died 2 weeks later and the green gel got moldy. This defective item made my daughter very upset. I wasted money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run away! Get the sand version.","review":"This was a huge waste of money. The ants took forever to ship, as many other reviewers have pointed out, but my real complaint is that they never really dug in.

The gel farm arrived fine, but from day one smelled of curdled milk. I ordered ants from a competitor after some research and knowing they'll probably arrive dead months later if I used the form which came with this farm. All ants arrived alive and active, about a week after I placed the order online. Put them in, and by second day mildew formed on all walls, gel on top and sides turned into puddles of disgusting soup and gel separated from walls and started to mildew - it stunk inside! Ants never dug tunnels, just remained on top of the disgusting, runny gel. What a nightmare. Had to throw out, very sad for the ants. Please, do not buy this product, no matter how discounted it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I bought this for my twins and thought this was going to be a great project. First off, they arrived with under 10 alive....the rest had died. I received it straight from the mail delivery truck as we were waiting anxiously, so they did not sit at all. Second, we followed all directions regarding transferring, and got them all set up. They never did dig the way they are supposed to, so this was very disappointing, and now we have all of them dead but one, and a heaping amount of mold in the container and I am not sure what to do with the last fellow.

The first real song (\\"The Song That Goes Like This\\") does not even appear until the middle of Act One.Overall, the score is not quite as good as \\"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\\", but still thoroughly enjoyable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spamalot LOL","review":"If you've seen the play this is GREAT... all the key songs with the original cast including the incomparable Sara Ramirez as the Lady of the Lake (her performance was worth the price of admission alone) and Tim Curry as King Arthur.If you have NOT seen the play, but are a fan of the movie, you will be perplexed in places as the former only generally follows the latter. Still, the Python humor of unexpected twists is there."},{"rating":"2","title":"what could be better than a monthy python musical??","review":"If you had a chance to see this show on Broadway I am sure you would agree that it was one of the best shows ever to grace the streets of New York.

Buy it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is worth the price of the CD","review":"Often I write: \\"You have to see the show to enjoy the CD\\" but this CD is one of a few Broadway soundtracks that even if you are remotely familiar with Monte Python, you will enjoy no matter what.Classic stuff gleaned from the troupe's \\"Holy Grail,\\" \\"Spamalot\\" is a winner! This CD is really really funny with catchy tunes that you will hum along to again and again... \\"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"More Spam Please","review":"Spamalot was hilarious when I saw it in London and again in Portland, OR. This soundtrack has everything from marching band to Gregorian chant to gospel to lounge lizard.

If you like musicals or if you hate musicals, this is one to listen to again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lot of Spam","review":"Great CD if you like someone who can laugh at themselves.

I thought the songs were witty and the production numbers were riotously funny. I couldn't wait until the OC was available.Funny, how memory plays tricks on us. When I got the CD I was amazed to realize that the music wasn't as good as a commercial jingle and the lyrics weren't witty at all. I tried listening to it again and couldn't get through it.This is not The Producers.

However, the issue with merely listening to it is that many of the jokes do not translate without the visuals to go along with them.Having seen the national tour with Gary Beach, I can understand the fad that Spamalot brings with it wherever it travels but prior to seeing it, I must confess, I was not on the bandwagon.I wouldn't be too much of a lesser person without it in my collection, go buy Light In the Piazza!This being said, Sara Ramirez is just to die for on the recording.Songs to download: Find Your Grail, Song That Goes Like This, Diva's Lament"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"All I can say is that I've listened to this countless times since I bought it a few weeks ago, and I still laugh at many parts, just thinking of it on stage.

I purchased it because I will be attending a Broadway performance of Spamalot in April, and I wanted to get an idea of what to expect when I see the show live! Of course, I've been a fan of Monty Python humor for a long time, and loved the original movie, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, that this show is \\"lovingly\\" based on! The actors in the original Spamalot case are mad talented, and I'm excited about seeing this show live! I highly recommend this album for anyone looking for a taste of this high-energy and just plain silly-funny show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Humourous Musical from MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL","review":"This musical should be pleasing to every Monty Python fan who saw and enjoyed their production of the Holy Grail. The musical itself is fast-paced with astonishing energy. It introduces \\"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\\" from THE LIFE OF BRIAN (a delightful reprise there!) and the Lady of the Lake makes a surprising and somewhat surrealistic appearance early in the show. Despite what \\"Dennis\\" claims, she's NOT a \\"watery Tart.\\" While not a re-make of HOLY GRAIL, many of its scenes are recreated. A wonderful production all in all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't run away!","review":"I am not going to see the live show until December 17, but I've had this soundtrack for weeks and cannot stop listening to it. It captures the irreverent comedy of Monty Python with some wonderful additions. The soundtrack is well done and I had to see the show with the original cast because of it. Sara Ramirez is particularly wonderful. Some of the songs I can't stop singing:Find Your GrailHis Name is LancelotAlways look on the Bright Side of LifeRun Away!You Won't Succeed on BroadwayDiva's LamentBut the whole soundtrack is great - there's not a single song I skip - no matter how many times I've listened to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clasic of the clasic...","review":"This is the first CD of Silvio I think, or the most clasic songs, very nice CD.

I wanted to use it to stop my neighbors dogs from barking when I am home. We share a fence, so I could walk over and point the device at the dogs and they would just look at me. I tried multiple times with no effect or change in behavior. I changed the battery, and again same result. The red light would like up, and I could hear a sound, but it caused no reaction from the dogs. I even tried it on my girlfriends dog and my cats, with nothing. Hope that helps. I returned the product to get a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"This ACTUALLY works!!","review":"This was by far the best few dollars ever spent. After trying to correct my dog from barking for the last four years, my sister-in-law told me to try this product as it worked on her Husky. It literally took TWO corrections! Now a simple 'No' (no shouting required) gets his attention. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this product in hopes of being able to quiet my neighbor's small dog that barks constantly every time I enter my back yard.

Perhaps it would work better at an even closer range but for my purposes it was of no use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totaly Useless","review":"This product would work better if it were a rock, then at least I could throw it at the dog and get his attention. The product was completely useless at any distance. I think maybe they were laughing at me under their breath.

(the rock did...no more problems when they see me)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A gamble","review":"I have read reviews from others saying this thing works. However, for my three small dogs it doesn't do much. I know they can hear something because when I push the button to emit the sound I can see them tilting their heads like they hear something. However, it doesn't stop them when they are barking. I am not even sure they can hear it when they are barking. I am wondering if one of the more expensive sound emitting devices would work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"My neighbor dog loves this stuff","review":"My neighbor's dog backs days and night and they never even try to shut him off. He was barking tonight so i decided to try this product on him. I tried pushing the button for half a second, a second, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, 10 seconds. Nothing would work. He would just bark before, after and while I would push the button. I was about 15 feet away and pointing the remote straight to him. I would not see a positive effect one way or the other.Either this product does not work or the dog is as stupid as my neighbor."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works!","review":"I was skeptical, but bought it anyway. I'm really glad I did. We have neighbor dogs that stand at the lot line and bark hysterically at us when we are out in our yard. One press of the button, and they turned around and walked away.

I tried it on multiple breeds of dogs, from within a few feet to 50 feet of range. Some dogs turned their heads but that could have easily been a coincidence. It did not produce the effect I wanted (the dogs to stop barking and run away).In addition, the battery compartment is almost too small for the battery. It took some effort to actually get the battery inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly this was a big waste of money!","review":"Ok I saw the mixed feedback. Figured I would try it out and see for myself...to try and stop our 12 week old puppy from barking nonstop and to correct him from jumping up. I am sad to report it was a waste of money. I know our puppy hears it...he could care less. it doesn't even phase him, he looks at it and doesn't even stop what he is doing. He is a mix of lab and newfoundland...no idea if this matters. Anyhow the previous reviewers that said they can hear it when put up to their ear are correct. you can hear a faint sound. Needless to say, I wouldn't waste your money on this.

In my case, I was trying to train a new puppy to not jump on the older dog we have. It worked, but in the meantime, the older dog can also hear it and therefore would go off and hide in the house to get away from it. I will say it only took a few days to get the attention of the puppy. All we have to do now is pick it up and point it and he will settle down, without actually activating the sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit almost immediately","review":"On the first day of testing some dogs seemed to notice it, others didn't. By the second day out, all dogs paid it no mind at all. Being a service tech, I opened it (easy to do) and found the oscillator did not always kick start and the switch had to be pressed hard to make turn it on (merely clicking it didn't always work.) But even when the oscillator was running (as shown by an oscilloscope connected to the output to the transducer), a small microphone connected to the oscilloscope, 2 inches from the transducer, would only occasionally pick up any output, and that usually quite weak. I think there is something wrong with the transducer. Either that or the dogs in my neighborhood are all deaf. My own dog doesn't even turn his head if I blast him with it only 5 feet away (from behind). After writing this I am going to hunt around for a way to contact Amazon for a replacement or refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works good on some dogs","review":"I have an aussie/husky mix that barks alot so I bought this on a recommendation and when i was training him and he didn't listen i'd zap him, he noticed it but he just ran away confused.

I think dogs can hear something when activated. I say that because when used on a docile dog, you might see a slight reaction from the dog. Nothing spectacular though... ears perk up, or head turns slightly. It is obviously only a mild sensation.If you plan to use this to ward off agitated dogs all I can say is be prepared to throw this at the dog, because the noise it makes does NOTHING to fend off an excited dog.

I WAS VERY CAREFUL NOT TO BE ABUSIVE--NOW WHEN I TELL HER TO BE QUITE FOR SOME REASON SHE DOES IT!!THE REASON I DID'NT GIVE IT 5 STARS I COULD'NT GET THE BATTERY COVER TO STAY ON.

If I get closer (within 5') to try and stop the barking...he will tend to bark AT it. So unless it is used with some other kind of reinforcement...it doesn't work so well.What has worked is a squirt gun...he doesn't like water. Found this out when I turned the hose on him one time. Now I need to find a squirt gun holster...and I'm all set.

Not sure who wrote the reviews (probably an employee of the company who made the product) but the dogs did not respond to it at all!!!

It is a total waste of money!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"surprise! it works!","review":"The unit is like others have stated; once the battery goes in, the back cover does not fit. Oh well. You push the button and while the little light goes on, you cannot tell if its doing anything else.Having said that, it's been 4 weeks, and the neighbors dogs totally get quiet when I hold the button! They stay there wagging their tails, it does not seem they are in any discomfort. They simply stop barking.It works on the rotties and border collies, but not so much on the little yappers across the street (I think they are pocket dogs)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"After many successes, I finally made a purchase that didn't work out. I bought this item to help with training a puppy. It does not seem to work at all. One time I thought I saw the puppy raise her ears momentarily, but she did not stop what she was doing.Typically she did not seem to even notice when I tried to use this device. Distance, close or far away, did not seem to matter. Tried two different brand new batteries. This made no difference.The product does not work. I've returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't phase my dog","review":"The first time I tried this, I had to press the button several times before my dog even noticed it. And then, he only did so with mild interest. My dog is a Great Dane though, I don't know if it makes a difference, but from what I've read it seems to work well on smaller dogs, and that may mean that smaller animals have more acute hearing. For instance, my cat HATES it. His ears fold back and he runs off. I was really hoping this would work for my big boy, but he really doesn't seem to care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I have a min pin that I love dearly, but she has the attention span of a gnat and will bolt right past me and out the door if she gets an opportunity.

This thing works like a charm, and I don't even have to press the button but once every couple of weeks for a split second, literally, to \\"remind\\" her that the front door is forbidden territory. Because I live on a major highway and despite being 12 inches tall this dog THINKS she weighs 300 pounds and has no fear of anything, there is no question in my mind that this has saved her life.

One is a leader and the others follow. They tend not to listen when given directions if something has caught their attention. The lead dog can hear this dog repeller.

She is accustomed to it and reacts immediately, but I noticed that other dogs, that never heard this sound before just get confused and ignore it. So I guess all the bad reviews are basically about the dogs that just don't know how to react to it.Also it has a distance range. It probably would not work on your neighbor dog if you press it inside of your house. I would say 20ft is probably the farthest your dog can be from you to hear it.My dog has some separation issues that are annoying. Like when I leave her outside coffee shop she starts barking at the door. Well with the push of a button she shuts up immediately. Very handy. The only draw back it is bulky. If you take it along you will feel it in your pocket and there is no way to clip it to the leash unless you drill holes in it yourself.I am thinking about buying couple more and have it throughout the house.By the way, works on cats too. They can't stand that sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works!!","review":"I have 2 chihuahua's. They are yapper's.

It appeared to have worked on a small yap-happy dog but on subsequent trys I got nothing. Also tried on a very agressive dog who was behind a fence and it appeared to only make him more hostile. It's too bad cause from the previous reviews it sounded like it would work. Really need a larger more expensive unit if you really want to stop incessant barking."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT product","review":"I bought the cheaper version because of the price. After reading the reviews on other products, I thought it might not do the trick so why spend the money. I'm very pleased. I orginally was trying to stop the aggressive dog next door from standing at the fence and barking, because I have 2 dogs that go crazy when they see him outside. This dog just stands at the fence, barking, it's so hard to sit outside and enjoy my backyard. Well, the product works not on the neighbors dog, laugh but on my two. I just tap the button and point it toward them and say get away from the fence and they slink away. It's a great training tool, the neighbors dog isn't intent on barking cause he has no one along the fence to be aggressive with..............my two are staying away from the fence and are playing on the other side of the yard.................I'm extremely happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful on dogs","review":"One star because rating system does not allow zeroes.It freaks the cat out, works well to stop her from whining, but does nothing to barking dogs.

It does seem to work with my daughter's dog (a pug) but not our dog (a Shiba Inu). I do know for a fact that she has great hearing since she always seems to know when a car pulls up into our driveway.

Now the peace has desended on the household. All I do is say \\"quiet\\" and go to reach for the reepeller and both dogs just stop barking. So thanks for an item I should have purchased years ago.

This did not work for me at all. I used it on my dogs here at home and it worked but only because I was about 2 feet away from them. The range is just not far enough to help me on a bike, and I don't like the idea of letting a dog get that close to me on a bike either, my mistake in purchasing this product with such a limited range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog Repeller","review":"Fair price, effective training device.

I held it up to my face and activated it and I could hear it; but my dogs had no effect to the sound.

So, I decided to get this. Well, to my dismay this thing does NOT work AT ALL. I put it up to my ear and can hear the high pitched sound, but the dog has absolutely no response. It just barks and barks and barks. So, I guess it's back to calling animal control every other day.

The worst part is that it only lasted for a day and a half. Now it doesnt even work. Completely broken!!! I wasted 13.00 dollars on this device only for it to be of no help what so ever. I am lucky that I didn't purchase it to protect myself from big dogs. It would have left me defenseless. I do not recommend this device to anyone. I am going to buy a bark collar instead.

Wanted to stop her from going to the glass door and peeping threw the blinds every time she heard a noise. It got her attention the first time. By the second use of clicking and giving the command of \\"inside\\" she listens to the command every time now, without using the clicker.We have had other loose dogs run up to us and start barking, as soon I click they run away. Don't use it too close to YOUR dog or it will bother them and make them growl and get angry.I would and do recommend it to other pet owners. Cheaper than the \\"As Seen On TV\\" Item and probably works better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I was really hoping this item would work. I have two labrador puppies, a male and a female, from the same litter. The female barks for attention, when I get her food ready, when she's unhappy about something, etc., etc. This device has pretty much no effect on her at all. A few times I thought that maybe it was having an impact, but I've come to believe that she is simply responding to my voice. That's fine, even better than responding to the electronic device, but I believed the hype surrounding this product, and for me the hype doesn't pan out."},{"rating":"1","title":"No correct 6v battery connection","review":"After purchasing a 6v battery, I found that the connecting wired pieces within the item matched up to fit the exact size of the 6v battery connectors.

Shape is a little weird, since they wanted to print a logo on the right side, but no so much that it will hinder your work.

I have owned it for about three months but say less than two months because I do not sit at my PC every day as would an Adm. Assistant. The seam has failed and the stuffing is squeezing out. The wave design IMHO is just an excuse to skimp on materials, and cheap materials at that! I've had other products which lasted two years before the seal holding the stuffing failed. The stuffing consists of a thin rectangle of foam surrounded by a softer dense foam which feels like semi-dried latex chalking. Better products have a solid core of silicon jel which cushions the wrist while retaining it's shape for years. I may as well just be using the neoprene backing at this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable","review":"For the price the two Belkin ergonomic items I purchased are a good buy. The are not exactly what I expected, I thought they would be a little more comfortable and softer. These are not uncomfortable, but the are \\"structured\\" and a bit to molded for my liking. However they are doing the job and they were very well priced! The mouse pad is probably a little higher on the scale as it has plenty of mousing room on the pad and the rest is suited better to actual natural resting position. Either way they seem to be well constructed and will last for quite a while if taken care of, not forgetting saving our poor wrists from carpel tunnel or the like! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent for the cost!!","review":"Does what its supposed to do.

Not too long after I got it, I noticed that the middle part of it was developing a bubble/wrinkle and eventually split at the seam after about 9 months. I can only guess this was because I would occasionally rest my elbow on it as I was leaning forward to read the screen.I plan to replace it with this same product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart after less than a year of use","review":"Update to below: Against my better judgment, I bought a second one of these, thinking that perhaps the first one had been defective. The new one didn't even last a month before it split open and spewed sticky gel gunk all over my keyboard and desk. I won't make the mistake of buying another one, they are poorly made.------Why can't somebody create a gel-filled wrist rest that holds up?I bought the Belkin wrist rest pad to replace my previous one (3M) which had fallen apart. All I do is rest my wrists on it while typing. I don't squeeze it, touch it or abuse it in any other way. Yet in less than a year, the outer covering split open along one of the seams and the inner material started coming out. By the time I realized it, I had gummy gel bits all over the place, including inside my keyboard where they were making keys stick. It took me a couple of hours of unpleasant effort to \\"ungunk\\" my keyboard.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"asymmetrical shape","review":"Make sure you pay attention to the fact that this is shaped asymmetrically.

Being on a budget, price played a large part in the choice. However, within about a week of use, the gel pad inside seemed to have begun to shrink up as the cover became increasingly loose and wrinkled up, too big for what was underneath. I've only been using the item a couple of months and the cloth cover has begun to come loose from the base of the pad. I guess you get what you pay for. *smirk* I definitely do not recommend this item because its construction leaves much to be desired in quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrist Pad","review":"No problems, this item works great and is curved for your comfort as well as cushioned also.

However, like others have noted, the most cushiony parts collapsed after awhile (the places where my wrists generally sit) and eventually the lower left corner split.

So I stopped that and have been sitting with an open seam and small bits of foam falling out now and again.

My wrists stopped aching. What a world of difference it made! I recommend it to all my friends who spend long hours at the computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Junk! Won't last more than a year.","review":"I bought one of these a year ago but recently I've been noticing the stuffing is all over my desktop.The sides are sewn, rather poorly I might add and the gel that is inside spills out like a leaky bean bag chair.Who knows if this stuff is toxic or not.Why not make a solid foam pad that will stand up to normal use?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Short and Too Hard of Material","review":"I bought this to replace another gel wrist rest. I couldn't tell which brand it was and didn't realize that all \\"gel\\" material was not created equally. Too bad I already opened up the clam shell casing and couldn't return it. The shape doesn't bother me but the gel seems underfilled. It sinks inward in the center of the wrist rest. I am going to give this one to my 4 year old to use for his netbook since it is also not long enough for my 17 inch laptop. I am going to keep on looking for a better option.

Useless for my needs, waste of money; the old, battered wrist rest I have will still have to serve me as no one makes a decent sized one anymore.This Belkin product is so skinny that it probably wouldn't have been very comfortable anyway.My advice: look elsewhere.One good note, Amazon is giving me a full refund -- only good thing about this whole unfortunate purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crummy Noisy Smelly Waste of your Money!!","review":"This wrist rest is a complete waste of money.

Oh and I went to return it and both Amazon and the USPS wanted to charge me $9 to return a $10 item. Like hell if I am going to pay that much instead of throwing the piece of crap away. Do not waste your money. Look at other items. Buyer Beware!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Hard (same problem as the mouse pad)","review":"Same problem as the mouse pad:Sincerely, I've read a number of comments saying this thing is too hard, and as it is not too expensive, I thought I might give it a try. It is definitely much too hard (is it realy gel inside ? It feels more like dense foam or rubber ...)I don't think I will get used to it as the thing is supposed to take the shape of the wrist and not the opposit. In fact, even after half an hour of use, my right wrist is already slowly getting uncomfortable warm and it seems also that the stiffness of that thing increases the friction on the synthetic surface. So I'm already looking for another real wrist rest...And forgot to add: strong chemical plastic smell !"},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't hold up to elbow abuse","review":"I purchased this product to replace my previous gel wrist rest that had finally worn out after many months of use. This pad wasn't as good as I hoped it to be. First, the product did not give off a bad odor when I removed it from the box, as others have stated. But the gel is very firm and not very comfortable. I really wanted it to feel like gel, but instead it feels like a dry sponge. I primarily use wrist rests for my elbow. Within two days, I already had a permanent indentation where my elbow commonly rests. After a month of use, I have permanent places on the rest where it has bottomed out all the way. To be fair, it is a wrist rest, so I guess it isn't designed for elbows. The positives are that the neoprene outside is sturdy and the edges seem to hold well (so far). But if you are looking for a gel rest that feels like soft gel, this isn't the product. I am already looking for a replacement for this one after only a month of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"The wrist pad could be longer for my keyboard tray, but it is a well-made product and I am using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor","review":"I use a wrist support to protect my arms from rough wood on the edge of my desk. I purchased this based on good results from Belkin products. Unfortunately, this product does not measure up. The foam in the rest collapses as soon as you put any weight on it. I bought a matching mouse pad with wrist rest at the same time. The cushion on the mouse pad works fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfy, but sucks","review":"This thing fell apartment after maybe a month of use.

It is as hard as the petrified one I got rid of, it is narrow and it is half as deep as the one I had before. Also, it has some kind of depression in it on the left hand end, so whatever gel is in it doesn't help at all there. Since there were no other selections available for gel wrist rests, I could not \\"divine\\" all of this from pic and product description. A bargain NOT!! I am looking for a replacement, NOT where I got this one, fer shur. And, I am highly disappointed in this offering from Amazon--this was my first foray into purchasing non book items from Amazon. And oh--ergonimic??--NO WAY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"quit crying about the smell, great product, good buy.","review":"You can't smell anything unless you put your nose on the pad. It smells like brand new sneaker rubber on the back, on the top side it has a small hint of crazy glue smell. It just smells like brand new sneakers fresh out the box. It does not leave a smell on your wrist. Like I said you can't smell it unless you put your nose on the pad, the only reason im writing this review is because I almost did not buy it because of all the little B1tch3's crying about the smell of these pads, for the price of the 3M name brand wrist pad I got this keyboard wrist pad with the belkin mouse pad for the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Firm and soft, but...","review":"Wonderful very comfortable wrist rest with a durability problem. You must be careful not to position your elbow on the left side when relaxing or the pressure will eventually cause the seam to open and the gel to escape. The covering fabric is glued down when it should be stitched so it will separate. Otherwise the gel covered foam inside is firm yet soft. How do I know what's inside? Because two of them have torn open so far. Yuck, gooey gel! I think that 2 stars is appropriate. Belkin should use a better glue."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad shape","review":"Why is it shaped so there is little or no support for the right wrist? I would recommend getting something else.

If you have already done your homework or have started working for a major broker/dealer, then you probably won't sacrafice too much. Of course, that isn't to say you won't get something out of it.

I would encourage you to view this book in terms of a basic introduction to the field and career of financial planning - don't expect advanced tactics or strategies.

I personally love the songs on his single, and for you parents out there, this is great music that you can listen to with your children, no innuendos or vulgar language.

My family thinks that I have lost it but when there is someone whose whole heart is into something as much as Taylor's is, you definitely have to support that person (in this case, Taylor!).I absolutely love this version of Do I Make You Proud. I listened to it all the way to work this morning and it was truly inspiring. I put myself in that song and wondered if I was being the best that I could be that others would be proud of me.

I've enjoyed it year after year but when Taylor sang \\"A Change is Gonna Come\\" at his audition, it was foreboding. Nobody put as much energy and passion into their performances during the years as he has. Who have you ever seen fall on the floor at the end of one of his performances? Who brought the audience to their feet as much as he did just because they wanted to share in his passion and enjoyment of the music. This is not going to be Taylor's best work -- that's still yet to happen, especially when his complete CD has his magic touch on it. Everybody I talked to enjoyed watching AI just to see Taylor perform. This song just absolutely takes my breath away and it's amazing -- use it for graduations or to send to the military or just to give to your kids to let them know how proud you are of them. The words are poignant and the song is sung beautifully.

Overall the song is \\"ok\\" as far as lyrics and composition, but nothing to get excited about.HOWEVER!!!... The WAY it was sung: the raw feeling, the great vocal performance, the way the song momentum builds into a memorable grip on your emotions ... it's FANTASTIC!! I REALLY enjoy listening to this song, repeatedly, on the car stereo.The \\"B\\"-side of \\"Takin' It To The Streets\\" is not very original in its arrangement.

One of the things I like best about him is that he always manages to inject his personality and style into whatever he sings. Yet his songs never become boring or mundane and I think that that is the mark of talent. \\"Do I Make You Proud\\" is typical AI pop fluff but the song is actually quite good when it is Taylorized. I loved \\"Taking It To the Streets\\" when he performed it on the show, but sadly the CD version doesn't quite live up. The song is more believable when you can see the dancing that goes along with it. Other than that, this is a good CD single and definitely worth your $3. Both finalists' singles are a bargain right now so we should snatch them up while we can. I'm happy for Taylor and his fans, and this CD is only the first taste of what is sure to be successful recording career up ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK for me Dawg.....","review":"Taylor Hicks is a great performer, but just not a very good singer. While I totally enjoyed watching him on American Idol, listening to him without the visual is a very different experience. There is nothing unique about his voice, others like Michael MacDonald and Joe Cocker have been there, done that. I'm sure seeing him in concert would be a fun experience, but I don't think I'll be buying his full length CD when it comes out because his voice does not make me want to listen to it over and over like some of my other favorite artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"definitely not the best","review":"Dont get me wrong, I like Taylor, just not obsessed like some people.

Taylor could sing the ABC's and I would still buy it because he injects raw emotion into whatever it is he sings. I actually really like DIMYP because it seems in some quirky way to fit Taylor's whole journey on IDOL. While I agree that DIMYP is not what he typically would sing if given a choice, if anyone has heard his pre-Idol stuff, the man is a talented singer/songwriter very much capable of doing original work, and not just a \\"good cover artist\\" suited for \\"Vegas or Branson\\" as one reviewer indicated. \\"Somehow\\" is a powerful, soulful ballad and \\"Hell of a Day\\" could be a number one hit if it were released tomorrow (both from \\"Under the Radar\\").

Taylor can sing and he has soul...those are given. He is a natural performer and quite possibly the most charismatic artist I have seen in quite a while. He is able to successfully turn \\"Do I Make You Proud\\" into his own song and I'm impressed by that. While I loved \\"Taking it to the Streets\\" when he performed it on the show, the recorded version loses a lot of energy and appeal for me. However, the song is by no means horrible....it just loses some of its shine which is why I'm taking off 1 star. Definitely buy this CD single because it is worth your $3.

While many people are critical of his lack of range, many other great artists have been just as limited and have managed to find just the right combination for their songs. Overall, I think Taylor has the potential of joining those whose songs he has used so far. I finally bought this CD and I must say it is not all bad. You do miss his showmanship and all is left is his musical ability which, again, is not totally bad, just different than more musically talented singers.

His take on the song, is refreshing, intuitive and remarkable. The more I hear it, the more I love it. He has an uncanny ability to sell a song.I need to feel a connection to someone in order to feel an emotional connection to a song. Taylor is an artist who has that innate ability and it is something you can't teach someone. They are born with it. That creative outlet which allows a musician to establish a connection with the audience and with the song.Taylor is as \`real' as they come. Raw, passionate, intuitive and approachable.His upcoming album is going to be a nothing like we have seen before.With his attention to detail, his knowledge of music history and hisability to \`capture' his artistry in the music medium, will no doubtparlay his gift into a CD which will be a breakthrough in AI history.It will crossover many genres and individuals who thoughtIDOL winners were all the same will be blown away by Taylor.I, for one, can't wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Taylor Hicks ROCKS!","review":"I've been a fan since Las Vegas and will continue to be for as long as he's making music.

I have played this short cd over and over and \\"Do I Make You Proud\\" still brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it. On the flip side I enjoyed the second song \\"Takin It To the Streets\\" much better because I thought it highlighted his voice much clearer and that's his genre by far! Although I like ballads very much and they move me emotionally, I prefer Taylor singing those wild, upbeat, fun songs that make you groove! Can't wait to hear his entire collection of songs and I hope he sticks with those upbeat songs as well. Go Taylor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hope he makes you proud!","review":"you won't be sad you bought this! Its amazing, I love the lyrics, but most of all his voice is just beautiful.

His first single with \\"Do I Make You Proud\\" and \\"Takin' it to the Streets\\" is so completely different compared to other AI finalists in this season and past seasons that he just stands out so easily!

He deserves to be the American Idol!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, Taylor has made Us Proud!!!","review":"I just love this song!!! It's even better than I thought it would be.

The screams and thunderous applause when he introduced it at the AI finals made it quite clear that he did and does indeed make us proud!Taylor is here to stay; he is fast becoming a household name, and I can hardly wait for his full album to come out in November. I love this guy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do I make you proud.","review":"The CD was well worth the wait. I wondered if Taylor could make a CD that could be as orginal as he is on tv.

I watched you evolve on American Idol from a very good singer to a fantastic singer. You have taken a song that was written for AI and turned it into your own. \\"Taking It To The Streets\\" takes me back to my younger days and when I feel music was at it's peak. I admire Taylor Hicks because he's not afraid to sing and play music that he feels is right, not just go with the flow. More power to him. He has talent that hasn't even been tapped yet, and he is already at a point where some seasoned professionals only wish they could be. I can only see success for Taylor Hicks in the future.

This is the best vocal performance in the history of recorded sound. I'm a little creeped out by the look he's giving me on the cover, but when I hear these songs, I climb to the tallest hill in Nebraska and sing songs from my favorite musicals like Chippy. I am numbed by the sheer perfection of this. Go Taylor, woo hoo!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good stuff","review":"[...]I've liked Taylor from the beginning of AI. He was unique and seemed to have a love of music and performing. Those qualities came through in spades in his TV performances and is why he ultimately won.

DIMYP is simply a badly-written song, it is too idolish and the title of the song is worse. \\"Takin'it To the Streets\\" is not bad, but it's not that good either. It's not even one of his best performance. Anyhow, I would like expect more for his new album. I guess he still has that star factor, which makes him become the Idol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed more than enjoyed","review":"Sorry to say but Taylor's single is not great.

I think this change is exactly what the industry needs right now and we're getting a sample of it with his new single.

I read the book a few weeks ago, after seeing so much of the Knoxville Area press, and reading these reviews. My verdict: it's simply poor writing. The characters are all cliches of \\"drug hell\\" literature: the listless but salvageable protagonist, the hyper-intelligent and (we are told by the author) \\"charismatic\\" drug gang leader, the dutiful drug groupie girlfriends, the \\"wild and crazy\\" decadent bunch. The \\"metaphors\\" for various evils, etc, fall flat. The reader is expected to be shocked because the author all but says directly \\"You are reading something shocking.\\" The women characters in particular are one dimensional.

I experienced this time in my life. It is really weird to read about it after all this time. But I must say, although it is one sided, it is pretty accurate to the actual occurances of several mad men. And women. And although I no longer can see the time and temperature from a friends bedroom window, I have to say that this is a time in my life I will never forget.

Jimmy Love is a rebellious teenager who comes under the influence of bad company in the form of Piper, who introduces him to alcoholism, drug addiction and general mayhem. Piper mesmerizes Jimmy until Jimmy finally begins to recognize that he is involved in a web of increasing evil and that the end result will be his damnation unless he can free himself of his various demons. This is a book of rare substance and I look forward to the author's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-written exploration of evil","review":"THE KILLER OF LOVE is a well-written exploration of evil and its consequences that I found to be a compelling read. The Hippie House, the terrifying Grid of Self-Knowledge, and bewildered teenagers like Jimmy Love - or their equivalents - were no doubt a familiar sub-stratum of life in university towns across this country in the seventies and eighties. Mr. Conley has managed to convey well the squalor and futility of a lifestyle centered around the endless quest for the next beer, the next party, the next fix. But it is the power of Piper and the mysterious ascendancy he holds over his followers that is the core of this novel. To believe that such charismatic evil actually exists, one has only to recall Charlie Manson and Jim Jones of an earlier time. Jimmy Love's struggle against the lure of Piper's amoral siren song makes this book worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite latin jazz CDs","review":"Paquito D'Rivera, Arturo Sandoval, Giovanni Hidalgo, Mark Walkerr...and more...what more can you ask forFriday Morning, Tanga, Reunion, and Body & Soul are the highlights of this CD...although all the tunes are great.I'm absolutely in love with Friday Morning...This is a great Latin jazz CD...a good representation of the genre.

Critical, but not demonizing the Christian Right, the book shows that there were a number of waves in which the Christian Right has made a comeback in American politics. Written by a team of solid academics, this is recommended reading for the introductory reader. It is short, and covers a lot of ground in good detail. One shortcoming of the book is its organization, which led to some repetition and redundancy in the book. Not detracting from the overall work, the book serves well as an introduction to the undergraduate reader. What do Wilcox and Larson think? They believe the Christian Right's influence is significant, but also limited. A take-over of American politics or policy does not seem imminent in their view. The legacy of the Christian Right has potential uses, and dangers, but does not in the author's minds pose a grave threat to democracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine, rational discussion for college-level spirituality or political classes alike","review":"ONWARD CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS?

For our most recent trip (round-trip, one connection each way), we used this Car Seat Travel Bag and found it to be a nice way to check in the car seat along with our other luggage. After a couple of practice runs, getting our big seat into and out of the bag was easy. The side zip pocket was perfect for stashing some car window shades and the strap (for check in). So far, in our limited use, the bag seems quite sturdy and the strap makes the heavy car seat \\"sling-able\\" for short walks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the multi-tasker we'd hoped for","review":"We bought this bag so we could check our son's carseat with our other luggage when flying.

The lyrics, voice, orchestration, and production all fall into place to create one tremendoucs work.The opening track 14 KARAT GOLD grips you instantly with it's tasty bass and soft studio accents. The next track holds you with the perfect balance of studio engineered sound and a clear acoustic guitar.I could go on in detail for each track on this album, but I'll keep it short and sweet by saying this; this is Lightfoots best vocal output of all his albums. The voice is deep, strong, warm, and conveys the depth of how much he felt love, beauty, pain and loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album.","review":"Theres very few Lightfoot songs that I don't care for, hardly any in fact. I thought this was a good collection of his music and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This is a very good CD. Actually, I have the album. I had the chance to see Gordon Lightfoot in the early 1980's in Philadelphia. He put on an excellent show! This is a quality recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tyler Hicks is an Extraordinary Photographer as is the book","review":"Contrary to the first reviewer's misinformed and erroneous comment about \\"are the photographs faked,\\" Hicks is one of the world's finest, most authentic and reliable photojournalists. This magisterial book is a good entrance into the world of his extraordinary visual testimony about the world's events. It is not necessary for me to add more than what Ms. Hegland has already contributed villifing the outlandish accusations promulgated about Hick's work. We, unfortunately, live in a time of easy words and radiant mistruths spread with electrical velocity. If only the hard-won expression of what passes in this life were so easily and readily available to be swallowed and digested.I recommend this book and the entire scrupulously honest work of Mr. Hicks.It is magisterial and breath-stealing. Allow yourself this wind-swept moment: by swallowing Hick's photographs, you shall be transformed.cheers,"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Understanding US War Zones","review":"This book is a must for anyone interested in what is happening in our war zones.

Unfortunately, this was a total washout. The range seems to be about 15 feet (after that static overwhelms intelligibility), and limited to line-of-sight--even going slightly around a corner makes the message cut out.

If you want to store CD's this is the box to do it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY - TAPE DESTROYS THE PRODUCT","review":"The tape used by the manufacturer to hold the pieces together DESTROYS the outside of each box. The tape is standard, transparent packing tape and a LOT of it is wrapped around the snap-together parts. The whole, taped package of two boxes is also shrink-wrapped, so you must tear that off to detect the product-destroying tape.When un-taped, ALL the adhesive remains on the paper exterior of both boxes in the package. It took me 40 minutes, half a can of Goop-Off and half a roll of paper towels to make this product minimally serviceable.Buy something else, ANYTHING else, than this:Snap-N-Store SNS01617 CD Storage Box, 2 Pack (Black)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned It.","review":"I returned this item. I wasn't expecting fabulous. Just a basic box to hold my CD collection. The description was a little misleading. The jewel cases do not fit properly. You have to turn them sideways and the box lid does not sit on top as it should. They are also cheaply made. Mine came complete with dents and scratches. Don't waste your time with these storage boxes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"As mentioned in other ratings, you have to assemble the box yourself. The boxes are fixed with 2 snaps on each edge, which make the boxes a bit flexible when they are empty. Still, after filling the boxes with CDs, they are pretty solid. I haven't had to move my boxes around very much so I don't know how they would handle lots of relocation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for holding Office Software","review":"I work in IT and needed a better way to organize our software that comes with our computers we purchase.The Microsoft Office OEM CD sleeves we receive with computers fit perfect. I have only purchased 2 so far but will be buying more. They will hold a size just a bit bigger than a paper CD sleeve and just big enough to hold a plastic CD case when stacked on its end.Only reason I gave it 4 stars is the buttons hold good but not great. If you get into the boxes a lot they may pop loose a few times. Which could probably be easily fixed with just putting a little glue on the inside to make it a bit more sturdy.Other than that they look great and work perfect for what I need them for."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm saving space","review":"I was looking for a way to consolidate my massive cd collection and this is. If you want to shed the jewel cases this is the item for you. I put each cd in a paper sleeve with a window and then slide it into the cover art work from front of the jewel case. The art work on the back of the jewel case is pretty much worthless but it will also go in the box if you fold it or turn it on end. Anyway each box will hold around 150. Great item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not meet expectations","review":"I purchased 4 of these based on customer reviews. I use them to store music CDs in jewel cases. I store them on a shelf inside an entertainment unit with doors. The units look nice, but do not stay snapped when being pulled off the shelf. I would only recommend these if they are going to be stationary and not pulled out and put away often."},{"rating":"1","title":"box sizing is off","review":"I thought the quality of the product (materials, snaps) was fine. The problem is more of a design flaw. The lid sits just on top of the CDs once you put them in, so it's not really secure. It would've been a perfect box if it was taller than the height of a CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snaps are crap","review":"I didn't expect much for the price, but the snaps should at least line up and stay snapped. They don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied Customer","review":"I purchased these storage boxes to hold my data discs, They are ideal for the purpose of holding data CD's And DVD's in envelopes,although if you wish to store your cds in cases in them, it might be a little awkward until you fill them fully as the cases sit a little above the box top, so unless full the lid sits unevenly, but as i say, for my purpose they were ideal, very happy with them, good solution, and resonably priced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok!","review":"It really wasn't what I thought it would be.

It's a very good reference (encyclopedic) book.My main problem with it is that Leslie M. Harris, the author, relies heavily (if not entirely) on secondary sources. The book, then, is nothing more than a patchwork of various other more scholarly works. Hence, finding the actual primary source (i.e. court decision, council minutes, etc) proves extremely difficult.I do not recommend this book for advanced students.

They are a great value for the price, specially compared to the clear ones,Avery Easy Peel Mailing Labels for Ink Jet Printers, 1 x 2.625 Inches, Clear, Pack of 300 (18660). The printing is nice and crisp, and they are easy to pop out and stick to your mail.But be aware: if you buy them thinking you can use the free templates mentioned on the cover, forget about it. The download is free, indeed; but they are for use with Microsoft Word, and if you want your labels to have graphics, it's simply a nightmare to design and align them. I designed my labels with Adobe Photoshop and imported them to CorelDraw for a more easy printing adjustment.

It was so easy, that I started labeling everything from which tools should be in what drawer of the toolbox to what items are missing from the shelves at work for re-order. This is great.

I like his vision of the celebrated Sherlock Holmes. He showed movies can be fun without the weighing down of conventions or stereotypes. Many people who watch movies disect them to death during and after watching them. Reminds me of my first Literature class in College.

This is what Sherlock Holmes was supposed to be if ever adapted into a feature film. Robert Downey Jr. either really did a critical read of the stories or he had somebody explain them to him very carefully and patiently because his acting is very similar to what you read on paper. He even had many of the mannerisms and meter down pact. This was a solid vision that Guy Richie had and he executed it well. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was all the CGI which looked awesome but maybe the movie didn't need so much. Just my opinion. However those that were expecting a watered down Holmes should really read the stories and do some critical analysis and you will be surprised how wrong you are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Can't say I loved this movie the first time I watched it but by time you see the end you realize just how brilliant it is.

The cinematography was fairly well done, the score and music forgettable. Robert Downey Jr. was fine as Holmes. I'm a Holmes fan, but not a huge, obssessed one, so I thought he was fine. But Rachel McAdams just CANNOT act. I'm sorry, but she acts the same in everything! I was expecting for this movie to be a fun, well done adventure.

Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law make a good team and I appreciated the fresh approach to Sherlock Holmes. However, when I bought and played the DVD on my 73 in screen I was disappointed in the video quality. The transfer suffers from obnoxious pixelation and macroblocking, making the movie un-watchable. I have recently noticed this same effect on other movies: Inception and Legend of the Guardians. I have over 1600 DVDs and all play clear and sharp except for these 3 recently released movies.

Also, the plot was kind of difficult to follow sometimes (maybe too many scenes were cut off?).In this movie, the detective was more like a modern action hero placed in the 19th century world. Jude Law was Watson in love and distracted of his role as Watson.If the producers had named this movie to detective action hero and not Sherlock then it would have been more believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"sherlock holmes","review":"did not like this movie , nothing like the originial movies , or anything like the books.Very dark .

This was the last movie I expected to see an \\"action\\" format to, but it surprisingly did! A cool story line, interesting characters.

And he is truly exceptional in Sherlock Holmes. What a talented actor to shift gears and adopt the persona of the famed sleuth. He also makes it his own, bringing unique characteristics. I loved the martial arts aspect to the movie as well. Jude Law was not my favorite Dr. Holmes. I think the writers took a little too much liberty with this character. I envioned a frumpy old guy carrying a doctor's bag, living vicariously through Sherlock Holmes' many adventures. Shortcoming aside, this was a still very enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Dolby 5.1 in English","review":"Enjoyable movie, but my comments pertain to the Blu-ray disc. For some reason the studio decided to release this with English surround sound encoded in DTS only. French (and Spanish?) are encoded as Dolby 5.1, but not English. Those of us who prefer the Queen's tongue but are otherwise without DTS systems are plain out of luck. Sans DTS, we are left with Dolby Pro Logic, which is just not comparable, and on my otherwise well balanced system, sounds way too bass heavy for some reason.A real drag, though the film looks fine otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll Take Basil","review":"This movie was bad. I loved the Basil Rathbone Holmes movies but this was not the same Sherlock. It was hard to understand their fake accents,,,after all it is an American movie. A very mild phoney accent would be fine. The plot was so thick that it started to take an effort so I didn't even finish it. I don't think every movie should be a 'no brainer' but there was too much of nonsense.

This film, while entertaining, doesn't capture the feel or intrigue of a \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" story; perhaps if it were released 15 years ago, before all the \\"twists\\" and \\"shocking reveals\\" were commonplace on basic cable. I believe this film, and its sequel, could have done just as well (maybe better) if they weren't trying to jump on the Holmes \\"mythos.\\"If you're a fan of the intrigue and mystery that's the basis of a good Sherlock story, of the \\"I didn't see that coming\\" and the \\"How did they pull that off?\\" then I STRONGLY RECOMMEND you avoid this film and instead turn your attention to the \\"Sherlock\\" series produced by the BBC; you know, the company that's based in the traditional home of Sherlock Holmes.Sherlock: Season One"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sherlock updated","review":"Place your logical brain on pause and just enjoy the action and witty dialog between the two leads.

This is the 19th century for the 21st century done right. The writing, acting, and special effects are wrapped up in a package that's beautiful to look at. If they were on a ship they would be swashbuckling pirates, as it is this is a grand who-dunnit adventure. Leave the history books at the door."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great take on a classic.","review":"I am a loyal Sherlock Holmes fan and loved the old Basil Rathbone, Nigel Bruce movies. However, Dr. Watson was portrayed as loyal but a bit of a bumbler. The orginal stories of Doyle portrayed him quite differently. Not on Holmes intellectual level but not a bumbler. I think that this current version portrays the good doctor as Doyle meant him to be. The action is fast, with plot twists galore. Good fun and very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love the books skip this movie.","review":"It's another book to film adaption that will break your heart if you love the source material.Robert Downey Jr. played himself. Which is great usually, but Holmes is too iconic a figure for that to work this time. His love interest seems to exist primarily to dispel any jokes or even ideas that Watson and Holmes are gay, which certainly they would seem without her presence. Holmes is also not the dry, tortured and grave protagonist of the books, he's more like a spoiled child who knows he can get away with anything. Further, the plot is silly. At the core of every Holmes adventure should be empirical science (that's what makes him so brilliant), and this leans too heavily on the magical side.Somebody please ask Hollywood to stop financing Guy Ritchie already."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last a Holmes who is not supercilious and a Watson who does not seem like a befuddled walrus!","review":"I very much liked this movie.It is one of the only times I didn't get think Holmes was snotty and and Watson simple.The chemistry between the actors was great.I hope a sequel is in the works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie","review":"This movie was very innovative.

But like so many movie versions of pre-existing characters and stories, this one is too dark and violent. Add to that, the humor, and you have something that feels sick. I don't mind movies that re-invent or re-interpret characters and stories -- if they are done well and have integrity. The first Batman movies were terrific, but the later ones became too gruesome and perverse. This movie feels like a destruction of the original Sherlock Holmes. I feel sorry for the young people whose first (and maybe only) encounter with the great Sherlock Holmes will be this franchise. BTW, My husband hated this movie more than I did and he's not even that familiar with the original books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"Don't throw your money away on this one.

I wanted to take in the absolutely beautiful set decoration, attention to detail, city scapes but nope Guy won't let me and what is with that dumb crow lurching around, talk about suspense! was thinking subtitles but that would not work with the frame speed so am very dissapointed... thought the reveals were the most interesting aspect as Moriarity slipped so ever slowly (hey thanks to paperweights!) to his leap into a sequel..

The films starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce didn't require special effects and blaring noise to hold their audience's interest.Having read every book and seen every movie involving Holmes, I don't recall much in the way of gunplay or any other form of violence. The essence of Holmes was his brain....not his brawn, but you would never know if from this trash.This piece of garbage may appeal to people who know nothing of the original stories and therefore might enjoy the overblown antics in which Holmes and Watson are involved. Frankly, this is one of the few movies I've ever paid admission to and walked out on. I do not own the DVD and would not accept it if it were given to me for free.Obviously, a large profit was made on this film as there is a sequel to be released shortly.

The only success it had was in stupidity! Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Now a sequel? God no!!","review":"For me to say I hate any movie starring Downey bothers me as I am a huge fan of his. I was anxious to see this film with its great trailer and he easily pulls off any diverse character. But this film has a couple of problems: Unfortunately Downey completely mumbles through his English accent, making it impossible to decifer what he's saying much of the time (& i have many English friends I easily comprehend). Secondly the director did a horrible job of keeping the plot from running smoothly; the story is so disjointed it wasn't 100% easy to follow. Sitting through two hours of this mess was too long for me but I do not blame Downey for this poorly executed picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Sherlock Holmes I had in mind.","review":"Robert Downey Jr has made quite the name for himself over the years. However, I find myself disliking his performance in Sherlock Holmes. He was not as eccentric as I hoped he would be. I went into this film with overly high expectations and came out feeling extremely disappointed. I even saw this film twice just to make sure I wasn't having a bad day when I saw it the first time. Maybe its Guy Ritchie's vision, but this was not at all what I was expecting Sherlock Holmes to be. I found the casting of this film to be a bit peculiar. I didn't feel that Downey and Jude Law really had any chemistry and Rachel McAdams felt more like an annoying little sister rather then a former love of Holmes. The story line is hardly anything to rave about it and I felt bored throughout the entire movie. It's extremely predictable and the twist is nothing that surprising. Of course, I am extremely picky with movies and hardly seem to like anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total nonsense","review":"This is not the Sherlock Holmes I loved to watch.

There are many people out here who find things centered on the Occult offensive.Now, if things that center on Satan worship and the occult don't bother you then I am sure you will find this movie very entertaining.

And there was a decent attempt to justify Holmes' fighting abilities. The action plot is really just there to give the characters something to do while exploring the real plot which is about relationships; the disruption to the Holmes/Watson relationship most obviously, but also between the two men and their respective paramours, and between Holmes and members of the police force. That's where the real joy of the film arises and why I am eager for the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say what?","review":"Robert Downey looks great (nice shirts, Sherlock), but he swallows most of his hastily delivered lines and is often incomprehensible. My wife and I would turn to each other laughing after he'd spoken and then exchange gibberish in imitation of the vocally impaired detective. (I suspect that Downey, insecure about his British accent, decided to enfog most of what he was forced by the script to say.)Lord Blackstone emerges as the hero if only because he's about the only significant (male) character whose lines can be comprehended. Bring him back! In fact, give him his own franchise (and it's hard to believe this Sherlock will become one)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action and comedy like movie","review":"I read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's books and enjoyed them and I watched this movie and enjoyed it no less then book.

I have classical book, movies and I swear I would not buy one more same old classical movie which in the modern world would look boring.I enjoyed this movie, watched it several times with my family and gonna buy it on blu ray now.PS Sherlock Holmes is collective character and does not have to look only on the way as Conan Doyle described him.

There was no mystery or plot - just a bad script and embarrassingly Americanized characters. Downey came off as a half-deranged ne'er-do-well, and McAdams' character was unlikeable and superfluous.

Did the director of this movieknow ANYTHING about Doyle's description of Holmes?Obviously not. I understand that he felt the need to transformHolmesto the 21 century,but was it necessary to change Holmesinto a totally unrecognizable character.I read the reviewsof this movie but still rented it only because of Downey.He is a superb actor who I think would have done one heckof an acting job if he had the chance to play Holmes the wayDoyle intended.As it was,even Downey couldn't save the horrendousdialogue in this movie.But,to me the worst part of this movie was the overall blacknessthat was supposed to take us back to a different era.I didn't buy an hdtv to sit and watch 2 hours of different shadesof black because the director was so-o-o inept that he couldn'tcome up with any other way to give the viewer a feeling ofa period piece.Don't waste your money on this one.Get the Jeremy Brett version of Holmes.Yes he plays it over the top,but its fun to watch him doing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, horrible DVD","review":"I went to go see this movie in theaters back in December and I loved it. As soon as I was done I bought the books, read them and went back to watch it a second time. The characters are great, Jude Law makes a perfect Watson, and while RDJ takes a while to get used to he certainly plays and interesting version of Holmes. It is definitely something I would recommend watching.However, while I loved the movie, the DVD is a huge disappointment :/ It feels like they put no time and effort into it at all. No special features (I was really hoping for deleted scenes and/or bloopers) except for one 'how its made' segment. The start menu is also really unimpressive. It seems that they put all the extra stuff (including a different cover) on the blu-ray and left the DVD with nothing.Anyway, I wouldn't bother getting it, instead get a friend to buy the Blu Ray-DVD combo pack and steal their DVD version :P"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been good if done seriously","review":"With fine casting, great costumes and a big budget; this COULD have been a great Sherlock Holmes movie.But it fails to deliver.Why ??It did not take the character of Sherlock Holmes seriously ......... instead this movie went for a silly, almost spoof like feel.Remember how they ruined the Wild Wild West movie ?This Sherlock Holmes film adaption looked and felt like the very bad Will Smith version of Wild Wild West."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sherlock Holmes Poser","review":"This movie has nothing to do with Conan Doyle's character of Sherlock Holmes.

The story is about a person who seems to have supernatural powers and tries to bandy together a group of loyalists from the parliament to control the country. My daughter watched the movie and shouted, mid-way, \\"Dad, this is black magic!\\". The 'black magic' is extremely convincing. And when Sherlock Holmes explains all the supernatural phenomena, my daughter was completely flabbergasted. She did say, \\"Dad, there is no black magic - everything has to have a reason\\". IF any movie can send that message to children, I think it has more than achieved its objective. On the side, I watched the movie before she did and I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. I highly recommend it for family viewing (it is PG-13 rated)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Breed of Holmes","review":"If you're a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional detective you'll only find traces of him here. This Holmes is a new creation loosely based on the famous detective, not carefully patterned on him. On the other hand this movie's Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are a reasonably exciting duo with their own set of more contemporary characteristics. Holmes exhibits his famous ability to make important deductions from small clues which causes him to get doused with wine in one scene.There is enough action including fighting, mystery, intrigue, explosions, and general mayhem to satisfy most fans of the genre so the movie fulfills its obligations in that regard. The villain is suitably dangerous and clever and we even have overtones of Holmes' arch enemy, Professor Moriarty, the consummate villain in the Holmes saga.In summary it is watchable and should succeed in holding the aficionado of action movies attention all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining","review":"Saw this for the first time.

It was nice to see lines or snippets from Doyle's stories make their way into the movie. The chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law is wonderfully subtle; the scene with the pair awaiting bail was snicker worthy but also showed the pair's brotherly affection. Don't expect this movie to hold hard and fast to Doyle's stories but know that this movie does pay homage to Doyle's famous sleuth by dropping actual lines from the tales which the characters either speak or situations they comment on.

I'm not a fan of the movie-theater experience, so I patiently wait for good movies to come out via other formats. After watching this movie, I wondered how quickly must I acquire this DVD? The acting mastery of Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law is undeniable and they only enhance each other's performance.

Isn't he supposed to be a detective?!I simply couldn't grasp the plethora of action scenes in what is supposed to be a detective film.

This is typical Guy Ritchie nonsense.I expected an intricate, tense and mysterious detective film with plot changes that would make your head spin - after all that is what Sherlock Holmes is all about - but all I got was Rambo with a bit of detective skills.

If you were expecting a well crafted film, a la Chaplin, with action sequences, you will be disappointed. I know 1 star seem harsh for a harmless action movie and I did see the previews. The problem is I was able to rent this for free, didn't have high expectations and still couldn't sit through it. This means, at least to me, that it was a truly bad movie and that Guy Ritchie is a one trick pony.

While the explanation of the physics is correct, the writer doesn't allow for variances due to execution. For example, very minor impurities in the materials that make up the body of the signal distribution unit can cause enough back flash to degrade/contaminate the signal even at the speed of light before it arrives at its destination. The wavelength of light and the frequency of this noise are not related. Granted, in most consumer quality FO cables, this is a very minor component of the delivered signal; does that justify spending $40-60 more for a HQ cable?

But Flight (and the rest of Mothers & Daughters) quickly begins to suffer from the scattershot feel and pretentious, self-important meanderings of the earlier Church & State II, which I consider the worst book of the first 6. Sim has no focus here, and jumps around, shifting from wacky comedy to heavy-handed drama to boring historical ramblings indiscriminately. In Flight, I no longer felt immersed in a particular, cogent world of Sim's creation -- I felt like I was just watching him sort of ... make stuff up ... ramble off on bizarre historical details that I felt no connection to as a reader ... and so forth.

Those markers stain on this surface as well which is odd b/c the same washable markers wipe clean from our wooden floors and walls. This \\"white board\\" is extremely porous!! We have yet to try the chalk side, but we have no high hopes for that either. This product was a gift--thank goodness we didn't waste any money on it.

Pilot holes were drilled so imprecisely that the pieces we did get together were crooked. Critical pieces of support wood were warped so they could not be used. The wood is so cheap that the screws stripped right through as they were being put in. This product will be returned after 2 adults spent 1.5 hours trying to put it together without success.I am appalled at the poor quality of this product and am horrified that the gift giver spent over $50 on it. Please, save yourself the headache of returning it and just don't buy it in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Satisfactory","review":"I ordered this product when it was on sale for $50 thinking I was getting a deal from the regular price of over $100, but I was very disappointed when the easel arrive. The legs were scratched all over including one leg being cracked. In addition to that, the product is very cheaply made. The writing inserts were flimsy and the holder for markers was dirty and chipped. Certainly not worth the $50 I paid and certainly not worth the $100+ regular price.

The easy-peel feature is simply a strip-away of remaining pieces on the paper. It then offers you \\" Pop-up Edge for fast peeling\\". I don't think it is worth the extra charge at all. Go get the basic one. You will be very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I want to see in labeling","review":"These meet my basic requirements extremely well:- They come off the printer cleanly, without jamming.- They don't smudge.- Peeling them off the backing is simple and clean.- And they adhere nicely to the envelope.They work great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super fast for big label jobs","review":"I do catalog mailings about once a month at work, we're a small company so I do the job from start to finish, stuffing and sealing envelopes, printing labels, attaching labels and running postage.The two things that take the longest in this process are stuffing the envelopes and peeling the labels to stick on the envelopes. This product doesn't solve both of these, but it sure takes care of one of them! These labels worked flawlessly in our printer, then just bend the backing and the edges of each label are there and ready to be peeled.Cut my labeling time nearly in half!I was a bit concerned that \\"easy peel\\" would mean \\"not sticky\\", but the labels adhered nicely to the envelopes, with no corner lifting at all.Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent labels.","review":"I have been using Avery 5260 address labels for years. They are perfect for addressing envelopes, labeling files, and even captioning photos in albums. Avery labels are easy to use, rarely smudge, and peel off easily. The package contains 25 sheets, 30 labels per sheet for a total of 750 labels. Avery address labels are handy for home, school, or office use and work well with most printers. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One small complaint","review":"Overall these are very good labels and my complaint doesn't really count since they directions say not to run the sheet of labels through the printer more then once, but I do. With the easy peel labels the sheet tends to get stuck a little more in the printer then before, but it's not a ton. And I reuse sheets because really, I'm not wasting a whole sheet for 2 or 3 addresses! Besides that I've never had a problem with these labels smudging or not sticking, I've always been pleased with Avery labels."},{"rating":"2","title":"The standard bearer of laser labels","review":"Avery is a brand that has been doing laser labels for as long as I can remember and they put out a very nice product. This particular size, the 5260 is the perfect size for address labels for envelopes. Three columns, ten long means you get 30 labels to a sheet.Easy peel off, easy printing with no jams. The perfect label.The nice thing about Avery is that it works seamlessly with Microsoft Office. In word they have templates for all the Avery laser labels and you just have to select which one you are using and the blank template just pops up. Sometimes with generic brands, this is not the case and you have to manually set your parameters which while doable for a regular MS Word user could prove to be quite an obstacle for the casual user.I highly recommend these labels to anyone. They will not give you trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stickers","review":"I use these stickers to put my name and address on some paperwork products I supply to clients (permit paperwork).

In all of the books I have read from her so far the female main character is always some damsel in distress that needs help an the man comes in like Superman and saves her at the end of the story. While I typically wont mind this especially if this is her preferred niche, I would like to see a change in plot at least once in a while.

All through the book I kept wondering \\"What is wrong with this girl\\". Of course you don't find out until the end what she has gone through (going through) and why she pushes men away. I thought it quite unbelievable that a man would knowingly kiss his twin brother's girl especially since she has told him she wants to end the relationship (with his brother)???This story was ok but not as good as the other's report."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a MESS!!","review":"This book was unfocused and unbelievable. The characters and story line was all over the place. I found myself wondering several times, \\"What are these people thinking? And this just seems too out there to be believable\\".

By the way, here is another use I found for them. My wife is filling in as teacher for a class of 4-year olds. There are more kids than swings at recess, and this was causing fights and discontent. Now the kids get \\"swing tickets\\" printed on Avery labels (kids LOVE stickers) and based on their good behavior. So far, she says it's worked wonders."},{"rating":"2","title":"I used these as name tags in my classroom and they are great","review":"I used these as name tags in my classroom on folders. I also used them on boxes that I packed away for future use. I mailed a present to my sister in another state with some of them. They have worked great for all three purposes. They stick well and don't peel up around the edges. The markers (sharpie type) don't bleed on them. They are very effective for many purposes besides just shipping. And they do a great job for their main purpose as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect little labels.","review":"I used these for two reasons - to print addresses for shipping padded envelopes and to help label and organize my bathroom closet.They were perfect for both.The address labels were printed on an inkjet printer which I thought would smear but they came out fine. I used the standard paper setting and didn't have to fiddle with the gloss or stock weight settings at all. The colors looked nice on there, too. They were affixed to those brown padded envelopes and they stuck on really well. They are sticky and re-positionable but ONLY if you pull it off very quickly. Great size - fit full addresses with room to spare.Then, I used a Sharpie to write names on the stickers to match up with the little organization bins I have in my bathroom closet and that worked great, too. The sharpie marker looks fantastic on the matte surface.I will use these again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Use it for more than just a shipping label","review":"I have been using the Avery Shipping Lables for years for my buisness. They work out beautifully! Easy to format on word and other programs. I use these as shipping lables but they are great for other things too! I have used them to put labels on a small bag of popcorn. I have used them to place on the kids gift bags for birthday parties!

You will want to savor this wonderfully written book. I am eagarly awaiting Paul Shepherd's next work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Running from some good writing","review":"The overall style of this book is very unique, because while the majority of it is written from an adult's point of view of events that happened to him as a child, there is virtually no retrospective of these events.

Anthony Quinn plays a Russian Cardinal that was imprisoned in the gulags of Siberia by the Soviets during their crackdowns on religious institutions. He is released and returns to Rome, is elected as Pope after the previous Pope dies. Good plot and has a very imaginative ending.

The Nun's Story is a fairly accurate and touching tale of one woman's quest to follow her heart just as the world falls into war. This is a great example of the Catholic Church in the early 20th century. With Shoes of the Fisherman, you have a great story of a Pope from the Slavic World, more than a decade before Pope John Paul II. The turmoil of an ancient church trying to deal with a modern world is very well told and is still quite relevant."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST OF THE BEST","review":"In this first volume of the history of civilization, Dr. Durant starts at our beginning. Most of us in the West have little idea of the impact the East had upon or civilization. This work changes that and through his wonderful prose, the author gives us a clear insight. The work is meticulously researched and presented in a fashion that is quite understandable. Please do not be put off by the sheer poundage of the book. At first glance, as one review pointed out, it can be quite daunting. I was quite amazed how fast the work went once I started to actually read the thing, rather than stare at it on the shelf. Will Durants multi-volume work should be required reading in all of our schools. Perhaps if it were, we, as a society, would have a greater understanding where we have been, ergo, have a greater understanding of where we are going. Overall, I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great History","review":"I received this book as a gift for my graduation, and ever since then, it has become a staple in my library.

Some may wonder at the subject matter; some may be disgusted. By the time you're done reading them, however, I'm sure you'll no longer feel that way.Speaking of fireflies, book lice, and honeybees, Fleischman shows the unique perspective of each. At times his poems are hilarious, with the worker ant complaining in time to the languid satisfaction of the queen; some are poignant enough to touch your heart and make you think twice about that caterpillar you shuddered at the other day.What makes these poems truly wonderful, however, is the fact that they are \\"for two voices\\". For full effect, they *must* be read aloud by two people, sometimes in chorus, sometimes speaking alone, and other times echoing each other. In such a manner, the already-delightful poetry becomes alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"An original idea","review":"These poems about the lives of different insects are meant to be read by two voices, thereby mimicking the sounds or characteristics of those bugs. The book works rather well, especially the whirligig beetle poem. Appearing in bookstores nation wide in 1992, I remember being given this book at the age of 10 from my mother. At that particular age I was not interested in participating in a picture book, clearly designed for younger students. Had I received it at a younger age I think I would have liked it more. I would recommend presenting this book to a group of students, having them perform it together. That would be the best use of this singular text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Create life-long memories with your children or grandchildren","review":"Mesmorizing & magical.

You can also read it with a friend. My favorite part about the book was the poem called Water Boatman. It's m favorite because it was very funny. I also liked the one called Honeybees because you got to use two different personalities. The queen bee had a wonderful life and the worker bee has a hard life and hates being a bee. I would recommend this book to my teachers as a learning book about poetry and insects."},{"rating":"2","title":"An experience the whole family can enjoy!","review":"Our 3 sons were too young to read yet, so my husband and I read it to them.

No hiding the lyrics behind a wall of overly-produced instrumentation on this album. Shawn uses very few \\"near\\" rhymes and a healthy dose of internal rhymes, often even writing in an AABBA pattern - a form which can be awfully difficult to construct without sounding forced. And what a storyteller! My favorite track? The Tanning Bed Song. Listen to the way he plays with that \\"weather\\" image throughout the story. Do you find yourself caring about Maria? The kids?

This is torture!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One or two decent songs, the rest is filler","review":"The famous \\"Lullabye\\" song that received a good deal of radio play is good, but none of the other songs on the CD have the same tempo or character. They're sleepy and dull.For me, it sounded like a person trying too hard to be a poet and not making it. I usually don't write reviews, but I thought it necessary to balance out all the rave positive reviews I've read about this albumn (which is partly why I bought it).[I originally wrote this in 1999, but it didn't get posted right away because I forgot to display my e-mail address.]"},{"rating":"1","title":"this cd is bad","review":"This is one of the worst cds I have ever had the misfortune of buying.

You can purchase a used copy of this cd on amazon for 1 cent, that should tell you something about its quaility."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Bad As It Gets","review":"My god, do people really listen to this? that song Rockabye or Lullaby is the worst song I have ever had the misfortune to hear. Thus far I've been able to avoid hearing the track in its entirety, but not so lucky tonight. I mean, is the guy rapping? talking? why is he talking for the whole track? why does he sound like he's wasted? The dude sounds like he's doing a parody of himself. seriously! The track is so awful that it made me dizzy! Till now, Bye Bye American Pie was the absolute bottom of the heap, no questions asked, unequivical, without doubt most awful piece of music that i have ever experienced. Lullabye is ten times worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love his songs","review":"I love Shawn's songs. They are so down to earth and realistsic. If you want some real music, check out some of his stuff. My favourite song on here has to be Shimmer. I heard it once and fell in love with it. But overall, this album has everything. All different types of songs and all of them are wroth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shimmer is great but not much else to offer","review":"I got this CD because I loved Shimmer and I thought that maybe there would be other great songs just like it on the CD. I never thought it could be this bad! Nearly every other song ,except Lullaby, sounds exactly the same. I don't understand why all these other reviews are saying he's so great. He may put feeling into his lyrics, but the songs are so slow and boring that you don't listen to the lyrics because you're only asking yourself, \\"Why did I buy this?\\" If you think Shimmer is great just go buy the single and don't waste your time and money on the rest of the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwhelming lack of creativity","review":"I can't believe this is the state that music has become today. This MTV saturated pop music is enough to make a person who truly likes music, and sees it as an art (not some lack of talent junk like this), throw up. This album is full of awful song structures, EMBARASSINGLY STUPID poetry, and simply bad music. Those of you who think this is music, or anything else on MTV or Top-40 radio, needs to think again, and notice that this is absolute disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sing!","review":"Shawn's music is okay, but it seems that he is too afraid to really sing. In the few instances where he does sing (instead of murmuring), his voice sounds fine. The chorus of Lullaby is good, but the rest sounds like talking to me. Actually, most of the tracks sound like talking. Shawn needs to gather up the courage and really start singing. I'm glad I borrowed this album, and not purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's lacking guts","review":"This CD isn't what I'd call horrible, but Shawn really needs to learn how to get some guts and sing. He talks in way too many of the tracks, and let's be honest here, who CAN'T pick up a guitar and just talk while they strum? What a silly album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly great music--sung and written from the heart","review":"I first bought this CD for \\"Lullaby\\", and was amazed to discover that, for the ONLY time, I liked ALL the songs on the album. I can really relate to Shawn. And I respect him for doing what he wanted to do, following his dream, and never compromising. It's wonderful to see someone succeed at that.I just had the rare privilege of attending a concert of Shawn's and I was knocked out. Halfway through, the aisles were packed with people and everyone was dancing. Only once in a while do you find an artist whose work makes you feel that you could have written that song if you'd had the talent, and Shawn is one. This is an artist whose career I will definitely be following."},{"rating":"2","title":"So what's wrong with sincerity?","review":"Shawn Mullin's video for \\"Lullaby\\" does him a disservice because there's a lot more earnestness and sincerity in this singer's work than his in-your-face TV persona suggests. I happen to think cynicism is overrated, and I was happy to hear an honest voice, unencumbered by overproduction and overarranging. His gifts as a vocalist and musician, however, outweigh his talent as a poet. There's a little too much about drinking, cigarettes, the lonely life on the road, and the alienation of celebrity. I hope he can broaden his the subject matter of his songs on his next album. Still, none of the tracks ring false or sound trite, and I suspect his soothing growl could make any song sound good."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's About Time....","review":"As an Atlanta resident I've had the privilege of listening to Shawn for years - I'm glad that the rest of the country has finally gotten a chance to hear him. This is a great cd - vintage Shawn. If you've only heard Lullabye you're in for a treat with the rest of the album. And promise me you'll see him live when you get the chance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lullaby, that's how this song feels, like a lullaby","review":"I love the song Lullaby. Before I had the CD I waited a long time for it to come on the radio not just because it is my boyfriend and I's song but also because it is just such a great song and it actually makes sense unlike other songs people sing these days :o) Shawn's music comes from real life and personally, that is the best music out there is when they really know what they are singing about. Anyways, if you haven't gotten this CD yet, please buy it sometime. You'll love the rest of the songs because nobody has such a catchy voice as he does!

The practical and useful information, some of it helpful and some marginal, is buried within pages of this type of meandering. The author's seem determined that all practical information be presented within flowery, cutesy stories. I took notes as I read the book and discovered no new earth shattering information. Good reading teachers who read this book will find that they are already doing much of what is being prescribed by the authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"I read this during my master's program.

Each of her chapters presents a different comprehension strategy. She opens the chapter with a text that was difficult for her--and it will be difficult for YOU! Then she models how the strategy may be taught and understood.It was uncanny the connections that the book causes the reader to make as a reading teacher. In one chapter she began with a poem by Codescu on the streets of Chicago. A long -planned trip to Chicago coincided with my reading of this chapter. The poem was difficult to interpret, and I found myself going back to it over and over, and discussing it with my travelling companions. Isn't this what we want our students to do? This book will be my bible for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brief but Interesting","review":"For persons who are fans of the Back to the Future movies this is a good video.

I try to get Extra Wide (EE) when I can, but they can be difficult to find in walking shoes. These shoes have been perfect for me because the have a roomy toebox. They are comfortable, able to accomodate inserts and are nice looking, too. The leather uppers clean nicely and I find them last a long time.

My heels hurt like hell, and the pain persists for hours after I've removed the shoes. This issue only occurred after I began wearing these new Easy Spirit shoes (it's been less than two months). I have not had any food/spinal injury.In addition, the outsole material is very cheap and the outsole began chipping within one week of use.As I read the product description, I find that the shock absorbent material type is not mentioned. Is it simply EVA or something else cheaper? Who knows?"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE! Stiff, Clunky Hot and Heavy","review":"These shoes are terrible and i totally hate them. I had originally ordered a pair of Easy Spirit Gofast which i loved but had to return because of sizing. As the Jumper was the only shoe available in a half size at the time i went with them even though i wasn't thrilled with the style.The style though bad, is not why i dislike these so much. These are marketed as a walking shoe. I tested the walkability at the flower show and halfway through the show my feet were hurting. I don't know why they call these walking shoes. I felt like Frankenstein's monster in these shoes.They are so big and clunky and heavy and stiff. No ventilation, no flexibility they aren't good for walking let alone working out. And your feet will be so hot.I've had these for a while a now but shortly into wearing them the man made material started peeling off.

If you're a fan of jam bands, including Grateful Dead, and you've never listened to moe. you have something new to explore. With songs like 'Nebraska', 'Plane Crash', and a goofy love song like 'Queen of the Rodeo' you're sure to enjoy this disc. I for one found it to be a good cd to listen to while programming :) Anyways, take it from me, this is a good cd if you like any of the aforementioned bands, or are open minded enough to listen to some good rock music. 5 stars, and I'll be looking for another moe. cd pretty soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"PHAB PHOUR BE WARNED!!!!","review":"moe. is an awesome jam band and this new CD only hints at what great songs like \\"Spaz Medicine\\" and \\"Nebraska\\" sound like when jammed good and hard for fifteen minutes.

Nebraska, Stranger than Fiction, and Plane Crash are three songs that might be heard on rock radio stations (hopefully) in the near future.

Some are turned off by Jam Bands (i.e. The Grateful Dead, Phish, etc.) due to the fact they seem to overindulge, and I'm hard pressed to disagree. However, Moe. defies that image, making the solos and instrumental tracks just long enough to be appreciated, but not too long that they become boring.All of that aside, I found \\"Tin cans...\\" to be Moe.'s strongest effort, a unique blend of rock, country, bluegrass, the list goes on and on.

I love Lon Chaney movies, but I was surprised at how dark this one was. But, as usual, Lon Chaney is a great character actor, slinking around like the lowlife Ricardo is, but every now and then making us wonder whether there is going to be that \\"human\\" side to him that we see in so many other Lon Chaney movies. (Sorry, doesn't happen)For all of you out there who happen to be Lon Chaney AND opera fanatics (I know there are just tons, don't everyone jump up at once), listen for the Das Rheingold rip that the composer of this version uses in several scenes (and it almost becomes a small lietmotif for Ricardo).Wicked Darling: I'm sure glad this one got found!

I am a very clean person and the notion of walking around with a dirty-looking watch is icky. I tried to clean the band as soon as I noticed the greyish-greenish colors and low and behold, no product can remove any of it!!!

A lot of the recipes have fruit on the side and would be delicious without the fruit. I have enjoyed the Chocolate Bread toasted with cream cheese.

Once I was older I remembered it and mourned its loss. Unfortunately I couldn't really remember it that well and had no way of finding it again. Just recently, as I was preparing to start my first year of college, some of the wonderful stories came back to me, completely out of the blue. A quick google search led me to this site and now, all these years later, I'm listening it once more.

The wheels are way to small and smooth to provide any friction for the spider to gain traction and move. It wouldn't even crawl on my wood floor. A very anemic performance. Also, it has light-up eyes that immediately indicate it is just a toy. Even if you cover the eyes with something, it creates a loud sound as it tries to propel itself which makes it obvious its not a real spider.

I was extremely disappointed. In addition to misstatements of fact, his main objective seemed to be to blacken the name of every Yorkist who gained the throne, as well as that of Richard, duke of York. Further, he makes the rather unpleasant Henry VII Tudor virtually into a god. All in all, the book appears to display an unfortunate animus and is overly concerned with Richard III, a subject handled with much greater dexterity by Weir and others, whether or not you agree with their conclusions. This was not a book on the Wars of the Roses, but on the general familial and cultural milieu which formed the character of Richard III. It should have been so titled."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, fun informative history.","review":"The author consciously attempted to write a book in the style of Tuchman's \\"A Distant Mirror\\" and was 80% successful.

It worked great for light work, like drilling small holes in wood (not metal)and driving short screws (forget about lags). It was great for furniture projects where a delicate throttle and finesse was necessary. But if you plan on using this as your all-around, do-it-all drill, forget it. While driving some longer screws (3\\") on a job (my first 18v Milwaukee finally wore out) the clutch inside snapped some gears. I called Makita and they sent me a replacement clutch (in the meantime I rush ordered a new 18v Milwaukee to finish the job). After that I only used it for extremely light duty work. A few jobs later, the replacement clutch started slipping before giving out completely. I shouldn't have to keep putting parts into a tool to keep it running.

There were one or two songs that did not appear on it but i was easily able to overlook that because it had The Pressure Part 1 by:Sounds of Blackness, Girl U Want by Devo, How How by Yello and other cool and funky hits which went along nicely with the movie. The one song I know which was not on the soundtrack was Love Shack by the B52's.

Good adjustment possible on both seat and handle bars.Cons: *For the money, you'd expect software included. I paid over $1,500 and that rankled me that it is not included. *Outdated serial port interface on unit. Few new computers have these. I just recently purchased a Serial-USB converter cable.

This is a story of courage, stupidity, cowardice and of major and minor fire-fights and battles. The courage of those American advisers and the South Vietamese troops they assisted during this brutal offensive is awe inspiring. Not to forget their enemies who took massive punishment from US airpower but carried on the fight! This is a well researched and written piece of military history which I think has been forgotten due to the fact that it was at the tail end of a unpopular war. The author has done a great job to remind us that the war didn't finish when all the troops got home, that people continued to fight & die long after. Well worth the time to read with over 500 pages of text, however the author could have provided some better maps."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Courageous Book about the Loss of Faith","review":"Thomas Bunting suffers from self-pity, disorientation, and lethargy as he realizes he cannot worship the god of his parents, both Christians. Nor can he keep his wife's affections largely in part because his inner turmoil seeps too much into his married life. His wife would prefer him to be more upbeat, socially adroit, clean, and ambitious, but Thomas' religious struggle slowly and insidiously consumes him as he forges his own \\"gospel,\\" a Book Against God, which articulates his reasons for being an unbeliever.A good companion piece that covers someone losing his faith is Martin Gardner's The Flight of Peter Fromm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lit Crit Strikes Out","review":"I enjoy reading Wood's literary criticism, and consider him among the best tilling that particular field today. He is smart, an excellent writer, and usually on the mark. But he is not a novelist. He writes ably enough here, yet there is no life in this novel. It is dead, inert. I won't beat him up because the book is scattershot, aimless, and his narrator is a total jerk. Jerks can be cool. But this BAG guy was insufferable, not to mention boring.When Saul Bellow died, a eulogist said that what he most enjoyed about reading Bellow was the quality of the mind behind his writing. In every novel, and not all of them were good, the reader knew he was in the presence of a captivating mind. As a critic, Wood approaches brilliance. As a novelist, however, his mind is as interesting as a piece of toast. He should stick to what he does best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive effort.","review":"The portraiture of this novel began and remained disappointingly lifeless. Despite a minor revelation to the protagonist, it remained difficult to view him with any compassion; he never entertains, shocks, or angers the reader.

A few dynamics were well handled (between Thomas and his wife); but skillful handling can hardly rescue a book with very little to say. A man with spiritual crisis named Thomas??

Oh, and we need someone to update our Popper piece, pep it up a bit. I've heard he's a wee bit poorly.\\"Cut the crap, Jimbo.

I've heard the album, and have seen them live. They are good musicians, but they can't write a decent song if their life depended on it.

It has a few tints of rock here and there, but for the most part, it's just a Toby Keith album, with distorted guitars, and an occasional solo. Nothing more. They are a decent live band. They need to amps, the feedback was killing my ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, Sappy and Predictable","review":"I actively seek out books that teach good morals, but this one was way over the top sanctimonious. Our protagonist, Shelby, is whiny, weak and simplistic. (Oh, but she's a believer, so that makes it all okay.) Ditto for her love interest, Prince Nick. Dialog is flat, unnatural and preachy. And, really, everyone seems to behave like little automatons, with nothing more to do than wring their hands and pray over our main characters' marriage. I found NO realistic or interesting characters in this book. And while this is an age-old storyline centered around an arraged marriage turned love match, I believe that with (much) more deft handling, it could have been made interesting. Try Lizz Curtis Higgs or Francine Rivers for Christian romance that you can sink your teeth into. \\"The Princess\\" was little more than stilted dialog interlaced with preaching--a dash of needless fretting thrown in for good measure. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Princess","review":"This was the first novel I have ever read by Lori Wick.

Nothing exciting about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I really wanted to like this book.Unfortunately, I simply could not force myself to like The Princess. The characters, for the most part, are dull, predictable, and abnormally religious. The dialogue seems oddly stilted at times, as though the characters are reading lines someone else wrote for them. And the plot itself wasn't nearly as interesting as I'd imagined it would be.If you're looking for a good piece of Christian fiction, I reccommend that you skip The Princess."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This is the first Lori Wick book I have ever read, and I was surprised by how disappointing I found it. It was a good storyline to begin with (the only reason it is not just one star), but it could have been handled much better. The writing was dull and seemed amateurish, the dialog stiff and unnatural (I realize that sometimes that was called for, but it occurred in ALL of it!), the characters perfect---and where's the fun in that? Once again, let me emphasize that I liked the general plot. In the hands of a different writer, or written with a different style, or both, it could have been far more entertaining. Reading this has made me wary of pursuing any more of Wick's novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly corny + incredibly predictable = a poor example of a good genre","review":"I love romances, and I love books where God and Christianity play an important role. However, this book is a terrible example of both. I was very intrigued by the premise, and opened this book knowing it would be easy and light...I did not expect it to be the single corniest book I've ever read. The character of Prince Nicolai was especially offensive - no man thinks and operates how he is portrayed! I wanted to like this \\"modern fairytale\\" story, but I just couldn't get past the incredibly predictable plot lines. The characters are too perfect and unable to make decisions, the already unrealistic premise is poorly executed, and the ending seems completely contrived.

I am a senior in college and at least once a semester I am drawn to this book again because it takes me to a land that I can only hope to be in, and just because of the simple way it is written. I have now gotten about 6 of my friends started on these books because of the Princess. Even my mom read it and liked it - it is a book for all ages, but especially for girls who need a good excuse to read a beautiful love story.

The book has a fairy-tale type of quality that makes it so enchanting! Yet there is more to it than that. Its about a prince who is grieving his late wife when his parents (the king and queen of Faraday) decide its time for a new princess because of laws that say the prince must be married by a certain age. So the king and queen are in much prayer about who should become the next princess, when a dear friend of theirs thinks he has found the perfect girl. That girl is Shelby Parker. I would tell you more about it but I wouldn't want to ruin it for you. This is a book that you must read! It is simply delightful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"\\"The Princess\\", is the best book I have ever read.

I borrowed the book from a friend and now I am going out tomorrow to buy it. :o)"},{"rating":"1","title":"a little bit too unrealistic","review":"I've always loved Lori Wick's writing, and expected the same when I read this book. However, I found it to be a very shallow book. No thinking was required to read the book. It was a \\"fluff\\" book. I thought the setting was rather fake, and didn't seem like real life. I also found it hard to believe that a prince would marry a citizen that had no royal blood whatsoever. I could maybe understand it if her uncle was a duke or something, but she was just a normal person. It also seemed like everyone in the country were christians, which does not happen in the real world. I would definitely classify it as escape fiction. Altogether a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sweet Fairytale, Happy Ending","review":"I found The Princess very enjoyable and easy to read, a sweet story to relax with. There is nothing objectionable in it and anyone could read this book, young or old- I gave a copy to my mother-in-law. The Christian message is prevalent, but was not an \\"in your face\\" type of treatment.There is little \\"action\\" and if you are used to reading mainstream romances, this is very noticeable- no tempestuous heroine, no arrogant hero, no scheming mistress, etc. This is not a bad thing, really, since the story cannot rely on such props and sterotypes.Ms Wick focuses on what is in the heart of the main characters, and does it well. The very believable characters are well-developed and there are many different personalities involved, making it interesting.Having read the book several times, it is on my keeper shelf, and I look forward to a lazy afternoon at the beach with The Princess."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that everyone should Buy","review":"First of all let me start by saying that Lori Wick is the BEST when it comes to christian romance!!!

I have bought all of her recent books, but I wish I had waited to borrow THE PRINCESS.

It didn't seem as though she spent as much time in developing the plot and characters as she has in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really couldn't set it down","review":"Well, this wasn't great literature, and it had some flaws, but once I got into it, I couldn't stop turning the pages! And it made me think again about emotions, marriage, and what love really means. I felt the child,Peter Owens, was an unnecessary addition to the storyline, perhaps to share the plan of salvation, which could have been placed after the story. But overall, the story was worth the read, and shows the importance of sharing the same belief as your partner. If you're interested in stories of love and relationships, then I suggest this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"syrup and sugar","review":"This book is so disappointing and the plot so underdeveloped. It's very sad because there is/was a potential to write a totally awesome story. The premise could've been really been developed into a pretty beefy, good Christian story. Unfortunately, all the the characters here are one-dimensional and flawless. In fact, Princess Shelby is so squeaky clean, she makes good ole Cinderella sound like a hack! How can these people be Christian and yet so flawless?? After all, a christian is just a sinner saved by Grace. The plot is basically anorexic; there are no subplots. The prose is mediocre, at best. I wouldn't recommmend this book to avid readers. I read it in about 3 hrs and only because I wanted to punish myself for wasting money. Everyone in the book was so sweet, I'm sure I have cavities by now!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing does not measure up.","review":"It is written like a simple every day letter, with the same complexity and art. Not much better than a non-writer like you and I would do if we came up with a story. I do give it credit though, for some wonderful messages to live by. Ms. Wick would do better by writing books that teach how to live by the word of Our God, than writing novels.I really feel that we Christians don?t do ourselves any favors by giving high ratings to books simply to ?do good?, because it deceives others about the quality, and into spending money on a disappointment. I feel that we need to rate Christian writers same as we would anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as i thought....","review":"Hi,I read everyones review and thought this book would be great.

After reading all of Lori Wick's books besides The Princess, I purchased it online. The story starts with great possibility, but it falls to pieces.
