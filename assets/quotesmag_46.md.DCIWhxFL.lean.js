Very very few pictures, outdated visa requirements about yellow fever vaccinations (which I've read elsewhere have never been a requirement), not much basic travel information (like country weather, dress, currency) which is usually covered well in Lonely Planet books, like LP China, for example. The writers are clearly European, but their strong style leaves me wondering what nuances I may not be picking up on as an American. These omissions make me less confident about the other facts and recommendations given in the book. None of the writers are female, which also makes me wonder if the places they felt safe would be comfortable to a female traveler. All in all, this book was not as thorough and well researched as other Lonely Planet books I have read and used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Bradt Guide.","review":"I've used both the Lonely Planet and the Bradt Guide for a visit to Ethiopia at the end of 2009; it should be noted that a new edition of the LP came out two weeks after I returned, and that the edition I used was three years old when I used it.My opinion, based on the 2006 edition: don't bother with the LP. Prices are completely inaccurate to the point you wonder if they ever were remotely correct and crucial information is lacking and inaccurate: according to the LP one bus trip takes six hours by minibus (it takes ten) and there is no specific place to catch one of these buses (there is). The Bradt guide is much more accurate, has a more comprehensive listing of hotels, restaurants and more background information on Ethiopia.

After talking with many people and getting many opinions, I came across the Lifecore LC-980 on Amazon. After reading the reviews that were previously posted here and from websites that review these machines, I heard nothing negative about the equipment. In fact, it was rated a best buy, \\"priced too low if you ask me\\" and all positive feedback on several sites. After receiving the machine from Dazadi, took 5 days to get from California to NY (not too bad), it was a breeze to put together and was up and running shortly. After figuring out the computer settings, it works like a charm. My wife and I are extremely pleased with the Lifecore and look forward to many years of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"There has to be something better","review":"Normally, I can't tolerate books that are completely in black and white and this one was no exception. I sincerely despised the book. In the note from the authors, they claim that they have taken care to show every equation derived from one to the next. That holds true for the first couple of chapters, then it just disappears. I'm also the kind of person that likes images to better understand the concepts. The images presented here weren't helpful at all. I bought the book because the professor let us use it during the exams (and even the professor's derivations were much better than the book's) but frankly I wouldn't even touch it.

I've had no problems with the velcro fastener, either. A major complaint, though, is that the leather covering on the metal belt clip tore away after only a few weeks of use, leaving the sharp clip exposed. This has made it difficult to get the clip onto my belt, because the remains of the leather clip cover bunch up at the top of the clip. It has also left scratches on my leather belt, which is annoying. Overall, it hasn't worn well, either -- the seams are coming undone, and the elastic on the sides is fraying. It makes a good-looking phone appear cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hire an editor","review":"This book would have earned a higher score had it not been so full of errors. My husband recently purchased this book to help him study for the ASVAB. We chose the Princeton Review one because we thought we could trust the name. There are countless errors in both the explanations of how to take the test as well as the practice tests. In a novel a few typos are harmless, but in a test prep book, it renders it useless.The format of the book is good. It is divided up into clear sections with practice tests throughout. I hope that the next edition is more thouroughly proof read so that it can be helpful to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I bought this book a few months ago to help prepare me for the ASVAB, and wish I had bought something else now that I'm finishing the book.

Especially when it comes to the math problems; you'll be left scratching your head time and time and time again trying to figure out how they got an answer to a problem, when it is actually the wrong answer. If you are a bit rusty on math, which most people are, this book might do more harm than good. Although I haven't tried another book, I strongly suggest getting something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistakes","review":"The math section is awful. It's full of errors that only serve to frustrate and confuse. They will give you a problem to solve and you'll solve it only to find out that the answer in the back is done using a formula that makes no sense, or they have changed numbers in the problem. Not all of them are wrong but there are a few. Example It says to get the circumference of a circle the formula is 2P r(sorry i cant find a button for pi) one page later it asks you to solve the circumference of a circle using the formula Pi R squared. It's little things like this that make it a bad test prep. It's very confusing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice screen at an affordable price","review":"The screen arrived with the box intact.

I called Amazon immediately and they told me I had to pay to ship it back but if it was their fault they will cover my shipping. I hope so, it was $23 to ship back to them. There were several stickers on the outside of the box, one was a little loose than the others, and this was the one that said 110\\" screen. The stickers on the side of the box told the truth.

Byron is not, however, a favourite of wealthy but harsh land owner Tobias Brown (Lee Marvin), who teaches the lad lessons of life the hard way; their conflict forms the kernel of a torpid work that does benefit from a strong performance by always reliable Paul Ford as proprietor of a small cafe, but that is sunk by flaccid direction and hackneyed dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst MYOB upgrade ever","review":"We've been using MYOB for our book keeping software for six years now, until this this release, I've had nothing but praise.However, this version, despite the additional bells and whistles, is slow at best (System: Dual 533 processsor, 384 megs of RAM, running 10.1) and very unstable.

Also, I am not at all offended when she makes political observations, especially when I agree with most all of them!I've recommended this series to my trainer and the kids in the local Pony Club to read, and for anyone frustrated by adult horse fiction.

As for the good guys they suddenly came off as smug and downright cruel to anyone who wasn't in the circle of Sister's friends. Speaking of Sister, I didn't like what's happened to her character, she's changed. I didn't like this version of her at all--maybe Brown just didn't put enough effort into this novel.

Wet thistle is not appetizing to the birds, nor to me. It does not dry out, but clumps and rots. In additon, the feeder is very difficult to clean. If you already own one, may I suggest adding an umbrella baffle. Of course, you could always bring it in before a rain, or hang it under protection....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finches at our house didn't like this feeder","review":"For some reason, the finches we have at our house refuse to use this feeder -- even though they flocked to a cheap $5 tube feeder I had before this one! The other cheaper feeder had a flat tray on the bottom, which they seem to prefer over this design. I left it hanging out there for weeks and not one bird used it, so I finally gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless waste of time...","review":"Bought this feeder as a gift. The actual bird feeder was plastic at the bottom of the unit and the copper had scratches over most of the metal surface. Unfortunately, never found out how this feeder worked with the birds as the plastic bottom was a defect and did not actually attach. Without the bottom sealing the feed chamber, the feeder would not work. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction","review":"I cannot evaluate this book for method or factual accuracy but it provides an interesting, engaging take on Cree mythology that is very readable even for a nonspecialist. Specifically, Brightman seems to understand what appear to be paradoxical, sometimes contradictory elements of the Cree views of nature, which are very different from the western views of nature.I highly recommend this book for people who are not specialists in the field, simply as a reminder of what else is out there besides their own way of thinking. It is sad that cultures such as these were largely replaced by other cultures less closely connected with the North American environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real World Talk about Autism","review":"It's so exciting to read what the direct care workers who spend their days working with autistic kids say! My son is in a school for autistic children - the entire staff surround him with love while they push him to learn and develop. ABA, the method Newman discusses, can seem cold and a little frightening when it's just words in a text or manual. To see it in action is to see why it works so well, and this book celebrates the love and caring that make ABA work. The passion in every chapter leaps off the page. It's inspiring, it's reassuring, it's the best description I've seen of ABA in daily use."},{"rating":"2","title":"great music!","review":"I've read before that not all of Chet Baker's recordings are not that good, But this one is a winner: GREAT STUFF!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best , so easy to make and oh so tasty","review":"easy to make just follow the instructions on the boxHowever, instead of water i use MILK , plus i always add a pinch of salt, freshly grated lemon peel, pure vanilla extract, pure almond extract , cinnamon extra , nutmeg extract .or sometimes , if i am adding rhum, i would substitute 1/2 of the milk with rhum ..U do not want to add more liquid because it is \\" super Moist \\"..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and outmoded.","review":"My first impressions are not favorable.

He may be one of the greatest minds of all time, but it is clear that this book is poorly written, haphazard in its range and content, and, in places, insufficiently researched and so inaccurate. Worst of all, the author puts forward his quite personal speculations about Chinese music as if these were proven facts. This could mislead the first-time reader.There is a lot of scope for an enthusiastic and inexpensive book about Chinese music, one that will help the non-specialist approach this fascinating subject. There is also a place for speculation in opening up new research areas, but a good author needs to exercise self-criticism, check facts through careful research (including reading the work of others), and avoid bombast. Mr Shen fails on all three counts. The cover is a very nice shade of vermillion, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak motor,","review":"This is a sweet birdbath.

I'll try again in a month or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and reliable","review":"I bought this fountain last year after going through 5(!) floating solar fountains in our birdbath. The floaters either developed leaks or just quit working. When I received it, there was a broken part, but they worked with me and after emailing photos of the broken part, the replacement came quickly. We have the birdbath near a tree and have selectively pruned some branches to let the sun in. That way, we get the enjoyment of the fountain and the birds have someplace to be safe. I brought the pump in over the winter (in Michigan) but just turned the bath over and let it winter outside. It did develop a crack that I was able to patch, but I will be bringing the entire base inside this winter. The fountain head is too sedate for us, so the water is usually allowed to cascade without it. The bath does empty faster that way, but we change the water in the bath daily anyway for hygiene."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 week later -- doesn't work","review":"DON'T BUY. Paid the price for this because I liked the idea of the circulating water in the birdbath. Unfortunately, the 'fountain' portion only lasted a week.

Gilson'st overrated and lacks the critical acumen to make cogent judgements. Compare Kenner's books on Eliot, Pound, Beckett etc. and Abrams' two critical masterpieces. I strongly recommend that the reader ignore Gilson. That he is so popular with academics is yet another index of the lunacy of today's literary/religious/ philosophical critics. If only Mark Steyn could be persuaded to write some literary criticism, we could then have critical perceptiveness and fine writing to help us understand literary works.

The male and female characters are wholly unbelievable - how can anyone swallow the premise that a 20+ year old woman who works at a professional job like a financial analyst somehow wakes up at night, sees a man in her bedroom and just sort of has sex (we think, because nothing is described) because, we are to believe, her father was highly sexed and she apparently takes after him??? The book is nothing but page after tedious page of each character's thoughts about \\"what ever am I going to do\\" (her) and \\"I hate that I am attracted to her) (him). Neither is either romantic or sexy. Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical artist vs. censorship movie, but with nudity and snakes","review":"The story of Snake Dancer isn't particularly original, or even put together very well, but there's plenty of 70's atmosphere and nudity to make up for it. It's supposed to be based on the life exotic dancer Glenda Kemp (who plays herself) and her troubles with censorship in South Africa, but the real reason to watch it is for the nude dancing. The movie is cheesy and a little odd at times (particularly the ending, which couldn't of actually happened), but the dance numbers are usually interesting. Glenda Kemp had ballet training and her body type is definitely one of a ballet dancer, so don't expect huge [...] to be bouncing around during her performances. Regardless, there are some decently sensual scenes, especially toward the end.There isn't that much actual snake dancing in the film, at least for a movie called Snake Dancer. I liked it anyway, but the story could have been a little more coherent. Glenda Kemp is pretty hot, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD MOVIE.... WORTH WATCHING","review":"I rented this on VHS about 14 years ago. I didn't what expect as it was aSouth African Film. It turned out to be a somewhat factual story and had you solidly in Glenda's corner from the gitgo. I didn't think much of herManager ( pimp?). I was glad to see this released on DVD. Everybody has focused on the snake, and I guess it does play a pivotal role, but,I kinda liked the puppet act even if the authorities didn't.

While limited to his 1985-93 Capitol tracks the compilation producers (thankfully) had the good sense to include album-only tracks in addition to the hits in order to give the listener a balanced retrospective of his most prolific period.

Those looking for a narrative such as found in so many chronicles of the settling of the west may be dissapointed. I was raised with my brothers Frank, a character in the book, and Charlie about twenty five miles east of the \\"meadow\\" as the crow flies and also on the Colorado-Wyoming state line. Frank, a fountain of common sense, but not nearly as philosophical as Galvin, shared his passion for the meadow and its environs as do all who were brought under its spell some time during their lives. None of us could have put it into words and we are thankful James did. The style is difficult even for those who know the area and characters, but it is exactly appropriate for the task at hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"I wish more people knew about this book! It was recommended to me by a few \\"ranchy\\" friends, and I was glad to be able to get this copy in excellent condition. James Galvin's writing style is so unique. The story of the history and people who lived around the meadow truly reflects the challenges faced in the developing West. Mr. Galvin has a very descriptive, poetic style which shares his obvious appreciation for nature and, conveys the tough character of those who have no choice (and no other desire) but to work through their hardships.

But I've never really liked Renée Fleming; she's very good, yes, but her voice isn't distinctive enough for me to call her a \\"great\\" soprano, lyric or otherwise. Dessay's performances of these relatively unknown selections are flawless, with the possible exception of Rachmaninov's Vocalise, which is more for a lyric soprano. True, Dessay's ultra-thin tone can be piercing, but it's worth it to hear intelligent interpretations of songs that I haven't heard eight million times before. And her coloratura technique has got to be among the best in the world today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Natalie Dessay...performs Rachmaninov,Alabiev and others","review":"This is great classical female opera...for anyone who thought they would not like high scale singing with most done without orchestral backup...you have found the album to buy.

I don't believe it is copper as advertised. It also did not develop a rich patina as claimed. The cage area has held up fine. Also, there are eight feeding ports, but the botton four are unusable, because as soon as the thistle seed gets wet, it turns very hard, clumps together and blocks the ports leaving only the four upper ports operational.

It brought back memories of my one year at Galena and decided I had to buy it. Boy, I could not put this book down and read it every spare moment. I had even read it at stop lights (not recommended)while driving to work. The endurance and hardships Jim and the peoples of Alaska had at that time in history was incredible. Makes our silly problems seem so trivial. I did briefly meet Sydney Huntington dury my stay in Galena, I just wished I'd had a chance to meet his brother Jim. I too wonder if they are still around, they would be in their eightys by now. Great book, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lets All Remember...","review":"I will start out by saying that i think what happened on Sept. 11 was very horrible and i wish peace to all the families affected. After listening to these songs i feel that this song was redone well, and all the artist did a great job. Lets all remember that artists alike, we are all humans and have our own feelings. These artists put there hard time into these songs and just because there is a rap artists doesnt make the song disrespectful in anyway, shape or form. This CD was made so that people that prefer different genres of music could listen to the song that they liked. Lets all remember this is 2001 and we should respect each other and the work we participate in. Overall i find this CD to be a great remix and hope the best for everyone.PEACE"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice idea for a good cause...","review":"The line-up Bono has amassed is amazing and they do a pretty good job of updating the Marvin Gaye classic for today's current politcal landscape.

No matter how I hold it the top edge of the right side recess digs into my finger(s). Is my pinky finger supposed to fit in there? Maybe my ring and pinky finger?

In short, it says \\"if you do this thing that you aren't supposed to do while you're pregnant, don't panic, but don't do it again either.\\" Repeat for each thing you aren't supposed to do while you're pregnant. I had been hoping for the reasons why you shouldn't panic, but it doesn't go that deep.

The year is about 1950, I mean, comon! Mind-control? Wheater machines? Kane are not in this game, Nod and GDI have no connection to RA2. How can people love this game, it's almost an exactly copy of Tiberian Sun (wich were good, despite the graphics). Personally, I think WestWood (WW) should finish Tiberian Twilight (sequel to TibSun). The GDI-NOD conflict are mutch better and the units are more time-made. The story are also better (who Kane is? where did tiberium come from etc...). Now WW are almost finished with Yuri's Revenge, witch also will be dissapointing.

It has better grapics, a better story, and fresh units. Both the Soviet and Allied single player mission are great and fun with interesting twists. As usual Westwood Studios has given us a great game with a good backstory and bad cinemas (but since most people don't even watch them it doesn't really matter.) Yet there is one problem with this great game, it's too easy. If you start the single player missions on normal it can be challenging to beginners yet after a while it can get dull even on hard. Yet Westwood puts in a solution to that too. Since the game features single player skirmish battle and a wide array of multi-player games. It's one of the best RTS games I've ever played. If you're into RTS games this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a great game","review":"I think it is a great game. It is a great game for all people who love strategy games.

I also enjoy all of the different strategy you can use to defend you base and counquer the enemy. For more information on the game I suggest going to westwood.com. I would suggest buying the game only if you are sure you would like it but if it were up to me wast no more time reading this review and go ahead on buy it.

And what the graphics lack in a technical aspect, they make up for in artistic value, and by really helping build up the atmosphere of outrageous sci-fi/history/comedy mishmash background.

Although, I am an adult and I loved reading it.The descriptions of each character was hillarious. I especially loved how the Hooligans actions were described. Roxie's large pink ears reminded me of the story about an elephant named Dumbo. The stories describing Uncle Dangerfoots adventures were very easy to get lost in.

It's very hard to determine where Ades is ultimately heading, musically speaking, but these works written on the way to that destination stand on their own as fascinating examples of a truly creative imagination. Although I enjoyed \\"Living Toys\\" it was my least favorite piece. [update: after many rehearings, it has become a favorite-this underscores the necessity of gving complex music such as Ades' more than a perfunctory single listen] The aforementioned Quartet and Choral pieces were the standout. \\"Origin\\" was interesting for the wonderful sonorities and textures conjured up from a truly odd ensemble and the \\"Sonata\\" made me laugh out loud with it's fun-house mirror view of Baroque music.

This can be said to all Analogue Production Jazz Classic SACD/CD hybrid series. Cut the CD layer and the sales price. Those who spend extra bucks to buy those classic disks know more than too well how musically superior those recordings are from CDs and LPs they own for years.

He was excited to get it and played with it a lot for the first few days.Unfortunately the set is not well made. My first clue came when assembling it and the pre-drilled holes for one of the legs was not spaced right for both screws to go through- I had to re-drill the hole to get it through. Starting within an hour of play, I've constantly needed to re-glue the tools and bolt together- I've done every single bolt and tool handle at least once and lost count on how many times I've fixed the hammer. The second day he had it the vice broke off with a splintered end from him tightening and un-tightening-he's a kid, it not like I was torquing down on it, it shouldn't break that easily.Workbench tools are fairly basic, and boys love them.

The pieces included are clearly very rudimentary and simplified for toddlers and young children - actual construction of real-life projects should not be expected. Using the pieces included kids can 'build' things by screwing and unscrewing, tightening and loosening nuts, ect. The pieces are bright and colorful, a good size for toddler fingers and hands.Overall it seems a little on the flimsy side - I don't see the bench or many of the pieces lasting through more than one toddler, as their play can be a bit rough and abusive.

If you use the Metra faceplate, it leaves a large gap around the face of the head unit. If you use the faceplate from the head unit, there is a large gap between it and the rest of the Metra trim.There is no way to combine the two face plates, so you are stuck with deciding which option is less ugly. The gap is substantial enough that you can see through to the back.I will say that this kit is better than its predecessor, the 99-5200.

When they work, they're awesome. The price isn't worth their short life span. Stick with Delonghi's radiator heaters or get one from a different company. These are garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money and pass this one by!","review":"After researching this product and reading many reviews (admittedly more bad than good), I decided to purchase this product. In fact, I purchased through Amazon due to the fact there would be no hassle if the product failed to live up to its claims. The heater worked fine...for about 7 hours or so and then refused to operate. Customer service was no help. The room was 64 degrees and it was set to high and still would not operate. I'd say skip this lemon. However, if you decide to roll the dice, purchase through a dealer such as Amazon who will not hassle you if you should need to (and probably will need to), return it. And don't forget to open the box carefully so you have something in which to ship it back! Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the heat?","review":"Just got this thing and it barely gives off any heat. I got it because my old heater fan was going and thought it was neat this didn't have a fan but it can't even compare to my old heater that used half the wattage (and half the electric bill).

Bought two of these in the fall, used reasonably regularly throughout the winter, both worked well in closed and open spaces. First one died about a month ago - light still worked, made normal clicking noise when turning the lower heat knob to higher setting, but didn't heat. No way to repair; in addition, Delonghi has stopped making these and will only offer to replace with a much less expensive model (TCH8590ER). Second unit still working but emits blue sparks at times (typically when on a medium heat setting); there may be bigger issues with this type of flat-panel heating that has caused Delonghi to discontinue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great heater.

So far it's fantastic. Heats up silently and immediately. I find the dial controls totally sufficient; when the room heats to your liking, you just turn the thermostat a bit and the heater holds that temp in the room. You do not need to be sitting next to it to get the benefits - after a little time the whole room will heat up. I especially like how lightweight and portable it is. It's also a slick look. The perfect solution to my drafty back bedroom issues.

Of course this seemed dangerous. I deemed it a fluke - a lemon because it was an effective heater and I really liked it. I bought a second. It has been working well for 3 years. Sadly it died a couple of days ago. The \\"on\\" light lights up when plugged in but there is no heat. I would expect a heater to last more than 3 years. Needless to say I'm disappointed.

I used it seasonally for a few hours a day, 4 or 5 days a week, until now (early April 2012). Yesterday, after an hour or so of use, I heard odd crackling noises and thought I noticed a spark and an odor, so I turned it off and unplugged it. Today, large orange sparks appeared as soon as I turned it on and traveled around on the face of the heater (presumably on the elements), accompanied by the same noises and odor. I don't plan to turn it on again as I strongly suspect it is now a fire hazard.I debated giving it two stars, since it worked adequately for the equivalent of two winter seasons, but I don't think an item like this should fail so quickly under reasonable use, and I am certain that it shouldn't fail in such an alarming way.

But they don't last.Bought the first one from Amazon, used it for a several months but then it smoked. Literally, the element started sparking. It was under warranty so DeLonghi sent me a new one. Used that one for a little over a year and then it just stopped working. No smoke but no heat either, nothing.The last one wasn't under warranty so the bottom line is I bought a disposable heater that lasted for about 2 years for $90. I think I should get more mileage out of an appliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good safe heater for baby's room","review":"We needed a small heater to keep our new born's room warm during the winter when we turn the central heat down to about 60 degrees. This is little light weight heater has been idea. It keeps the room nicely warm yet it doesn't get dangerously hot to the touch, at least when kept on the low setting. It does, of course, get hot enough that you wouldn't want to hold your hand against the front screen for more than a few seconds, nor allow a blanket or such to come in contact. But it's a lot cooler than many of the others we've seen, and it wouldn't burn you or baby just from a quick contact. My only complaint is that the power on indicator light burnt out within a week of purchase, but otherwise it has been just what we needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delonghi - Beats the cold of 18 degrees","review":"For years I've had 2 heaters in my Glass Patio/Sun Room (15 X 14 ft). We've been able to use the room 9 months a year as Virginia winter chilled the room. The ceramic heater I was using burned out and I saw a write up in Forbes about this heater. I was skeptical but the room is now warm at 18 degrees outside and 25 mph winds.Its quiet and great. My only issue was for the first 3 hours it smelled of new heat - the smell lighting the furnace for the first time or the first fire in the fireplace. The smell filled the room to the point of opennng the windows to let air in. After 3 hours the smell subsided -its been great since"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT buy this product","review":"I feel sorry for the writers of glowing reviews here-- because this product worked well for me too-- for a very short amount of time.First winter-- near silent operation mounted on the wall. Quiet, that is, unless we used the \\"high\\" setting. On \\"high,\\" the heater made loud and somewhat disturbing popping noises.Second winter-- loud popping noises even on low! And in the dark, those pops were accompanied by disturbing \\"spark\\" like orange glows on the mica panel. We had to discontinue use-- the child who slept in the room would wake up and cry when the heater cycled on. And the increasing visible spark-like lighting made me too nervous to leave it on, since that effect is not described anywhere in the product's documentation.Third winter-- it worked for about two hours, and then died. For good.Save your money. Buy a product reviewed positively by someone who has owned it for more than a month!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Portable Heater Review","review":"This heater is noisless.

Upstairs in the loft office I needed auxiliary heat. What I liked about this unit was its looks and its wheels -- it just rolls around the floor quite easily. Unfortunately, the heat it puts out doesn't seem to reach very far from the source. You can feel the heat with your hand a few inches from the panel, but my desk chair is only 3 or 4 ft. away, with the unit behind me, and my back and shoulders are still quite chilled. I'm guessing that the absence of a fan or any radiant elements limits this unit's effectiveness. Bottom line: I'm still cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heat from the top only","review":"If you are the one to get warm, you need to bend over the top of the heater.

They lasted for different amounts of time...I think one of them may have gone as long as six months before it died. While they worked, they were quite nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third rate book on one of the greatest performers","review":"What a let down! I can't think of anyone more deserving of a good biography than Elvis Costello. The greatest 20th Century songwriter -- and I include Dylan, Gershwin, Porter, et al., in that comparison. Well, this isn't what we've been waiting for, by a country mile. A thrown-together collection of press clips, apocrypha and tired gossip, with absolutely no analysis of his lyrics and songwriting in general. If you're going to read a bio, try \\"God's Comic\\" instead. It's no great shakes either, but this is the pits. Why the publisher didn't just sling the MS in the trashcan, I don't know. Obviously done with no cooperation from the subject or anyone who knows the first thing about his music. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did it chart? Did it chart?","review":"Because of Costello's fantastic music and lyrics, not so much because of the mans life(of which I knew nothing about), I wanted to read this book, and so I have.Well, I must say that while Costello's lyrics are profound and rich, the book about him do not fit that description. I was all the way through reading the book with great interest and fascination, but that was never because I found the book well written or in any way brilliant. Anyway, I couldn't put it away because the story told was about an exciting human being.This is on the other hand no excuse to write a boring book, that uses more energy on explaining marketing strategies and US charts, than contemplating Elvis Costello."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut and Paste Bio","review":"There are three types of unauthorized biographies, well-researched, pure speculation, and cut and paste. This is an example of the latter. The author gives us the Elvis Costello to be found in magazine interviews, and creates a whole book by taking information from a variety of sources and putting it all together into this quickie bio. Some decent insights into his recording career are to be found throughout, but this is really not well-done. You can put your time to better use by listening to a few Costello CD's and wonder about the workings of the man who created all this challenging music. That will bring you closer to understanding Elvis Costello than this book will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin Account of Elvis","review":"One thing that you have to give credit to Tony Clayton-Lea for is that he right up front advises the reader that Elvis Costello had nothing and wanted nothing to do with this biography. Cooperation from the subject of a biography is, of course, immensely helpful in writing of the book, but by no means a necessity. Mr. Clayton-Lea offers an extremely pedestrian account of the life and times of Elvis Costello. The book reads like press clippings in many spots and offers no insight into the man's career. Being that there are barely any books on Mr. Costello, this book has a minimum of value for that reason, but not much else. if you are an avid fan of Mr. Costello, then this book doesn't offer much, but if you are not that familiar with his career, then this book is a decent primer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Really good protagonist and writing subject!

Forgiveness is the theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very offensive material to Jewish people.","review":"The premise of the story is that Jewish people have been looking in the wrong direction. Jews need to follow Jesus otherwise they are materialistic and full of vengeance. All the characters (of course they are Jewish) who accept Jesus are loving. Those who do not are narrowminded, mean, and self-centered. Throughout the book, the author belittles Judaism, while at the same time, never really explains Judaism. Does the author have any real knowledge about Judaism? How can she criticize a religion if she does not understand its beliefs or practices? Many of the comments I have read come from school age children. This book promotes one religion over another and should not be used for instruction in the public schools. There are many books that teach concepts of love and peacefulness without getting into religious material. The religious nauture of this book offends me.

Both of them won a Newberry Medal. This book is so much better than \\"Blackbird Pond\\". It kept my attention and I couldn't put it down! The book taught lessons of leadership, patience, care, and love. It wasn't a romantic book but it was more about loving the people that matter to you and also loving your enemies.I have recently been reading Tom Clancy novels that teach nothing of the sort but I found this book at a bookstore warehouse that was going out of business and I decided to give it a chance even though I didn't like my previous experience with the author.

It is spectacular!! A story about a boy named Daniel, a sister that will not leave the house, a bunch of outlaws, and Roman soldiers. The book also includes Jesus. Elizibeth Speare carefully weaved the truth of Christ in this book. It is very emotional at the end. I cried while telling my mother what happened at the end. It truly impacted me. It makes me want to follow Jesus and please him.You must understand when I say \\"the best book I've ever read\\", what it beat. Here are some books I've read that this book outshined.The HobbitHarry PotterShannaraLes MiserablesNarniaHittite WarriorCat of BubastesThe Golden Goblet...and lots more. Notice the last three book titles. Those are also fabulous books. Bronze Bow, however, is wonderful. I can't decide which words to use. You would have to read the book yourself to know what I mean. You will like it, trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiring and exciting book","review":"\\"He hath trained my arms for war, so I can bend a Bow of Bronze.\\" I loved this book for many reasons, #1, it is very deatailed, almost as if you are seeing out of Daniel's eyes. It shows what it is like to be under the rule of an empire. It describes his feelings very clearly. #2 It is exiting. There is fire for war in Daniel's eyes. There is strategy, skill, and breathtaking moments that will keep you reading. WARNING WARNING: IF YOU ARE UNDRE THE AGE OF 12, YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE THIS BOOK.

The only disappointing part of the construction is that the interlocking mechanism that connects the top to the bottom is made of plastic. However, having said that, it has withstood the 'attack of the squirrels', which jump on top of the feeder. (My fault, I placed it to close horizontally to the tree). This feeder cannot be pole mounted. It holds a fair amount of seed. You need to unscrew the top from the bottom to add seed to the feeder, so I hang my feeder off of a hook to that I can easily remove it for refilling. I would recommend this feeder if you plan to hang it off a hook. You could hang it off of a string from a limb, but I think you might find refilling more difficult.

To begin with, the opera is sung in Italian-when Gluck actually made a point of writing it in French! In addition, the male singers are all woefully inadequate, and Sonzogno's Gluck sounds more like bad Puccini. As usual with Callas, there are thrilling moments (for instance, the wonderful opening scene), but they never add up to a complete portrayal, and, although she sings with great elegance and poise, the overall peformance is disappointing. Those who wish to hear what wonders she could accomplish in Gluck should listen to her Alceste, which is another matter altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok....not fun","review":"I am 13 years old and have a lot a tycoon games, zoo tycoon 2, rollercoster tycoon 3, and even school tycoon that is made by the same company and they are so fun!

The nice part of the kit is that you have needles and yarn to start out with so you don't have to wander into a yarn store and stare cluelessly at the shelves. If you want to learn how to knit, get size 7 needles, a skein of cheap 100% acrylic, and \\"The Knit Stitch\\" and \\"The Purl Stitch\\" by Sally Melville.

Not only is it historically accurate but, the plot is terrific! Thomas and Jocelyn's fractured marriage, solving the affairs between Indian and the English, the surprising marriages of Jocelyn's maid, and the horrible event that happened to Jocelyn and Thomas' daugher.

As a historical buff, I was excited to set sail to the Lost Colony of Roanoke Island, but I got lost along the way. The first 1/4 of the story moved painfully slow, but when it hit a very unexpected flashback just to fill in some historical facts, I found myself shipwrecked. Like Gilligan and the passengers, I tried to find my way off of it and to sail onward. I almost made it to the halfway mark, but decided to walk the plank and give up the journey.I was disappointed in the writers' ability to intertwine the fiction story into the historic. It moved too slowly. The main character was a blur. My optimism in looking for the hook drove me to read as far as I did. Bottom line: I found it historical, yet painfully boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and Light","review":"I love this book.

In fact, it may be that everything you ever need to know about CVS is in this book. This book covers version control basics, paradigm differences, branches, merging, and all of the 'basic' version control tools. It then provides 'recipes' (boiler plate) for common operations to simplify things. This book has perhaps two shortcomings: first, it doesn't cover all of the features of CVS. The authors can be forgiven for stating their prejudices, particularly since they coincide with mine, but I think completeness is worth something so ignoring the features that are deemed of less worth is probably not the best. Second, this book doesn't cover the GUI interfaces. The GUI's should be easy to figure out, and the command line is certainly where it's at for scripting, but I think there are a lot of folks who would like at least a WinCVS appendix.

In actuality, the boy mostly functions as an observer of the whirlwind lives of a group of fine young women who live across the street from him. This is reflected by the more apt ordinal French title, which translates to \\"The Taste/Appetite of Young Girls.\\" Theses women are a fairly unpleasant, nasty, catty, backstabbing lot, and are fairly hard to tell apart.

Ordered Napoleon Dynamite headknocker at same time, from same vendor, and that was only sent in a manila envelope with little packing, and original box only had cellophane protection in front, and again the glasses were broken and pieces on the base were broken off.

Southerland and Bain give absolutely chilling performances, and as always, Macy was right on mark. Though the movie isn't really a thriller, it is psychological, disturbing, and at times intense. It ends the only possible way it could, and it leaves you with an uncomfortable, yet satisfied feeling...."},{"rating":"2","title":"betty crocker golden vanilla cake mix","review":"This is the best cake mix ever! I have been a cake decorator for many years and every time I make a cake with this mix, I get rave reviews about how moist it is. It is by far my personal favorite and my family's too. In fact, I just used these mixes to make my son's wedding cake! Their other flavors of \\"vanilla mixes\\" like french vanilla are excellent too, but this is THE best!

This book is for anyone that has found him or herself asking this question. Join Isabel on her journey of self-discovery while she attempts to answer this very question.Funny and informative this book is insightful, and explores the history of the Tibetan people in their quest for autonomy from the Chinese. Travel with Isobel as she meets the Dalai Lama, travels Nepal, Tibet and India in search of some answers. This book makes you want to find out more about the situation in Tibet...and anything that moves anyone to act in a selfless manner in this day and age should be applauded.It is well worth a read as it, sneaks up on you and works it magic without your knowledge. And when you're finished you will b immeasurably changed...Even if it is just the smile it puts on your face....and that alone makes it worth every cent!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"The author's story was inspiring for me. From what she said, she started out as a novice political activist. But within a relatively short time, she'd masterminded and organized several high profile events -- complete with extensive media coverage -- and her fledgling group 'Act for Tibet' had become a force to be reckoned with....A good book for anyone who's been thinking 'what can one person do?'Moreover, this book was enjoyable.

The build quality was definitely shabbier than the first one with the bars being made of softer metal. It was no match for the squirrels. I definitely would not purchase another given the \\"bionic\\" feats of my mom's squirrels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucky mistake","review":"Very cute bird feeder, but the one we received had blue glass, not orange! Nowhere on the product page is it indicated that you will be shipped a random color, and not the one shown on the photo, so it was quite a surprise.Thankfully, the person the feeder was meant for likes blue, so she didn't mind a bit.

They look like lights. You can take the handle off. What makes it even more better is the security from it being a \\"screw\\" top. I originally purchased two, then bought three more. I will be ordering more, for future uses (in case I can't find them anymore). Neihgbors think they are outdoor lighting. The birds have no problem accessing the sunflower seeds (even through the ledges are rather short). I got the 4/4 post in 6 feet, put them in the ground, they are painted the same chocklate color of the bird feeders, looks great. Image shown doesn't do the feeder justice, it is a nice size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Replacing this one too soon!","review":"I liked this feeder just fine until something happened with the fasteners. The plastic top connects to the feeder by twisting it onto tabs on the feeder and they lock onto the top. For no good reason, the tabs do not line up with the top and will not lock on now. Everything looks fine, but they do not connect. I even broke a tab off trying to get the thing to lock down. I have had this feeder for only a few months and am replacing it already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attractive, but not for squirrel populated areas","review":"I bought these as gifts for families with young children. For that purpose they were wonderful gifts.For my taste I prefer the tube-type feeders with metal around the feeding ports to keep squirrels from destroying the feeder. However, those are too expensive to give to just anyone.For an attractive, reasonably priced beginner feeder, this works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Small Birds Only","review":"It is strange that the feeder instructions urges one to use Cardinal food--sunflower seeds--when I don't believe it is large enough for a Cardinal to land on. \\"My\\" Cardinals have eaten the spillings from Chickadees but haven't ventured to try to land on such a tiny ledge. It is easy to fill and looks good. Our local squirrel has leaped upon it but slid off as it is apparently too small for it too. Even the Chickadees can barely keep their balance.; they pluck the seeds and then eat them off the ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This feeder was a huge disappointment. The cover is hard to attach. It take several tries to get the grooves and grippers to match, especially when its no longer new. Lots of seeds spill in the process. After just a few months the color of the plastic (the entire thing is plastic) started to fade. The cover has warped a bit making it even harder to close securely that before.The ring to hang it from is short so it's difficult to hang unless you add chain. The bottom serves as a perch and is very narrow and is part of the base- no drainage holes. Rain collects in it, the seeds get all wet and stick together and rot. Water gets into the storage area and the seeds in there clump so they don't come out for the birds. Then they rot and /or sprout. I have to take it down and clean it out each time it rains.Squirrels love it. Birds and owners, not so much. I would not buy it another and do not recommend it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks nice but doesn't stand the rigors of the weather","review":"I had two of these for 3-4 years.

Read the book and find out the rest of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Captive, with twists and turns","review":"In the book The Captive, the plot line takes many twists and turns that can be sad, or can be full of action. It takes its first twist when Kofi Kwame Paul, the main character, witnesses his father and brother get shot by their betraying servant, Oppong. This event causes Kofi and his other brother, Kwesi, to be left with a slave trader. The slave trader allowed Kofi to prove his brother and himself a part of the royal Ashanti family. On this mission Kofi finds himself escaping from a trading post he went to to get his flute back. He was caught and sent on a ship to Salem, MA with African slaves. When he arrived there it was to his misfortune that he had become a slave to a farmer. After working there he ran away to Boston, MA with the other slaves to have freedom. Although the twists and turns seem to lead somewhere different, it all ends up in one place."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book you should read and buy","review":"This is a cool book because you can imagine how the main character,Kofi, really feels. It talks about how a son of the Ashanti chief, Kofi, was caught and sold as a slave again and again. In the end, Kofi met two American boy and learnt English.

It used to be available at Walmart, but now we can only find it online or at Walgreens. This is aspirin for people who cannot normally tolerate aspirin because of stomach problems. It does not cause either of us any stomach problems whatsoever because it is buffered by a powerful buffering agent, Maalox. I have inoperable trigeminal neuralgia and take a massive amount of aspirin (up to 4550 mg/day). With Ascriptin, I have never experienced any kind of stomach problems. Many people cannot take that much because of other reactions--tinnitus, etc--but I'm fortunate not to have that reaction. It is very fast acting, far faster than coated aspirin which for me, never seems to grab on to severe pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even the ICR rejected ths movie!","review":"Some years back I telephoned the Institute for Creation Research in Santee, California. They told me they no longer advocated the film In Search of Noah's Ark on the grounds it contained too much misinformation. This says a lot when a young earth creationist institute rejects a creationist film for being too misinformative. Those YEC's are so rightfully notorious for misquoting scientists themselves and distorting facts like crazy that for them to reject a creationist work shows how bad the latter work must be.This film leaves one with the totally false impression that archaeologist Leonard Wooley in the 1920's found a flood that covered the entire world.

However Adam Keen (Ed.) has injected a sharp opinionated eye and a nack for plot summaries that makes this an easy and stimulating read. There are movies listed that won't make it to these (or many other) shores, but that's part of the fun.There are some minor quibbles. Two of the photographs are mis-labelled; and colour photographs would be an improvement. Those aside, an entertaining read that is thought-provoking at the same time.

Twenty years ago this band from Canada released it's debut album called Vices which was a very successful album.Now the band is back with their original singer Gary Langen, and ready to go back on the road to rock. For most people that have not seen Kick Axe live here is your oppurtunity to hear the bands new material before you see them live.

The music he delivers for the movie \\"Amazing Grace\\" may not be his overall best effort, but some of the tracks on this CD are among his best work yet. The standout pieces are: 1) Opening Title; 11) We Have Hope; 23) Dying, and; 24) Triumph. The rest of the music is not as good, but solid nonetheless. My only real complaint is that the stirring rendition of \\"Amazing Grace\\" on the bagpipes is not featured on this CD, but that does little to diminish the overall power of Arnold's work. While it might not be sensational, it is a fine CD that belongs in the collection of any fan of movie music.Grade: B+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off","review":"Amazing Grace is a great movie and the CD is a rip off. The song Amazing Grace is a key part of the film and a key part of the score, including the bagpipe version at the end. Yet the song is not a part of the CD. Sleazy! Mis-leading!!

The first release of the soundtrack didn't have that song at all, and there were a lot of complaints about that. The producers of this CD added \\"Amazing Grace,\\" but the quality of that track is noticeably lower-quality sound than the rest of the CD. We were greatly disappointed.

Echoing what Mr. Merrick had to say, the tempo is fast, giving the music an even more frantic sense that it usually has. The conductor has really just amplified what Bernstein provided: Things certainly slow down when they need to.So why am I only giving 2 stars for a quality performance? The quality of the recording sucks. I don't know if it was somehow muddled during the encoding process, but the chorus sounds as though they are performing from inside a well. The focus seems to be on Mr. Jones, who comes through quite well along with the harp. But that's not even 1/4 of the piece, and the remainder is left muddled and confused."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book, but...","review":"Its a great book, very very specific and with lots of details on the history and dates. The only recommendation i will give to any possible buyer is: it is NOT a easy book to read, it has many names(of persons and places), many dates, very specific information that if you just are just looking for an overview of the history this is not the book.

If she really read and analyzed the series with the Bible, she'd find out just how close they are. True, no one can describe the end-times events exatcly how they will happen, but the Bible gives us a pretty good idea. The LB series is FICTION, but it's the clearest portrayal of prophecy yet.

I made the mistake of \\"trying it out\\" once on the bed and really messed up. It was so comfortable I fell asleep and was almost late for work.

From the hit That Rock won't roll- which just makes you want to dance, to the most touching of songs like Long Lost Friend with the sharp piercings sounds of heartbreak. Dancy's Dream has always been a favorite of almost anyone who is a RH fan, and it includes the sweet I'll still be loving you.There are a whopping 16 songs on the CD with very little filler.

The CD tracks are misaligned, so as to cause the first second or two of the following song to play at the end of the prvious track. So, if you want to burn a song, skip to a specific song, or listen on your media player, you lose the opening notes and gain the first notes of the next song. This is not a problem if you just put the disc into a player and go through the whole disc, in which case you won't notice this problem.

At the first tingle of a new sore, I use the disc at night. The box says not to sleep in them, but I prefer to. Sometimes it can be difficult to get the disc in the proper place, but be patient and keep your mouth still until it sticks. It is worth the effort. I'll NEVER EVER be without them.I also use Rembrandt toothpaste for Canker Sore Sufferers. I've found that this combination keeps me canker free.

It is a series of short stories, by different Spanish-speaking authors. The true value of this book resides in that it's a collection of children's stories about places and things and people in Latinamerica. Our own tales that, unlike the american fairy tales that we are bombarded with at an early age, hold marvellous stories that we can really relate to because we are part of them.This is the most entertaining collection of stories I read as a child. Even when my book is back home, and when the name of the stories are not listed here, I can still remember my favorite one: \\"Sopa de Piedras\\", one of the most ingenius and funny children's story I've read.

The only small wish I might ask for is higher resolution print like the Brother labeler does. My wife uses that one. However, the labels with the split in the backing really makes this labeler superior for me. The Brother doesn't have the split backing and I've spent two or three minutes per label trying to peel the back off the Brother's labels. My son likes Dymo's alligator box outline.

I'm not a mormon, but I go to church and consider myself a good person as well. I think this Decker guy has more to worry about then any of the Mormon's he proudly degrades. Would God endorse anti-mormonism as a good, faith promoting practice? Why not just put all your time and energy into serving others and making the world a better place?

They have their faith and others have theirs, and I can respect that, even if I think the particulars of any of them are dubious at best.But this book - The God Makers - was so badly written as to actually do less to discredit the Mormons, than to rally people to them. It was basically a few anecdotal accounts that are rehashed and drug out to the point of redundancy. And then capped off with a series of \\"The bible says this and that is at odds with the Mormon ideals - so they are big stupid heads\\"My quotes are paraphrased, but that was the feeling I was left with as what the author was trying to impart on us.

To be sure, I know other ex-Mormons with qualms about their upbringing, but none with such a checkered past or with quite so much vehemence against it as Decker, and notably none that have moved onto a higher plane of religious zealotry like he has.So the LDS are weird and definitely have negative elements in the fundamentalist fringe (what faith doesn't?), but here it all just comes off like the same degree of born-again hysteria leveled against Harry Potter.

Enough solid LDS doctrine is included to give the text a ring of authenticity, then the authors bend it all out of shape with obscure so-called research points that the reader cannot possibly verify. The result is a mixed-up jumble of truth and error that represents tabloid journalism at best. There are better works on Mormon theology than this for readers conducting serious research.At the end of the day, if a God is an authority on everything and able to touch every person on the planet, Hunt and Decker's work might best be described as an autobiography, especially now it's available across the Web.

He is a demagogue.Little scholarly work is achieved in this boring, sensationalistic work of fiction. Decker has mastered the art of a good lawyer: the ability to make falsehoods appear true by mixing in just enough truth to keep the reader guessing. In the end however, Decker is the religious equivalent of an ambulance-chaser.IF you are one who already dislikes Mormonism you will be thrilled by this work.

It seems that the forum for worldwide dissemination of nonsense known as the Internet to sell Books has provided conspiracy buffs with a chance to spread all of their theories and musings to what could be the largest audience in the world today. Hate and fear have always sold and made big bucks. The same can be said of this book. It reminds me of The Nazi propaganda against the Jews. This book is as useful as reading Klu Klux Klan material on Afro-Americans.However, if you hate Mormons this is the book to buy.

Ed Decker at one point in his life was a high ranking Temple Mormon. I read this book and it has helped me to understand my friends who are mormons.This book when combined with the Bible (which the Mormons believe in \\"to the extent that it is translated correctly), and science and the constant revisions of the four main regilious text of Mormonism, leads me to believe that the Mormonism is a sham, perpetuated to line the pockets of those in higher leadership."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This book is simply an argument that one religion is better than another.It isn't what I thought it would be, which is a description of Mormonism beliefs, about which I know very little.

After reading \\"The GOd makers.\\" I realized that some of the words they used Decker refers to in his book. Also, I went to MSN LDS chat rooms to see if his information present was correct and it was. I believe the truth is out there and we just have to see around all the bias and lies that people present.

It is very much false information. Just remember one thing, if you have a problem with a Chevy truck you do not take it to a Ford dealer to get it fixed, you would go to a Chevy dealer. So if you have questions about the Mormons, then go to a mormon. They will be honest with you about everything they do.

The writer, an excommunicated member, claims credibility due to his former membership. But after reading the first few pages you begin to see it for what it is, the rantings of an angry man. Because of certain problems which came into his life the author seeks a scapegoat for his troubles. Through fabrication, exaggeration, and bold face lies he seems to get his point across. But anyone who actually takes time to check the footnotes and verify the quotes will see that most, if not all, allegations made in this book are false. This book does, however, provide wonderful insight into the mindset of people who refuse to take responsibilty for their actions.

Godmakers tends to downplay the varying levels of Mormon-ness Mormons experience outside Utah, and it emphasizes practicalities and the human failures of church leaders while belittling the faith-based element typical of any organized religion.As a former Mormon myself, I opened this book with great interest.

How can you locically argue something that isn't logical to begin with. Look at the holes in your own religion before you look at the holes in everyone elses. Shooting down one persons faith to build up your own is wrong. If christian groups are going to pick apart the Book of Mormon for contradictions to the Bible, then they need to pick apart the Bible for it's contradictions to reality.

Given that some of the singers aren't very good actors, the result is dramatically very pale indeed.As far as the singing is concerned, not all the singers are up to their task.

I saw the COC production of Die Walkuere earlier this year. It was well done, but I must say that I prefer the version on this DVD, with its traditional sets (other reviewers called the sets blah) and its top-calibre Metropolitan Opera performers and conductor (Levine). The COC presents Siegfried, on its own, in February 2005. ***Note*** the Die Walkuere DVD has its subtitles for Act III screwed up.

All the problems with it are so minor I hardly noticed.James Morris' Wotan is truly amazing, and Hildegard Behrens, though not perfect, is a decent enough Brunnhilde. But Siegfried Jerusalem as Siegfried troubled me (I think I've been spoiled by Alberto Remedios--listen to the ENO Ring Cycle recording of \\"Siegfried\\" after this and you'll get my point). Matti Salminen is a wonderful Hagen/Fafner, and the music is of course excellent. The voices range from fair to awe-inspiring.

So this production should have appealed to me.Unfortunately, I'm rather disappointed by what I see, as the performance is quite lifeless. I suppose the stage director is to blame, for he has failed to ignite much fire and passion on the stage despite all those high drama inherent to the work.This is not helped by the indifferent acting and singing of the cast. I admire the Met's orchestra, though, who is captured here on top form. Yet, Levine's ponderous musical direction is not at all to my taste.I can therefore only give this set a qualified welcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not entirely satisfactory production","review":"Having viewed the entire DVD several times, I can say that I'm not that satisfied with what I see and hear.It's great to have a production with traditional sets, in particular as we're often nowadays treated to so many stupid productions with all those irrelevant \\"up-dates\\". Unfortunately, the stage direction here is insufficiently lively and often unimaginative, thus making several of the scenes fall flat.On the musical side, there are a number of flaws in the casting with several singers either past their prime or are physically unconvincing in their roles. The orchestra of the Met does a great job, but the effort is marred by Levine's rather stodgy conducting.I think it is still worthy to get this DVD recording. Yet, all those reservations cannot be overlooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"An earth-boung production","review":"It seems that the views as regards this production have been rather polorised. Well, instead of analysing the merits and faults of this production, which other reviewers can evidently do better than I can, I would only say that I'm rather bored when watching this monumental cycle on DVD. The point is that there're very few places in this production where the drama or the music really lifts off. For most of the time, the production remains resolutely earth-bound. The singing and acting are mostly mediocre, and the camera work is quite unimaginative. In fact, I enjoy listening to the Ring cycle on audio CD more than when watching this DVD set. Others may of course have a different view. But for me, I'm more than a little disappointed by what I see and hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unevenly cast in a tepid interpretation","review":"Frankly, I had high hopes for this set before it was released, because I very much prefer a traditional staging of Wagner's great work than those gimmicky productions that we're now accustomed in the opera house.Unfortunately, this set does not live up to expectations. One of the major reasons is that the performances captured here have been very unevely cast. Some of the singers are distinctly below their best and some (like Behrens's Brunnhilde) shouldn't have been singing their roles at all.Another reason for my disappointment arises from the conducting of Levine, which I found to be lethargic and dramatically stunted. The orchestra performed very well, though. But as an interpretation, it lacks fire and drama.The production loses much of its grandeur when viewed through a home TV (unless one has a very large and wide-screen TV set), and the stage direction is merely dutiful. Some of the stage effects are also too much subdued.I'll award this set 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch this one first...","review":"I saw this production in person, and it was a wonderful experience. If you aren't familiar with Wagner's Ring cycle, or you know the music but haven't seen it, this box set is definintely your best bet. It doesn't have any political or artistic agenda - it mostly follows what was called for originally. My impression in the audience was that this is what it would have looked like if you saw Nordic mythology taking place. And Nordic mythology is the ostensible topic of these operas, you can decide for yourself whether you're interested in possible subtexts. None of this is to say that this production doesn't have depth or subtlety, or that it's \\"stodgy.\\" Staging the Ring is a big undertaking, and this was a fantastic realization of that endeavor, with great attention to detail. It's visually very pleasing - and the Ring was meant to be seen as well as heard. Whether or not it's the exact cast that everyone would want, all the performers in this production were world-class."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic and epic Wagnerian voyage......","review":"I remember the first time I watched The Ring Cycle, one of composer Ricard Wagner's best known operas, back at 1990. I was at once stunned and overcome by the great attention to detail and production of this epic presentation. From the time the curtain goes up, and we are introduced to the Rhein Maidens in their glory, to the thrilling conclusion of The Twilight of the Gods, the stage is illuminated in an other-worldly glow, almost as though we have been transported to a different dimension. I won't elaborate on the numerous plot twists. Anyone familiar with The Ring is aware of its \\"novela\\"-esque dramatic complications (everything from incest to hari-kari is covered here). The performances in this production are amazing! Especially notable are Jessye Norman, Siegfried Jerusalem and Hildegaard Behrens. Also, conductor James Levine is at his best. Fantastic.....just keep in mind that The Ring Cycle takes many, many hours. Pace yourself......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting gradually worse as the cycle progresses","review":"I'm afraid this production doesn't making very enjoyable viewing/listening as the performances get gradually worse as the cycle progresses.Rheingold proves to be a promising start, but the tension begins to sag a bit in Walkure. A big decline in performance standards greets the viewer/listener in Siegfried whereas Gotterdammerung provides an anti-climatic end through some lifeless tempos and inadequate singing.I'm OK with the staging but it isn't much help to the performance as a whole. I've no regret buying the set, but I'm indeed quite disappointed by the performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding performance","review":"The production of this Ring cycle is OK for me. It's not very interesting, but it's also true to the spirit of Wagner's work.I'm however disappointed by the performance. I know that there're different views as regards James Levine conducting and I belong to the group who found him disappointing. The speed that he adopts is far too slow and lifeless, which renders the performance a plodding one. The singers are not that outstanding with a few who're below their best, including some in the major roles.I don't think this is a very inspiring and invigorating performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed by the production","review":"I managed to sit through the entire cycle over Christmas. I'm afraid I don't have many positive words to say. I'm not familiar with Wagner's operas and I thought that a production from one of the greatest opera houses of the world might serve as a good introduction. I'm disappointed by what I saw as I found the production to be mostly very boring. Not that it doesn't have any impressive moments. It most certainly has. However, it is not dramatically engaging enough, just like a costume drama which fails to take flight dramatically. The singing is generally OK but the singers don't act that well (fault of the director?). As can be read from the other reviews, I'm sure that some other people can better appreciate this production. Yet, I have to say that I'm not at all impressed by what I see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with Levine's conducting","review":"In my view, that chief drawback of this dvd release lies in the lethargic conducting of Levine. There should be no doubt that the orchestra of the Met gives us playing of enviable standard here. Unfortunately, the music just drags on under the baton of Levine, who often fails to piece the many transitional passages together in a coherent and dramatic manner. His slow tempo also causes much straining on the part of the singers, and in particular Frau Behrens, whose slender and patchy voice cannot adequately cope with Brunnhilde's music. The other cast members are often little more than adequate. Surely not a great performance, which, as I've said, is unhelped by Levine's interpretation. Quite disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoilt by inadequate casting","review":"The chief glory of this Ring, in my view, is the performance of the orchestra of the Met. However, Levine's conducting is at times lethargic.The cast is wildly uneven. The major blot on the set is Hildegard Behrens's unstable and weak Brunnhilde. Some of the cast members are also past their prime. The acting is unremarkable and the production, though loyal to most of Wagner's original instructions, is uninteresting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty decent entertainment","review":"I remember collecting Goosebumps when the first wave came out a decade ago. Ghost Beach was written around the time the series was taking off in popularity, but before it got saturated in merchandise and took a dip in quality. There's nothing goofy about Ghost Beach, it's a straight-forward ghost story with some decent twists here and there. It's also one of the scarier books in the series, along the lines of \\"Welcome to Dead House.\\" Good for some safe scares.I used to get scolded for reading too much Goosebumps and not enough \\"real\\" literature, but it's hard enough to get kids to read these days.

The author constantly tells you to use friends and family who happen to be singers, florists, charterers, artists, etc. If you really feel like you need this book, check the library and save the $15....that's what the book is all about, right, saving money?

Alexander Hamilton supposedly hated the 22nd Amendment even though that Presidential term limits didn't come about until 150 years after his death. Oops. Does anyone really believe a lowly Lt. Colonel can make the arbitrary decision to buy an unvetted weapon for the entire USMC? The utter incompetence of some of the police work the author writes about in this book makes Barney Fife look like a professional investigator in comparison. There's so much more, but it's making my head hurt thinking about it.Maybe some Hollywood producers could believe some of the far-fetched dreck in this book, but you shouldn't. Reich either spent zero time researching or expects everyone to be as ignorant as the ideas and notions he put in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Derivative","review":"Having read and thoroughly enjoyed Christopher Reich's first four books, I waited for \\"The Patriots Club\\" with eager anticipation. I was disappointed to say the least. The story seemed derivative; elements of it could have almost been lifted from the film \\"Enemy of the State\\" and alterned only slightly. And did anybody bother to edit or proofread the text? Throughout the book, the Washington, D.C., suburb of McLean, Virginia is spelled \\"McClean\\". I know, I know, this is a nit: but to me (who grew up in the D.C. area) it also shows either a lack of attention to details, or a lack of caring.

Bolden grew up in foster homes and after a tough childhood worked his way up enjoying a successful Wall Street career. He is also just about Mr. Perfect. All of a sudden he is targeted by a high powered right wing group called The Patriots Club. The Club has existed and evolved since the days of George Washington. According to the author this club, which has included all Presidents,has secretly and behind the scenes determined U.S. policy since the country's inception.

With a plot that is way too cliched to be in the least part believable, far too many characters (none of who I could find any empathy for), and so many different scenes and locations that it's easy to forget where you are, what's going on and why, it's not worth the effort.

In this book Carl has been ordered to eliminate a swedish man who escaped from prison and fled to Russia, he was in jail for spying for that same country (an event the really occured).

I just want my money back now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Greasy and gross!","review":"I decided to try Mary Kay's Extra Emollient Night Cream on my dry feet one night, and I was very turned off by the product. It was greasy and oily, and did not sink into my skin at all. It also had an unpleasant odor. Yuck. I'll definitely not try this product again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works best as eye cream","review":"I have been using this product as an eye cream, and it works great as that. Although it is mostly vaseline (I think?), it is effective and relatively cheap for the purpose. I have not been able to find any other eye cream that's that thick, ever since they discontinued the Almay eye cream, which I used to love. So this is it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"I found a tub of this I'd shoved in the back of a drawer years ago because I thought it was too heavy for my face. I was having trouble with dry, cracked winter skin on my heels and feet, and nothing was working. Out of desperation I dug this out of the drawer, rubbed it on my heels, put on some socks and went to bed. The next morning they felt and looked so much better! With repeated use my feet are well on the way to being beach ready for vacation in a few weeks. It works on hands, too - our grandmothers had it right. Slather this on your hands at night and sleep with a pair of cotton gloves - you'll wake up with your hands so much softer.If the formulation is the same (about the consistency of petroleum jelly), try this on your feet, hands, elbows, knees, etc. I'm so glad I found it on Amazon - I'm almost out and I can't live without this stuff in winter!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb product - but they need to lose the scent..","review":"My mom has used it for like 30 years, she is 78 now and she credits this product as being the reason she has NO WRINKLES ON HER FACE AT ALL. She made me use it for one ridiculously dry elbow I have - and it was like a miracle - totally healed in just a few days. My dog has problems with her ears from being on steroids, so I am also using it to see if it helps the skin to regenerate faster after a bad infection. The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that the smell is VERY STRONG (perfume-ish) and my husband can't be anywhere near it as it gives him an instant headache. And it does get to me too. I'd give anything if they were to make an unscented version! Why does Mary Kay have to perfume things like this????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't live without it!","review":"I have been using the product for more than 30 years. I have used it for a facial night cream, a salve for diaper chapped bottoms on my grandchildren and for rough & dry heals and hands. I love the product and I hope Mary Kay will never discontinue it. I like the fact I can buy it on Amazon and not be bothered with a beauty consultant. It is the only Mary Kay product I now use. I have used all Mary Kay products because I was a Mary Kay Beauty Consultant for many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"All around, a good read!","review":"The Third Force is a horror-meets-sci-fi novel. It was very original with radical new concepts which could only come from the mind of a visionary. All-in-all, The Third Force is a great book, get it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Introduction to the Divine Marquis","review":"I recomend this book to anyone who is interested in the Marquis de Sade. I read it after I'd already read his four major novels, and a biography on him, and still found it a delightful read. The book provides a detailed biography on the Marquis, and covers and discusses indepth the messages the Marquis was trying to get accross in his four major novels, as well as his infamous dialogue \\"Confessions Between a Priest and a Dying Man.\\" The book also briefly touches on famous people who were inspired by de Sade, and how his work continues to effect the modern age. Introducing the Marquis de Sade is brilliantly illustrated with humerous and fun pictorials of the Marquis, people in his life, and scenes from his works. The illustrations often involve scenes of sadomasochism and masturbation, so be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like a comic book than a novel","review":"While this would be a good book for someone who had not previously read about de Sade's life, it probably won't be of much interest for those who are more familiar with him. This book didn't tell me anything I hadn't already read elsewhere, and I could have done without all the drawings. It wasn't the content of the pictures that bothered me, but the fact that most of the time they took up a majority of the page, and in some cases there were only two or three lines of text. I had expected a few illustrations in a more 18th century style, not something that was mostly all pictures drawn in a more comic book style. For those looking for more well researched ways to learn about de Sade and his life, I would recommend \\"Letters From Prison\\", \\"At Home With the Marquis de Sade\\", or \\"Must We Burn Sade\\". In \\"Introducing Marquis de Sade\\" there is definitely some interesting artwork, but there is too much of it in most places, to the point where it distracts from the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"The English Garden, good magizine for Americans","review":"The English Garden is a wonderful gardening magizine for serious gardeners.

Great set of woods. Comes with a 1, 3 and a 3/4 hybrid. Also came with a 5, 7, 9 iron and a decent putter. Only thing missing is a pitching wedge and a sand wedge, but if you're a lefty clubs are dirt cheap so overall this is a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Space Rebellion (Jewel Case)","review":"This is a low grahics game, not what I thought it would be. It's more like the old space invader type games. If you have played Homeworld, Sword of The Stars, or any Star Trex PC games... and like them, you won't like this one. I don't play it, it just takes up space on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing production and performances","review":"I'm disappointed by the production and the performances. While it's a good idea to stage this opera in a naturalistic manner, the stage direction is disappointing, as can be witnessed from the comical episodes involving the Rhinemaidens and the various transformations by Alberich.The cast fails to do justice to Wagner's score. Morris is hampered by bad stage direction all the way and he is less than dramatically vivid. Ludwig is well past her prime, as is the Alberich. In fact, the other roles are not that well taken, too, with the single exception of Jerusalem's Loge. But a good Loge cannot rescue the entire opera. Levine's slow tempo is also a liability even though the orchestra performed well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too ugly to be laughed at....","review":"Wagner's masterful score is well-executed by Levine, if you can ignore the audience, which coughs like it has TB. Visually, this production is atrocious. The Rhine-daughters are about as graceful as three-legged cows and are costumed like cheap mermaid prositutes or fishy spokesmodels for a seafood place. Loge looks like he's wearing Star Trek TNG latex. As he climbs the rock to get the gold, Alberich makes the whole thing wobble like something put together by middle-schoolers for their first production of The Ring. Bad stage direction all around. The only part I think lived up to Wagner's vision was the cool rainbow bridge at the very end, but you can see that by looking at the DVD case. Remind me not to attend the Met. Sounds good but best to watch when blind."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you got this far, you can't stop now......","review":"The final chapter in the Ring Cycle, as done by the Metropolitan Opera conducted by James Levine. This is a fine offering. Of particular highlight is Hildegard Behrens portrayal as the spurned Brunehilde. A surprise was Christa Ludwig's fine performance, not as Fricka, but as a Valkyrie (a role I enjoyed very much). The story itself ties up a lot of loose ends....Also great performance of Siegfried's death march. Definitely worth watching if you've gotten this far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salminen!!!","review":"I don't know about the rest, but man was Matti Salminen something else! He absolutely dominated, looming over (especially) Gunther and the rest. And when he called the vassals together to greet Gunther and Brunhilde, I worried that he would falter because I didn't think that kind of output was humanly possible.I do have to mention that Jerusalem wasn't bad, although the acting seemed exaggerated and forced, much like Behrens' acting. Behrens was okay but she did falter a bit here and there and I am willing to concede that (listening to Karajan's Ring as well) Wagner places a lot of demands on the singers and only Salminen was really up for the challenge, with the rest being adequate. I think I may have to go for Solti where Birgit Nilsson sings Brunhilde. Lastly, Gutrune was okay because her role is not to be a force like Hagen and Brunhilde, but more subtle."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lame effort","review":"The opera is supposed to be the climax of Wagner's Ring cycle. Unfortunately, the performance here is rather inadequate, which detracts from the majesty of the opera.The production is traditional (which is good) but badly directed. The singers are either left with no direction to hang onto, or they are merely able to fill the acting requirements with half-hearted stock gestures. Their singing is unremarkable, in particular Hildegard Behrens's strained Brunnhilde.Levine and his orchestra are quite admirable, although I've heard them on better forms. All in all, it's quite a lame effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"UUUUGGGHHHH AWFUL","review":"Absolutelly agree with GUNTRAM'S review Behrens and Jerusalem should have been at their homes instead of singing this Ring cycle, the same as Levine. He makes no difference while directing Rossini, Wagner or other composer. After I bought the DVD I thought to throw it away, but I kept it just for the small part where sings Chrtista Ludwig who did it absolutelly great. Do not waste your money in this ring cycle.Die Walkure worth for the Jessye Norman's Sieglinde and in the second act Christa Ludwig's Fricka....... Buy the Boulez Ring with the Dame Gwyneth Jones' Brunhilde and there you will see what is a real Bunhilde. It is a Pity that Nilsson never was taped in this role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time-lapsed nature photography is wonderful","review":"I have purchased several nature DVDs and this ranks as one of the best in quality of sound and visual production.If you enjoy time-lapsed photography and its artistic effects on water and sky in particular, you will enjoy this.I could have done without the narrative although it was minimal and only at the beginning of each section. The new-age music was appropriate and well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misdirection in several ways","review":"This is not a scholarly book, nor even a sensationalized potboiler in the tradition of Hans Holzer, Jess Stearn, or the fictional Sidney Redlitch. It's a comic book...and even \\"Dennis the Menace Visits Mexico\\", a twenty-five-cent Super-Giant published around 1960, showed a better understanding and explication of a country and its culture andhistory, and had better art besides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Good LIE","review":"I ordered this book from Hastings because it said it was in VERY GOOD condition.

The only way I can imagine this thing doing what the company says it can do is if someone's shredding pages from the bible; any thicker and you're stuck.Yes, it is cheap. Even if it were cheaper, it'd still be a waste of money.

I have it down to the lowest 'acceptable' resolution for me (1024 x 768) and it is impossible to control anybody or anything. My armies get their butts whupped as I am trying to move around, even SCROLLING is horrible!! I would not waste $5 on this game even in a bargain bin.

I found it was pretty simple to kill the enemy just by taking the airfield and defending it while gradually building up your forces between each wave of attacks by the enemy. It was fun to fight against 3 AI forces but it was easy just to defend the area you start out in while the other 3 forces took each other out,all the while you build up your tanks and call in strikes on the remaining forces repair trucks and missile trucks. I thought the graphics were pretty good but I'm not sure what the standard for RTS games is because i have only played a few.

No, unless you're bitter yourself you don't want to read something so like a bite into a lemon."},{"rating":"1","title":"I laughed until I stopped.","review":"Although I enjoy a bit of mean spirited satire, the author just doesn't seem to know where to leave off a joke. While I did find myself laughing out loud in places, those laughs were few and far between, and the rest of it was a verbal elbow to the ribs.Yes, I get it. You don't like publishers and bad romance novels. You can stop punching that dead nag in the face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naughty, Naughty!","review":"There is truth here. Oh God, is there ever!I laughed a lot while reading this. It stung, but I laughed anyway.If you like to laugh, this may be for you.But if you think the publishing biz is above criticism, if you don't like hypocrisy pointed out, if you are connected with the publishing slash literary industry, then you might want to steer clear of this one. The truth hurts. Ouch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE HORROR! THE HORROR!","review":"This book is gutter slime best avoided.

She has nothing but comtempt for writers, publishers, agents, and most of all, even readers!

Its very misleading at first. Read the fine print. I didnt see anything humorous about this book. If laughing at people who work really hard to write a book, maybe its a bad book, or they are a bad writer, but to make fun of people and new authors, who are at least trying is no joke. No wonder this so called author didn't want to give their real name. SHAME ON YOU! Waste of money, but luckily my kindle had a delete button!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cynical and funny.","review":"If you take things very literal, then avoid this book a all cost.

Imagine a bitter, unpleasant lady getting home from a terrible job that was legitimately difficult, and then what she would want to say, for hours, to get it off her chest. This book is sort of like that, only it costs a dollar.At times funny, it is witheringly negative and self-satisfied. 'Nasty' is appropriately the largest thing in the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"KANDY KID MUSIC!!!!","review":"this cd, like all the rest, are aimed for all the kandy kids in america. all the songs on this cd are 175 bpm (off anabolic frolic website) but..it contains a new style that was not heard at all in ch.4, but in ch.3 TRANCECORE! this cd contains old school and trancecore. i kinda like the old school better, more happier than trancecore. but, to the closed minded person, this cd will appeal to them to be ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"anabolic frolic does it again","review":"this is one of his best works. he has still got all the speed like the rest. 140 and up on bpm's. they are 6 cd's in the whole series and this one is a must have for any hhc fan.even if you dont like hhc, you should still get this cd. it wont be a waste"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Unlike the other reviewers here, I am very disappointed with this album. Now, granted, I am into ultimate cheese. I expect Bonkers every time I purchase a happycore album. This is not it. Strangely, nearly every song starts off slammin, then (in my opinion) takes a nosedive.If you enjoy some good 'ol cheese, do not buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awwwwww...","review":"I think this is probably my least favorite disc in the Happy Hardcore series. Pretty much ever song on here seems very flat and weak/hollow compared to any of the songs on the other cds.As another reviewer pointed out, there is definately not enough \\"cheese\\" on here...its too serious. Even the Scott Brown and Bang! tracks are weak in my opinion...the only reason it gets 2 stars is because it belongs to one of the coolest series of cds ever.Hmmm...its kinda tough to write a review for a cd you dont like. I wil say this...Every once in a while I'll pop it back in to see if it might grow on me, but it always falls way short:( Anyway, if you're want to get into Happy Hardcore get #3 or #6 in the series. Get this one last, if at all, or it may discourage you from buying the rest of 'em."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best hardcore around","review":"this has got to be the worst computer mix of the whole series to this point. he doesnt pick the best mixes of each track and not the best tracks IMO. this was more along the lines of trancier sounding hardcore but not really trancecore. if you're looking for the cheesey happier sounding hardcore anthems then stick to the 1st 3 chapters. there are so many other dj mixes around, you have to wonder why everyone is picking chris as the best dj around. if you're looking for some better new school hardcore check out the blatant beats/next generation mix cd, the bonkers series from the uk or pretty much any mix put out by any one of the UK dj's. search the 'net for more info or just get in touch with me, i'd be glad to help you out.brisk's HHF series is a little bit 'darker' sounding but when it comes to the third disc is the series it turns mainly to uk hardhouse. pick it up if you're looking for something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"celtic agate earrings","review":"they fell apart three times on me and they kept replacing the actual hook for the earring. They look pretty cheap though not as nice as they looked on the site"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare Pieces of RVW","review":"This CD contains some rarely heard, but beautiful peices of music from RVW. All the songs are done with Violin and Piano only. The \\"Lark Ascending\\" and \\"Fantasia on Greensleeve\\" both which are usually played with an orchestra are also done with a violin and piano combo. This was a very interesting and refreshing approach to these two beautiful songs. The only thing I would complain about is that portions of the \\"Lark Ascending\\" was played too hurriedly and could have used more patience. The \\"Six Studies in English Folk Song\\" are very serene and nicely done. In short, I would recommend this CD to all RVW fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection, but author needs a fact checker.","review":"I recommend this collection of epitaphs because they give a fascinating insight into the lives and deaths of past New Englanders. However, on page one of the author's commentary, I was stunned to see her erroneous statement that Benjamin Franklin was a Quaker!Benjamin Franklin was not a Quaker. He was baptized in 1706, at the Old South Church congregation's Cedar Meeting House on downtown Washington Street, Boston. In Philadelphia he occasionally worshiped at Christ Church, the Church of England parish established in colonial Philadelphia in 1695 and later reorganized into the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America.Because of this factual error, I found it difficult to trust the accuracy of the commentary and hence, the author's analysis. But, her collection is most excellent and for that reason, the reader will be rewarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book for my daughter","review":"When my daughter was in collage, she and a friend occasionally wandered through cemeteries to read the epitaphs. This was a perfect birthday book for her. She spent most of the time during her birthday dinner reading to us from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"My dad had knee surgery recently, and we were joking that his epitaph would have to include the fact that he now has a part from a cadaver. I wanted to get him a book of FUNNY epitaphs, and this one is full of the overblown poetry about the nature of death. Which is fine, if that's what you're looking for, but I wanted something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW, I mean... what the heck???","review":"Frat Party is worse than I ever could have imagined. I wasn't exactly expecting top notch acting skills or a complex storyline, but this movie is so utterly pointless and accomplishes absolutely *nothing* that the many, many topless girls is honestly the only reason one could even have in watching it. It's flat out terrible.Don't even try to convince me that the marriage is supposed to be good enough to qualify as a storyline segment because this particular aspect of the movie only takes up a small amount of time. The REST of the storyline is about a young college man walking around campus and hitting on girls. That's it.Truth be told, if this movie fell under the category of a porno instead of a supposed comedy, it'd be more logical. I will admit that I enjoyed the girls. I can't possibly deny that because they were beautiful and plentiful, but come on, that's the only thing Frat Party has going for it, seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just terrible","review":"The movie is poorly done (there are shots that get out of focus more than once) and the acting is terrible. Adriana's character's dad is terrible with, an accent that sounds nothing like an Italian accent. The dialogue is terrible, and the plot is even worse, if one can call that a plot. There is really no use getting into the plot, its just not clever or funny. I would not recommend this movie, it is not entertaining or funny, and I am \\"glad\\" I only rented it on Instant video, I'd never buy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"this movie was great","review":"This movie is great and full of laughs i enjoyed it from start to finsh it was the plot may not be nothing new but the laughs kind a releaf to a bad day"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie I have ever seen.","review":"I am at a loss for words to describe how bad this movie is.

Ideally suited for kids in about grades 4-8 with an interest in castles specifically or medieval life in general. Adults will find it informative and interesting as well, though.Very nicely illustrated throughout. This book is part of a series. Other titles in the \\"The World of...\\" series look at pyramids, pirates, disasters, dinosaurs, horses and ballet. My kids fist came across this book at the library. They enjoyed it so much and it was so inexpensive we decided to purchase it for ourselves when we saw it later at a bookstore.Kids who like this book may also like David Macaulay's Caldecott-winning book titled \\"Castle\\". It too features detailed, albeit black-and-white, cut-away illustrations and diagrams describing the construction of a castle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Level in Christ","review":"Fred is my boy. When I first receive Jesus Christ as my Savior and Lord 10 years ago, the first Christian/Gospel Music my Uncle Chuckie introduced me to was Fred & Commissioned also my boys. God has truly blessed this man with a gift to minister the Word in song. All the songs are about a personal relationship with Christ and as believers we go through different stages of growth in our walk. The first time I listened to this CD I listened briefly to the first 6 songs and knew it was for me. Yes this is different from what Fred usually writes but again I say he is at a New Level in Christ and cannot stay the same. However the songs still celebrate a personal relationship with Christ. The Song that really says is all is \\"Show me Your face.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep God First, who can stop you?","review":"Hi this DeMarcus Brownlee from GA, Fred, you and RFC have done it again, keep up the great outstanding work. I am a big fan since you were with Commissioned, of what you are doing. Keep making those great albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking the Hammond Mystique","review":"Fred Hammond is a unique gift to the Body of Christ. However, I must agree with the comments from Chicago. This project does not measure up to the standard that we're use to with Hammond. I am a rabid fan of Hammonds. In fact it goes beyond fan. His music ministers to me as deeply as the best anointed sermon. God has used His music to carry me during trials, to deepen me in my relationship with Christ, and to give me perspective when the devil tries so hard to confuse me. In my home, in my car and in my office, you'll hear Fred Hammond. With my wife and kids, with family and friends, you'll hear Fred Hammond. So I was disappointed and perplex when I got this CD. Most of the songs sound the same and they seem to lack that unique touch of the Spirit that has become marquee with Hammond. I know that with Fred's music, I have to sometimes give it time for my soul to warm up to it. But I don't believe this project will grow on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"HE RUSHED THIS ONE","review":"THIS ALBUM SOUNDS RUSHED.... LOOKS AS IF HE WAS PRESSED TO HAVE SOMETHING OUT ......

However, I was very disappointed with his latest effort. The album did not evoke any emotion, stir my Spirit, or usher me into the Lord's presence. Fred's vocals seem uninspired and, while I acknowledge the gift God has giving Fred and don't doubt his annointing, this album is not indicative of this. Sorry, but most of these songs wouldn't even be good \\"filler\\" material on his previous albums. I long for, and am praying for the return of the \\"modern-day psalmist.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"These people must not have \\"Pages of Life\\"","review":"I bought this album and gave it away within a week. I am the biggest FRED fan. However, like gregory in the previous writing said, Fred doesn't seem to be into the songs. I thought that he was going to go back to that old school praise and worship, but he didn't! I was soooo upset with Fred. The studio work is poor quality,(and I'm not even musically inclined) and the music was not composed with much thought. There has been no other since Pages of Life and Spirit of David. I hope Fred reads this. WE need you Fred!! I'll still support you! However, I suggest that people listen to the songs b4 buying the CD. Sorry Fred."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply AWESOME!","review":"Fred Hammond is a worshipper!

Excellent CD especially cut number 5,9,and 14 buy it its worth a trip to the record store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fred Hammond","review":"If you want to grow spiritually and you like contemporary gospel, then you want to listen to Fred Hammond. From the very beginning Fred Hammond and Commissioned introduced to the world the best form of contemporary gospel available.

Check out all of his music and also check out all of Commissioned's music as well! I am sure that you will grow spiritually and that you will be encouraged."},{"rating":"2","title":"RELATIONSHIP!!!

As i've matured in my relationship with God, Fred has the ability to express feelings toward got that I can not quite articulate on my own, so I use him albums because they truly speak the sentiment of my heart.

The anointing is all over this cd. Songs like You are My Daily Bread, Lord of the Harvest, Great and My, My, My God is Good get my praise and worship sessions going. Other songs like Praise Him Through the Night and When It Gets Down To It remind me that through whatever trial or tribulation I'm going though, God is there offering his grace and continuous mercy to me. I encourage everyone who loves good music and the Lord to buy this album, don't bootleg it either. Let the music industry see that Gospel music is worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Totally Amazing!","review":"It's amazing how God allows Fred Hammond to continue to bless His people with wonderful \\"Word-filled\\" music. Pages of Life 1&2 will always be a classic, but POL 3 is right up there with it. Fred continued the Gospel funk with the first 2 tracks, and he still found a way to bring it all home with #9, \\"Praise Him through the Night.\\" The whole album is filled with words of inspiration and love. Everyone who listens to this will truely find themselves \\"Speaking Those Things.\\" Fred, thank you for allowing God to continue to pour into your life. Yet, you remained obedient and shared that with the rest of the world. Continue to be a blessing to the body of Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD IS OFF THE CHAINS!!!","review":"Fred is truly going from Glory to Glory, he is an Anointed Psalmist for such a time as this!

To sum it all up, He is \\"Great\\"! To all the Fred Haters, I really do pray for you.

Got worried it might rub onto my clothing. It did. I wore a black shirt that night and it did get onto the shirt. Maybe this would work better with short hair that wouldn't be hanging on clothing.

Uses of cliches were given as wrong answers. BUT THESE ARE NOT WRONG. To use a cliche is neither wrong grammatically nor wrong semantically, yet it was listed as wrong because it is a cliche. Second, in one question on p. 56, the choice which explains what a carnivorous plant is, is marked as wrong.

It is a satire of the English which employs an historicalperspective in a unique way. The narration employs social history using the form of a patriarch's memoir to his descendants. Full of admonitions and asides about inheritance, or the lack thereof, Bonfiglioli raises the non sequitor to an art form and re-creates the world of 19th century England and its mercantile destiny. His sense of character, the pacing of his narrative, all make for wonderful reading. In fact, one can read him too fast- it is necessary to re read to fully appreciate his humour and insights. And re-reading is perhaps more rewarding than one's first impression of this original writer. This is a book which proves hard bindings aren't obsolete ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I cannot stand the taste of this \\"cinnamon\\".

I don't think Canetti succeeded in proving his notion that Kafka's landmark novel The Trial is a fictionalized representation of his oddly doomed relationship with Felice, but he does point out several interesting parallels which can enhance your enjoyment of Joseph K's misadventures. The real value of Canetti's book is, in my opinion, the fact that it will probably inspire you to read Kafka's own diaries and the actual letters to Felice themselves, and probably with a greater appreciation as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good points, but not great","review":"Geyer makes some good points, but overall her book comes across as an anti-immigrant diatribe.

The maps are poor and the descriptions of battles mainly involve boring lists of names and platoons of the relevant platoons, companies etc. To summarize: great topic, great research, poor maps and above all, very boring presentation.

The episodes are poorly written, lack content and engaging plot and the 'interactive' parts like phone calls and email seem more like a gimmick than a way to blend real life with the game. The puzzles are way too easy, there is not enough to do, there is no way to change the outcome of events through your own actions (ie the plot is painfully linear to the point of stupidity), and *way* too much time is spent waiting for no apparent reason.

Unfortunately, he was hamstrung at every turn in his career by the institutionalized paper pushers. If only the USA would unleash these types of guys and let them go to town, allowing them to do their job, there would be far fewer islamo-fascists running around the globe today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding, riveting!","review":"This is an excellent book that describes how bureaucracy and politics (foisted by the Clinton administration) has infected and destroyed the CIA, and why we hadn't a clue before the WTC disasters. Author, Baer, was a field agent and seems to have taken pride in the job, but served under a succession of career bureaucrats who were primarily interested in making sure reports were filed on time, with very little concern regarding their content. He was one of a small handful of agents who spoke Arabic, and wasn't afraid to travel, therby putting himself in personal danger in performance of his duties. Really good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very interesting tour of the worst places in the world","review":"A very interesting tour of the worst places in the world.Regarding the decline of the CIA, I found it not unlike the the stories of corporations like GM, Sony, and Microsoft that grew massive and lost then lost the \\"eye of the tiger\\", opening themselves up to being taken by surprise by an underestimated force.Regarding terror, Baer's work in the Middle East through the 80s and 90s put the 9/11 attacks in perspective as an escalation of a rising tide of Islamic fundamentalist violence.I was particularly shocked at Iran's role in fostering international terror. It seemed that plot after terrorist plot led back to Iranian intelligence services, to the extent that Saddam's desperate dictatorship of Iraq seemed almost benign by comparison. The brief history of Iranian involvement in terrorism that is contained in this book affected how I think about current events regarding Iran."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Equal!","review":"This book chronicles much of the career of Robert Baer during his tenure at the CIA.

Baer is an excellent story teller, and is spot on when it comes to how government operates... regarding both risk averse management in the field as well as those in Washington who are too concerned about politics and/or \\"drinking and whoring\\" to comprehend what's truly unfolding beyond our borders. The truth can be ugly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Even Finish It","review":"I am not up on politics, so maybe that is why I had such a hard time with this book. It reads more like a report to headquarters than anything. It skips around a lot, too, which made it difficult for me to follow.The subject matter is so interesting that you'd think you wouldn't be able to put it down, but as it turned out, I had to force myself to continue. About halfway through, I gave up.The author has had an incredible life, and what I did manage to get through really opened my eyes to a lot of things. You might like this book more than I did, especially if you are already familiar with middle eastern politics.I think it could have been an excellent book had the author co-written it with an experienced writer instead of trying to do it himself. To sum up, the subject matter is great, but the way it is written makes what should be a thrilling read, slow and confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"See no Evil","review":"The arthur was obviously connected to the CIA and had acurate knowledge of events that were well documented. The problem I had with the book was the arthur never seemed to have been directly involved in any of the events himself. He did however have an opinion of the events leading up to the 911 attacks and why the CIA failed to recognize the threats. Overall a good read about true facts of the decline in federal policy that overlooked the worst terroristic attack in US history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Credibility...","review":"While Robert Baer's recollections and analysis can occasionally be interesting, he's not always very insightful. Here's The New Yorker's Seymour Hersh, quoting Baer, a little more than one week before the Saddam's downfall and Baghdad's liberation:\\"Robert Baer, a former C.I.A. Middle East operative, told me in a telephone call from Jordan, \\"Everybody wants to fight. The whole nation of Iraq is fighting to defend Iraq. Not Saddam. They've been given the high sign, and we are courting disaster. If we take fifty or sixty casualties a day and they die by the thousands, they're still winning. It's a jihad, and it's a good thing to die. This is no longer a secular war.\\" There were press reports of mujahideen arriving from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Algeria for \\"martyrdom operations.\\"\\"Or not. And it puts a bit of a dent in Baer's credibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read, Won't Change a Thing","review":"I really enjoyed this remarkable book. Baer is someone we can all admire as a man who took risks, put himself in danger on numerous occasions, reported accurately to his superiors, but was ignored by burecratic place-holders, people more interested in their jobs as sinecures rather than acting on information generated by agents on the ground.As a pure adventure story, this book is without peer. It should be read as such. However, as an expose by a retired CIA officer it will do little to change the culture of complacency within that organization. Read it for the sheer adventure of it, but heads won't roll because of it, nor will policy change in a meaningful way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Behind the mask","review":"As the author relates his work in the CIA from the early seventies when the American people started challenging our government's role in world politics, to today's even more chaotic world, he's revealed an agency frought with ineptitude and inefficiency. As one of the grunts on the ground, working clandestinely, he's watched in alarm as the effectiveness of the agency has gone from a stellar one gathering behind the scenes information to being a hand-tied-behind-their-backs (dis)organization. It's a fascinating read through the eyes and ears of one who's worked some of the most dangerous parts of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!

It is about Detainee Operations inside Afghanistan."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important book!","review":"\\"See No Evil\\" is not just a worthwhile read, but an important one for anyone interested in getting what I think is an objective look at what America has on its hands in confronting Islamic terrorism. The author, ex-CIA field agent, Bob Baer, has been in so many of the key geographical locations which are central to it, and displays a passion to understand it, carefully distinguishing actual facts from his subjective attempts to piece things together, but his thoughts indeed seem reasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Road To Self Defeat","review":"Robert Baer's account illustrates how American intelligence gathering capability was decapitated by bureaocrats and politicians. The author paints a vivid picture of work in the field as humint (human intelligence)was relegated to the back bench. Our enemies could not have done better than our own political establishment in neutralising the CIA. This book tells it all.Kingmaker"},{"rating":"1","title":"let down","review":"I'm surprised at the large number of favorable reviews. I was very excited to read this book from the description but ended up disappointed. It started out great - describing what it was like to join the CIA and the training etc. Then it begins to get dense with names and details and the bigger picture gets obscured.There is a whole lot of complaining in the book and when I read a book like this I must always remember that hindsight is 20/20. It is very easy to criticize decisions in the past when the outcomes have already been determined. Nonetheless, the author does present some valid overarching criticisms of the CIA and I'm sure the CIA would do well to heed them.The author does not give a lot of historical context to his situations and I think that hurts the quality of this work.Unless you are a die-hard CIA enthusiast, you may want to pass on this one. There are other better books that expose the CIA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling","review":"I was motivated to write this review (my first) because the last chapter was so bad.

He provides a gripping account describing the various assignments of his career which ultimately leads to Iraq. The book seems to accurately describe life as a CIA Officer. It describes the many ways the US government and the CIA, in particular, bungles delicate missions. The short-sightedness of the US government, as portrayed, is convincing enough to leave one with a sense of wonder at how we've managed any successes to date. One can only hope the CIA and our government has changed it's ways since the 90's but it's doubtful.

I proudly voted for GWB in 2000....but find it both interesting and sad that Mr Baer knew right away that Ahmad Chalabi was a fraud and fake, while someone in the the Bush administration or Pentagon fed Chalabi sensitive info that made it back to Iran.Baer's book is two sides of the same coin: on the one hand, it makes one sad that the CIA is so fouled up (or at least was while he worked there and likely has not markedly improved). On the other hand, knowing that there are patriots like Baer bright enough to recognize this and patriotic enough to want to make a difference, better days could yet be ahead for the CIA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Specific and Insightful Information...","review":"Baer's book is a must read if you wish to get up to speed on the problems the intelligence agencies in the USA have faced over the past 10 years (and especially during the Clinton era). Tales of political correctness and limited human resources are told repeatedly in Baer's book. His frustration with the declining abilities of the CIA are palpable and troubling for any reader who lives in the United States.

I just have a hard time enjoying music mixed/made by people who are just jumping the bandwagon and have no real passion for electronic music. Don't think this is a stab im taking at the genre itself.

I'm not through reading this yet but I almost don't want to finish it because I want to be able to keep on reading it. I plan on referring to this book as a guide through out my spiritual journey. If youre still deciding whether or not to purchase this book, do so. Buy two and give the second one to someone as a gift. Thank you Kathleen McDonald."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book :)","review":"Excellent guide book for meditation beginners. Really good analytical meditations and to many practical techniques - all of them great. Truly recommend :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Helpful","review":"I was suffering from an anxiety disorder and was looking for a way to help me that didn't involve medication. I knew almost nothing about meditation but have been extremely pleased with the teachings of the book. I feel calmer, more at peace, and have really taken a strong look at my personal beliefs.I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to learn about meditation and all that is has to offer!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Offers Practical Advice for Beginners","review":"This book showed me the basic way to meditate. Makes meditating a natural task and you aren't pressured to think about certain things, but just to simply gain inner peace. It threw me off a little when asking you to meditate on certain chakras or buddhist gods, but this is dependent upon how deep you are into the Buddhist practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken when arrived","review":"The watch was broken when it arrived.

Adam is interesting, the two \\"heroes\\" are not. The good doctor has some interesting points, but rather than expand upon them the author sort of drifts about between the monster and the doctor telling their tale intersprsed with the action. Thus the book starts out in third person, goes to first, then back to third, and then back to first, then back to third. It makes for disjointed reading. The 2 necromancers are boring. This book is not distinctive enough to set it apart from its source material. Mordenhiem is not particularly evil either, he is more indifferent than he is evil. His biggest crime is being self absorbed. Check out the original tale, skip this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"This is a great variety pack, I bought it to experiment with the mats.

Barry has written many exciting and beautiful film scores over the past four decades. But the best of Barry's compositions have been recorded and released on CDs many, many times. Few film-score composer hit a home run every time. This CD has a consistent collection of strike outs. Sure there are snatches here and there of Barry at his best, but waiting for them to flash by your ears is not worth it (and you are likely to doze off and miss them entirely!). The art work on the CD booklet features a list of CD credits in a spiral of small print. The spiral design matches the music presented. The credits are hard to read without being put off. The music is hard to listen to without being turned off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I ordered these and two days later they just cancelled my order.

Not only does it discuss the ships themselves based on archaeological evidence (such as frescos), it also discusses the implications on society of the frescos. Although the section on laws of the sea is short, it's forgivable based on the lack of information, and the author does go into detail on the few laws that are known. I'd say it's a comprehensive and exceptionally useful text for anyone studying Bronze Age seafaring civilizations."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 7 year old daughter loves it!","review":"since getting it for her birthday, my daughter has not stopped fluttering around the house. she takes all of her stuffed animals and pretends that they are all in an enchanted forest. she loves the pretty music that her fairy wings make when she runs around. the wand, tiara and bracelets seem to make her really feel like a fairy. i love seeing her use her imagination with this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary and Jesus","review":"A lovely book in all regards. The color illustrations are wonderful. From the DJ: \\"Bodker has written a very human Nativity story, seen from the perspective of Mary, a young woman who has never been far beyond the confines of her small village. The book follows Mary's son Jesus until he is old enough to begin work in his father's carpentry shop.

In this book, she gives us a first hand look at her life, how she has gone about creating awareness in her life and how it has enabled her to be authentic. Her courage in telling her story, asking questions of her readers and supporting them gives the reader courage and a way to go on an awareness journey of their own.Dawna's earlier works gave very valuable insight about how each of us learns. This work gives insight about how each of us lives, using some of her life experiencs to illustrate the points and asking questions for us to ponder about how we are living our lives. She asks the questions in a very supportive way. With the insight provided by this book and the addition of our own passion and courage, Dawna's newest book, is an excellent guide for enriching life's journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Advertised","review":"Make no mistake - this book is about one thing: Dawna Markova. Based on the title and sub-title anyone would think this is a self-help book about reclaiming purpose and passion. Who wouldn't think that by looking at the title? It is nothing of the sort. This book is a memoir - nothing more, nothing less. It is interesting for what it is. Just understand that what it is - is not as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely, amazing, inspiring book...","review":"There is so much to say about this beautiful and beautifully written book...

Maria Taylor being half of Azure Ray, naturally I would check this album out. Fortunately, Maria didn't decide to do something crazy and way different from Azure Ray. If she did, it might still have been good but it wouldn't have been this, which would have been a shame, for this is one heck of an album. The high-light being Speak Easy, which could easily be used for a song on a commercial, don't ask me why, it just sounds like a song the type of song you'd hear on a commercial and you'd wonder, \\"who sings that song? I have to hear it again!\\". Anyway, if you have heard of Azure Ray and love them, I'm sure you'll definitely enjoy this album. If you haven't heard of Azure Ray, I can still assure you you'll find something on this album to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The man behind the bookstore that launched 1000 poets!","review":"What can you say to a young person who wants to write?

I was basically housebound and a captive audience. This book was cliche, long-winded, and depressing. The only reason I didn't put it down after the first 50 pages was there was basically nothing else for me to do. So I read on, and on... There are too many characters, too may side stories--all boring, too many plots that go nowhere. The only single character that is fleshed out is Susan, the writer. I imagine Rona Jaffee put something of herself into that portrayal. Other than that the Hollywood producer with an anorexic wife and a lover on the side--it was like a bad Lifetime movie. Yuck! Don't waste your time!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It remindes my love story","review":"The story came into my bones. So romantic, in a way I felt just like Susan, independent but romantic.

The characters (far too many, even for a well written book, which this is not) are unbelievable shallow and have the emotional reaction time of a sloth on Rufinol.

This is so insane it's funny.Very disappointing overall.If they did show you the actual footage from the whole concert this would be AWESOME.I'm sorry to say it isn't.All you get is about 10 or 15 minutes of actual footage.Whoever made this should be ashamed of themselves.I gave it 2 stars because I love Emerson ,Lake and Palmer.Go for'Master's from the Vault's 'instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I can't say enough bad things about this video.

As mentioned in the other review, we watch ridiculous boat races to the music. The only thing that keeps me from getting rid of this DVD is the final performance of Rondo,in sinc and in real time which is is where they get all the slow-motion clips they use in the rest of the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"Theres around 5% of the video footage from the concert used for this DVD.

The players tell why the '64 team was so close and so successful, and it is interesting to see what happended to the players since then -- especially since few made a lifetime's worth of money in their playing days like today's players do -- these guys actually had to go out and get a job and a career when they retired from football. Maybe that's why these great players are remembered so fondly -- they were just like us expect they could take the field for us on Sundays too. Fond memories for Browns fans who miss their heroes on Sundays, and a good book for general football fans who want to know what made a great team click."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful as an overview, but...","review":"This book is useful as a quick overview of the OpenGL API, but fails to teach the fundementals of graphics programming necessary to apply the API to real-world problems. Also, it appears that Michael Sweet was brought on board to \\"write\\" the second edition. Where Wright stresses OpenGL's platform independence, Sweet ignores this thread of the book and writes code that is tightly linked with the Windows API.Anyone looking to learn OpenGL should stick to the college texts, such as F.S. Hill's Computer Graphics Using OpenGL. These books are reviewed by CS professors who use the books in their classrooms, and as such only the good ones make it to print."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for learning and using OpenGL","review":"Probably one of the best books out there for learning and using OpenGL. I have all of the OpenGL books from the OpenGL ARB, and the SuperBible is the one I find myself referring to the most. Nice examples, good sumarrys (summaries?), and adequate examination of the details without delving too much into esoteric topics. If you want to learn and use OpenGL, buy this book. If you want all of the ins and outs of OpenGL, buy the orange and red books from the ARB as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Mistakes","review":"Although this book gives a pretty thorough tutorial in OpenGL, and readers may learn something from looking at the examples, the author and editor should have worked out a number of things before releasing the book. First of all, after stating that \\"Calculating the frames per second... is about as simple as math gets for 3D graphics,\\" he defines fps as \\"Time in seconds / number of frames,\\" which would be seconds per frame, not frames per second. Second of all, when writing a book on graphics, the illustrations used in the book should at least be geometrically correct. Yet the illustrations in this book there are multiple places where an illustration shows lines that should be parallel, but instead are skewed and intersect. The concepts covered throughout the book are useful, but with all the typos and errors, waiting for the next edition may be the best option."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd a mash up the entire world fi real","review":"Yo it only took 2 tracks to show me this was the wickedest cd to ever hit the streets.

I never did get a tech support person to speak to and decided that my time was better spent elsewhere.Call M-Audio on their pre-purchase support line in ADVANCE and ask them about this issue if its something which you think might be of importance to your purchase or use of the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not feeling it","review":"I have used thes before however I am not really into this.

The pedal itself slides back and forth in its casing, and when mine slides to the left, it cuts my sustain off. Poor construction. Huge disappointment. Never had a problem with a piece of gear in 18 years until now. PLEASE don't put gear out unless it can withstand the rigors of performance! Again, I like M Audio just fine and am sorry to bag on them, but this product is a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"defect","review":"I am on my second M-audio sustain pedal, as the first one failed due to wiring defects. It works decently, however the pedal slides when i'm playing and I find this to be very annoying. No matter the surface i have under it, whether it is a rug or hardwood flooring, the pedal will just slide back until i can no longer reach it. I think the problem may have something to due with the weight distribution since the bottom surface it rubber but i'm not exactly sure. I would not recommend this product due to this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"works great until it breaks","review":"All I can say is its a fine pedal in my experience for a year of heavy use, but after that it starts to bust. The pedal starts slipping from side to side in its groove and only works if I push it all the way to one side. I have gone through about 4 of these in the past 4 years, thinking that the breaking is always a fluke because so many Amazon customers seem to love it. I'm finally giving up, its not a super solid pedal that will last for professional amount of usage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought 3 of these in a row... all junk","review":"I am shocked by all the positive reviews on here.

I thought it was an amazing deal to get a pedal like this that felt so sturdy. Unfortunately, within 6 months, the pedal started giving me problems, triggering sporadically and unpredictably. With no noticeable flaws, I opened it up to see what was wrong and discovered the issue. The casing of the pedal had been improperly clamped down onto the wire, splitting the protective plastic coating. I tried unsuccessfully to repair the wire and eventually just gave up on. I know anyone with decent soldering skills could have saved this pedal, but I saved myself the time and effort and bought a cheap $5 \\"sewing machine\\" pedal from Radio Shack that has worked perfectly for the last few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I've really liked having this pedal.

So it's more like a guitar pedal than a piano one. But again, expensive electric pianos come with their own pedals. This one I bought to be used on a cheap Casio keyboard from Costco. So I didn't expect it to work like a real piano pedal to begin with. Considering the price, this pedal is rock solid and works way beyond my expectation. Great piece of work. Thanks M-Audio!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pedal","review":"I purchased a Yamaha P85 one year ago and was very pleased with the performance for such a small inexpensive piano, except for the pedal which was a joke.

Then I cut out the trace and placed the pedal in it and BAM !!!!No More Pedal Slip because, the other 10 inchs of the cardboard has my foot on it !

I would buy it again without a second thought. It's never given me any issues and feels pretty much like a real piano lever.The only complaint I have is it is a bit long. I just moved my keyboard next to a baseboard heater so there is not really room for where I want the pedal to be unless its at a slight angle. Even then I could move the keyboard an inch away but honestly I don't even notice once I am playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice","review":"Got my pedal today.

Easy to place, install, maneuver, and use. I'm not sure what else there is to review about it, it just does the job.

Very good product for the price, I see it lasting for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great...if you have the room under your keyboard","review":"I had been using the 'pedal' which came with the keyboard for the Privia px-100 keyboard which is nothing like a pedal on a normal piano. I purchased the M-Audio pedal to replace it.At first I was thrilled with this pedal, but when I bought a stand for my digital piano I discovered a problem. This pedal is very long, 10.5\\". With the stand against the wall there was no room to push the pedal far enough back to place into a normal playing position. I had to move the stand about 8 inches from the wall to put the pedal into place.Before buying just beware of how you have/want to arrange your keyboard and be sure you'll have the room to use the pedal comfortably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pedal at a Great price","review":"I recently bought two of these for our church keyboardists. They have held up very well over the past three months and do exactly what they are supposed to do. The polarity switch on the bottom is a huge plus since we have two different brands of keyboards that require opposite polarity from each other. With this pedal, just flip the switch and you're good to go - no jumping through menus or rewiring pedals.The quality of construction is completely adequate. It is a plastic housing with a metal pedal, but the plastic is the good stuff and it appears as if it will give several years of good service. Can't be beat for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better!","review":"This pedal is much more real feeling than the pedal that came with my Yamaha keyboard.

Ever","review":"I own a Roland RS-9 and a KORG PS-100 and it works great with both keyboards.What Im particularly impressed is that is made of hard plastic, so is not like your average cheap pedals that comes with your brand new keyboard and also, if you really like to take care of your stuff. This pedal comes with a hard white plastic over the pedal so you wont scratch the pedal itselt.If you are looking for a sustain pedal, this is the best money you'll ever spend.In a music store these run for about $30 on amazon they are half the price.This has a 10 in my book!!RAY ST JOHN"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price, great product","review":"This pedal was the cheapest I could find at the time for piano-style sustain pedals and I have been very happy with it.

I've used this sustain pedal, their foot pedal and controllor pedal. Seems like the sustain pedals go bad for me within a year. But I'm a full time musician and work 360+ gig's a year, so the pedal's get a lot of use. I've bought the extended warranty which is 2 years, so I've never had any problem getting a new one.I think they could use some heavy duty cables, that may help, but as a keyboard player, I think if manufactures would use angle plugs, that would prolong the life of the cable.All in all, it's a good sustain pedal and I like the size, well constructed on the bottom for stability"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it is advertised to be.","review":"I bought this cd on the basis that it lists Robert Merrill as the main performer.

The mixes in this collection have the yeast in the flour, not packaged separately. The bread failed to rise at all. Why would they package the yeast separately in the single mixes and not in the multi packs? Along with the Heartland Collection I also purchased the Baker's Choice Collection. I am throwing them all out. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"bread","review":"The bread has a good taste but does not rise properly and only makes 1/2 loaf.

This toothbrush really makes my teeth feel clean without the terrible hard scrubbing from before. It holds a charge long enough to get me at least through a week (I used to travel a lot for work), which is so helpful.

Unfortunately, the content is very lacking.Their UI testing chapter was limited to a discussion of various tools that allow you to test-run the actual GUI, but was bereft of patterns like MVP/MVC that exist for the purpose of UI testing.IoC was virtually if not literally unmentioned.The mocking chapter was very very light, and mentioned Rhino only in one of those side boxes, not as actual content in the book (!!)This is one of those books that will give beginners a false sense that unit testing is easy, who then wind up making a mess in a real-world project.And as noted by other reviewers, the book was written in insufferably chatty prose, which somehow only added up to 190 pagesI'm just starting the Osherove, and it seems outstanding so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get better your code!!!","review":"This is a good book for devs who wants to improve their code and make it more safer.

What I can't understand is, if they insisted on making these Guess Who reissues \\"twofers,\\" why couldn't they have paired them in some semblance of chronological order? Why put ARTIFICIAL PARADISE together with WHEATFIELD SOUL, an album recorded four years earlier with marked difference in the group's sound and personnel? The scattershot approach taken to these Guess Who reissues isn't a mortal sin, but sure makes you wonder how seriously the label takes the band's recorded legacy. Ah, well, at least ARTIFICIAL PARADISE finally made it onto CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another CD that only works in some players","review":"The CD wouldn't work right in 4 out of 5 CD players due to some kind of funky copy guard on the last few tracks as the manufacture says (BMG). Started to listen in my office but it messed up, thought I would listen to it on the way home but the same problem in my vehicle CD player. Worked on My living room CD player, But by the time I was done I was so pissed I really couldn't enjoy it the way I wanted. So it really made this a bad listening experience. Also the same thing happened to a Rolling Stones Exile on Main Street CD after buying music all these years (since the early seventies) and now not being able to enjoy the music on my own terms this is the last CD I will ever buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"strange combinations....","review":"First of all, I think a lot of the Guess Who's early stuff (eg. Randy Bachman era) is overrated - they were very inconsistent, having some great songs and then some other stuff that seems very dated and misguided now.But as far as these repackages, it's easy to see why they pair up completely unrelated albums - because otherwise they'd never sell the lesser ones. While a lot of people might want \\"Wheatfield Soul\\", I doubt there's a huge demand for \\"Artificial Paradise\\". The same can be said for the other duo packages: winners: \\"Rockin' and \\"So Long Bannatyne\\"; losers: \\"#10\\" and \\"Flavours\\".Basically, Kurt Winter's departure was the end of The Guess Who and the subsequent albums are yawners."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"If you played straight rock and pop in the late 1960s, you landed in the mid-1970s in pretty good shape. The Guess Who did one very compelling psychedelic experiment, \\"Friend's Of Mine,\\" onWheatfield Soul. Other than this they worked the continuum of rock and roll and high end pop--write good songs and sing and play them well.Which is why Flavours works: the times may have changed between the Guess Who's start in 1968 and this 1974 album, but except for dropping some fuzz and wha wha on their guitars and a few trippy mannerisms, the Guess Who's sound didn't shift much.Most of Flavours is well-written, piano based rock, with interesting turns and twists and Burton Cumming's amazing singing. The half spoken, hard rock \\"Dirty\\" is the one exception--good but it really doesn't fit the album.There is no big hit like \\"American Woman,\\" and no track with a killer hook like \\"Undone,\\" but this is still brilliantly made, enjoyable work by one of the era's most underrated bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item description does not match what you receive","review":"I was really disappointed in what I received with this product.

The 36\\" size is perfect since most of my patterns are approximately that width. This means I roll out the length I need and trace. No taping pieces together!The paper is whiter that traditional pattern tissue but it's still transparent enough to see through. I was able to see all the markings without difficulty.It's sturdier than regular tissue, so I've been able to use masking tape to hold it down while tracing without tearing the paper when I remove it.Overall, I feel like I'm getting a lot of value from this paper and will definitely order again when I run out."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is spot on.","review":"I traveled to Guatemala for two weeks in the summer of 2005 and used Lonely Planet the entire time.

I thought that the foward that she wrote was very incredulious and, with the fact that she is one of the people that are suing the parents of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, somewhat two-faced.I thought that this was a very underpar book and I would not recomment it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AP Psychology Review","review":"This book was very interesting and helpful. While reading this book, I was moved by all the different stories each patient had to tell. The different stories and event were the most interesting part of this book. It was helpful the way Shaw, the author, related each story to each other, it was easy to see the common thread they all shared. Shaw developed this parents guide because he felt that most of the time, these violent children were acting out against hardships their parents had placed on them. It contains advice, commandments and guidelines every parent should know. The most emotional part is contained in the forward.

They felt alienated, isolated, not loved, were bullied at home by a parent, received no parental support with their anger management and had easy access to drugs and guns. They tell the author what they think is needed in todays society to stop the rage. The author James Shaw writes that parents have to get back into the \\"drivers seat\\".

I would rather have my money back and I think my exploration of Hentai is at an end.However if any one is interested in seeing a beautiful and extremely healthy depiction of Japanese School girl life and how it relates to changing mores ( or recapturing dissappearing values ) I strongly recommend Ghibli Studios \\"Only Yesterday \\".

That in itself is unusual, because sadly, anime commercials nearly always fail to sell their product. This one looked a little quirkey, a little rude, and a bit on the fast-paced side, so I took a chance on it. I am glad I did. Disgaea is a fun series, full of demons who aren't quite as bad as they might be, angels and heros who aren't as good as they should be, and worlds we all can relate to. The story is nothing new, but the presentation is well done and the tale is a good one. If you like sarcastic comedy with anti-heros and anti-villians mixing it up for the sake of their own views and goals, Disgaea will entertain you."},{"rating":"2","title":"disgaea anime review","review":"This is simply a collection of the three/3 disgaea dvd's in one package. So don't expect more. Do the math. Three individual dvd's @ 100 minutes apiece. One complete series 300 minutes. It's definitely kid oriented ... well, 99%(Jennifer). One thing i did like was how the subtitles for the opening credits would alternate between English and Japaneses. Commentaries from series creator, & the one of the voice actors. The story made itself different enough from the game to keep me interested. My only complaint with the story was the never gave closure to the one episode. Who or what was that person really, & what was Mid-boss's connection? A second season would be nice. This is definitely a buy for anyone who is a fan, or just couldn't get into the game, & wanted to finish up the story. The game's advantage is different endings. Now that's a thought for dvd/blu-ray. Imagine as special feature home viewing you could choose how the story could progress, & perhaps end ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intensely entertaining!","review":"Hill is a wonderful writer, and this series just gets better and better.

I gave this book only a 2.5 star because I didn't like Indigo throughout over three quarters of the book. I thought she was a very self centered and spoiled little girl and emotionally immature. She wanted everything for her and in her own way with no giving at all on her part... until just the last few pages of the book (when she 'even' realized how selfish she was) and it was a long book. I really liked Jake, he was the giving and understanding one (without him, this book would have gone in the crapper) he kept putting up with Indigo's whinny crap (he had the patience of Job) where I just wanted to smack her and tell her to grow up!!

He is at his best, however, when he is interacting with the live audience-where his acerbic wit really shines. My only complaints are a latter tendency toward blue material (according to the reviews) and too much repetition of material- hence 4 stars instead of 5. Even so, I thoroughly enjoy every CD I have of Tim's and heartily sing his praises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Tim's best work","review":"I could be wrong is a funny tune, but the rest of the songs aren't.

This recording, made shortly after that fabled night, presents us with the opportunity to hear a youthful Sutherland launching that starship. \\"Lucia di Lammermoor,\\" easily Donizetti's best known opus today, was relatively unknown by the post-war audience. Though there were a few sopranos who could sing the role, the demands of the cast were such that it had fallen out of the more familiar repertory.This recording does not disappoint. Sutherland's performance is simply breathtaking. The supporting cast is more than adequate. Margreta Elkins, a fine mezzo soprano, compliments Sutherland's voice quite nicely.Sutherland went on to make two studio recordings of this opera which are arguably better. This recording, however, captures that moment in history, and the results are electric.

If you've listened to Lost and Found before, you may realize that Something is very similar to THIS, not in the songs, but in the arrangement. The second song (\\"Convinced\\") is played, a line at a time, as interludes during the entire CD, just as \\"Remember Me\\" is in THIS. Something was recorded in a studio, so it doesn't have that fresh, raw sound like the Speedwood albums, but it is definitely NOT a dissapointment. It features 11 brand-new songs, 2 previously recorded songs (\\"Hearts\\" and \\"Ground\\"), and one old but popular hymn, played and sung in the classic \\"speedwood\\" style (\\"Holy, Holy, Holy\\"). As a very big fan of Lost and Found, I think this CD, along with all of the others, is great in both the music and the message behind it all. The message is, and always will be, \\"God has spoken a Word of Love whose name is Jesus.\\" Please enjoy this CD, and enjoy Lost and Found, because they are the only ones like them."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOBODY DOES IT BETTER","review":"Everything these guys do is AWESOME!

The \\"author's\\" contempt for the subject apprears to have prevented her from actually doing any research on the topic. This author clearly knows nothing about the topic of her book. This is an insult to all readers. What a shame! What a waste! The author ought to be ashamed of herself. This book does not even deserve one star (how about negative five stars)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst piece of literature I have ever read","review":"I am so disappointed in this book. I am always on the lookout for books about the Saints. So when I read this I was not expecting to pick up a book that borders on pornography. The constant demeaning attitude the author expresses about the virtuous lives of the Saints is positively sickening. The Saints are honored in the Church so that we can understand that holiness is for everyone. Just because someone chooses not to give in to base instincts and to fight against vice does not make them psychotic, masochist or weird. What makes it even worse is that Catholics who don't know much about the Faith will read this book and think it's right up there with \\"normal\\" thinking about the Church and the Saints. This book deserves -10 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contempt prior to understanding....","review":"More research was needed for this book. Virtually everything in it showed contempt for Catholics. We do not get our faith from the imperfect people that constitute the Church (past or present), but from the Church herself. Religious faith arises from the heart as well as the intellect. This book lacked both."},{"rating":"2","title":"an enlightening travelogue into the world of saints","review":"A fascinating read. Though I found her narrative a bit dismissive at first (particulary when talking about worshippers and Europeans), the author found her groove around the middle. Up until that point, it was only the entrancing accounts of the saints' lives and the descriptions of the churches and relics that kept my attention. After her groove discovery, though, she began really nailing her social commentary, relating the lives of the saints to modern day as well as putting into light the repercussions some of these saints' \\"miracles\\" actually created (like St. Francis). Overall, informative, fun and even bred some wanderlust."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Deliciously Morbid Read!","review":"Anneli Rufus takes the reader on a jaunt through Europe, creating \\"word paintings\\" of medieval times juxtaposed with modern attributes of the cities which house the specific relics discussed in the book. It is difficult for the mind to grasp the researched histories and vignettes that tell the story of each relic! We find ourselves both horrified and intrigued at once. Many of the behaviors of the sainted women portrayed are highly suggestive of anorexia nervosa, misdirected and/or suppressed eroticism, self-destructiveness, and obsessive compulsive disorder and would be viewed very differently in our modern world. I highly recommend this to any reader who is interested in the offbeat and the early history of the Catholic Church and its traditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, no plastic worries","review":"Wife ordered these because of the recent BPA scares. They've held up well to drops and abuse and clean well in the dishwasher even if, because of their height, they need to be loaded carefully. Nipples are a little finicky to clean as they have a small ridge around the inside.No problems for us yet, but there is always a risk of broken and/or chipped glass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bottles but wish I had bought the silicone nipples at the same time!","review":"I was so excited to receive these glass bottles after I learned about the potential harmful effects of Bisphenol-A leaching from my daughter's plastic bottles. They are so cute! They hold heat really well, and for a lot longer than her plastic ones. They also clean up really easily in the dishwasher which is heaven. My only gripe is that my daughter is 6 months old and is used to silicone nipples so she won't take the latex ones that come with the bottles. I did purchase some 'standard' gerber ones but they ended up leaking. Also the diameter of the nipple is a lot smaller than her old gerber comfort hold bottles so the way she nurses is different than on the new smaller nipples for the glass bottles. My advice is to start your baby early on this glass bottle/nipple combo or be prepared for some adjustment time as your baby learns the new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, safe alternative to plastic bottles-no bishpenol a!","review":"I love these bottles. My daughter is very picky and would drink out of only Dr. Brown's bottles. When I read that Dr. Brown's (and other clear plastic baby bottles) leached harmful amounts of bisphenol-a into the fluid in the bottle, I bought these immediately and worried about whether or not my daughter would accept them (she is also a reflux baby, so she's just a naturally picky eater due to her tummy problems). She drank more milk than I had been able to get her to take in months, I'm not sure why she loves these bottles so much but I just wish I'd discovered this months ago! GREAT bottles! And safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but it doesn't vent","review":"These are your old-fashioned, sturdy glass bottles. So if you're used to a Dr. Browns', which vents so well, you'll be disappointed. My son sucks and sucks and when I take the bottle out of his mouth, air gets pulled in through the nipple, creating all kinds of bubbles. I tried to use the Dr. Brown's interior venting system, but it's just a hair too long to fit in the bottle. If they were just a bit shorter, they'd fit. I'm starting to think the extra money for the Born Free bottles is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caps leak","review":"The caps leak on the bottom. I've tried tightening and loosening the caps but that didn't seem to help. While using a spoon to mix the formula I found that some bottles were larger than others and some were out of round (the spoon went in some bottles and not others, it would go in one way but not another). My guess is that I have a bad batch of bottles. I went to Evenflo's web sight but there doesn't seem to be anyway to contact them their about bottles. In anycase the bottles have turned out to be a real pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bottles.","review":"I recommend this product. was as described. Nice colors and correct size.

Why even take the chance of using plastic bottles that have the possibility of the toxic lining - when the glass bottles have the same benefits - but are 100% safe. The only slight con is that they are a bit heavier than the plastic bottles - but a newborn does not hold his/her own bottle anyway. Also, I bought the evenflo nipples, which are only a few bucks, to replace the rubber ones that the bottles came with (they are way too hard). I would highly recommend that you use these bottles!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Really Wanted This To Work","review":"I love the idea of using glass rather than plastic bottles. Sadly, these just didn't work. I bought the silicone nipples to use, and they just collapsed while my baby was drinking - she couldn't even get anything. When I buy a product, it should be fit for its intended purpose. Here, this is a bottle and my daughter should be able to drink from it, but was unable.I read others' reviews, suggesting to use the Dr. Brown's piece in order to let airflow. I don't think I should have to go out and buy something else for the bottle to work. Also, aren't I still using plastic if I use the Dr. Brown's plastic piece? Sadly, I had to return them. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems like an easy way to save $$...","review":"I just assumed that the bottles would be made bigger. The neck of the bottle is so small that it is hard to pour the powder in without making a mess. The nipples are a joke. I do not like this item at all. Right now, I am just using them to measure water to pour into my smaller bottles. Definitely not worth even the small amount they are asking for them. I will buy more of the Born Free next time!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great option","review":"I really like these bottles. I just gave them to my six month old son who has always used plastic bottles. He immediately liked them and had no trouble adjusting. In addition, I was so very pleased to be able to put them in the dishwasher with all other stuff. I did not do this with the plastics and I was washing them all the time. Beasides, all the hight-tech talk about air intake, I think that because these bottles are much more narrow, there is less surface area exposed and there is less of an air intake sound as he drinks it. I would highly recommend these bottles!!!Not only there are reports of the side effects of BPA, I think everything tastes better in glass!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent bottles, nipples not so much","review":"Excellent, safe alternative to plastic bottles.

Three in a pack is a very good idea, four could have been better though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't image there is a bottle that leaks worse","review":"My wife and I got these bottles, because they are glass and therefore BPA-free. The problems is that of the six that we have, only one doesn't leak. And when I say leak, what I really mean is pour. The milk flows freely from around the nipple where it contacts the glass. So my recommendation is to look elsewhere for bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utility Bottles","review":"These bottles are great for storing and heating breast milk. The standard opening they have fits the wife's breast pump (Almeda Purely Yours), and allows her to pump longer than the stock bottles that come with the pump.I feel better heating milk in these glass bottles, and using plastic bottles to feed my son. Overall they are sturdy and come with a lot of old school nipples and caps."},{"rating":"2","title":"No plastics!!","review":"I knew even before I was pregnant that I wanted to use glass bottles- I don't believe that BPA-free means \\"safe,\\" so I wanted to use something I could trust. These bottles are great (they come in two sizes; this review is for the larger, 8oz size). I freeze milk in them and defrost them in warm water and we have never had a crack or break yet. They wash better than plastic bottles because you can see the fat from the milk left on them when they are still dirty- it's hard to see that in the plastic bottles. They are easy to clean and not too heavy, but still strong enough to freeze/thaw multiple times. My daughter was able to hold them herself (of course we hover while she does that) and drink a bit when she was just a few months old, so they are not these huge and bulky bottles. Good quality and better safety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy it.","review":"The bottle part is all right. The cap and nipple have poor quality. You have to tighten the cap very hard to seal the bottle, otherwise milk will leak. I bought bottles with slow flow nipples, and my baby does not like it. Even when I change to Evenflo fast flow nipple, she does not like it either. There is no hole in the fast flow nipple, only a \\"x\\" on it. It is poorly designed, and it takes my baby very long time to finish one bottle of milk. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice glass bottle and BPA free","review":"I like the fact that is glass and BPA free. I voted 4 stars because it leaks when mixing the formula. I am getting the Born free for the 8oz, because it's wide neck for easy cleaning, leak free and BPA free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price and no BPA","review":"I just gave up my Avent's to get glass bottles that are BPA free. The bottles are great for the cheap price BUT they do take a bit longer to warm up because of the thick glass. You also have to be careful that you don't go from cold (in the fridge) to extreme hot or they can break. You have to gradually warm them up. Overall, I'm liking them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for storage but bad for feeding","review":"Like most reviewers, I bought these along with Dr. Brown's glass bottles to see which ones I can use to replace my Avent plastic bottles due to BPA concerns. These were cheaper but as stated in a lot of reviews, the nipples were useless. They collapsed and my son gave up trying to nurse after awhile. I now use these to store my expressed breast milk in the fridge and use my Dr. Brown ones to feed my baby. Overall, it was a cheap solution for milk storage but definitely not for feedings. Dr. Brown glass vented bottles are great although having so many little parts to deal with is a bit annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for babies with reflux","review":"Great price, but if your baby has reflux, this is not the bottle for him or her. We've used Avent and Dr. Brown's , but with the plastic scare, wanted to switch over to something else. As other's have suggested, I tried my Dr. Brown's parts with these and they leaked terribly, there is no vent system with the Evenflo and with a reflux baby, tons of spit up and stomach pain. Better off with the Nam, plastic, but BPA free, they work great with the reflux baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Glass Bottles","review":"I have been searching for some glass bottles with all this talk of BPA's in plastic bottles.

I can't say enough good about them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bisphenol Free and Health of baby priority!","review":"My husband is a scientist & know pretty well the effects of Bisphenol!We have always used glass and yeah the nipples are latex but its cheaper to replace it with silicone than compromise my baby's health for the long term effects of bisphenol.Maybe old fashioned yet its the best choice than those nice looking plastics with \\"free cancer\\". Think about it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good, affordable alternative to plastic bottles","review":"These bottles are great, and I had a hard time finding them in stores around me.

My son just can suck anything out of these nipples. The bottlesare fine. Glass is better than plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in theory, leaky in practice","review":"I decided to switch off of the Avent bottles out of concern for the BPA in the plastic. I wouldn't say this is the best choice though. Unless you get the cap screwed on just right they leak or don't vent at all. Also, the fast nipples break down quickly (the hole grows larger with each use) and become more like a deluge of milk soaking myself and my daughter. She medium flow is too slow and she gets frustrated. They also are rather heavy and she doesn't like holding it on her own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use","review":"I switched to this product because it is glass and safer than plastic according to news reports. The caliberation is difficult to read on the bottle and so I always end up pouring more or less milk than I need. Also, the nipples are not up to par and when I used the Dr. Brown's nipples and vent system, the bottle leaked terribly.The price was very reasonable but I ended up going back to my trusty Dr. Brown. God will protect all our little ones!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"after the bad comments about the plastic bottles, I try to look glass bottle and found this.

They break and have razor sharp edges. They drop on your feet. They get thrown (maybe at you). Go with plastic. Maybe for the first few months you can get away with 4oz glass bottles. But by the time your child is ready for 8oz, switch to plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes me back to my teenage years.","review":"Wow! This is the '70s in a nutshell. A whole lot of music for the money. When I am listening to this, it is as if I am eleven years old again and at a roller-skating birthday party (remember those?), circling the rink to tunes like \\"Tell Me Something Good\\" and \\"Billy, Don't Be a Hero.\\" The memories are priceless.

Soundbites connected to the tracks of 33 songs! I didn't realize the soundbites aren't separate, but connected to the actual song track. Some of the bites are in front of the song and some at the end. You can't edit them away from the song without some time and editing equipment.

What GREAT memories this collection invokes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Seventies pop music collection available","review":"This collection will take you back to the 1970's in sentimental style. Some of the songs on this album will bring back wonderful memories (Maxine Nightingale's \\"Right Back Where We Started From\\"). But this collection also proves that not everything that came out of the seventies was great, either. Morris Albert's \\"Feelings\\" still makes me wince). but on the whole, this is a marvelous trip down the memory lane of the Seventies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you need in one shot.","review":"I would have strongly preferred that a couple of the novelty songs on this set were left off in favor of \\"real\\" singles, but that's my only criticism of this incredible set. The only things that are missing are hits by artists who you probably own greatest hits collections of anyway. Their absence leaves room for more obscure gems and one hit wonders that you'd never buy on their own. So I'm glad there's no Elton John or Springsteen, etc. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"hang on to your vinyl","review":"So Long, Bannatyne (1971) has the best overall sound of all the albums. However, there are problems here too. The sound quality is slightly sterile, and once again the vocals should be louder on some tracks. Equalization varies from song to song. The guitar solo in the middle of \\"Grey Day\\" seems to disappear instead of panning back and forth between the channels. \\"One Man Army\\" sounds good, but the mix isn't right. The strings in \\"Sour Suite\\" suffer due to the high end being rolled off.#10 (1973) suffers from entirely too much bass on most of the album. Compression rears its ugly head once again on \\"Musicione.\\" \\"Miss Frizzy\\" sounds fairly decent, although the vocals (once again) should be louder. \\"Self Pity\\" is the only track on the album that sounds like it should. The rest of the album's second side has way too much bass and \\"Just Let Me Sing\\" is a compressed mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO ENJOYABLE","review":"I cannot say enough good about this CD.

Two days after Christmas the two front wheels fell off while she was riding it and they continued to fall off every time she would drive off the sidewalk into a grassy area or bush. There's a plastic round piece that holds the two wheels in place, but this piece doesn't fit properly to prevent the wheels from coming off. Two weeks later I went to visit my co-worker at home and she was experiencing the same problem. I got so sick and tired of putting the wheels back on while my daughter was outdoors riding it that I don't let her ride it anymore. Not worth the money or the time!

The Conscious Heart brought the subject of commitment to the forefront for me. I have already loaned out the book so I can't quote exactly.

On top of that it's an eyeball on the entertainment world through the leveling prism of golf: Stars, producers, directors striving to shine or at least //look// good at the maddening game.

The amount of detail makes the read a bit dry at times and is not a riveting read, but one that gives you information to sort out as you go, although podding along as it seems at times.

Gantz focuses on groups of people who have died and been mysteriously transported to a room with the Gantz which forces them to engage in brutal battle for the right to return to life. Though there is action aplenty in the series those considering checking this series out should know that this series is very cerebral and less an action film than an exploration of questions about life, death and various other existential questions. One of the biggest themes is the question of whether modern society has desensitized people to violence and diminished the value of human life. In a way the graphic brutality of the Gantz games is itself meant to confront the audience with their own desensitization and bloodlust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"This anime like the manga is just boring, and repetitive. The story starts out interesting, but begins to get old real fast. The biggest problem is that no one in the series is worth caring about, in the least. DO NOT waste your money on this, if you want crazy violence get berserk, elfen lied, or blue gender, all of which have much better plot, and action. This anime is not for me, but i am jaded by the manga, that is at least in my opinion a sci fi wannabe of berserk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Anime","review":"This Anime series is completely worth the purchase.

This could have been done in half the the episodes or even less. I think there was only three real battles and they lasted all 25 episodes. One character would be fighting while the others would just be standing around, complaining, whining, or trying to get in touch with how they feel about killing \\"Aliens\\" and this would last for 3 to 4 episodes. It just took to long to develope and the characters were boring. Kai the main character was the only bright spot in the Anime the others were boring and annoying. Borrow it, dont buy it.

Personally, I knew of them from a distance and never researched them until recently. Living in Germany placed me in the thick of the ABBA Fan Club as they are revered here in Europe. There are enough ABBA fans here to pack any venue where they would perform, believe that. Already familiar with tracks such as \\"Dancing Queen\\", \\"Take A Chance On Me\\" and \\"Mamma Mia\\", I can now associate ever so closely with their string of hits. As a DJ, it's imperative to have a worthy compilation such as this on hand at all times. Best believe if you are doing an old school set, an ABBA fan will reveal himself to you. More importantly, this music is nostalgic and full of great, feel good vibes. For that reason alone the Definitive Collection is worth having in your collection.

The jokes that were to be had were really pretty much covered in the trailer; everything else was just kind of an extension of those. Even the whole foray into religion seemed to be 45 minutes dedicated to a joke that could last about 10.Also, about 30 minutes of the movie deals with finding a partner with the right genetic code (as opposed to the one your in love with, i.e. makes you happy).

Yes, that's the world you enter in the movie, but it's done well and you discover the likeable \\"hero\\" who is about to lose his job and also can't get the girl he loves. Well, he does lose his job and the girl says she's not interested, but that's not the end of his story, which has more than a few twists and turns and is suspenseful up to the end.

The fact that Ricky Gervais is an atheist makes it more than clear that he is trying to promote atheism by making a mockery of the concept of believing in God. People of all faiths, any faith should steer clear of this film and do our small part to let Ricky Gervais know that his approach is not acceptable and his message is not mainstream.

The premise has been visited before but not necessarily as directly as the first 15 to 20 minutes of this film. After the set up, this film could have gone one of two ways. It could have explored the darkness created from the lead character's decision to start lying. We could have been taken on a very deep roller coaster ride exploring the ramifications of his decision. (And by darkness, I don't solely mean depression. It could have been handled in a comedic fashion too). Or the movie could do what it did; become one of the umpteen million typical hollywood movies that gets bogged down in resolving the age old guy meets gal baloney.One extra star for the cool premise.

Horrible butchery of a cool idea","review":"Despite an intriguing concept (and maybe five lines of dialogue that capitalize on it) this movie is neatly organized into three sections: boredom, uncomfortable crudity, and histrionic blasphemy.Let me save you an hour and a half of precious, precious life.Even Rachael McAdams (sp?) isn't that appealing, who's otherwise quite irresistable.Maybe not everyone would share my disappointments with the above (maybe) but the pacing is drawn-out to the point of agonizing. I felt like I was watching The Aviator again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie EVER!","review":"They could have done so much with the idea of the first ever lie and they ruined it with a cast of bad leading men and a random appearance by Tina Fey where she didn't even get achance to do her comedy magic.

However, our family has a 15 minute rule - if a film drags for the first 15, we yank it. This film lasted 30 minutes - 30 minutes too long.It was disappointing - especially with the brilliant cast. However, no onew as given enough time to develop any sense of character - it was basically one cameo shot after another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected, Let Down...","review":"Ok, so I was excited to finally see this movie whenever it came out, but once I did... What a HUGE let down! Wow. All of the best & funniest scenes I had already seen in the commercial/trailers. So, Not only would I not spend the money to buy it I wouldn't even rent it. If you're looking for a movie to make you laugh, look further. Not the worst movie I've seen, but for me personally it was such a let down. Should you watch & completely disagree, I honestly would be happy about that. I'll even admit part of my review could be due to the fact that I may have just built it up in my mind to the point of when I did finally see it there was ALMOST no way it could have lived up to to my expectation. I don't know about that, but either way, hope this helps. Oh, & had this been the standard 4 star rating system I would have rated it a 1 star, but since it was a 5 star rating system, as you see, I gave it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive","review":"My husband and I couldn't watch the film all the way through. Once we realized it was a movie portraying God as a lie, the movie turned from humorous and cute into something extremely offensive and hurtful. A waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally, completely, absolutely UNfunny","review":"This film claims it is set in an alternate universe where everyone tells the truth but that itself is a lie. What it is is a world where everyone is venal, stupid, vacuous, vicious and tells not only the truth, but every single thing they think, which is not at all the same. If you care about what your kids watch, and I suspect few do, keep your kids far from this. The jokes are about masterbation, excretion and cruelty. This film is the perfect example of what is wrong with Hollywood---it tries way too hard to be funny and succeeds only in insulting anyone gullible enough to watch. The marching morons (read it:The Marching Morons) have triumphed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring with an anti-religion message","review":"I wanted to like this movie - however -it is crude, lacks intelligent humor and then gets all caught up in involving God as a lie told to comfort his dying mother.

I was equally disapointed that the talented Jennifer Garner would be involved with this stupid movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"Although I've always liked Ricky Gervais, I was extremely disappointed with this one. Although it was somewhat entertaining at times, I found the concept of God and heaven being \\"a lie\\", soley created by an individual, offensive. I believe in freedom of speech and everyone is entitled to their own opinion - but if I had known what this movie was about, I wouldn't have wasted my time watching it. I don't recommend this one. And, based on freedom of speech, I'd like to say ... shame on you Ricky."},{"rating":"1","title":"MEAN SPIRITED, UGLY, INSULTING & DEPRESSING.","review":"The Invention of Lying had the potential to be clever and witty. However, it is not.It started out slowly with some laughs, and eventually started to desperately struggle to find lower and lower ways to make people's spiritual beliefs appear to be ridiculous. The insults aren't even cleverly presented.Blech. Awful.I'm hoping for better stuff from Ricky Gervais in the future. The \\"Old Man in the Sky\\" told me it's possible. (Well then, I guess we can forget that.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"This movie was so disappointing for so many reasons. First, it simply wasn't funny. The promo clips led me to believe that this was going to be a hilarious movie. It was not. In addition to not being funny, it was also so terribly boring. But what I found most offensive was the obvious underlying message/theme to this lackluster flick: That the concept of God, heaven, hell, sin, and eternal life was a lie created and embellished upon by the first man on the planet to ever tell a lie. I don't know if anyone else found this offensive, but I certainly did. Is it too much to ask movie producers to make a movie that is genuinely entertaining with making an obvious political statement?? Apparently, the answer is YES. This may quite possibly be the worst movie I have ever seen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever made...","review":"I bought this video because I've always enjoyed Jennifer Garner's work. About 5 minutes into the movie, one realizes that the jokes are running thin, and then the main character \\"invents\\" lying by telling his dying mother that there will be a wonderful place to go after she dies. I was insulted by the overall storyline that a belief in God, and of the afterlife, was the invention of lying. This movie is a STEAMING PILE of horse manure put out by a production company with an obvious political agenda. (Oh, Shame on you Mrs. Garner for accepting this type of role.) I was NOT impressed. PS: Amazon made me as a reviewer give a star rating. I had to give it one star because of this, but if given a chance would have given it -2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Invention of Poor Script Writing","review":"Firstly let me say i love Ricky Gervais and have no problem with the \\"poking fun at the christian\\" component of this film however this fails miserably as a comedy. With such an interesting cast (including many cameos by well known faces) and concept (everyone on earth speaks nothing but the truth except one man) this should have been far better. Most of the jokes fall flat and the romance component is as tired as an old dogs hind legs. Whilst Ghost Town was mildly amusing this unfortunately falls into the category of dud. The only thing of interest i found in this film was a particularly well acted scene featuring Ricky Gervais dealing with his mothers death. Ricky demonstrates the depths of what his talent is capable of here showing unseen sides to his personality. Perhaps a drama next time Ricky......."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The man in the sky\\"","review":"The romantic plot was quite cheesy but I loved the \\"the man in the sky\\" part.

Luckily it was on his Amazon Gift Wish List, because I didn't have to wonder if he would like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange but uninteresting","review":"I thought this was some of the weakest written script I've heard in a long time. I thought it would at least be funny but I barely cracked a smile. The odd world is too consistent to be funny or unpredictable and the premise is boring after the first 5 minutes. The acting was decent but there were no good scenes to test the acting at all. Of course, it was completely atheistic in it's message and mockery of religion, but at the same time it was so incredible (as in, not believable) that I found it more boring than offensive. I finished the movie only because I'd paid to rent it and could multitask to avoid sheer boredom. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, bad delivery","review":"The idea of this movie were ingenius, particulary the dating interaction where men and women are completely up front about their desires or lack there of. Pscyhology experts would probably get a kick out of watching this movie because of the way people are honestly revealing the shortcomings, jealousies, and fears that motivate them. I thought the movie got boring though when the main character started using his power for good rather than evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Didn't Laugh Once (No Lie)","review":"I was hoping for a good laugh when I saw this movie, but unfortunately the only funny parts were the bits shown in the commercials (of course). I really don't think I laughed once. I liked the premise, but it didn't work for me. People not only couldn't lie, they were compelled to share every thought and explain their motives for everything. While I was wallowing in my disappointed boredom, I was suddenly hit with a surprise \\"anti-God\\" agenda which became a major part of the movie. I found it to be offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Invention of Crap","review":"<YAWN> A very boring film whose only reason for being seems to be to insult the religious. Paper thin plot, no laughs. They could have done so much more with this theme had they ditched the agenda. Sheer crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant funny....","review":"The premise is that everyone has to identify exactly how they are feeling during an interaction or the absolute truths of institutions and things in general. The style is dead pan british style humor, and it delivers. This is the best comedy that I have watched since old school, even though the style is different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had to buy it","review":"After seeing this film, we had to buy it so we could share it with others. Simply one of the best comedies and social commentaries ever. Right up there with Some Like it Hot. Gervais just keeps getting better."},{"rating":"1","title":"we get it, you're an atheist","review":"Ricky Gervais is a gifted actor. He always makes me laugh. However, this movie is a thinly veiled medium to convey his atheist \\"beliefs\\". It made me lose a lot of respect for him. The movie was funny at times, I will give it that. However. the overarching theme is that the \\"man in the sky\\" does not exist. That \\"man\\" is God, Ricky, and He certainly does exist. You will find out for yourself the hard way unless you come to your senses before it's too late!Like L. Ledbetter, I feel this movie is COMPLETELY OFFENSIVE and I would give it zero stars but that's not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexually explicit language during first five minutes","review":"Watch out! During the first five minutes, there was sexually explicit language not suitable for teens or anyone for that matter. We turned it off after several references to explicit sexual actions."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever","review":"Wow, where to begin? I will just come out and say it DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. I feel as though I have lost 1.5 hours of my life that I can never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"The angry Athiests are at it again","review":"This movie is an unfunny, angry \\"comedy\\" written by unhappy and angry Atheists. They thinly disguise their utter lack of respect for anyone who believes in God. So if you are a person of faith and want to watch angry Atheists make fun of you this is a good movie for you.One has to wonder why they are so obsessed with making fun of people of religion, more specifically Christians. When I think something is ridiculous do I spend pretty much anytime at all thinking about it? No, not really. Maybe all their thinking about God will someday bring them back to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"A misrepresentation (not the comedy you think it is)","review":"I wish I had known that this was a movie about an athiest's view of our world rather than the sweet romantic comedy it was sold as in the previews. People can believe in what they want to -- I just wish I had known before viewing the movie that the message of the film was to belittle those us of us that have faith in God and the afterlife. I guess I should feel \\"happy\\" the movie attacks all religions and not just Christianity. I feel sorry for the actors that took part in this film. If they believe that life is just the brief time we spend in the flesh, I really do feel sorry for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood needs to do some research!!","review":"I found this film very insulting to Christians as it makes it very obvious that Hollywood needs to look at the evidence for Christianity before it makes it out to be nothing but a big lie. The no name actors aren't even worth mentioning. However, Ms. Garner should've known better. I guess she hasn't taken the time to look into the evidence either. Pray for Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I get my $1 back?","review":"I cut if off after they started getting into religion.

I should have read the reviews before I ordered it. I couldn't even finish the movie. I only got to the reading of the \\"tablets\\", and had to stop.The man who wrote this movie hates God, and denies His Lordship over all.In the end, God will not be mocked. EVERY knee will bow, and EVERY tongue will confess that Jesus Christ is LORD. Including the writer of this film.In the meantime I will pray that this man comes to repentance, and turns away from his foolish ways.DO NOT rent or buy this movie if you are a Christian. DO NOT show this crude film to children. It is disgusting, it glorifies lying, and greed, and selfishness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Internet","review":"Don't watch this if you don't like atheist films. I definitely wouldn't have rented this movie if I had known that. My bad for not researching the movie at all, but I do feel misled by the previews I had seen.Simply stated, I feel this movie had potential, but fell short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ricky Gervais can't make a good movie to save his life.","review":"And that's no lie. Okay, so The Office and Extras were great TV shows, but his movies sink to the bottom with a dull thud. The religious aspect aside, this movie was sloppy, unfunny, poorly acted (what was with Jennifer Garner's cartoon performance?) and basically ridiculous, and I rank this movie as one the worst I've ever seen. A great premise with terrible execution. The characters don't just 'not lie', they come out and say whatever cruel thing they happen to be thinking, whether they're asked or not, because Ricky Gervais thinks it might be funny to write down an insult about someone's height, or intelligence, clothes. Along with his other catastophe Ghost Town, and other bottom feeders like Anchorman and Deuce Bigelow: Male Gigolo, you've got a handful of movies worth going into a coma over. Oh my gosh, please skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't believe the lies","review":"The Invention of Lying is a humorous softball of a movie that still manages to address the superficiality of humanity and the easy path many people take in life because they put their faith in a greater reward at the sacrifice of the here and now. It also deals with the base fears that are the basis of religion's power and influence in our life. And it's funny for goodness sake. It's Ricky Gervais funny.How perplexing that this movie has a majority of 1 star votes and Step Brothers has a majority of 5 star votes. I don't know if there is anything else to say. To compare them is pointless. I don't know what turns people off the most about this, but I think that at least part of it is the subtle-like-a-jackhammer take on religion and this makes people uncomfortable. That forced infantile humor devoid of even the slightest thought can be more enjoyable to the masses than this thoughtful, very funny and yet tender movie is a staggering reality. Truth is stranger than lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, so no one lies.... but it's a pile of crap!","review":"The story of no one lying is one thing.... but when the movie opens up with some woman answering the door telling the guy showing up for a date, and she tells him \\"he's fat\\", and \\"I just masturbated\\" is where it's so stupid. Just because you don't lie doesn't mean you have to say every cruel or stupid thing that enters into your head, does it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film!","review":"Awesome movie. Highly recommend it. Ricky Gervais is hilarious.The quality was excellent as well. Amazon instant watch never fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Religious Propoganda","review":"The entire movie basically makes fun of Christianity. That's really the point of the whole movie and it doesn't really try to hide it. If that's your thing it's a great movie for you, if you're an athiest it's perfect. As a Christian I found it offensive and not very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely offensive","review":"I only gave this one star because there is no option to give it zero stars. I was thoroughly disgusted with this movie. I was actually looking forward to this movie as I really enjoyed Gervais in Ghost town and Night at the Museum, and I love Jennifer Garner. Wow, what a total disappointment! I have never been so offended by a movie before. Completely disguised as a romantic comedy, this movie was a complete promotion of atheism and was totally anti-God, anti-religion and anti-Christianity. If you are a Christian, you will no doubt be as utterly offended by this movie as I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even though I read other reviews, I thought would feel differently","review":"I liked Gervais in \\"Ghost Town,\\" so I knew I would like him in this one. Oh my gosh! I can't stomach it, and I can't get myself to watch the rest of the movie. I know where it is heading and that is exactly where some of those who gave it negative reviews said, anti-Christianity (i.e. God is a lie). I just can't do it. Nothing is worth that. It was beginning to feel as though it was mocking me and my beliefs. If you're wondering still, read some of the postings from other reviewers who gave the movie one star. They are right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I rate it at zero stars???","review":"This is a sad excuse for a movie. I'd prefer to rate it zero stars because it wasn't worth the time it took to take it out of the packaging and put it into the dvd player. I'm disappointed that Jennifer Garner would allow herself to be associated with this project. It's a two hour rant about how telling the truth is a bad thing, lying is a wonderful thing, and believing in God in absurd. This is not entertaining by any standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie we have ever seen!!!","review":"This movie is the worst one we have ever seen. The entire movie is a slap in the face of Christianity. If we had known this, we would have never watched it. The producers should be ashamed. If you are a Christian, we strongly advise you not to watch this movie. It makes fun of God, and everything associated with Christianity. This is an absolutely sickening movie that NEVER should have been produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another preachy comedy","review":"Somewhere along the way, Hollywood types realized that most people won't sit through their preachy dramas. So they started producing preachy comedies. This is one of them.The invention of lying is like an old-time poor-house meal where they'd serve food and the price of the food was a sermon. At least that was an honest bargain. The invention of lying is a joke here and there, and the price of the all-too-rare humor is tedious sermonizing about the evils of religion, but the only preacher here is Ricky Gervais."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it...and I'm not lying","review":"I found nothing redeeming or interesting about this movie. It's obvious stabs a God and heaven were poor at best. I was really hoping for a turn around at the end but it never happened. It was good concept gone very bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ricky Gervais","review":"Now, I am a big fan of Ricky, so that may have corrupted my rating. But this movie, although not critically acclaimed, can possess a lot of emotion. In the beginning scenes where Ricky is still telling the truth are kind of bland, but stay with it and you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD BUT NOT GREAT FILM WITH AN INTERESTING CONCEPT","review":"A what if story about a culture similar to ours except it isn't possible for anyone to lie (or even hold off on giving information to questions). . . until the character played by Ricky Gervais shows up. The imaginary culture says a lot to the audience about their culture. How and why we lie and the repercussions in being too honest (in some examples you can see the spirit of the undesirables being crushed) but at the same time why we might lie and why it isn't always bad. There's also some focuses on the afterlife and God which may turn off heavy religious types. Strange in the final cuts that the culture didn't believe in God yet had a Church with a cross on it in the background. This film was the directorial debut for Gervais. The budget was $18.5M and made over $32M at the Box Office.

As an agnostic, I wasn't as offended as religious viewers...but it still felt like it was in poor taste to hide the biblical mockery from American audiences.I'm a huge Ricky Gervais fan, and an agnostic to boot...so you would think that this movie was tailor-made for me. Not so. The message of the movie--that Radical Honesty would lead to a world of cynics who do nothing less than put down each other constantly--was a downer. Would it have hurt the writers to put a few nice words into the mouths of the characters? THE INVENTION OF LYING high-concept misfire on the level of Mike Judge's dire IDIOCRACY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as I was hoping","review":"This movie not only relies on its audience believing that its characters are incapable of lying, but that they are all incredibly stupid. Even with suspension of disbelief, it is nearly impossible to become engrossed or even mildly enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN!","review":"I'm sorry folks-I thought this was just about as boring as can be.

I don't know if the director was off his game or what, but it felt like the \\"Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy\\" movie where you know each scene was better in the book than the movie.

I must admit, I had a bit of hesitation when choosing to read this title (I was given a complimentary copy of the e-book version from Booksneeze in exchange for a non-biased review). When I opened the book, I thought that the concept \\"lead from anywhere within the organization\\" was a bit far-fetched, and unrealistic.

The book is simply a collection of quotes, references to Maxwell's other books, and an homage to his friends and colleagues. No original thoughts or revelations.Take away all the quotes and fluff and the book boils down to 3 points: Leaders work hard, are good in social settings, and are competent. Most leaders shouldn't need a book to tell them that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 360 Degree Leader Facilitator Guide","review":"The format same as the test book of primary school.The content is superficial, not worth a farthing.The book makes me disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"I feel like a true leader now","review":"This book was wonderful.

You need a code from the flyleaf of the book in order to do this.IT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE KINDLE EDITION!This book has been highly recommended to me by leaders that I respect and I want to get the full value. Guess I'll go buy it again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What's Promoted!","review":"I was very disappointed in this book after hearing John Maxwell promit this book on the Inspirational TV Networks. He said this book was for everyone - and would teach about being a leader in every aspect of life. I took the online \\"test\\" to establish my own leadership skill review and potential. It was a total waste of my time and the results were exactly the same things I entered. He promotes needing to read all his OTHER books so one can understand this one. Totally a waste of time and energy. The skills of leadership that he mentions - are the basic ones that any person would already know - and only seemed to apply to business - not everyday life or the everyday housewife as he promoted. Very confusing and disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets repetitive after a few chapters","review":"I like John Maxwell. His leadership skills are widely recognized not just within Christian circles but beyond it. His books read effortlessly: it's like listening to one of his motivational talks. It's hard not to be energized by it.But I think I prefer Maxwell's quotable quotes rather than entire books. The 360 Degree Leader is just one example why.The first few chapters sound great; the principles aren't mind-numbingly awesome, but you can't really disagree with them either. But after a while, it starts to sound repetitive and even a bit cliché. I couldn't finish it; it just felt like the book didn't have anything more to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not read by the author","review":"As a long time fan I found the audio CD disappointing.

Based on the other reviews I read about this product, I thought that it would put some space in between him and his mattress and stop his sweating. Unfortunately, this pad is very thin as far as mattress pads go, and it is also unbreathable. My baby sweat even worse against this then when he slept on nothing but a sheet over his mattress. I recommend going with something that is not waterproof. All baby mattresses are waterproof anyway so you do not need something waterproof in a mattress pad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and does the job.","review":"I have been using the pad for several months now. It certainly does the job, but the reason I am giving it 4 stars and not 5, is that it seems to collect a lot of lint from the dryer. The pad looks dirty when it comes out, though it has just been washed and dried.Other than that, I am pretty happy with the overall performance. My 2-yr old constantly takes off her diaper and wets the bed; as a result, i have to wash it almost every day.

Simon Callow is pretty much a remarkable writer, executing the events in the book with a sort of charm and also a keen observant pen, depicting situations and emotions so we may feel them also. I personally found this book touching and large-hearted, and I think that all these negative remarks about Mr. Callow is only relevant in making us dislike him, instead of helping us to decide whether or not to buy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I aggree with \\"Opportunity is where it knocks\\"","review":"I was nauseous from reading this book.

I looked forward to this installment in the Southern Vampire series, and was not disappointed.However, don't underestimate Charlaine. Her books have a cozy appearance, but don't let it fool you! You welcome back many of the previous players, and get introduced to many more new ones.Eric has a new side to show, and so does Bill. Alcide, a new character, will hopefully be seen in more of the stories.Bill disappears, and Eric goes to Sookie for help. Sookie, accompanied by Alcide, goes 'undercover' to find Bill in unfamiliar territory. Needless to say, danger and mayhem ensue, with bodies (dead and REALLY dead) dropping (or rising)everywhere.Kudos, Charlaine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to scratch","review":"If anyone has read my earlier reviews of the first and second installments of this Southern vampire mystery series, you must know how much I enjoyed the books. They were great, fast paced, thrilling reads, but Club Dead is, in truth, disappointing.Ms. Harris did not live up to the reputation of this series. Club Dead resembled that of an overly dramatic cheesy soap opera. Sookie's love life is in shambles, Bill leaves her for another vampire for an unexplained reason, more men want to get into her pants and her life is in even more danger. Charlaine Harris attempted to fit so much into one book without any clear cohesion that the whole book was an absolute mess.Just to add to the disappointments, Club Dead is a slow read. The action does not start until late into the book and I found myself sluggishly reading from page to page as if it was a tiresome chore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sookie Wins Again","review":"I actually stumbled onto this series in a quest for some new reading material. I love the first two books in this series and I love this one as well. My only complaint is the never ending beating Sookie takes. I guess vampire blood cures all though because Sookie comes out shining once more. I love all the characters in this book, they definately made me feel all kinds of emotions as I got to know them. Really disappointed in Alcide for hooking up with is gal again. Very proud of Sookie's decision at the end of this story. However, we are left dangling when Sookie exercises her rights with Bill and Eric. Hmmm, what is next? And how long do we have to wait?"},{"rating":"2","title":"these books just keep getting better..","review":"WARNING: contains spoilersThis books opens up soon after the action of Living Dead in Dallas. However, all is not well w/Sookie and Bill. He's been acting distant and soon has to take a sudden business trip.I won't give anything more away other than to say that the ending of this book was a big disappointment and Harris took the story and the Bill/Sookie relationship in a direction that I did not see coming. This book introduces us to more of the supernatural beings that walk among us and includes a scene involving a car trunk that still gets debated by the fans of the series.Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite so far","review":"This book was my favorite so far. I couldn't put it down. I read it in one day which I never do. The battles/dilemma were a little back to back. They barely took a break before you were wrapped up in a new scuffle, but it was great. I'm reading the 4th book now.

I didn't know that shape shifters could be so much fun.In this third outing, Bill is pulling back from Sookie, actually spending more time on his computer then on her, if you get her complaint. So when Sookie finds out that Bill has an up coming trip she figures there is a big lie in there somewhere but when Bill is discovered to be missing she turns to Eric who just might know where to find him. And this might not be good news for Sookie.With the help of Alcide, sometimes you just have love the names that Harris comes up with, a werewolf, the antics begin in the search for the missing Bill.Though this book did seem to drag in parts for me, the interaction between Eric and Sookie is always entertaining and with Harris slowly revealing Eric's background I can see a much more entertaining character develop."},{"rating":"2","title":"What the heck's the matter with Bill?","review":"I LOVE the Southern Vampire series. The books are short and extremely fun to read. However Club Dead just wasn't as good as the other two. Sookie is great as always, but what happened to Bill? Sneaking off to Jackson and not telling Sookie is so unlike the Bill in the first two books. It goes against everything we learned about him. And then we really don't get any sense of why. Being a Bill fan, I was disappointed we didn't get to hear more about this female from his past and how she had control over him.Also the book just ended. There wasn't really any wrap-up. This is also my biggest complaint with the Anita Blake books-they just end. You're left hanging.So I'll just be hanging, waiting anxiously for the next book in what is becoming my favorite vampire series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not as good as the first 2","review":"After reading the first 2 Southern Vampires books, I was excited to see a 3rd one out so soon. I was very disappointed. At the end of book 2, Sookie and Bill were fine romance wise, but all of a sudden in this book they are having problems with no development of any previous tension. All of a sudden he leaves town and it was like the author decided, they need to break up so let's see what I can come up with. The scenes with Sookie and Eric are great, but the parts with Bill are boring and the scene in the trunk of the car is just awful. Not to ruin things for anyone, read no further if you don't want a spoiler, but Bill rapes Sookie and she crawls back to him. It was a slap in the face to all women! Then we find out what the big mystery was that Bill had to keep secret. All that for a stupid computer program. This was not a well developed book, and the author just destroyed the heroine's credibility as a sane woman in one paragraph. Poorly done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Series","review":"Just finished the 3rd book in this series. Read them all over the last month. So, here's my recommendation. Read them all in order.

This book was ridiculous and I couldn't wait to get out of Sookieville. Bill is a pain, Sookie needs a backbone and Eric, well Eric is just Eric.

That is how I felt reading \\"Club Dead.\\"I consider myself a fairly intelligent person, but I seriously had no clue where the plot line was -- or if there even was one. Yes, there was a ton of action, but it was enough for three or four books instead of just one. And the motivations about what was going on was never really explained.A lot happened in this book, but I'm not really sure what it was -- or why it occurred. Too bad, as I really enjoy the characters, and Harris has a great way with words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Me Cold","review":"I read books one and two of this series and really liked them. This third one left me cold. It was slow, garbled, inconsistent with previous books and completely out of character for Sookie and Bill. I was so disappointed with the ending that I thought I would just try another series by a different author. This book makes almost no sense on its own, so if you don't continue reading the next in the series you will have not idea if what happened in this book means the end for Sookie and Bill. Unlikely, I suppose since this is a Romance novel series, but I never heard of one that ends with such a cliffhanger. Completely unsatisfying novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but irritating","review":"Club Dead is an great book,an interesting mystery, but I would actually tell people to read this book before reading the first two of the series: Dead Until Dark and Living Dead In Dallas.The problem is an inconsistency in some of her characters' behavior, especially Bill and Sam. This is, unfortunately, a fault in another one of Ms Harris' mystery series, The Aurora Teagarden Mysteries. It appears, that when a storyline get difficult, Ms.Harris either kills, removes, and/or changes the character's personality abruptly.This is a good book, I enjoyed it, it was entertaining, and I am glad I bought it. But, the character jumps in a second Harris series were an irritant."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fan","review":"Ms Harris has come into her own with this, the third book in the Sookie Stackhouse series. It's got it all, humor, seduction, frightening scenes and a plot, too. Sookie's missing her boyfriend, the vampire, Bill. He's been kidnapped. And it's up to Sookie to get him back. Along the way to the rescue there are several tussles over who's actually going to be Sookie's next boyfriend, if Bill shouldn't make it. Those scenes plus the one with the werewolf in the closet are among the funniest.

It's an easy read and great to pass around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading with Tequila","review":"Club Dead is the first book in the Sookie Stackhouse series that hasn't been portrayed on the TV show True Blood, so it was the first book in the series that I was able to read without any preconceived notions of what it should be. This book is the embodiment of everything I hoped this series would be. More Eric, less Bill, interesting scenes with Bubba and the introduction of Alcide (who I hope to see more of) made Club Dead a fully satisfying read. I could not put this book down and loved every single moment. I cannot imagine how Charlaine Harris could top this book and can barely contain my excitement looking forward to the next in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Me More Sookie","review":"Simply addictive.

The smartest thing Sookie has done thus far is when she \\"rescinded\\" (took back) the invitation into her house from Bill and Eric, which by the way I have never read a vampire book where that is even possible. I keep hoping one of these books will actually be a good read, but holy cow I'm having a hard time justifying the waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not the best vampire story","review":"When you read the book's first chapter you'd think that you'll read a spooky book. So if you like eerie readings this could be it. The problem is that CH tried to make antic after jest and that only makes the book boring.

Popp. That book has a really spooky love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic","review":"Inconsistent and formulaic (is Nora Roberts writing as Charlaine Harris now?). The book series started out pretty interestingly albeit with a few continuity errors. Already going downhill, but there is a market for the lowest common denominator-good for \\"by the pool\\".

Despite her worry for Bill, Sookie can't help but wonder if Alcide would perhaps be a better match for her, especially once she learns Bill has been in contact with an ex-girlfriend in Mississippi.This was the best novel yet in this series! It has southern charm, suspense, romance and just enough humor to offset the darker, gory parts. Sookie gets more likeable with each book as well and I just can't get enough of Bubba. Can't wait to see what happens in the next book, Dead to the World."},{"rating":"2","title":"Club Dead: by Charlaine Harris","review":"I have loved every episode of Sookie Stackhouse.

This installment had alittle Laurell K Hamilton type flair which I thoroughly enjoyed. While waiting for my fix of Anita Blake it is refreshing to be able to supplement with Bill and Sookie. New characters introduced and other possible love interests for Sookie made this book a very fast read. Once I started I just couldn't stop. Hopefully Ms. Harris will continue down this path she has started and give us more adventures."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it.","review":"In a sentance:Bill gets kidnapped, Sookie goes to get him back, and in the process learns a LOT more about the subculture of vampires, shapeshifters, and the like, having waaaay too much fun in the process.It was a fun book to read, like all the rest in the series.

In the third book of the Southern Vampire series Sookie has to rescue her boyfriend, Vampire Bill, again. There are a few things that make the rescue difficult from the start, Sookie has the feeling Bill doesn't love her anymore, there may be another woman in his life and Sookie's entre into the Misssissippi supernatural world is Alcide, a handsome, warm, thoughtful, very sexy werewolf. There's much more El...Bubba in this book. Club Dead is another fun read from Charlaine Harris and may be the best of the series to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"They just keep getting better!","review":"After seeing the show True Blood on HBO this past year I just had to know more about Sookie's world. I thought the series started a little slow with Dead Until Dark but DEFINITELY picked up with Living Dead In Dallas. Club Dead blew me away! I LOVED IT! I picked it up four days ago and finished last night. I'm already two chapters into Dead to the world. I love the development of the characters relationships. Especially Sookie and Eric.

Without the back story of his evolution, it's hard to understand \\"where he is coming from\\".Second, the film ignores his allegedly extremely violent manner and bloodthirsty executions he ordered on thousands of Cubans who were thought to be enemies of the state after Castro came into power.Third, the film ignores his journey to the Congo. Something interesting must have happened there.Fourth, the film spends hours showing Che and his band of guerillas wandering about the Bolivian mountains. Not that interesting.I could go on, but despite the good acting by Benicio Del Toro, and some good cinematography, the movie is ultimately quite a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thnk and do!","review":"This movie was great. It showed the life of a revolutionary who saw true poverty and changed it how they saw best. Although, they saw violent revolution as the only means to bring a better life for their people which in the end did, it also showed the real foriegn policy of the United States during this time. The speeches and interviews seemed all the more relevant now as in any time in history. Great acting and wonderful cinematography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Communist Propaganda","review":"Another attempt by social justice (gun point, government take over politics) justification! Communism = murder. Che was an ignorant, short-cited idealist that cost the lives of those who didn't see things as he did. I have no idea how social justice can be used as an excuse to kill inocent people.

He explains the way we see, or maybe what we don't see, in a witty and extremely accessible way. Elkins uses his knowledge of Art History and mixes it freely with neurology and psychology to bring us readers at a different level of understanding of the world. I'm already a true fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't see any reason to read this book","review":"I thought this was going to be a science-based look at howour eyes and brains \\"see\\" the world. Instead, it's basicallya diary of the author's random thoughts about what and how we see. There's absolutely no scientific information and barelyany proof of his assertions. His prose is nice occasionally, butif you want to actually learn anything, do not buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected but still a good and interesting read!","review":"I agree with the other reviewers, however I do not feel that the book deserves a low review because people's expectations were not met. I expected a more scientific explanation of seeing, but this book is not about that. I was impressed by the writing of Elkins because it is very thought provoking and insightful. I would recommend this book to someone who is interested in seeing the world in a different way, because this book will encourage you to look at things a little more carefully and realize there is much we see, do not see, try not to see and try hard to see but fail to do so. Very interesting book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"James Elkins, The Object Stares Back","review":"James Elkins gives a lot of interesting speculation on the experience of seeing, but unfortunately, he fails to give much linkage of his subject to the experience of making and seeing art, which is curious in that the author is an art historian. He attaches a lot of importance to the idea that conventional seeing is a form of \\"blindness,\\" that is, that conventional day-to-day seeing is extremely limited, but, again, he seems to be uninterested in the ways that artists remove these limits, both for themselves and their audience. So much of the writing is about how the author himself sees and does not see, that eventually I became bored, as one usually does listening to one person talk on and on about his own limited experience of a subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits Of Kenny Chesney Vol. 2 - Karaoke CDG Songlist:","review":"Contains 8 Songs With AND Without Lead Demonstration Vocals (16 Tracks Total).1.

He meets Butch, who is a street hustler. Suddenly he is introduced into a world of sex and drugs, and the two friends wind up falling for each other, until drugs push them apart. It's a gritty movie that is sometimes disturbing, but worth watching. Coming of age is a good way to describe it, to see how Cliff is at the start of the movie, then to see the kind of person he is at the end. I thought it was a nice movie, well written and well acted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything horrible about gay films all roled into one","review":"One positive thing about this movie, the only positive thing: Fehr did a great job acting. Other than that, there is no redeeming quality to this movie. I am not sure how anyone could confuse this with a love story. All the characters are selfish, irresponsible, miserable, depraved, and sad excuses for human beings. If you want to experience the depths of how low a man can go and still be alive, then this will satisfy. However, unless you want a movie that will leave you depressed over how gay men are portrayed in cinema and in the world and feel like beating yourself up for no good cause-----stay away. I am very sorry Fehr chose to make this film; I am more sorry that part of my life went to viewing it. As a gay man, I feel it is high time to create gay cinema that has positive characters and an uplifting, hopeful message. Not every gay man is miserable, suicidal, and drug addicted!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"The only redeeming quality about this movie is that Brendan Fehr is hot (and even that waned as he lapsed more and more into drug-induced psychosis). The first 30 minutes dragged, while I waited for some kind of plot to arrive, but I held on to some shred of hope. Over an hour later, as the credit rolled, I asked myself why I actually paid for this movie. Yeah, there are a couple of nice skin shots, but the drug use, manic behavior are just beyond me. Maybe I'm not abstract enough to get the point. This movie isn't nearly as endearing as I thought it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Empty","review":"This movie is all style and no substance. It relies on visual hurly burly alternating with visual stasis to make it seem as if something's happening. There's no story, or not enough. It plunges the main character into this world of hustlers and drugs and trannies without having really established who he is or why he's drawn to these people. Someone praised the script and the acting, but it felt like weak improv to me, and there's not much script to speak of. I watched Latter Days last week and that was much better--story, rich characterizations and real acting, not this posing and strutting and pouting."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Soft Porn Than Movie","review":"I enjoy softcore and hardcore pornography as much as any sexual gay male, but I, also, enjoy a provocative and challenging gay-related movie. This movie is unfortunately in a line of commercial gay films that titilate more than mentally or emotionally stimulate. The acting itself was not bad in itself, but the preponderance of substance abuse gives us the idea that all gay youth struggling for identity and acceptance turn to drugs for their journey to self-acceptance. The softcore pron in the movie was pleasant enough but was out of place for me. There are times when showing less is more creative and stimulating than showing it all. See the movie once, but I would recommend buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sand in the Sugar","review":"Q: What do you get when you mix a bad screenplay with no plot, unbelievable situations like the little sister, bad production values and scenes inserted only to shock (pardon the pun) like the servicing of the 500 lb. woman? A: Sugar!Cliff has an identity crisis. Big deal. So what? Which one of us hasn't at some point in our lives? So he turns to drugs and hustling. I know that was my chosen path of enlightenment.Unlikable characters, flimsy plot, bad production values (everything is so dark I had to adjust the brightness on my monitor) and situations that are so far-fetched they are more appropriate for a comic book. This trashy film asks us to suspend disbelief so often you'll feel like you were hired by your local electric company to string power lines.Other reviewers have called this film gritty. It's gritty, all right. Gritty like sand in your sugar."},{"rating":"1","title":"No words to explain how bad this movie is","review":"I gave it 1 star because there are no 0's. Absolutely horrible. No story line, extremely bad acting. Boring movie from start to finish. Do not buy this movie.

Then there was the beating and using of the older men by the 2 actors, which streched limits further but still not too bad. No the main point of the movie that made me say it has to stop is when pedophilia decided to come into play and i was basically blind-sided by the review i had read at the time. In the words of my friend when we took the video back, because i actually had to BUY this movie to watch it, we didn't really take kindly to pedophilia. If you are looking for a movie that will boggle your mind, i say you can try it, but for me...it just was a bit too much boggling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful!","review":"Enough already of this street-hustler, drug scene \\"coming of age\\" wannabes. It has been done much better in \\"Johns\\" and in Showtime's \\"Queer As Folk.\\" Brendan Fehr's performance is an embarrassment. Cookie, who sends her brother out to get some sex, is beyond belief. This movie has nothing to recommend it. No stars is my rating.

Unfortunately for me this movie was awful. My roommates and I watched this movie and none of us enjoyed it, there were moments when we felt like turning it off.

The characters just pick up and go on with their lives like nothing happened in the end leaving you to wonder how human can they really be? If you're looking for something with heart and content...wrong movie. If you're looking for something with these qualities and is erotic? Wrong movie. If you're looking for a movie with a let down ending and tons of graphic nauseating sex between Brendan Ferh and a large woman then here's your movie.

It blows away the crap that people call \\"indie\\" these days. Like that jerk off cash cow Conor Oberst. I Hate Rock N' Roll is IMHO one of the best songs ever written. This is one of the JAMC's best albums. Only a couple of their albums can rival this one. An amazing finale for this band. It's like one of their concerts; leaves you with a thirst for more, and the sensation of ringing feedback damaging your ears forever. Incredible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great finale for J&MC","review":"Cut about 4-5 songs of this album and rearrange the order of the songs, this album would have been one of the greatest of the 90's. Some of the songs are spectacular, like Cracking up, which is one of the greatest songs they ever did. I also like Virtually unreal, degenerate, birthday, moe tucker, commercial, dream lover, black, and I love/hate rocknroll. The brothers can produce great songs, either the experimental rock stuff and melodic songs with great melody. The most underrated band of all time when it comes to music, but the worst live band ever, which hurts their credibility. Otherwise, collecting all of the J&MC albums is a great investment if you like music. It does take a while to appreciate all of their stuff though, but once you do, you'll be amaze at their talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best...","review":"if not the best album in the history (past , present, or future) of music.oh, sure there are plenty of songs out there that are better than any one song on this album, but as a whole, nothing compares.just buy it, & be happy (or sad).stranded on a deserted island & only have have one album to pick to have with you? this is it.1,000,000 stars out of 5.but after thinking about it a bit, some of their other albums are even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'M AFRAID IT CAN'T GET ANY BETTER!","review":"JAMC is truly better than ever, and this album has rightfully earned it's great reviews!

It is probably best listened to by those safely past the sort of emotional crises depicted, since anyone in their throes may find the record simply too painful. Fortunately, such topics as suicide are not romanticized--the victim is found in the garage, by the chicken wire and the spare tires, hardly a glamorous departure. Nevertheless, the music's surfaces are all quite pretty, complete with strings and tasteful flourishes. Pernice's voice is well-suited to the material (one wonders which came first, in fact.)

I highly recommend readers stay away from this book or else they too will get a misunderstanding of what the Bible really says; they'll be deceived too if they read this book. \\"Solving the Puzzle of Revelation\\" is a deceptive title and the book's content sharply contrasts the title.

He calls us to contextually look into a scripture that we so often literalisticly destroy with our narrow linear interpretations. BUT...if Sprong and others are right, that the bible is not the \\"Word of God\\", and Jesus was not the ACTUAL Son of God...than anything we choose to think or do is valid because we are under no authority (save what society deems lawful) other than our own conscience and our own personal interpretation of right/wrong and an ambigious personal definition of \\"God is Love\\".This is not the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitions please!","review":"Well, one must ask the Rt. Rev. Spong what a fundamentalist is? According to this book, anyone who considers Jesus Christ as Lord or the Bible as the Inspired and Truthful Word of God, is a fundamentalist. As a faithful believer in the Reformed Faith, I find it hard to identify with my brethern on the far right...as well as pseudochristians on the far left. I'm as much of a fundamentalist...as Spong is a Christian. A Christian isn't just a person who does good works (although they are worthy of praise)--A Christian is in a relationship with God. This book views such a loving (and real) relationship with a living God as worthy of contempt. If you're looking for a passionate voice of Christian thought, see Barthe, Bonhoffer, or Lewis. Spong may as very well be agnostic after writing such a book as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT Fundamentalism?","review":"The title of this book is misleading; it might be better titled \\"Delievering the Bible to the Unitarians\\", because it is more of an argument for his position than an argument against \\"fundamentalists\\", who are painted broadly and inaccurately.

His earliest doubts about the inerrancy of the Bible as a literal document resulted not from the influence of the outside world, but from the Bible's intrinsic conflicts.Internal contradictions, pre-scientific assumptions, and pre-second-century social thought are all barriers to the modern Christian's literal acceptance of the Bible. Therefore Bishop Spong rightly employs them to underline his point that there must be a better way to understand Western civilization's most important book.RESCUING THE BIBLE FROM FUNDAMENTALISM is an earnest attempt to give thinking Christians a way to get beyond the humanly limited dimensions of the Bible, and into the inspired ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fundamentalism is the true Satan of religion","review":"Whether you are a Christian, a Moslem or an Atheist, fundamentalism is the destroyer that walks among us.

In my opinion, this book belongs in the library of ANY Roman Catholic or Anglo Catholic. Many people become frustrated that the Gospels vary in facts. Bishop Spong helps to solve this quite vividly. (Even a real obtuse person could finally understand why the Gospels are so different.) Mark basically wrote the facts without any other intentions. Matthew wrote in a way that compared Christ to Moses. (This way the Jews who became followers of Christ would be able to see Christianity as the fulfillment of Judaism.) Luke used beautiful images and language. (His goal was to make peace between the Jews who became followers of Christ and the Gentiles who became followers of Christ.) John wrote in a hostile tone.

Theologically speaking, he is still in childhood, and has not grown up. His critics are not primarily fundamentalists, but university scholars such as Richard Hays of Duke or Luke Timothy Johnson of Emory.

HOWEVER - Spong's true agenda of self agrandizement grows continually more event in his near industrial output of anti-divinity, anti-morality, clubby social activism oriented writings. This book is wonderful if you're an athiest wanting to debunk any possibility of the devine nature of God, Christ and the Trinity --- while still wanting to hold onto some of the Bible's calls for social justice by turning the Christian church into a vehicle to promote radial social liberalism.

In choosing to claim that the Bible is not inerrant, the Bishop accuses the Bible of saying things that it does not say. The Bible never condones incest, slavery or polygamy. The Bible includes these stories so that we might see the consequences of foolish choices without having to make the choices ourselves. In claiming to rescue the Bible from fundamentalism Bishop Spong is doing a grave disservice to God, Christians and non Christians.

Unfortunately, he's still bound to the corpse of Christianity, and believes it can be resurrected. I would recommend that people read the book, but don't buy into the malarkey that Christianity must be saved or evil will befall the human race.

Next thing we know, he's going to be telling us how the believers of Hinduism are believe in the same God as Christians and that they have a similar theology. Remember, just because the Bible lists events that are less than savory (lets face it, who gets encouraged by war and destruction), it is important to keep in mind that the Bible is also a historical record (read, just because it talks about something does not mean that it condones what happened, but rather it just tells you it happens).

I got it yesterday and installed it today. My Titan now sounds amazing! There is way more power and more sound. I dont know about the gas mileage but I dont care about it so much yet. It was very easy to install. I did it all by myself in about 1 1/2 hours. The only reason it took that long is I broke a bolt taking one hanger off. PB blaster is your friend, trust me. All you'll need is a 9/16 socket/ 14mm socket and a 1/2 socket and a little strength and you'll have it set. If you have a chance to use a lift use it, I didnt even jack mine up at all which made it a little challenging taking the old system out. I am VERY happy with the Banks Monster system. When you are done you'll need to reset your ECU which is easy. Go to google and look it up, it takes less then a minute.

The writing was dry between the tutor and student but the story part, the \\"history\\" was well written. Unfortunately, the history part is at best only partially correct or flat out incorrect.

Long story short: second hole... not so easy. Why? Because the first hole took ever piece of grit from the cutting surface. What does that mean? That means i can no longer put holes in things at a 5/16\\" size.If you want to pay a lot for a disposable one time use hole drill bit... then these are for YOU!If you want to pay a lot for something that you will have for years, or even days.. then look elsewhere.Super disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked Perfect!!","review":"I bought this set of Diamond Holesaws to cut holes in wine bottles to make them into lamps. My husband used a drill press to cut the holes and I misted them with water as he was cutting.

This elminated the wine bottle from moving and you also didn't need to clamp the bottle itself. These holesaws are definitely worth every penny. They worked great.

That is what reading this book is like. Pronzini takes us one step at a time from the suicide of the 'jackpot' winner to the endgame of how it all came about. Most of the time we are moving forward like a shark, as \\"Nameless\\" finds out that he is still affected by what happened to him (in Shackles) psychically when he was held for three months in a house in the mountains. Though he feels better, physically he is doing great, he does find that he has some ways to go before he can feel 'comfortable in his own skin' again.

Carmen is unsure of her relationship with Anthony, not to mention his mother is a B****, who can't stand her because she's Latina.

Erica is still hurt over her ex Kenny cheating on her and getting another woman pregnant, when he pops back up in her life after 2 years, she doesn't know how to act.

The author never gave me a chance. The narrator would introduce a new character, sleep with him, split up, mourn his passing, and be re-united all in the span of about six pages. Finally I could take no more and actually threw the hardback book in the trash.

Man ruins the Earth, leaves Earth for the stars, tackles the problems of time travel through an intergrated form of speech-like alchemy, rediscovers a still populated Earth but does not belive it to be the Earth of myth, renames Earth as there are already hundreds of planets in the universe laying claim to that distinction, unifies the universe, institutes galactic warfare as a necessary economical device, and destroys the universe in a truely unique battle against man's successor.

This period has long been a subject of interest to me despite the fact that I'm too young (and geographically challenged) to have seen most of the programs in the first place.Besides being a linked series of show business biographies of key figures of the time (The Beyond the Fringe foursome, etc), the book raises some good discussion.Just how much does satire really matter, if it does at that? As Peter Cook used to say, the peak of satire was 1930's Berlin--and look how much that did to prevent the rise of Hitler.But the best part of the text may be the final chapter, which paints an unflattering picture of the state of the art in 2000-era Great Britain--and it's sobering how much of it applies to the US as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"weird fabric","review":"I feel like these are a knock off hard tail.

This pan handles so many tasks, and this one pan can easily take the place of two pieces, i.e. a wok pan and a large frying pan. I love that it has tall sides so food doesn't slip over the sides as sometimes happens with a frying pan. Plus, the higher sides keep splatters from getting all over my stove top. The larger capacity also allows me to cook many dishes that wouldn't fit into a frying pan for stove top cooking.The pan, like all of those in the Anolon Advanced line, is a high quality, solid piece that will last.

For clarity, the author backs up every major point pertaining to a given aspect of immigration/naturalization procedures and rules with a real-life example. The less one knows about immigration/naturalization laws, the more helpful this book will be.

It gave me confidence to reach my goals and not let anything get in my way."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of three great love song collections","review":"Love Bites, along with Monster Ballads, and Power Ballads, is one of the three great love ballad collections from the eighties. Here one finds compelling compositions that actually led me to chase down other compositions from some of the artists, such as Cinderella (overall an estimable band, but with three great songs, including \\"Nobody's Fool\\", \\"Don't know what you got til it's gone\\", and \\"It's gonna be a long cold winter without your love\\"). \\"Good-bye\\" by Enuff z'Enuff is exceptional, and many of the songs similarly do not fit one genre, but stand as a tribute to the ability of hard-rock bands to make great love songs, simply by the power of their slo-mo exectuion. Well worth the buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torture.","review":"This is the first, and only book I have read by Andrew Greely. I only finished the book because I thought it had to get better and I always try to finish a book I have started. The characters were shallow, the plot predictable. I never was able to relate to Pat or Kevin in any way and by the end of the book was happy to be rid of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cardinal Snooze!","review":"I found this book in the free book bin at work, so I thought I'd give it a whirl. The beginning and middle were okay, and I kept reading in hopes that the plot would pick up. It didn't -- and, in fact, got WORSE! Greeley began introducing more and more characters, all with similar (and hard to pronounce) names. The plot was jumpy, and I found myself skipping the \\"really boring\\" parts about the papal election to get to the \\"just plain boring\\" parts about the other characters. And the end, WHAT END? Nothing was resolved! Not that I minded. By the end of this 500+ pager, I was ready to call it quits no matter what happened! The only good thing about this book, in my opinion, is that I didn't pay for it. I think I'll put it back in the free book bin where I found it and let another poor sap suffer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the Andrew Greeley reader","review":"I heard Andrew Greeley once in a speech he gave to diocesan priests of the Diocese of Helena, MT in the Carroll College cafeteria in 1966.

However, from the first page, I felt like I was back on a ship and was reliving my own first tour on a ship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent space-based military fiction","review":"I picked up this book not sure what to expect; I was hoping for something mildly entertaining.What I found instead is an extremely taut, well-written, suspenseful story of a junior ensign aboard a military space ship patrolling the solar system.While somewhat lacking in \\"hard science\\", it is a terrific tale of the stresses of the military, legalities of conflict, and the behavior of individuals under trying circumstances.Although the characterizations were somewhat cliched (sneaky rivals, martinet commanders, Captain Queeg, etc.), I was very impressed with the author's structure and pacing of the novel. I got the sense that it was like a fictionalization of a real-life event. The situations and resolution rang true.I literally couldn't put this book down. I had nearly the same sense of enjoyment that I had when I read my first Hornblower book. I'll definitely be looking for more books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent introduction to the Old Testament","review":"This book offers a wonderful introduction to the lessons of the Old Testament. It avoids missing the forest for the trees, while still giving specific biblical stories, and it never loses sight of the Old Testament's relevance to the modern world. The book takes a semi-chronological look at the books of the Old Testament, hilighting stories and lessons of particular interest. A wonderful way to come to the Bible for the first time, or to gain a greater understanding of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Little Tool!","review":"I had one of these for years, until it up and vanished recently (I blame my brother). Was heartbroken until I thought to check here, and of course Amazon had it. Ordered 2, one for the basement shop, one for the garage. Its utility cannot be overstated. Apart from the obvious decal and glass scraping, it's proven quite useful for all sorts of less obvious jobs, including finish trimming of mouldings and other soft wood. Although it has a storage compartment in the handle, I find it quicker to simply flip the blade around in the clamp when I want to store it.

I am 66 and have drank an ocean full of coffee in my life time. It gets the water hot enough to do what the water is suppose to do to coffee, extract the flavor. This coffee was actually so good that I contemplated buying another to have as a spare if this one quit.This fond affection lasted only for a short time. I have had this coffee maker for about 4-6 weeks. Gradually, the coffee started to taste a little strange, like plastic. It even smells like plastic. Now it is undrinkable.The other problem is that the carafe needs a serious redesign. It is practically impossible to clean and you will spill coffee all over your counter until you program yourself on how to pour the coffee.

I once removed an object that was about 3/16 of an inch in diameter and used five Dynaplugs to fill the hole. It was for a co-worker and I told him to have the tire replaced right away. Of course he ignored me and drove it for weeks before replacing it. The tire never lost air and got him back and forth to work every day until he woke up and replaced it. I have five vehicles and would not be without one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work extremely well on run flat tires!!","review":"Used this tool and the plugs on a BMW and a Corvette. Both had $200 and $300 run flat tires. You remove the screw/nail in the tire, load the tool with the plug, insert it into the tire and slowly remove the tool. The plug stays in the tire and stops the air. You may need to use two or three plugs, but eventually when you spray soapy water on the leak there are no more bubbles forming = no more air leak! I've saved $500 with this tool...yes...5 solid stars!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Simple and Easy Solution","review":"My Problem: Slow leak in tubeless motorcycle tire.Cause: Nail in tread area of tire.Solution: One Dynaplug in where the nail came out, following very carefully the instructions included w/the kit.NOTE. It is important to observe the angle at which the puncture-causing object went in so that the plug can be inserted with relative ease into that same path. Be certain that the cord end of the plug is inserted into the insertion tube until the base of the metal tip on the plug is in firm contact w/the top of the tube. If water is available, wet the exterior of the insertion tube to provide some lubrication to ease the insertion process, which still may take a considerable amount of force. To preserve most of the air remaining in the tire, the offending object should not be removed completely until one is ready to immediately insert the Dynaplug."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Insurance","review":"I have heard from other motorcyclists that the Dynaplug is the best tire plugger for the $ available. I got it for my motorcycles, which of course don't have spares. Haven't actually had to use it - yet - myself, but I'm giving it five stars based on other reports I've heard plus it appears to be very easy to use.

The tip broke off inside of the tire and the stem, which is suposed to stop up the hole, remained inside of the tool and I couldn't get it out. With my purchase plus shipping, it was a total waste. I had to purchase a liquid tire plug, which did work well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the cost!","review":"Tried this device after good reviews. I definitely do NOT recommend to anyone!! Take your tire to a gas station or any reputable mechanic to do a patch job for $15-20. This product is trash. I am a DIYer and it sounds simple enough but it does not work. Ended up using all 3 plugs in the kit and tire still leaked (a bit slower) but still leaking tire after using the product. I had a nail which I removed, heard the air rushing out, followed the directions, and lost 2 of 3 plugs in the tire. The 3rd plug did not \\"catch\\" as described and basically was a piece of \\"chewing gum\\" stuck over the hole in the tire. At least it was a fairly inexpensive lesson to date and my tires only have about 5-10k left on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easier than a traditional plug","review":"After reading previous reviews, I bought this as cheap insurance and a week later my car had a flat tire(!?!). I would agree with other reviews, this tool makes plugging a tire very easy.Unfortunately, the tire is flat again after a month. I'm not going to blame the tool (yet) since I haven't looked to see if it's a failed plug, or more nails/screws.Definitely faster than a traditional plug.As usual, I received the item from Amazon quickly and with no issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leak plugged but still leaking","review":"I had a simple nail puncture and plugged it with one Dynaplug. It continued a slow leak so put another plug in the hole. It still leaked. I took the tire and wheel to a professional tire store where it was repaired with a patch on the inside of the tire. After a week or more of usage it has retained the tire pressure and now believe it is good. I think the Dynaplug is ok for a temperary fix but is too porous for a no leak long term repair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointed","review":"Purchased these tire repair plugs for my motorcycle. Lucky for me I was at home when I first used them.Basically, the sticky plug did not insert into the puncture far enough to prevent air from leaking out when the tire was inflated. The metal point went in after some hard pushing and turning. Seemed that the hole made by the roofing nail was smaller than the tool diameter.I tried 3 times using new plugs and each time following the directions. Finally, I was able to push the third plug in further than the tool had, enough to stop air from leaking.Now going to have the shop put a patch on the inside of the tire because I do not trust the plug.I have had better luck with the plugs you fold in half and center on the tool then insert, twist and pull the tool out, leaving the plug in the tire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used once already","review":"Purchased this as a just in case and already used it on a friend's car.

Finally after it just started to go in, the metal tube on the Dynaplug tool buckled and bent over. The tool simply is not strong enough to work unless the leak is large enough. If they had simply used a stronger tube on the tool, it would have been a great tool. As it is, it is worthless, and you cannot depend upon a tool that breaks so easily when repairing a typical flat.What a waste. Good thing I had my motorcycle tire plug kit with me, as it worked perfectly due to a better design.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"dynaplug fantastica","review":"Was looking for a tire repair that would hold and be easy to use.

What a deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of money","review":"I bought these Dynaplugs based on the reviews and thought I would have an easier time with plugging tires due to the sharp tip. Well I was TOTALLY wrong, I could not even get one (1) of the plugs into the handle in order to attempt a repair, each of the 4 (very short, skinny) plugs were limp and could not be inserted. I was really flabergasted! How can anyone say this worked. I had to end up buying the trusted old repair tools for about $10 with 5 plugs that work. I was really surprized at the size of these plugs, they are TINY, they will probably only work on a lawn mower tire of something that small, IF you get it inserted! NEVER again will I try the Dynaplug."},{"rating":"2","title":"Permanent fix?","review":"So it's Friday afternoon when my low tire light comes on.

Did the repair in under 5 min. That night I drove over 100 miles. Since then, I have driven 2500 miles without loosing air. Until this morning. I was parked on the plug all weekend, and this morning was down 7 psi. Filled it up and drove 150 miles today. It's time for a new tire, but I'm thrilled with the plug.

I was surprised by how easy the recipes are - and the outcome is extraordinary. Everything I have tried, from roasted apples, to the arugula and pomegranate salad, to braised short-ribs, has been outstanding. I found the directions crystal clear. And, the few times the ingredients were not readily at hand, the substitution was obvious (vanilla ice cream that I bought at the store instead of home-made cinnamon was just fine with the roasted apples).

It's is very well structured and I have 'discovered' many new symphonists to listen to, which aren't covered in more popularist books on this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Switches broke on first use","review":"cast metal housing with bend tabs broke and spring and switch guts shot everywhere.

I've listened with pleasure to many of the products of the Exchange, as well as later work by the group's alumni(ae).Since many of the tracks on the album were recorded in home studios rather than in professional recording studios, the audio quality of the tracks vary somewhat.

And some of the tracks are simply not \\"classic disco\\" by any known definition of the term: what is Sometimes by Max Q? Yes's Owner of a Lonely Heart, anyone?

We use the rack with rental cars and it even works on the slanted roof PT Cruiser. The racks stay fastened to the roof even when the kayak is not on. They attach and detach easily and quickly. I mounted some Yakima land shark saddles on them. The only negative is that the rubber pads don't attach firmly and have a tendency to fall off when I am dismounting the racks. I tried glueing them on, but that didn't work either.

Great rap, Paul can rap, better than most rappers, which isn't hard to do, but still pretty cool.Unfortunately, the Myspace syndrome starts kicking in and the CD goes downhill, literally. By the end of the album you're praying for the ride to stop, not because it's scary and unknown, but because it's frankly boring. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Paul Wright, his first two albums are excellent! But Myspace has taken away his talent. Now he is nothing more than a quickly fading memory.

The poor recording is, of course, not the fault of the company making the CD. The recordings are made from old originals that were made with primitive equipment in primitive conditions. There is no arguing that the music is historically significant. But, I was hoping that there might be one or two songs I could consider listenable. Each year I search for obscure music to add to a large collection of holiday CD's. This one, unfortunately, will not be one that I count among the worthwhile purchases.

It is important to us to keep all the parts (4 legs and windguard) together in one place for ease of setup and takedown so we drilled two holes through the table and made a bracket that attaches the windguard and the legs to the bottom of the table for transport.

However, it wants to teach how to write device drivers, and here it falls far from its goal. When writing a Linux device driver, there is a \\"how\\", but there is, perhaps more important, a \\"how _not_\\" (for instance, don't do noninterruptible blocking system calls) which are either glossed over, or done wrong in the examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vauge","review":"The stuff in this book is explained in a complex manner.

Chapters 1 through 3 present the flow of processes in Linux and introduce the operation of system calls, wait queues,etc. The chapter on the file system was very well done, however, the chapter on memory management left me with more questions than answers...it needs a little more work. The book requires a pretty good knowledge of C and some prior knowledge of OS's in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a teaching book","review":"I don't think this book teaches the Linux kernel at all. The writing is hard to understand and there is a total lack of examples. Some times they would pull out pieces of Linux source code and call that an example. At other times they would give you a theoretical three paragraph discussion and call that an example. I guess technically they did give an example, but those examples don't teach because they are too hard. Books are suppose to give easy examples that get progressively harder instead of dumping the real thing at you right-a-way.The book is really for people who already knows Linux or Unix and need to look up what a particular function do (because Kernel function are not in the \\"man\\" pages) The only good part about this book is that the index is very complete so you can look up an unknown function quickly - that's basically why I kept the book.

He spontaneously started singing to Julian 'Hey, Jude, don't make it bad...' and the rest was musical history. When he played the song to John Lennon, John thought it was a song about him! Anyway, the sound quality on this album makes 'Hey Jude' and several other tracks really shine - they were all cut from the original master tapes so you really hear the pristine Beatles sound. The inclusion of great rarities like 'The Inner Light' and 'You Know My Name (Look Up The Number)' makes this an essential purchase for Beatles completists - and these albums aren't a bad intro for first-time listeners, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will leave you smiling","review":"The tracks on this album are incredibly hard to find. This is the Beatles as they really were, not after the polishing or adjusting for various markets. A classic is 'You Know My Name', I heard this played constantly when a bartender in a pub in Salisbury, it was a forgotten memory until today. It reminds you that the Beatles did not always take themselves seriously. Or take Rain, possibly the best ever single released by the Fab Four. You could go out and buy the Blue Album which has most of these tracks, however the packaging and selection is better on this, plus no self-respecting Beatles fan owns either the Blue or Red album.For the die hard Beatles fan these records are the heart and soul of the band. If you ever tire of hearing the hits, this will liven up your soul and leave you smiling, for a long time"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Excellent Compilation","review":"This CD is essential. From the kickin' Daytripper to the nutty You Know My Name (Look Up the Number), every recording is excellent. My only regret is that there isn't a recording of the beautiful Across the Universe without any tampering. Oh well. It is still one of the two greatest compilations of rock singles ever (guess what the other one is)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Inner Light","review":"Most of the songs on this disc have always been available on LP. But this disc contains two songs that were never on any LP. You Know My Name (Look Up the Number) is an interesting novelty piece, but basically a throw-away. The Inner Light, on the other hand, is a great Harrison song.The Inner Light is the main reason to buy this disc.Also, if you feel that it is essential to have cd versions of great Beatle songs like Hey Jude and Rain, this is a good disc to have.My disc is broken. It won't play Hey Jude. So I have to take away one star in my rating. Otherwise, this is a five star disc. I don't blame The Beatles for my defective cd, but my rating system is tough. I don't give five stars easily.----Update: I have recently bought Past Masters vol. 1, and there are no defects on that disc (so far)."},{"rating":"1","title":"product poorly listed","review":"was not tagged as being for a long water pump in the listing...I needed a pulley for a short water pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"This release is for serious fans of Haujobb only.

To fix it will cost about $170 and is not covered by the warranty (there are scratches on the camera so they assume you dropped it - I didn't). On another note, the included 4 mb memory stick is too low. You have to buy a separate 128 mb stick to take a decent number of photos (Lexar sells one for about $50 that worked fine).

The USB port on that computer fried so we got a new desktop with Windows XP. The camera was not recognized so we called Sony. After trying 10 different things with a tech guy he told us it was our computer's fault. We got on the phone with Dell, who told us it was Sony's fault (of course).I borrowed my father's Kodak, plugged it in and it worked fine! I've now been on the phone with Sony for 1.5 hours (and counting) explaining the problem. At each step I've been told there are sometimes problems with hardware.... So what! Fix it!

However, under the extended warranty no lemon policy, after this 3rd attempt to fix the problem, I will be able to get a full purchase price credit towards a new camera of my choice.

Presto!The camera started working, the LCD screen came on and I was able to take pictures and review them. Thanks to the reviewers who mentioned hitting the camera.Until today, I dreaded the thought of having to purchase another camera after only 2 years use. I have too much invested in memory sticks, Nimh batteries, & a reader. I just hope it continues to work.

Sometimes it leaks more on the blanket than in the baby's mouth.Let's face it, come on, make a product that works first, then we can talk about performance.

The central focal point is so small that everything around it blurs drastically. Fourth, the minimum focal distance is about 6 feet, anything closer doesn't focus at all.Bottom line, paying $200 to look through a straw where everything is blurry sucks.The worst buy i've done in years (and I've shopped a bunch).

Banners covers the war in Tennessee and Kentucky from immediately after Shiloh through Bragg's and Edmund Kirby Smith's invasion of Kentucky to Stones River. The author depicts Bragg as an excellent strategist, but worthless as a tactician. My appreciation for the logistical problems in Tennessee and the Civil War in general continues to rise. I guess I am working my way backwards through the series, since I read Crisis in Command (the Chickamauga, Chattanooga and Knoxville campaign) first, and am now reading Struggle for the Heartland (Fts Henry and Donelson through Shiloh). Each book in the series has a different author, but all are excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting!","review":"Voyeurism \\"Come and see what I have in my pockets, sleeves, boxes etc...Don't be afraid little boys and girls.

It avoids the speculative, controversial and metaphysical conclusions found in Stephen J. Gould's A Wonderful Life and Simon Conway-Morris's Crucible of Creation and presents a superior first look at the remarkable Cambrian flora and fauna. The Fossils of the Burgess Shale begins with a simple, clearly written presentation of the site, chronology of fieldwork and the geologic essentials. The bulk of the book (199 pages) is dedicated to a celebration of the amazing life forms that have been uncovered. Fine B&W photography of selected fossils coupled with beautiful line-art reconstructions provides a visual framework that supports the highly informative and concise text. After reading this book, readers who wish to expand their knowledge of the subject will be well-prepared for the more personal interpretations of Gould and Conway-Morris."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diggin' The Trancing Queen","review":"I really enjoy ABBA and I really enjoy dance music, so as you can imagine I was excited to listen to this package.

The dialogue is stilted and unbelievable. The acting is comparable to what one might expect to see in a porno flick, which this is not, of course. The writer/director takes pride in stating his belief that \\"nudity is only a distraction,\\" but I doubt if even nudity could have helped this movie since only one of the actors (Ames) has any sex appeal whatsoever (keep your shirt on, Sean). The writer/director says he had intended to cast gay men in the leading roles but that the straight actors he chose were the best actors of those he auditioned. Maybe so, but the actor selected to play the hustler is miscast, for it seems unlikely that this hustler could command $1000 for an all-night stay. Another bit of miscasting is the actress who plays the part of the hustler's girlfriend -- she looks more like his mother.

Unfortunately it's so bad that it actually distracts you from the story.The story, on the other hand, isn't terrible.

Also, he can take a rest and make the flow completely STOP like he can when he is breastfeeding. Also, the top of the nipple is more flat like an actual breast.

I waited until my baby was 5 weeks old to use these because I thought the flow might be too much for her. She didn't have any problem with them as they are still slow. They probably speed up feeding time by 5 or 10 minutes. The baby has had no problem with Avent bottles and nipples. Sometimes they leak so you have to check them before you give them to baby. The remedy is simple...just unscrew the nipple holder and screw it back in and make sure it is tight. I would definitely recommend avent nipples and bottles. These nipples probably aren't a necessity, but they do get the baby used to a quicker flow."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"Do yourself a favor and save some money.

However our newborn is now here and wasn't putting on enough weight. Our pediatrician told us these are the worse brand of bottles on the market for newborns and shouldn't be used until the baby is at least 5 months old. The reason for this is because the nipple is too large for a newborn to latch on to and they're unable to get enough. We are now using the Medela nipples instead and he's feeding so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bottle nipple","review":"This is a good bottle nipple which of course fits the phillips avent bottles. Even though this is a slow flow nipple my 3 month old baby did and still at 4 months does struggle with it on occasion for being too fast.

Most annoying: the software did not ask (or check) to see if I had an existing Internet connection, but assumed I was on dialup and tried to dial my modem (I then had to use Task Manager to end the program.) I found the humor in the cards to be crass and insulting, with very few \\"sentimental\\" cards appropriate for an older person.

He twitches and mugs and generally displays personal characteristics that would make most of us cringe....Just another of those gay versus the religous fundamentalist movies, not funny, not clever,badly acted and embarassing...Hard to take gay cinema seriously when tripe like this keeps getting released. There must be better screenwriters out there than what is presented here.

For years, I have enjoyed Matthew Montgomery as an actor. I have happily written glowing reviews of him. But, in this film he was horribly miscast and / or mis-directed. His over-acting a la Jerry Lewis and his endless facial mugging were just too much. Mind you, this whole film is a loser. The screenplay is all over the place and the film has no center. It goes off in a bunch of unsatisfying directions : romance, slapstick comedy, political, and more. Very little is believable, even when we are supposed to be serious.Most of the characters are either caricatures or downright unpleasant. The drag performer who sings the same song poorly over and over and who waxes philosophically got old in the very first minutes but then went on to be a major character in the film.

But it could've definitely spent some more time in the editing room. It probably could've stood to be trimmed by about twenty minutes. It is nowhere near as bad as some people on this site are saying, though. It's just too long, and not enough time is spent on the romantic escapades of Montgomery's and Stickles's characters.

Although I noticed it said \\"Diaper Genie XL\\" on the package, I didn't realize it was a new model, and I didn't know it wouldn't fit the old ones too. I really think they should clearly state this on the front of the package so that people don't get taken for a ride. The new refill canister is only off by a fraction of an inch, which leads me to believe that Playtex did this thinking they would make more money by everybody going out to buy a new Diaper Genie. Instead, I went out and bought a Diaper Champ from Baby Trend. It works just as well as the Diaper Champ at controlling odor, but it's easier to use (one-handed operation) and the biggest plus is that it uses regular bags--no special liners to buy. Ha!

I have to admit that I am very pleased thus far regarding how well they contain the diaper odor.

My biggest complaint is that they should make the last 2 feet of the roll of film pink or something so that you know when it is about to run out.

I ended up cutting each piece a little longer then my final cut and went back for the 45Deg cut. Not a big issue but is worth noting. I imagine this is a common problem with most 10\\" saws. The additional cost of a 12\\" saw in conjunction with the extra cost of blades would not be worth the slight inconvenience of the problem I encountered."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Experience with the Bosch 4410L","review":"For starters, please pay close attention to several reviews of the Bosch 4410 (which is essentially the same saw minus the laser) by professional finish carpenters. It is true that everybody has biases, but overall, if the pros don't like it, chances are you won't in the long run.I picked up my Bosch 4410L at the freight depot on the way to the job-site one morning a couple weeks ago. It arrived in great condition - thanks Amazon! I was excited to try out my new saw. Well, I have to say that despite all the great design concepts that the Bosch has, its actual performance fell far short of expecations. This 500.00 saw was not nearly as accurate as my 199.00 RIDGID chop saw! The cuts were wavy, probably due to the issues noted in some of the other reviews. For fine trim work, this saw is unacceptable, which is a shame because I really liked some of the features. I sent the Bosch back the next day and got a Hitachi C10FSH. I'm glad I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great saw","review":"After deciding on the 10\\" instead of the 12\\", I was very pleased with the weight difference and don't think I'm going to miss the larger capacity. I will be using this saw on site and found it easy to transport. The accuracy seems to be fine as we were installing some large crown molding in a Kitchen and other trim work. I haven't found any drawbacks yet but had to get used to all of the controls. The versatility is truly remarkable. After trying some other saws, I'm very pleased with this selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dual Bevel Sliding Compound Miter Saw","review":"I have only one thing to say about this saw, \\"I wish I had bought this years ago!\\" very few adjustments were needed to get this up and running - laser guide is an excellent feature, but cut several scraps to get used to it. This saw has so many useful features I can tell it is going to take some time to become proficient with it. I have tried hooking my vacuum up to the exhaust but have yet to find the right size adapter. If this saw breaks down I will purchase another immediately. Nice sliding mechanism, accurate cuts, good power. If you are a serious craftsman do not buy anything less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bosh 4410L","review":"This is one excellent piece of machinery. I evaluated multiple products before selecting the Bosch. Quality tools help produce quality work. Even though there are extensive direction for making adjustments this tool was ready to go right out of the box. I was cutting trim molding for my home in record time. The sliding mechanism and bevel are easy to adjust and smooth as silk. Highly recommend. Would have given it a prefect score except the laser seems to be an add on and not an integrated part of the saw. The laser line does not mark the exact point that the blade is going to cut so you need to learn to adjust for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great saw","review":"I am amazed there is such a difference of opinion about this saw. In my case, it required only minor adjustment right out of the box. After several months of use, the saw still cuts dead-on 90 degrees without any adjustment. I especially like the micro adjustment feature and use it frequently. Some complaints such as dust collection and less than premium saw blade are common to most saw brands. Really, to effectively collect fine dust from a miter saw you need to fit a dust hood behind the saw hooked to a very powerful dust collector. I agree with most of the positive comments other reviewers have made about the saw and would certainly buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality Workhorse Saw","review":"I've been using this saw for 14 months. It has lived up to Bosch's reputation for high quality. The miter detents and manual micro adjust make for near perfect cuts. The front adjustability features are time saving and the adjustable slide handle makes for comfortable use with either hand. I use this saw on job sites on a hand built stand. I've cut everything from crown and baseboard to 2 X 12 and 4 X 4's with it. It has never bound or overheated. I found the laser to be a little gimmicky; it's hard to see in bright light and not as reliable as lining up cuts by sight with blade on the piece. The dust collection bag catches only about 20% of the saw dust, not a problem outside but messy in the shop. For indoor/shop use I would recommend a vacuum suction collection system, for which Bosch provides an attachment. The included blade is good for general purpose cutting. A strong saw and a good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great saw!","review":"I am a professional trim carpenter. I have used several different slide miter saws and this is definitely the best. The up front controls are great for bevel cuts. The open sight line in the blade guard is a super idea. I'm not so impressed with lasers for accurate cuts, but you can leave it off. This is one nice saw. The only draw back is the weight, but that is a minor issue for a high end saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great buy!","review":"i did a lot of reading up on Compound Sliding Miter Saws and went with the Bosch. i was on a budget, but dont mind spending the money if i only have to do it once. the Bosch arrived on time and was in perfect shape. i spent a few hours and was pleased to find it only needed minnimal correction to make a true cut. it has plenty of power and makes a great cut in both rough lumber and fine trim. i would recommend a higher quality blade for fine trim work tho. i am very pleased with Bosch on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This company never SENT it, even after contacting them (as you recommended)","review":"I responded to Amazpn's earlier request to me that the company sent me the wrong item.

Waiting for the paperbacks puts me woefully behind the eBooks, this I know, but my patience has been consistently rewarded with each new publication.In Book Three, we get eBook stories 9-12, and each one is a separate little thrill ride into the S.C.E. universe. And I guess what I'm most impressed with is the continuity of character development and growth throughout each author's writing. That can't be an easy task, especially when the authors are also charged with writing a compelling plot.If you're like me and don't really care for the eBook format, but are interested in learning about the Starfleet team that goes in to clean up the messes, I *highly* recommend these books.

It is WORSE. Period. No excuses. I read the book in about 8 hours, and I have to admit that after reading 1/2 of it, I felt sorry for whoever is preparing the written CCIE exam and actually uses this books. There's hardly one page (no kidding) without an error. Not talking about syntax errors - talking about conceptual errors, half digested ideas.I want my money back - this books actually deserves -1 stars.

His explanations constantly repeat and contradict each other and even go against the core Wing Chun principles (see the Bil Jee form photos for examples).This book is either evidence that Cheung has become too sidetracked in his own patchy modifications or that Cheung never knew traditional Wing Chun in the first place.One star for making a cheap bookend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bil Jee, Don't Be a Hero!","review":"This book is possibly the greatest book ever written about people poking each other with their fingers."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"you've heard of YLT... don't know which album to buy... sometimes a band's first album is arguably the best... such is not the case for this YLT album. buy anything later than 1990 and you'll hear why lotsa people dig 'em."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Insightful","review":"As a parent of a learning disabled child myself, I found Anne Ford's willingness to share her story incredibly helpful and insightful, and I'd like to personally thank her for it.

As the mother of a daughter with learning disabilities, it was amazing to read about how similar she is to Allegra. It helps to be able to validate your thoughts, feelings and concerns by reading about the experience of another mother. Anne Ford is able to clearly and accurately articulate what it's like to raise a child with learning disabilities which is something not all of us can really define.

After refunding my purchase Amazon added 'Volume 1' to this title's description.I contacted the Chicago based Museum of Radio and TV and was told that the publication is no longer in their hands.

Contemporary issues, social and historical issues, theological controveries, all are in this book as well as the nature of Baha'i administration, social organization, scriptural descriptions, relations with other religions, etc. It is an excellent book and useful to academics and students of the Baha'i Faith.

We like the coffee maker even though it is difficult to get the carafe in and out. That is what lead to dropping the carafe and breaking it.

(Our carafe did have a piece break off earlier than that, too.) When asking customer service if it was normal for their coffee makers to die so soon, I was answered with \\"well, mam, they aren't supposed to last forever.\\" In my opinion it should last more than 2 years. Oh well. We're going to try a different brand this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment this coffee maker turned out to be","review":"After extensive research we bought this coffee maker and it died a year later. The carafe broke within 3-4 months because of bad design, which dictated you force it under the drip filter. After many phone calls to locate one, I bought a replacement carafe and Krupp had redesigned the lid to where it no longer had to be forced into position.Thanks Krupp... a new carafe in less than 3 months, and now the blasted coffemaker has stopped working altogether with the red light glowing happily at me but refusing to make coffee.The lid doesn't come off the carafe for cleaning, the water indicator is hard to read, and the only thing that worked well was the clock! Next time I need a clock, I'll look at Krups but I sure won't look to them for a coffee maker.A piece of expensive junk: Krupp--I'll never buy another product you make. Promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unit is just O.K.","review":"While I think this coffee is beautiful, I don't like the way the carafe slides into the maker.

Sleek, modern design and I love the analog clock that glows blue especially since the microwave has a digital clock; another one would have seemed cluttered. The machine just had it's maiden voyage this morning and the coffee was perfect cup after cup. The taste did not change and the temperature was perfectly hot. I couldn't find a single cup machine I liked so this small 10 cup works great for me. This machine replaced a red Kitchen Aid that took up a lot more counter space than this one. Very happy and Amazon had an amazing price, as always."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krups is Krap","review":"Krups claims this coffee maker is made of \\"stainless steel for durability\\".But, they forgot to include the heating plate, which is the main component.As a result, the heating plate rusts within just a few weeks.

The timer failed after only about 8 months. It started by making coffee as soon as the \\"AUTO\\" button was pressed, and now it starts brewing if there is power to the unit even without pressing ANY buttons. I've resorted to plugging it in when I get up which totally negates the original purpose I had in mind when I purchased it.

Shortly thereafter, the plastic lid broke when I attempted to remove it to wash the carafe. I went to Bed, Bath and Beyond to see about a replacement, which is not available. Their floor model had the exact same break in the lid. Pouring water into the reservoir from the carafe results in spilled water, and coffee also spills/drips when pouring.

I emailed their customer service with three complaints about this unit. They said they had not had any complaints on this unit and apparently one (mine) was of no value.

The entire transaction went smoothly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little coffeemaker","review":"Some have commented in their reviews that the coffeepot drips, that the pot itself is difficult to remove and replace into its alcove, or that the coffeemaker spontaneously turns on. I value the consumer reviews posted here and usually heed them, but I loved the look of this coffeemaker so much and could find no other brands to match the styling and features of the KM1000 that I decided to risk it and order. So far, I have experienced none of these problems, and have been very happy with my purchase. The Krups KM1000 is a great little coffeemaker that not only makes a great-tasting, piping hot cup of coffee but looks good while doing it. Programming is easy and the price is right. My only fault with Krups is that not even a sample pack of cone filters was included with the coffeemaker as a courtesy, so be prepared with size 4 cone filters if you want to start brewing out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke after five months","review":"This coffee maker was love at first sight. My husband and I used it once a day every day, and it made very good coffee. The coffee maker had to be unplugged every other day and it was very easy to set up the clock. The blue light was a little bit too much (it used to illuminate the whole kitchen at night) and although it didn't bother us it stop working after three months, which we didn't mind. We don't know if the clock stop working by the third month as well, but after five months of use the electrical system completely failed, this coffee maker stop working. I consider this unacceptable for such a simple appliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Coffee Maker, BAD.","review":"Reason for buying:1. Liked larger carafe and programable-easy-to-read buttons.2.

Our machine is less than 9 months old, and its become unreliable.I was in an Odd Lot type store and noticed this machine there, which I thought was odd- but the packages were all labeled reconditioned. I suspect Krups and its retailers had issues with this model.I advise you, dear shopper, to reconsider the $50 or so purchase, and find a different coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krups died","review":"After 4 months the coffee maker just died.

It often stops the coffee from flowing through to the carafe, resulting in the basket overflowing and grounds going everywhere. It's a pain to re-filter the coffee and clean the unit after this happens.

If you want to get some great ideas on creating funky - artsy frames then you should consider it.However, if you want instuctions on how to make mats and frames in an afternoon (as the title would suggest) then look elsewhere.The instructions on measuring and calculating mats sizes are cursory. The instructions on cutting a double mat (the only real set of basic instructions in the book) are unnecessarily complex and arcane. The author fails to explains terms and, probably because she knows her subject too well, assumes simple but important knowledge of the reader(e.g. which is the front mat - the side closest to the art or the viewer?).If you want a 'how-to' book, I would recommend you pass.

It is written in a very readable manner and can be read from start to finish as well as a refernce for specific topics. The only reason I didn't give this tome 5 stars is that it failed to meet a few of my queries (these were very specific) and I would have liked a few more example bits of code.

Of course, it can prove confusing to some, but it doesn't take long for most folks to catch on to the fact that the author is mostly just playing around in a Robbinsesque sort of way. The characters are fun, especially the bird.

I like it because it's \\"short\\" (less than 200 pages) and doesn't waste the space with rambling tangents. It's full of suggestions and \\"we've found that X works well\\" information, but doesn't get \\"preachy\\". It's easy to read and avoids using big words and detailed theory just to show you how smart the authors are, which was appreciated.The overall tone I took from the book was, \\"Here's what we've found works, see if it works for you\\". My favorite part was the chapter titled \\"Common Problems and How to Fix Them\\", in which I found a number of issues I could directly relate to.Fortunately, the project I'm working on embraces a lot of the practices described in this book already. However, there's always room for improvement.

One of the most fascinating is how the hands remember what the head has forgotten. Women tell me they haven't knitted or crocheted in decades, yet they begin to work as soon as I put yarn and needles in their hands.The repetition of movement in knitting and also of crochet is beneficial as a mantra, reducing stress, inducing a nearly trancelike state, and making time stand still. Laborare est orare. Work is prayer. Indeed.Yes, it's addictive. Ah well. There are destructive habits and constructive habits.My home is full of book and yarn and friends.

Her adventures may not be the same, but strands that hold us together are!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Craft as addiction, maybe?","review":"I anxiously awaited the arrival of this book, given the reviews I'd read here and comments from others. I'm already a knitter and I had hoped the book would help me explain why I knit. Quite a disappointment.It seems to me the author has simply traded in one addiction (drugs) for another (knitting), and an equally destructive addiction at that. Sure, knitting carried her through some difficult times, but isn't that because addicts are able to shut out everything else in life because they are so focused on getting the next fix? Is it really OK to have a house so full of knitting projects that there's nowhere for your best friend to sit down?Her writing offers only a superficial and fleeting connection to some very important, very complex traditional/religious/spiritual practices; whether this is due to her own limited understanding or to an inability to communicate I don't know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knitting in Crisis is a pathetic way to look at this artform","review":"One of the cardinal rules of knitting is \\"No whining!\\" Yet Lydon begins, continues, and ends with one whiney crisis after another and tells us how she knits her way out of her melodramatic (and sometimes downright boring) problems. Knitting is about FUN. It's about creating beautiful works and great relationships with others. Yes, knitting can be a great comfort in times of trouble, but hey ... it's way more than that. A richer path of spiritual growth is one in which we celebrate our triumphs and concentrate on how the challenging and gorgeous things we knit bring us together with own souls, and with others who share our passion. It's about discovering the delight of who we are, what we create and what we pursue. Lydon needs to lighten up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed ramblings of unrecovered addict","review":"I, me, my, I, I, I, I. Boring, boring, boring. Little if anything to do with knitting, little to do with spirituality, much ado about Susan. Knitting for her is just another fix.

She can search everywhere for an outside spiritual practice, but she has developed nothing within."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little knitting...","review":"... too many platitudes, too much Susan. The author writes of her spiritual search and how knitting is part of it. However, skims over the life events leading the search (including barely mentioning her child and former husband), leaving me wondering why she was searching. She appears to get completely consumed by the passion of the moment, and then move to the next one.While she writes of the mediative nature of knitting, it's all the basics, nothing particularly insightful for an experienced knitter.On the plus side, it's a quick read and I polished it off on my commute today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and self-involved","review":"Count how many times either the word 'I' or 'me' appear on a page.

Kemal just gives us the usual nonsense to pander to the Western audience, Sunni sword weilding fanatics, Kurds and Armenians skipping and dancing together in perfect harmony yawn!If you are looking for a book that represents Turkish culture then this isn't it, there are far better Turkish writers that Yashar kemal but unfortunately there works have not been translated.(Ahmed Hamdi, Necip Fazil the list is endless)By the way, if you do buy this book you will not need to buy any other or you will find as I have that pretty much all of Yashar Kemals novels are exactly the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close but no cigar","review":"I got it, works ok, but isn't very accurate.

Ingredients on one page, turn the page for the method, every time. The index is worthless because it lists things like \\"Aw Shucks\\" as a corn recipe, or \\"Blithe Spirits\\" under asparagus. The names give no clue whatsoever as to what is in a dish or how it's constructed, and all the names are so cutesy they would gag the proverbial maggot.

All these cutesy names don't tell you jack! 2)The ingredients for each are on ONE side of the page, and then the instructions are on the BACK side. What's the point of that? 3) There are NO pictures, except on the cover! If you love to cook, and sometimes use recipe books, do NOT get this book. Fortunately it was a gift. It would have to be, because I certainly would not have bought it myself. That the authors group foods together--giving the meal's menu--is good, but they need to rename the recipes, put ingredients and instructions together and provide some visuals.

The useful stuffs are to help people WHERE to get java softwares, HOW to install them and how to CONFIGURE them both as SYSTEM wide and USER limited usage and HOW to RUN THE SOFTWARES. In these aspects, the book did not do a very good job. The one website the book referred to is BLACKDOWN which is a good site but the java softwares there are not updated often( it still carries jdk1.2 beta ! ).In conclusion, the book should be trimmed down in half and emphasizes more in those aforementioned stuffs and cut the price.

Hype, flashy wardrobe and heavily-publicized bizarre behavior often deflects media attention away from the efforts of humble but more talented musical artists. Chicago pulled a real coup when they recruited him but, in my opinion, Bill shines best at the helm of his own musical endeavors, either as a solo artist or fronting the Sons of Champlin. This DVD features Bill in a performance environment he seems completely at home with. The sound is good and the sidemen are exceptional.

Once I spotted a deer and turned on the \\"IR\\" illuminator, and the deer ran away - not too surprising, it is actually a red light and totally visible for most animals. Better use a flashlight. This is a first-generation nightscope, and has a very small range of utility: If there is a little light, the adapted human eye sees better, and if there is almost no light the device does not see either. 100 bucks is not too much of a waste, but if you are serious about nightvision you should spend about 10 times as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful due to very small field of vision","review":"The field of vision is too small for any useful viewing.

The only true statement is that it is made of leather. There are no tempered belt clips or convenient wrist straps. The only way to carry this is to put it in your pocket or hold in your hand. The price is also too high for what you get. Purchase this product only if you want an over priced leather protective case. I am only assuming that the case will protect your telephone. I am extremely disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good only if your an expert knitter","review":"They go way too fast when showing a type of stitch.

The explanations were not clear and the demonstrations were done quickly. I would like to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"A few years back we purchased a horse that had been winter-fed on round bales. The horse was great, but his breathing was not. Every time he cantered he coughed. The vet was skeptical when we said we had been trying respritory supplements. He said there really was no cure for a horse with the heaves. We tried other, more expensive supplements when we came across Cough Free. I tried it. In one week's time he had improved. In two weeks time he was a different horse! His lung capacity had improved so much he was able to barrel race! I recommend this product, and staying away from round bales."},{"rating":"1","title":"a trend that teaches no new things","review":"Overall, I think the book says things everybody (especially marketer) already knew.For instance, the final recommended nine strategies:- restructure organizations with a consumer-driven orientation.- select and focus on the highest-priority consumer segments.- develop standardized customizaton approaches.- leverage global trends and market intelligence.- increase the priority on innovation.- increase the priority on value.- choose more narrowly targeted and two-way communication vehicles.- align communications strategies with the spirit of tomorrow's consumers- adopt new marketing research approaches to understand tomorrow's consumer.All these \\"recommended strategies\\" are very \\"unsurprised\\" to me. Both the recommendation basis and recommendation strategies are just average.I gave two stars because the book was released in 1998, so it might have a little value then (though I doubt it too).Only recommend to college student for marketing basic reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harness the Future: The 9 Keys to Emerging Consumer Behaviou","review":"This book is good for anyone interested in long term trends. The author does a good job of identifying the specific factors influencing trends and then mentions what magazines you can read that will talk more specific about the area you are intersted in learning about further."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am definitely a Clarks fan!","review":"I bought three pairs of Clarks from Amazon when I saw the $20 coupon and as usual, scored with free shipping.

VERY disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly fine British cast recording of the classic show.","review":"This is a perfectly fine recording of the 1986 British revival presented at the Chichester Festival Theatre. Suzie Quatro can't hit the high notes and can get a little raw at times but she acts the part well. Eric Flynn is a bit long in the tooth for Frank Butler but vocally he's fine. There are 18 tracks including the later interpolated OLD FASHIONED WEDDING. The two soubrette songs are eliminated. At 56:06 this is a nearly complete rendering and is recorded as are all the Chichester shows as if you are front row center with a typical pit orchestra. It stands with most recordings of the work and is a fine choice if you don't care for Merman or Hutton or Martin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described","review":"I contacted Amazon because this product was not as described. The log was 2 inches smaller than the listed dimensions and the picture was entirely inaccurate (my log had no light colored bark, no outline on the green leaves, and different knobs coming out from the log).The product I received was not aesthetically pleasing and it was much too small for my hermit crabs. After looking at other Reptile Cafe products on Amazon, the reviews seem to give the same consensus. The product you will receive is not worth a steep $10. I returned my log and don't plan on purchasing any other Reptile Cafe products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product","review":"It isn't that large, but it will look perfect in my aquarium.

No tan bark and it was covered in red flowers.Not impressed. Living on a boarder town it's too much work to pay bridge fair, shipping charges and have to cross the boarder once again to pick up a new one if i did ship it back, it's just not worth it for me.Also the inside is extremely sharpe. I don't think it's very save for my gecko to be rubbing around in.I'm worried about my baby gecko being cut so it was a waste of time and money for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst quality product I have seen","review":"I am looking for a small footprint UPS and selected the Tripp Lite because I thought it would be prefect to sit on my desk. I received the Tripp Lite BCPERS300 in a light package. The box inside was properly sealed and fit the device tightly. When I pulled the Tripp Lite out of its box, its enclosure literally split in two, and the electronic components were in full display. I never saw something like that before. The device's enclosure's two parts meet in the middle, lego like, except that they don't hold together. If you hold the device on one end, the other fell apart. If you want to see what it is inside, this is the perfect setup, you don't need any screw driver to open it! But in term of quality, this is the worst thing that I have seen in a very long time. I am not sure if this is part of their ventilating system but I don't believe that a UPS should run with its gut open. I returned the product without any problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"its small, howver, it has a loud 60hz hum","review":"I was looking for a smaller UPS to handle small transient outages so runtime was not an issue.This looks like it would do the job so I gave it a try and sadly the loud transformer hum is noticeable 15' away.While such noise is expected when the unit switches in,once the battery has been charged I would expect such noise to be gone.Just keep in mind the sound if you plan on being near where you deploy this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great backup for internet connectivity gear","review":"I bought this specifically to back up my DSL internet modem and WiFi hub, and for that it works great. Since their draw is small, this UPS can keep them running for quite a while. Before, when the lights would go out for a minute or two, it would take 15-30 minutes for the internet to stabilize, now it's seamless.

The characters are deep and I couldn't help getting emotionally tied to the protagonist. It is written in Janny's usual descriptive style which may be a but wordy for some, but I quite enjoy the literary art she paints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did she rush the ending?","review":"This is a quality book for the reasons given amply by other reviewers. However it lost a star from me for two reasons: the ending is rushed, and I got sick of how the main character, crippled almost to immobility early in the book, suffers a continual unrelenting onslaught for most of the rest of the book, without ceasing to be an amazing killing machine. It was just too much! As the cliche goes, sometimes less is more.Having said that, it's still a better fantasy book than many so buy it, read it and enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exhibit review","review":"I saw this video at the Renwick Museum in Washington DC in October.

The plot is horrible; the acting is bad; and idea is a waste. Of all the lesbian movies that I've seen, this is definitely the worst...and I am a lesbian-movie-connoisseur! I can't even express how irritating the characters and their actions are. Please put this on the bottoom of your list of films-to-see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Run and hide","review":"I have a list of lesbian movies that I am interested in buying over the next few months or so. Fortunately a friend of mine bought this movie before I had a chance to consider it as it was quite frankly the biggest load of crap I have ever seen.Look, I must admit, I am not one for stereotypical butch and femme relationships so for starters that was a HUGE no-no for me. That just added to the fact that just about everything else in the movie was badly done.Harsh maybe, but if like me you live in the lipstick lesbian world and loved movies like Saving Face, this one is definitely not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"uhh.....not what I expected","review":"I have seen worse, it's a little weird! When I first watched it I thought it was good because I hadn't seen very many lesbian films, now that I have I don't think it is very good. It's okay but lets put it this way I watched it once and it's been on the shelf ever since!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time","review":"I gave this film a shot, by watching sitting though all of it..

There was no good parts to this film and really I can't see how it made it to dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad!","review":"The directing is awful. The acting is awful.

The main couple were very cute together and absolutely believable as a couple. The premise was certainly real enough. Some of the dream-like sequences were a little odd but no moreso than the first season of the L Word with the opening scenes there. It ended the way it should and had a nice little lesson attached... maybe more than one. We would recommend this for a nice evening in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite There.","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this movie. It almost entirely revolved around the butch/femme lesbian stereo types. It was an extremely unrealistic portrayal of gay life to the point where I wouldn't want people to watch it. If you are interested in quality lesbian story lines with realistic portrayals then I suggest you look else where."},{"rating":"1","title":"boo","review":"This movie was poorly written, directed, and acted.

Nothing like reinforcing stereotypes! too bad I can't give a negative star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Circus Big Top Clowns","review":"Two tarnished stars for this dog. One star for the bad acting and script, and the other because it was like watching a terrible car crash in action. You just had to see what happened next and how freak-showish it could possibly get. An anthropologist who studies weird tribal customs might like it. I watched it with four friends and they booed and tossed popcorn at the screen. I had to clean the mess up, following this mess of a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Games we were afriad to play!","review":"Came acroos this film on Logo channel but could never see the whole film. Glad I bought the video as cable has too many commercials. The film is centered around two lesbians--Sassy & Lou, & set in the 90's in San Francisco. They set up house & stumble across other lesbians who are into roll playing. Sassy decides she'd like to try this but Lou (who is hot!) decides to play along in fear of losing Sassy. The film goes through the ups & downs of this unique \\"family\\" & the rolls.To watch this you must keep in mind its a fun film, with some underlying issues of \\"the grass is not always greener on the other side\\". Daniele Ferraro plays Sassy, the one who wants to be taken care of & Michelle Wolff plays Lou, a stong rock to balance Sassy.Would like to see Michelle Wolff play in a police officer roll!!Great movie to watch after a long day at work or just to enjoy with friends or a partner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Ericsson Desktop Charger","review":"I purchased this desktop charger for my Ericsson R280LX phone and it's awesome! It uses the AC adapter that comes with your phone and charges two batteries at the same time. The rear slot conditions the battery when you push the button - it turns from red to yellow to indicate discharge and then green to signal that the battery is fully charged. This desktop charger can also be used in conjunction with the desktop speakerphone from Ericsson (that converts your wireless phone into a speaker phone)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"The holes on these lint trap are way too big.It is letting all the lint passing thru.
