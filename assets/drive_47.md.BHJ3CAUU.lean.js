This album rivals check your head. Which is, arguably the best Beastie album.I realized something today while I was sitting in traffic on my way home from work. I'm going to be listening to the Beastie Boys for the rest of my life. Now, while this might seem silly. I found it to be quite profound. The amount and quality of material that they have released over the years is almost overwhelming when you look at it in full. Every time I delve into a new track or album, I'm amazed at the level of detail complexity that you find with each release.

But i heard it again and i start to listen the sounds and the music. This album contains very much sounds that you should listen with a headphone. It's an experimental album and it's why i think it's the best album. Beastie boys have really a new \\"sound\\". Beastie Boys have also chosen news kind of music (see track 14-15 or 22 who is one of the best track). The new D.J's Mix Master Mike is really very good but his talent doesn't appear in this album. You should buy his album (Anti-Theft Device), Mix Master Mike is one of the best D.J of the world"},{"rating":"2","title":"Of course Beastie Boys I wouldn't have anything else","review":"Pardon me but do you have any Intergalactic?

I appreciate experimental hip-hop, but the Beastie Boys seem to have hit upon the boring, uninventive side of experimentation. Why, for instance, do they \\"sing\\" on so many tracks? (See Mos Def for a rapper who can sing hooks or whole songs if he wants to.) I wanted to like this CD for years because I know that the Beasties are living legends. Sadly, the fact that this is the first CD I bought from them will keep me from ever exploring their legacy more closely. Try anything by Blackalicious, The Roots, or Common instead for some more well thought out hip-hop experimentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy \\"the Science of Things\\" instead","review":"All of the good songs from \\"Hello Nasty\\" are all on the Beastie's 2 CD set.

I like rap and never discriminate against an artist because he or she has a different style, but point blank is this album s#$%s.

The first ten songs are more than anyone could ask for from three CD's. Just this makes it worth listening to.

I look back on Beastie Boys' old stuff and some of it was really good, but I can no longer stand the corny voices.

Thats not a bad thing seeing how I have all of them and the Beasties are my favorite of all time. I still listen to Hello Nasty all the time but there are a few problems.

Sure if this were any other band they would have 3, maybe 4 stars but from the Beasties this reeks of laziness. Gone is the inventiveness they displayed in their albums up to Check your head, and to a lesser extent Ill Communication. Instead its just same old same old. Its not a bad album per se, its just from the Beasties I would expect more you know. And well the approach to most the songs is formulaic. Except for Instant Death which is a touching moment of such warmth. I dont know why but that song really touched me. Apart from that Id say avoid if you are a true Beasties fan cos it is kind of a dissapointment, otherwise a fairly decent 90's hip-hop thang."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listened once, liked it.

In \\"96\\" they started organizing the annual *TIBETION FREEDOM CONCERTS* and have raised alot of money. Since \\"86\\" the Beastie Boys have made great music and seem to be the only group who can make the transition from PUNK to HIP-HOP!! Other groups have tried but failed. It has been 4 years since their last GREAT CD *Ill COMMUNICATIONS* and belive me it was definetly worth the wait. *HELLO NASTY* is the best of all.

Many of you may disagree but this is my view"},{"rating":"1","title":"i am lowering my previous review....explanation below","review":"This album does not have a whole lot of music worth remembering on it. It seems like as the Beastie Boys get older, their creativity, emotion and humor decrease. Their first several albums were classics (see Pauls Botique, License to Ill and Chec k Your Head), but on this album, they fall short on lyrics, beats, and humor. They lack the freshness and originality that propelled them to their fame, and besides a few decent tracks (the first three, body movin, intergalactic, 3 mcs, and electrify), this album does not have the componenets of the true beastie boys we (or at least I) know and love. Nice effort, but in my book, it falls short."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Rap\\" for kids with no taste","review":"I wanted to cast my vote to sway the average review of this album. The Beastie Boys have come up with some great hip hop records, but this is pure garbage. The lyrics could have been written by a bunch of drunks making fun of rap. \\"I like my sugar with coffee and cream\\" . . . give me a break. I bet DJ Hurricane would have vetoed that one and most everything else besides. The Buddhist edge made for some interesting tracks on Ill Communication, but this love thy neighbor stuff and the illusion of appearances . . . if you really believe half of this, get out of the business. This is one of the most dissapointing albums of the 90's, up there with Soundgarden's Superunknown. Both of them were tremendously popular, and both were absurdly bad next to what came before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello Beastie!","review":"Well, they've done it again.

Many of the songs that I hated at first are the ones I play most. This happened with Paul's Boutique, too, when I first got it. The only songs that I liked were \\"Johnny Ryall,\\" \\"The Sounds of Science,\\" and \\"Hey Ladies.\\" I absolutely hated \\"High Plains Drifter\\" and \\"Car Thief.\\" Now these are two of my favorite songs on the album, and I enjoy and appreciate every song. If you are a true Beastie Boys fan, you'll give this album a chance and keep listening to it. There's no way that you could still dislike it."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite of the beastie boys collection","review":"I'm a relatively \\" late\\" beastie fan, because I only really started listening to them when this CD first came out. I decided to check it out because some of my friends were recommending them and Intergalactic had sounded pretty nice on the radio.I was pleasantly rewarded when I indeed bought this album. Unlike some albums, it has A LOT of solid songs, and are all well-balanced. These guys can flow.I then checked out their previous albums, which arent bad, but I still say this one is their best. (song-wise though, nothing tops Fight for your right and Sabatoge!!!).. But for total number of good songs on one CD, this one is up there.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best introduction anyone could get from hip hop","review":"Listen to the whole thing, then don't listen to it for awhile, then listen to it again. The first listen will prove lackluster but anyone who gives this album a chance will be amazed by the musical genius that is Hello Nasty. From the funky Instrumentals to the hardcore rhyming, this album will dazzle the hip hop veteran and the hip hop virgin."},{"rating":"2","title":"something to believe in...","review":"I'm not trying to brag, but I kind of know Adam Horowitz, and I saw what he went through in making this album with the B-Boys. This is by far their best effort, and it gives us reassurance that something sacred is out there for us to study and worship (besides the bibel). Take it from someone who was there...this is as magical as music gets! Better than Cher! (I know her, too)"},{"rating":"2","title":"the CD of 1998!","review":"Overall, a very good CD! These guys still know how to rock, rap, and roll! The best tracks are \\"Body Movin'\\", \\"Three MC's and One DJ\\", \\"Unite\\", and of course, the single of the year, \\"Intergalactic\\". Because of \\"Hello Nasty\\", my interest in their music has been completely renewed! I was into them when \\"Licensed To Ill\\" came out, but lost interest later on. After listening to \\"Hello Nasty\\", I've gotten the other four CD's they've put out. All I can say is, thanks alot guys! And keep up the great music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great technometallic version of the Beasties.","review":"The Beasties always know how to party. With their new record they keep the same hip hop feel of their rhymes and combine it with some new samples. All togethor a great and innovative album that any Beastie veteran would invite and any Beastie newbie would be enticed by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beastie's Best in 9 years","review":"This album is wonderfull, masterfull samples, groovin' beats and great raps make this the best Rap CD i've heard in quite some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"long time dissapointed fan.","review":"this cd was definitely the worst beastie album, but it was still the beastie boys. its not horrible, but if i didn't have it yet, I wouldn't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CD SINCE BECK'S \\"ODELAY\\"!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"NOT HAVING BEEN A BEASTIE BOY'S FAN ALL THAT LONG (I REALLY ONLY JUST HEARD LISCENSED TO ILL ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO), I MUST SAY THIS CD KICKS @$$!! IT SAVED ME FROM ABSOLUTE BOREDOM ON MY RECENT VACATION. I'VE LISTENED TO THIS CD NON-STOP THE LAST THREE DAYS...IT'S THE BEST CD I'VE PURCHASED SINCE BECK'S ODELAY (AND I WORE THAT ONE OUT!!!) I LOVE THE CLASSIC BEASTIE SOUND MIXED WITH RUMP-SHAKIN BEATS AND SLOW, SWEET MELODIES. WHEN I HEAR \\"BODY MOVIN'\\" AND \\"REMOTE CONTROL\\" I FEEL THE URGE TO GET UP AND SHAKE MY BOODY. THIS IS A CLASSIC, AND WILL BE IN MY LIST OF FAVORITES FOR A VERY LONG TIME."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight-Very!","review":"Now this is definetly one album that the beasties are really gettin \\"biz on the crop.\\" this is such a good album...it has such phat beatz and rhythms that make it sooo perfect. With the money making skills of Mike D, The spiritual rapping of MCA, and the loaded weapon Adrock, this album can't get much better. All the songs are tight, and can definetly be easily defined. Adrock is so good on the SP1200, he makes all the songs sound like real drum beats. And it's hard to tell that it's really a drum machine on a lot of songs! Even the softer ones like \\"I Don't Know\\" really kick this album into high gear. If you don't have it yet, well then get up and get it right now...it'll definetly be much worth it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh yeah, oh yeah, the Beasties, the beasties, are BIZACK!","review":"ah, the Beastie Boys. What an amzing group, what an amazing album. Its rare that few or any groups can accomplish what the beasties have, obtaining a fan base that stretches far and wide into different cultures and into different fan bases. The punk kids, the rappers, the alternative kids, the rockers, they all love the Beasties! Why not, Hello Nasty is the type of amazing able that appeals to all because its so well done. Instead of pumping out garbage, the B-Boys took their time and gave us an album that cries back to the time of circa Paul's Boutique, except this time, they're a much smarter group. Hello Nasty is an album that offers everything! It makes you think, it lets you have fun! You can relax to it, grove to it, dance to it and party to it! So if you haven't already pix this one up!!! Five stars isn't enough for this jewel of an album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"The B boys are back and maybe thats a bad thing. It seems that all they can do is rhyme their lyrics and scream the last word of each verse. This is true in about 90% of the songs and frankly its getting old. Tha album lacks the strong samples that were prominent on previous albums. When they were young it was breakthrough and now its stale. Perhaps they should stop worrying about Tibet and clothing and make better music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money...","review":"This alubum has like 2 decent songs, then the rest of the cd is just filler material. I expected more. Do not buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've heard better.","review":"Three quarters of this album is a complete waste of time,effortless and repetitive.The other quarter however is generally entertaining and well developed.Rent it from the library and record it onto tape or MD.But don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-Rated!","review":"Not as good as their earlier works. My advice: Buy something with more than 2 good songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some songs pretty good, most not that great.","review":"This CD was kind of a dissapointment.

Hello Nasty has funny, intelligent hip-hop, and some incredible sampling with everything included from Stravinsky to Sondheim. Many critics have written that the Boys may be \\"growing up\\" with this record, but it just seems that they've simply created some great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beastie Boys - Platinum","review":"This album is more than 5 stars. The incredible songs include Super Disco Breakin' The Move, The Negoitan Limerick File, and many others. This album has many scribbles and has many well-written songs. Well not much else to say.

Let me know what you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"INTERGALACTIC","review":"Speaking as a former music student, that song is just pure melodic, chaotic, rhythmic GENIUS. The rest of the CD is also so AWESOME. Call me cheesy, but I love it when lyrics RHYME really well-or not! My 5 year old sister sings this whole CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain nasty!!!!","review":"What a dissapointment for me, a Beastie Boys Fan to listen to this CD. How can they even compare it to I'll Communication, it's not even close. I found only one good song Intergalatic, but it still wasn't as good as a song like Sabotage. Don't buy this CD unless you wan't to be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beasties are DOPE!!!!","review":"The Beasties boys have done it again. They take you into their own little world with \\"Hello Nasty\\" and I must say I wouldn't mind staying a little longer. With \\"Hello Nasty\\" the b-boys use samples very well, such as the spanish song at the end of \\"The move\\" and the lyric which includes, \\"lotto, you have to be in it to win it\\". With paul's boutique, the boys use hundreds of samples and they sounded great but with this album they are all much easier to appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woo-hoo, they're back!!!!!","review":"This album is awesome!!! The first time I listened to Hello, Nasty--the first of many times-- I was surprised and pleased to hear the sounds I so \\"cherished\\" from Paul's Boutique!!! I hope that they won't wait for another four years before putting out another album!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SOME OF THEIR GREATEST SONGS ARE ON THIS ALBUM.","review":"I have been a Beastie Boys fan for some time now. Intergalactic is a really cool song. I like the different sounds and the creativity that is expressed throughout this album. If you like this you should buy some more albums by them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do they still bother?","review":"Hello Nasty is another boring Beasties album, just like the two before it. Don't get me wrong, I've heard the genius in Liscense to Ill, but this is all just repetitive junk. By all means buy it and see what I mean. Song for song I can hear almost the exact same things on the Beastie's other albums, why didn't they do something original?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 3/22 songs, including Intergalactic, are good on the CD","review":"Only three out of the 22 tracks are worth listening to. I'd pay five bucks for just the intergalactic single but its an expensive import. It's not worth buying Hello Nasty for Intergalactic because Intergalactic is all you get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello Nasty, this CD rocks!","review":"Hello Nasty is such a cool CD. It's good song after good song.

Very cool CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Far weaker than their previous albums","review":"This doesn't hold a candle to Check Your Head or Paul's Boutique. There are some decent tracks, but lyrically this was a huge slide for them. It just sounds forced and there is a lot of mediocre filler...Buy one of those two albums first (CYH or PB), then get Ill Communication and Licensed to Ill. This album is better than 5 boroughs but thats about it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only give it a rating of 0.5 and two thumbs down","review":"Okay, if they got rid of the grunting, the sqeaky records, and the background noise they might just sound all right.

This is basically a home video of horses on someone's farm that she could have made with a video camera in her own yard. There is no talking on the video - just an occasional word or two by the person doing the filming. The horses in the video are pretty, but some type of narration would have made this video much better. It is not at all what we expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing movie","review":"I got this video which was truly a home video in a fancy box. There was no information at all. No credits, nothing. The producers missed the boat on this video, would not recommend it. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This video was little more than (very) shaky home video of ponies in a backyard pasture. My seven year old daughter is intrigued with everything Misty and I thought it would be fun for her to watch a documentary and learn more about the lives of the ponies. This was definitely not that. She watches very little tv and is usually captivated by anything on screen -- especially horses -- but this did not hold her attention past the first five minutes. And the constantly shaking and bumping footage made my head ache!! Clearly, the five star ratings were given by friends or family of the director.To charge $19.95 for this is robbery!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather listen to The Spoons","review":"When I first began listening to Bella Morte's The Quiet, I thought it was very mediocre, but not unlistenable.

Such is the case with this \\"band\\". Nothing here is interesting, fun, creative, or good. Everything here sucks, the vocals suck, the music sucks, and even the artwork sucks. It sounds like everything you'd find on MTV VH1 or any of those mediums. What is very sad is that these fools won a band contest and used that money to expose their poo to people. What an insult it must be to be the other bands competing. But what else could you expect from the inbred state of Virginia.If I ever met 'Bella Morte' on the street I would punch them in the face and ask for my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell Yeah!","review":"Despite it's title, this album is anything but Quiet, but as you can expect from Bella Morte, it's wonderfully diverse. Prepare to be impressed yet again. One beautiful-industrial-emotional-rock-dance-death-album coming up! Enjoy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bella Morte's best album so far","review":"Anyone into any goth music really should check out this album. Not only are all the songs on this album good, but they show a lot more diversity than their previous album \\"Where Shadows Lie\\" (also worth picking up). \\"Living Dead\\" and \\"Christina\\" would really appeal to death rockers and fans of horror punk, while \\"Whispers\\" and \\"Hope Again\\" cater to people who like soft ballads. Even fans of heavier industrial can find something on this album, such as \\"Regret\\" or \\"Logic.\\" It's a CD you can listen to all the way through and not feel like you're hearing the same thing over and over again. Adding to the song variety, this album was recorded with two guitarists, and each one contributed a different sound to the songs they played. I've played this band for people who don't listen to any goth music and I have never gotten a negative reaction. I highly recomend this CD to anyone, and you can check out a few tracks from this album on [a internet site]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from Nouwen","review":"This beautiful book, illustrated with pictures from Rembrandt, is one Henri Nouwen would have written about Jesus himself, if he were still alive. Instead, editor Michael O'Laughlin gives us selected writings of Nouwen's that illustrate the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, and how we can apply them to our daily lives. Nouwen's messages of love, self-sacrifice and servant-leadership come alive in these selections. Definitely worth it.I do have to wonder, though, how many compilations of Nouwen's work can be put out before the effect is diluted. Those who are in charge of his estate may need to think about easing back on re-releasing his work, and let what he has stand on its own. Otherwise, it can get rather repetitious, as some of what was in this book I have read in other books already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justin James","review":"If you like laid back accoustic music this is for you!

The compressor was leaking right at the first connection out of the tank, which could not be tightened. It would not build pressure and run constantly (and loudly). I had to return it. It's impossible that such an issue would not have been found during testing, which means there was no quality control whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bundle - Great Value!","review":"Have used the compressor extensively - works like a champ.

I received mine as a Christmas gift. However, mine arrived and obviously had been used and returned. The compressor shroud was broken, the power cord had been unrolled, the instructions, some of the packaging, and some of the accessories were missing.

Maybe the problem seems to be that men are shy of yoga so they need an apparently macho introduction, but guys, go with the tried and true titles out there, or DVDs from Rodney Yee, Rod Striker, etc. The photos are poor, the model (who may be the author) is NOT a good example (OMG his handstand is completely weird) there are misspellings and misinformation.

It rates high because it is timely and actually gives a plan to cut back on the tremendous waste of time and money in our system of choosing a President. Strong medicine sweetned with wit and style. Worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A plum book","review":"This is THE book for anyone who wants to know virtually everything about what rates as the world's most popular vegetable among home gardeners. Although the tomato itself originated in South America this book tells how varieties now include the Black Russian, Colossal Yellow and Dwarf Wax as well as many more familiar red tomatoes found in Europe, the US and the author's native Australia. There are plenty of pictures telling us how to grow, graft and keep healthy tomatoes in our own backyards and Mr Gilbert even shows how they manage to cultivate them in China's Gobi Desert. Hints on harvesting and storing are followed by a very useful, easy to read 'everything you want to know' chart detailing more than 120 varieties. In between are the gardeners' prizes - recipes to help you savour the fruits of your labours! In short almost anyone can grow (and eat) tomatoes and this compact book is the ideal reference work for enthusiasts everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Treasure","review":"This recording is a treasure, featuring several selections that were cut from earlier versions of \\"Anything Goes.\\" A notable example is \\"Buddie Beware,\\" a hilarious song which tells of a woman's reticence to marriage. It could be a big hit among cabaret artists if it were better known. Kim Criswell makes an appropriately brassy Reno, although her interpretation of \\"I Get a Kick Out of You\\" is gorgeously plaintive and lyrical. The lead male, listed as Bruce Hubbard on this site but as Cris Groenedaal (sp?) on my CD, lends a handsome voice and fine phrasing to the role of Billy, while the great Frederica von Stade shows versatility as Hope: not all opera stars can sing Broadway with as much success as she does. Jack Gilford is his usual endearing self as Moonface Martin. A fine ensemble is led by John McGlynn, and the incidental soloists are all excellent, especially the lady with the Pekingese! This is a great addition to anyone's collection of Broadway soundtracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brief Description","review":"Special guests: Iva Davies, Steve Jansen, samples by David Sylvian, Bill Nelson, and John Serrie.

Charles Cullen may have murdered repeatedly, but more grueseome is the author's grisly butchering of the english language. I can't imagine this actually passed under the nose of anyone who seriously calls themselves a copy editor (truly about a glaring mistake in punctuation, syntax, or grammar per page), and I have no idea why even the most obscure subsidiary/branch of Penguin would put their name anywhere on this disaster. Yet another mystery is why Barnes & Noble continues to display this dreck so prominently on their \\"New Releases\\" display. I mean, T.V. Guide was a new release that week, and is Shakespeare by comparison. The only two redeeming qualities are 1) it points out that lawyers suck, which is incontrovertible fact and 2) it does indeed make a fine drink coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful and Inaccurate","review":"I was appalled at this book. Inaccuracy after inaccuracy, including self contradictory \\"facts\\", only about 20 pages actually dedicated to Charles Cullen (the rest being a survey of other serial killers, the plight of the nursing industry and other fillers), overly sensational prose and obviously no research whatsoever makes this book no more than a sleazy attempt at a quick buck. What facts there are have appeared in the newspaper, so go to Google news, search on \\"Charles Cullen Nurse\\" and save yourself 10 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Embarrasment","review":"I live in New Jersey and work in the hospital industry. This book is, simply put, an embarrassment for the publishing industry. Mair writes at a sixth-grade level, and either \\"edited\\" this book himself or had an equally inept editor. Obviously written to capitalize on the Cullen story while still fresh, the 100-page book fails to provide any insight as to why Cullen (and similar murderers employed in healthcare) committed the crimes to which he had confessed, or to adequately address the shortcomings of the system that allowed him to get away with his killing for so long. That Penguin is behind the publication of this book is surprising. Avoid at all costs. The Internet and local newspaper stories will give those interested in this case a much better understanding than this book ever will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give this book negative stars!","review":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! The other reviews are correct: this is a superficial, inaccurate, poorly written piece of junk. I got more information from the Star-Ledger newspaper.

The book does not even make a good coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"A frustrating mess -- does not merit even one star","review":"It is difficult for me to believe that this \\"author\\" has actually written (and published) other books. This book is supposed to be about Charles Cullen, nurse serial killer, but instead is a way-too-long (at just over 100 pages), poorly written diatribe against the sloppiness of our health care system in patrolling its hospitals, nursing homes, etc. for suicidal, homicidal employees. It took me so long to slog through the grammatical and spelling errors, the disorganized, redundant chapters, and the obviously slapped together \\"bibliography\\", that I wondered how George Mair had the gall to offer this mess to a publisher, and moreover, why I was wasting my time attempting to get any sense out it!

For example, the menu arrangement described in this book for inserting a module sheet is different if you use Excel '97. The dialog sheet is used here for designing dialog boxes, a method replaced with UserForms in Excel '97.

The skills of guitarist Brian James, who lights the band's debut album on fire, have seriously diminished by the time of this concert. The other members put in a listless, bored effort that sounds like they really don't want to be there.

It acts as a slightly exfoliating, absorbent mask, from the Dead Sea--the black mud, but one thing that makes this product rise above the other masks out there or dead sea products is in how gentle it is, and yet so effective. This mask is FAR less drying than other dead sea related products, but yet effective. Dry skin shouldn't have a problem with it, and it would be very beneficial for normal or oily skin as well, because the mud simply does its job. Ultimate Spa made a great product with this mask, and almost should have added \\"for sensitive skin\\" because it is such a soothing mask, and I cannot see anyone having a problem with it. It has a very light scent, and if it wasn't for that, I doubt this product would have any scent!

I don't deny the fact that she brings up the comments and she does have some weird moments in the wokouts but I think it is more important to focus on the actual workout. This killed me! I could feel muscles working that I didn't know could burn the way they did. I have only done this workout a few times but I swear that there is already a visible difference in my lower body area. My friend even commented saying everything looked tighter and now she wants to join me. I should also mention my brother joined in on a few workouts.

I am not trying to toot my own horn at all, but I did have a decent base to start with so my results might be quicker than some just because of that reason.

I have been extremely exciting about the Killer Buns and Thighs DVD to come out as these are my biggest problem areas and I thought if Jillian couldn't help me with them then I dont think anyone can.

There's a ton of jumping around, which is usually good because of range of motion but just getting the moves down is frustrating. I feel like I'm in a dance class or something. For anyone who lives in an apartment building and is conscientious about your neighbors below you, don't get this dvd. What happened to weights and different forms of squats?"},{"rating":"2","title":"you can do it!","review":"She does things you don't think you can but try and you will see results. I lost a pant size doing it 3 times a week for a month. You will feel the burn.The only minus my butt is smaller and I thought it would get bigger ;( but its worth he waist size shrinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flabby to Strong","review":"This was in my DVD player most of the summer. I had to change it out for other workouts that worked upperbody, too, but I really want to maintain what Jillian has helped me to create :) This has transformed my lower half and I love the strength and look of my legs now! Jillian's attitude seems a little more loose than her other DVD's, and I read some complaints about it, but it doesn't bother me. I am too busy concentrating on balancing and finishing each move. It is longer than 30 minutes, when you add in the stretches. If you are looking for a great workout to tone buns and thighs, here it is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD delivers!","review":"This workout is awesome! It's definitely NOT a walk in the park or for people who are just starting to get back into shape. It has three difficulty levels which is nice. Jillian says a few strange things, but she knows her stuff and will definitely get you to a killer booty if you follow her instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"As with all her DVDs it pushes you to the max...\\"butt\\" well worth the effort.

If you want to look good and want some new options, just buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work that butt!","review":"I have a love/hate relationship with Jillian....she has efficient workouts, but her comments get old fast (but that goes for all her videos).

I personaly like a music thats a little funkier, but for those who like a slower beat and a more contemplative mood, this CD is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I'm a yoga instructor who was very disappointed in this CD as far as it being a music to practice to. The music for me felt all wrong for my own practice - the sequencing, the pace of the music, the song selection by Windam House. It felt more like easy listening music, but not quite right for a yoga practice (even a slow flow practice). For me, the music has to fade into the back ground while I'm practicing - this just grates on my nerves. My classes didn't care for the music and complained that the music was distracting for them as well. I recommend Planet Yoga (both CD's are wonderful- Disc 1 for faster paced and Disc 2 for meditation or slow flow) and Yoga Rhythm.However, for just playing at home while cleaning, or just relaxing it's alright. I don't think it's anything to get excited over."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for practice and sleep","review":"I found this a great cd for practice as it allows me to block distracting noises from outside my apartment and focus on what I am doing. It is good to relax with at night when I have trouble going to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is the Worst Textbook EVER","review":"I have seen many textbooks in my lifetime but this was, by far, the worst I have ever seen! It is extremely outdated and there is no index in the book. Many of the facts were based on statistics from the 80's so I felt like I was learning things that are no longer correct. They have updated the edition numbers but not the facts and stats that are used. Unless you are required to have this book for a class, don't waste your money on this. If you HAVE to get it, just get a used one as cheap as you can because chances are you will not want to keep it after the class."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very insightful book","review":"This is a book of wisdom which helps you to recognize the mode of our existence that makes us passive and even destructive.

It has become part of me; everyday I remember key sentences from the book which help me make sense of my own life, attitudes, and ideas. Two notions (a) the \\"being\\" way of life as opposed to \\"having\\", and (b) \\"matter is in constant flux\\" help me let go, relieving me of my attachment to things material. Paradoxically, they also give me the courage to experience life in a more proactive way, and to accept and appreciate life as it is without trying to force events. It's a truly spiritual and healing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eye Opener","review":"Fromm describes, in very understandable terms, the eternal conflict between the desire to \\"have\\" and the desire to \\"be\\". He outlines logically that most problems humanity has is the strive for materialism. He compares things to be had as dead and qualities to be as living. Some of his insights are drawn from the Bible and show that God Himslef, by his very name, is the supreme \\"being\\", whose wish it is that man becomes like him. Fromm warns against the perils of \\"have\\" based societies, and conclusively demonstrates that \\"be\\" oriented individuals have one of the major keys to a better and more satisfying life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fromm boils it down to this:","review":"will you fall into the Western, mechanistic, and capitalistic mode of Having, or evolve into the perennial Being taught by those whom Fromm calls the Masters of Living?

Ought to be taught in school..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book in the world!","review":"I found this book by accident in the tiny library of a summerhouse on the Maine coast. I read it in one day, and I loved it so much I actually took it home with me! The characters in this book are so well developed that you feel like you know them.The story is so real and so beautiful. You can identify with Cassandra as she deals with life, and the people who surround her. I read this book at least once a year, just to stay in touch, and i never, ever get tired of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sigh--I wish her other books were still in print","review":"I just finished reading this book and came to Amazon in hopes that some of her other adult titles were in print--no luck there.

Transporting, full of great characters, and more lovely than any book I've read in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going on my list of all-time favorites","review":"This book has everything a good book should have: memorable characters (Cassandra is one of the most lovable narrators I've ever stumbled upon, and I wanted to meet in person everyone in the story!), substance, romance, humor, and the ability to keep the reader thoroughly happy! I did not want this book to end. I felt I was part of their 1930 English countryside world and didn't want to come back to 2002 (there's just no \\"class\\" in the world anymore!) This book gave me the same warm glowing feeling as Pride and Prejudice. There is the film that is coming out soon. I look forward to it, but how could it ever do this beautiful work justice?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely done","review":"This a very appealing book for teens. A young girl who find herself in a castle, with sister, brother, father and step mother. All of them have very different personalities.

There is something about it so magical, and yet so earthy, that I always come away from it with something new. Although set in '30's England, the characters face situations and troubles with which we can all identify and in particular, Cassandra, the narrator of the book goes through adolescent angst so poignantly that you just want to sit with her in the castle window seat and be her friend through it all. I heartily recommend this book to anyone, young or old, who cherishes good books with characters you wish were real."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book","review":"This a book you want to read more than once and loan to friends so that they can have the experience. The characters, the settings are all beautifully drawn and developed. But more than that, the feelings of Cassandra at seventeen, falling in love for the first time are so vivid. It is wonderful to remember how it felt to be young and in love. A book for everyone. The only problem is that it ends. I could go on reading about these characters and \\"living\\" with them in their castle forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books that I have ever read...( 5+ stars)","review":"I loved this. I absolutely loved it. The lead character Cassandra was wonderful. She was so smart and romantic. She made me laugh and even cry a little. This has to be one of the most touching stories I have ever had the pleasure to read. I finished this book in a little over one sitting and I was so upset when it was over.I Capture the Castle is extremely romantic, yet very appropriate for young girls...not just older ones. This is a definite keeper. I would recommend it in an instant."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best book for all you romantic saps","review":"I prolonged my reaching the end of this book as long as possible. It's better than falling in love with a person! this book in short is beautiful and so charming.Now I must find a girl who will sit with me to Dubussy's \\"Claire De Lune\\"everyone should read this before they die!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure","review":"I'd been hearing about this book for a few years and I'm now terribly sorry I waited so long to get it. What a treat! The heroine/narrator is a smart, wry girl named Cassandra Mortmain, living with her father, stepmother and sister in genteel poverty in a ruined castle. With wit and an eye for detail, she describes her family, the history that led to their reduced circumstances, and the remarkable events that transpire to change those circumstances. I loved this book so much that I bought two more copies, for my mom and my aunt, for Christmas, and I know they will love it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Endearing Read","review":"I highly recommend this book to any girl who is a romantic at heart.

What a charming and witty character! \\"I Capture The Castle\\" is not remotely the sort of book I normally read, but I couldn't ignore all the glowing reviews I'd come across. What an incredible book ... I feel that I know those characters and places so intimately that I can't convince myself they're all fictional. I read the last few pages at a snail's pace, because I really didn't want it to end. There have been only a handful of books that have ever so thoroughly entranced me.I can't wait until my daughter is old enough to read this book. But it isn't just a book for girls.

It is definitely worth your time. I read a long time ago, but I am still writing a review encouraging others to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Utterly Charming, Delightful Read","review":"I first heard of this book when Entertainment Weekly gave it an unheard of A+ rating, and thought it sounded fun. After reading it, I became a D. Smith ADDICT and quickly read everything else (unfortunately, thru the library as they are mostly out-of-print) she'd written. The comparisons to J. Austen are apt, but Smith has her own idiosyncratic style. Cassandra Mortmain is a heroine for all times, though and I can well imagine that I too, will become one of the book's devoted fans who will read and re-read and re-read this book for years to come. Yes it really is that good!! As one reviewer put it so succinctly, \\"What Chanel is to perfume, Dodie Smith is to charm.\\" Do yourself a big, big favor and discover this utterly delightful book for yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no, thanks","review":"okay, personally, i really didn't like this novel. Sorry Dodie, but i just coldn't get past the first 7 chapters...it got really boring. i guess you could say that i shouldn't base my review on only 7 chapters...but seriously, the fact that i couldn't finish the book is the reason why i felt obliged to write down that i didn't llike tho book. i realize that many people loved this book, which is great..i just didn't. thats just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"so not worth it!","review":"its about this teenager, cassandra, she lives in this romantic castle but her family is increadibly poor. her father used to be a writer but is suffering from writers block and cassandra, who wants to be a writer, starts a journal to improve her skills as shes not suposed to be very good. then this rich family moves near them with two men. cassandra's sister and the rest of the family see them as a way out and rose(the sister) sets out to grab herself a man and some money.its really not all that. i read it because i heard about it in another book but i was very disapointed. the books long without much story and the characters are without charisma. the only thing i can say for it is that it does have some rare points of good description.i'm warning you, if you want a good story, whether your into action, horror, comedy, fantasy or even romance, this will not be it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I just finished reading this book, and I loved it. It is impossible not to love and admire the main character, and the story is impressively original, considering how stereotypical its plot appears at first glance. I could hardly put it down! I was a bit disappointed that the story ended where it did, but it made this book more interesting, more memorable. I definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Engaging","review":"I really loved this quaint book. I found it funny and engaging, in a Jane Austen-ish sort of way. The characters are quirky and witty, and even though it would seem that not much happens in the castle, you can picture yourself there, and the story that moves with it is delightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read","review":"I loved this book. I found it charming, humorous, a bit frustrating at times, but always enjoyable. I loved the eccentricity of the characters and was completely charmed by Cassandra. Rather than comparing the book to a Jane Austen novel, I felt Cassandra and Stephen were, at times, acting out a scene from Emily Bonte's \\"Wuthering Heights\\" only they both come to a happier end. This book left me feeling thoroughly satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant reading","review":"I feel almost churlist for not liking this book as much as I had anticipated. Oh, it's well-written and pleasant to read, with the usual assortment of eccentrics that only English authors seem to be able to create. Unfortunately, I couldn't really get interested in what happens to the characters in the story, even though I tried very hard. It's a good book to spend some quiet time reading, and it will relax you with its language and languid pace. Perhaps it's finally showing its age, being over a half-century old, and seemingly rooted in another world and time entirely. Don't be put off by what I say; read it and make your own determination. You may enjoy it very much, that's the beauty of literature; one size definitely does not fit all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"The book came as advertised except for the stickers on the spine, which couldn't be removed completely. Other than that, the book was on great condition and came quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captured my Heart","review":"I Capture the Castle was a truly delightful book. Written in a journal format, in the voice of the seventeen year old Cassandra Mortmain, this book captures the angst of first love. It is hard to resist a book whose opening line has Cassandra writing while sitting in a sink. The setting of a ramshackle castle in the English countryside adds a certain whimsy to the story. It is not your usual run of the mill coming of age story. Cassandra's view of the adult world is also seasoned with a hard dose of reality. The story of Cassandra and Rose's sisterly love is also very moving. The book is a little dated, and the naiveté of Cassandra sometimes takes one by surprise, but don't let that stop you from reading this book, because you will miss a lovely story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Promises to be a well-read favorite","review":"This book has a vividness and charm that is timeless. The family in the story is so quirky they seem like they have to be real. I read this book every winter and its rich, descriptive language and humor whisk me away every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magical read!!","review":"This book will captivate you, hold your attention for the duration. A must-read from off the beaten path."},{"rating":"1","title":"i couldnt get through the whole book...","review":"i capture the castle interested me because it had such good reviews. i decided to buy it in paperback, and got it at a low price in a local bookshop. i opened it and found that cassandra's journal really dragged on, with all these details about her life in the castle. i couldnt really find anything very interesting in it. im sure that people who enjoy very placid and idyllic books would like i capture the castle, but it is not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This book was extremely well-written, and quite entertaining. Though at some points in was a little bit boring, for the most part it was very enjoyable. I would not reccomend this book to people who crave action and fast-moving scenes; it is more for people who enjoy quite yet engaging books. I did enjoy Cassandra's charactor a lot, though I also loved that of Simon. A great read for a Sunday afternoon or a rainy day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheer pleasure","review":"This is one of those books that you can just \\"fall into.\\" The observations of Cassandra are insightful and delightful. The setting in time and place is a joy. The characters are, for the most part, well-drawn and interesting. My only complaint is that the ending came too fast. This is one of those optimistic books that you never want to leave. Try it as an antidote for the daily news. If you like EF Benson, you will like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an ageless book, and an old friend.","review":"Green arms, an old castle, a father writing \\"the cat sat on the mat\\", does this entice curiousity? Dodie Smith has the gift of drawing you so far into the story that you live inside the book. I read I Capture The Castle when I was a teenager, and loved it so much I lay under my bed to read it again and again. I actually thought that my family couldn't find me. How wonderful that it has been reprinted so that my adult children can discover this enchanting tale for themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only there were a sequel","review":"This book really has no equal. I first read it when I was fourteen, and find that I appreciate better now at 32 than I did then. I am delighted to see it revived. The boost it's gotten from J.K. Rowling, however, has proved a bit of a mixed blessing. Many people seem to infer from her endorsement that it's of a genre with her writing. In fact, this is not fantasy, but a beautiful evocation of the life of an observant teenager in 1930's England. Highly recommended for artists, writers, and Anglophiles. And may I suggest: \\"The Death of the Heart,\\" by Elizabeth Bowen, for an alternate existence to Cassandra's."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorite books","review":"I first read I Capture the Castle in junior high school almost 30 years ago and then as a young adult I bought a copy of the 1948 published hardback from a bargain book table at an antique store for fifty cents. I was quite amazed when I found it by accident while searching on Amazon. I am so very pleased that it has been re-released because this is one of my favorite books and I'm happy to know there is the possibility for others to meet the main character, Cassandra Mortmain and her family. I have re-read it many times over the years and treasure my bargain copy. It remains as fascinating as the first time I read it and I can't recommend it highly enough. It is beautifully written and is a book that can be enjoyed by book lovers of any sex, both young and old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written","review":"Even if you've seen the film, please take the time to read this charming novel. It's very well written by Dodie. She not only gives us a real sense of what life is like living in a ruined castle, she reminds what it is to be 17 again. I was very happy with the ending, which is not \\"tied with a bow\\". \\"I Capture the Castle\\" is a must-read for all Anglophiles."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book you feel lucky to read","review":"This book is like a gift, and everyone who reads it wants to share it.I first received a copy from a complete stranger -- a participant in a newsgroup discussion at rec.arts.books.childrens.

Now that it's back in print, it's on my gift list for half a dozen people. ICTC is intellectual without pretension, romantic without mush, comic without jokes. It's simply magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. It might be considered a \\"woman's novel\\" in the vein of Jane Austen, Charlotte Bronte, Antonia White, or Colette. The protagonist, Cassandra, a very bright and sensitive 17 year old writer, makes one want to move to a medieval castle in England. She has a very perceptive and wise view of life for a young woman, and captures the pains and joys of falling in love to which women of all ages can relate. Just a fabulous book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Have I Just Discovered This?","review":"Why have I just now read this book, at almost thirty years old? I wish I had discovered it as a teen!

Don't tell her, but I hated it. I was going to give it one star, but I must admit the author does a good job at painting the characters and bringing you into the story. The first half of it is sooo boring, but by the second half you can't stop reading it. And then the ending is totally unfufilling! I was soo frustrated like, \\"What? This is the end? That's what happens? I hate this book!\\" Well, you might like it if you like romances, but sorry, I'm into sci-fi, fantasy, and adventure. Mystery, too.

I am relatively new to blues music. I checked out several blogs and they all forcefully stated that Johnson is in the top 3 of all time. Some even complained that 3 was way to low for him to be placed on a list. \\"King of the Blues\\" was the #1 blues album of all time, according to 1 list I saw. I bought this with great expectations. I was very disappointed.This album is very 1 dimensional. The songs have no complexity at all. Johnsons singing lacks passion and depth. Although 1 reviewer says the guitar playing is very complex for an acoustic, I just don't hear it. Perhaps as I dig into the blues more, I will appreciate his talent more, but for now, I just don't get it.Let the flogging begin."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like listenning to Woody Guthrie, but not at all!","review":"(I have the Vinyl) I listenned to this record for the first time while in a Saigon opium den.

If you are interested in the roots of rock music, you need this cd or any of the others offered on amazon. I have a different collection than this one, but it has almost all the same songs, and believe me, it doesn't make a difference as long as you get at least a full disc's worth of good old Rob Johnson blues licks. If he only lived longer, he could have reveled in the success and admiration that these songs gave to his legacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unreleased Track A Revelation","review":"The previously unreleased early take of \\"Traveling Riverside Blues\\" will be a revelation for serious devotees of Johnson, since it shows him in a markedly spontaneous, uncertain and vulnerable state that's winning in its lack of audience-minded effect. This is Johnson thinking out loud about the song, its personal meaning and its communicative potential, exploring how to merge all these perspectives for maximum impact on a waiting world. Poignant and electrifying."},{"rating":"2","title":"King Of The Delta Blues Singers","review":"Robert Johnson-King Of The Delta Blues Singers ****1/2This is the quintessential recording for all blues fans and musicians.

The point is that this is the best collection of Johnsons material, it sounds the clearest out of all the versions, and has the best song selection.

But I will say that every recording here can be considered a classic.Why only four stars? Some songs are missing, songs available on the Mojo Workin' Blues collection.

With truly terrible ballads by 'Together,' this recording is an exploitation of the reputation of a great band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful just awful","review":"The romantic in me wanted this to be a great story....and on some level there is a niceness to it.For the 782 pages of text and who knows how much more time taken in footnotes. couldn't the author find anyone toproof read the tome?I am stopping after investing just over 200 pages of reading time- having just been told that the Civil War started onApril 13 (!!!!) 1861.Previous entries have some of the Ballou kin (or Sarah's) setting up shop in Rhode Island 50 years before the Pilgrims and 37 years before Jamestown.I love Civil War stories but way too much of this one is speculation and disinformation. Often even verb tenses are incorrect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"After reading all the great reviews, I was compelled to buy this book. It just did not live up to my expectations. I really did not like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Find An Ending","review":"After a thrilling one-hundred fifty pages, this novel just plain wilted. And the ending, if not predictable (I won't give away who done it, but it's not that hard to figure out), was then a series of boring epilogues. It seems like this novel was not quite ready when released, and needs to be revised, rewritten. After a promising start, a disappointing ending. And that simply sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't Good - Predictable","review":"I too bought this book based off the glowing recommendations, but after reading it, I felt it just wasn't any good: the story was disjointed and predictable and many, many points are repeated ad naseum. Also, the overuse of adverbs vexed. Every character, after they said a line of dialogue, was followed up with \\"He said coldly; softly, suddenly, quickly, angrily. Even the sun \\"throbbed fiercely\\". Read at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy, but compelling","review":"First time authors usually don't achieve this kind of suspenseful writing; normally a few books must be written before the proper balance of horror and coherence is achieved. This author competently enters into the mind of a very unusual nine year old boy, who is in a coma after a fall (or a push) from a cliff into a deep ravine. We read his thoughts, and we follow the actions the the doctor into whose care he has been placed. It's a novel of psychologicl suspense, and also a mystery, not to mention the various twists and turns of the plot right up until the end. It's a book that can keep you up very late at night trying to finish, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and well written","review":"This was a charming book about a little boy. I found the odd writing and interesting characters to be well worth the read. For the most part, I wasn't disappointed. I like her for the diverse presentation of the two perspectives from which she writes. It's like two different people wrote the book, and that's not easy to do. However, I admit that the plot was sometimes a bit too predictable in areas, but it didn't make this book less interesting. I'd still recommend this to anyone looking for something different."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Sixth Sense' meets 'The Curious Incident of the Dog...\\"","review":"Cross the eerie,'the Sixth Sense' with the stream of conscious narrative of, 'The Curious Incident of the Dog At Night time', and you'l have entered Louis Drax's world. A nine year old boy lies in a coma after a terrible fall. His mother is the only witness to the incident which she blames on her husband, claiming he pushed their son. Problem is, the husband has vanished, and the only other person who can tell what happened is buried deep in the catacombs of his mind. The book is wonderfully suspenseful with gothic overtones, and enough tension and human drama you'll want to finish in one or two sittings. I also appreciated that for the most part it kept me guessing up until the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"The secrets of imagination, psyche, and soul","review":"The accident prone boy Louis Drax falls into a coma on his 9th birthday, and the ensuing events entangle his mother with doctors and the law. The characters are original, the dialogue sharp and sometimes darkly comic. The author's focus on the world outlook of the child reminds me a bit of that used in \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime\\" and \\"The Way the Crow Flies,\\" both of which I found equally compelling. Liz Jensen, a Brit who has written other novels, deserves to be read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwhelming details!","review":"I find the Kitchens in this book to be so overdone that its painful! I'm an Interior Designer and was looking for ideas and inspiration. Neither were supplied by the content of this book. The details actually become overwhelming rather than working as an integral part of beautifully pioneered spaces!I would recommend Kitchens by Chris Casson Madden. Might be a little dated now but still helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks substance","review":"This book lacks direction and any substance to be worth reading. I began to tire of the trite comments, even though I was deeply interested in the subject matter. The author didn't use much research or detailed explanations on how to provide more for a child.It also gets old reading the many children's comments when they say they want \\"world peace.\\" Though it touches on the child's desire for security, it didn't need to be recycled throughout the text for every argument. As parents we can't make the world perfect for our children - war is a way to combat evilness in the world.Since many statements on this book teetered on political propaganda (on the liberal side), I tired of this book quickly.I will second the opinion of the previous reviewer who stated that 'Einstein Never Used Flash Cards' by Kathy Hirsh-Pasek is an EXCELLENT book."},{"rating":"2","title":"poignant & beautiful","review":"In the intro to The Other Side, Nan refers to the Oscar Wilde saying that \\"who are who you pretend to be.\\" Through the photography of those closest to her, those excruiciatingly beautiful people whose gender just happens to be ambiguous, Nan shows how our pretending seeps into every corner of our personas. I love this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad effort","review":"Since I wrote the review below, young Hilary Hahn has come out with an absolutely wonderful recording of the Brahms Concerto. I'm happy to say that I'm completely vindicated. A comparison of Kennedy's and Hahn's recording of the Brahms shows that Kennedy is sentimental, languid, boring, goes for cheap emotional effects and ends up suffocating us with pretty moments, whereas Hilary Hahn is crisp, smart, thrilling, avoids all sentimentality and thereby achieves a grand and truly moving overall effect. Those two recordings represent the extremes in good and bad classical interpretation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brittany Ashton Holmes my test tube daughter would like this book","review":"A big hi to Brittany Ashton Holmes whom I reccomend this book to.

Instructions were fairly clear, although some interpretation needed, and peg hole #s for DVD usage were incorrect. There is some mild 'echoing' in the exterior finish from the camber screws pressing on the inside, but hopefully this will not worsen over time.I also found that one part was missing (in a bag with almost 250 parts); this was a critical euro-head screw to fasten vertical panels to each other, not readily available on the local hardware market. Company did not respond at all to urgent email, so I was forced to engineer something from my garage screw supply. I am stunned that a few extras of each part weren't included...each hardware item has to cost mere pennies.Others remarked that unit was difficult to move after assembly...perhaps on carpet, but I installed self-stick felt pads to the base, and it slides readily on hardwood."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice and sleek","review":"I got it as a Christmas gift for someone and they loved it.its is very sleek in black. perfect size.not to big and not to small. doesnt fit as much movies at it says it does.easy to assemble but takes a while. loved it anyways.plan to get another one to have on other side of tv."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific space saver","review":"I love this item.

I even can place something on the top and look at it from all sides as I look for a dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spinning isn't winning","review":"I needed storage for a large collection of DVDs , CDs and a few small books. This looked great and lage enough to hold what I wanted.The fact it rotated sounded helpful too. Having a slight disability I find it better to have a handyman assemble these things and this was a challange.When he had it fihished I was disappointed:shelves are half width because it is foursided. It rotates well but the holes for the pegs are too small and therefore it is nearly impossible to 'adjust them or even get them in to begin with. It is bulky and awkward. I got another non-rotating and single sided unit with pegs that fit and will order another instead of this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't realise it was particle board","review":"I have to say I move allot so I hate particle board. I purchased this for dvd's which it didn't hold close to all of my dvd's. I also forgot to put the little wood stumps in so I broke it during assembly. If don't ever plan on moving this would probably be a good item for you especially if your good and reading directions but for me it's crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"This item was everything promised. It arrived on time with no damage, assembly was fast and easy and it looks great in our family room. For such a small amount of floor space the capacity of this unit is amazing.

It did exactly the same thing! Too weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I bought this staple gun for an upholstery class. I was willing to pay more to get the flexibility of the nail/staple option and wanted something where I wouldn't wear my hand out as with an old fashioned staple gun.As other reviewers have noted, it's not very powerful. That said, I was much happier with this Stanley than the other women were with their squeeze staple guns. For $10/day there was a higher powered rental available, which was the best of the lot (after I looked to buy and it retails for $150).What it comes down to is what you want to use this staple gun for. Don't expect this to replace a pneumatic tool. If you need that kind of power, either because of heavy use, or to use with hard woods, then this staple gun won't meet your needs. But if you want a step up from the old fashion staple gun that is lightweight, quiet & flexible (it takes 10 kinds of staples and 2 kinds of nails), this is a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should be called \\"The Jammer\\" - poorly designed","review":"I have to echo Mr. Titus' review. I bought this unit to do some light upholstery work. It seems to feed the brads okay, but lacks the power to drive them either flush or below the surface even on pine!Then I tried using staples (since that is the primary purpose for upholstery.) What a huge disappointment. Every staple jammed or would not feed to the nose. This is the result of a very poor design and/or poorly executed manufacturing (not meeting dimensional specifications, etc.) Stanley ought to pull this out of production and fix the problems. This piece of junk will harm their reputation.I strongly discourage anyone from purchasing this staple/nail gun. You will be sorry if you do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable performance. Waste of time & money.","review":"Using for stapling fabric to untreated lumber for window treatments. About 60% of the staples this stapler shoots do not go into the wood. It requires less effort and would be great if it would perform even as well as a manual staple gun. It is a waste of your time & money. Very frustrating to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of money","review":"I bought this about a year ago to install mosquito screen in pine and spruce lumber. On the low power setting it will drive 5/16\\" staples about 2/3 of the way in. On high power it shoots 2, 3 or 4 staples at a time with only one press of the trigger. The Stanley guarantee says it all:LIMITED LIFETIME WARRANTYStanley warrants this product to the original purchaser for its useful life (not to exceed one year for products with electrical or electronic components) against deficiencies in material and workmanship.Its useful life - not to exceed one year. Well, its useful life certainly did not exceed one year. It barely exceeded one week."},{"rating":"1","title":"No power","review":"I bought one of these about 5 years ago. It works ok in soft woods with short staples if you hold it down rather tightly against the wood. But after a few years I find it to be somewhat worthless since it cannot drive any kind of staple in anything but soft wood. So now I am back to Amazon looking for another electric stapler with some power. I don't always need the power. But there have been too many times when more power would have made all the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay, but definitely not great","review":"works when using 1/4\\" staples, but nothing larger. i bought it hoping to use 1/2\\" staples, but when using these you must hammer each one in after stapling. also, the trigger is quite hard to pull; i have to use both hands to pull it properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jams - almost seems like it hates me","review":"I use this to hang targets at the rifle range, so nothing really heavy duty. The things just jams and the Stanley web site doesn't offer advice or assembly diagrams.

It is hard to grasp as a sophmore in college and it goes to fast in a classroom setting. While I agree that other professor's should use this book as a reference tool, I have experienced it first-hand in the classroom and it caused more confusion than anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This Milestone CD collects two LPs Nistico recorded in the early 1960s: HEAVYWEIGHTS (Jazzland, 12/20/61) and COMIN' ON UP! (Riverside, 10/17/62). Both LPs were excellent and it's great having them together on one CD. HEAVYWEIGHTS has a slight edge over the Riverside date, mainly because of the excellent version of AU PRIVAVE found there. Nistico definitely was a swinging tenor player and on this handsome material he really shines. Nat Adderley is on cornet and plays with fire and his usual sure touch. COMIN' is just as swinging as the previous date and finds the obscure trumpet man Sal Amico joining Nistico. Previous to these recordings Nistico was best known as a member of Woody Herman's band; he died in Switzerland in 1991, aged 50. These are two solid mainstream modern recordings that easily could have gotten lost in the seemingly whimsical reissue game. Thank you, Milestone.

I have not tried any of the recipes yet so I cannot say either way if they are tasty or not. Maybe a video would be a better way of introducing consumers to this diet.

I purchased the original book and loved the recipes in the back, but wished they had pictures. I thought surely this cookbook would be like a cookbook and have photos of all the recipes. But it doesn't have many photos. And the photos it does have are very poorly shot. Several images look like someone threw a salad on a plate and just snapped a picture- very amateur.Many of the recipes in this cookbook are in the back of the original alkaline diet book anyway. I wouldn't have minded if there were at least some good photos.So while I LOVE the message of the alkaline diet, I was super disappointed with this cookbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much waste","review":"This book assumes you can purchase 100% organic foods, and be able to waste half of what you buy.

Try a handfull of paper squares with a couple of staples banged into the middle and folded over. I've seen free handouts with a more substantial construction. A fair price for this should be somewhere south of 3 dollars I would guess. Or better yet, the information should be up on a website where it can be viewed and downloaded for free.

But this book demonstrates individuality of basically any young girl that is alive today in a very comservative household. But I still think that the story is great, and the dialouge is funny as hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"**A daring journey into a new world of fantasy**","review":"One thing I love about this book, is the author's change of pace in the common fairy tale.

(The best move she ever made if you ask me) After following the directions of a talking frog, she befriends and becomes the princess of the mighty dragon Kazul. All in all this was a funny, lighthearted tale that makes fun of just about every fantasy story and fairy tale that has come out in the past five hundred years or so.

She meets up with Kazul, one of the most powerful dragons in the land, and is hired as the dragon's princess. (Kazul had to do some convincing the other dragons, because they wanted to eat Cimorene.)Anyway, Cimorene meets up with some pretty shady wizards,and soon finds out that they are up to no good.

Within her time there she deals with annoying knights, troublesome wizards, and a stone prince. My only complaint is that it was more for younger kids then older. It wasn't really hard to read and the climax was short lived. There really wasn't anything to keep those older then 12 interested. Yet I reccomend this book for a bedtime story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but not intended for experienced readers","review":"This book is about a plucky princess, who I found entertaining. Patricia Wrede's writing style is lively.However, the plot isn't very good. This is a classic \\"plot coupon\\" story. The princess collects a bunch of stuff, and miraculously it is all used in the end. This happens in Harry Potter too, but in that book the character's morals are tested as well. Here the character's morals are never tested at all. I found the ending predictable and forgetable.All that said, this book is probably a good read for someone who hasn't read hundreds of books already.

How she becomes the dragon Kazul's princess, deals withunwanted rescuers and meddlesome wizards is presented by Wrede with a wicked senseof satire towards all the traditional fairy tale conventions.Unlike many series, all three following books of the series live up to the high standards setby the first.

I like fantasy a lot, but I really hate when it gets into mythical creatures--centaurs, unicorns, dragons &c. My fantasy choices are more along the lines of The Golden Compass by Philip Pullman. Even so, this book was really funny and even exciting in parts and anyone who wants a nice light-hearted fantasy with strong female characters should give it a try. You'll probably laugh out loud in some parts. I don't know if you'll want to read all of the books though.

Three of our ports (Naplion, Gythion, Pylos) were not in the book at all or barely mentioned. In the book's defense, I will say that these towns were ports on the Peloponesian peninsula, not islands.

We took their advice and found the best food we've ever eaten in a little town on the island of Tinos. This restaurant grows their own vegetables, milks their own goats, and of course has the requisite cat or two hanging around. I have to say just finding that one restaurant was worth the price of the book. That said, I thought it could have been a little more detailed and included more out of the way type places.

I found The Rough Guide to contain more (and better) information and detail on a greater number of villages.

As well, I found the Cadogan (Dana Facaros) Greek Islands guide, while not completely written for the backpacker to be more helpful, with all of the basic information needed, fantastic writing and a satisfactory Athens chapter.

This book, however, is lacking in MANY ways. First of all, there are hardly any photos. Secondly, it seems like the same island description has been pasted onto each island. It goes something like this, \\" This is one of the most beautiful islands....\\". Lastly, it falls way short in hotel listing. In Mykonos, for example, the book only list 3 hotels in budget, 3 in medium price range, and 3 deluxe hotels. You've got to be kidding! All that's listed as far as excursions in Mykonos is the number of a travel agent and a gay cruise. Sorry,..not interested...in either!! I want descriptions and suggestions.

RZA, once again, shows his wide spectrum of unparalleled talent. The producer/MC has a track for everyone. The key to understanding RZA is to grasp his ideal for showing the world his variety. Some songs bring out the old RZA, delivering slow, heated verses with defying anger. Other songs bring out a more sensitive person, while one salsa-song shows RZA can still bring new innovations to a static industry. RZA has a unique style compared to modern MC's. He does not need to ryhmn and can keep rythmn to any beat. Thus, he is not bounded. He is free to demonstrate that hands down he is the best in the business, period. Bottom line is you can't like WU-TANG and not love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dalton Higgins","review":"It's funny how you put out your review without understanding who you are even writing about. First of all, Bobby Digital is what RZA considers his alter ego. He explained many moons ago my friend that he was putting out tracks under this alter ego. This content was from his youthful days. Basically before he had matured... The album is on time though..and the beats are intuitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"B.O.B.B.Y. does it again","review":"Let me start by saying that this is the best Wu solo endeavor since \\"Luquid Swords\\". Once again, Rza proves that he is the most important member of the Wu-Tang Clan by flashing his unparalleled combination of production skills and rapping ability. There is amazing diversity throughout the album, as the lyrical content ranges from a glorification of the carnal indulgences of Bobby's lawless male fantasy to a confession of guilt and an apology for engaging in such a lifestyle. Many of the later tracks show a more vulnerable side of the Rzarector, which is a nice contrast to the invincible character Bobby usually represents. The guest appearances aren't off the hook, but they do add a nice compliment on most tracks, and Rza carries the bulk of the album on his back anyway. In short, this is a great second effort from the Bobby Digital persona. Any hip-hop fan, not just those of the Wu family, should pick up this joint immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"RZA's best","review":"In my opinion this is the RZA's greatest LP. He packs nothing but deep and meaningful lyrics in \\"Digital Bullet\\".

It's always bloan my mind when musicians take the time to go to the studio and record something so vile. The first track has a good beat and RZA lyrically tears it up. But after that the record goes down hill. \\"Bong Bong\\"? The fact that guest appearances by ODB, Masta Killa and Method Man don't stand out shows how bad this album is.If you want some of the Wu Abbot's finer material, try 36 Chambers (of course), the Ghost Dog Soundtrack, Birth of a Prince or the new Masta Killa LP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soggy like old toast","review":"A weak effort from someone who can do (and has done) a whole lot better.

I used to be the biggest RZA fan, now he just throws some noises together and calls it a CD, Do not waste your money on this heartless failed effort, or any other Wu-Tang member's CD.

Which is a good thing.Im not a big fan of the Bobby Digital type beats, but for some reason, the beats here on this album keep me listenin and liking them. Good beats.

This album brings them back into very familiar territory, minus the production team of Murray Krugman, Sandy Pearlman, and David Lucas. The sound of the Cult is heavier and is more inclined to go in more exotic trips (listen to MONSTERS). I remember that the president of the B.O.C. fan club stated that CULTOSAURUS ERECTUS was his favorite album by B.O.C.

My old battery was close to 400 charge cycles and would last me maybe 20 minutes on a full charge. The new battery, after a couple of full discharge/full charge conditioning cycles typically gets me a little less than 2 hours to the low charge warning. If one is willing to reduce screen brightness and switch the processor to its energy saving mode, I know the battery would last longer. However, running the processor on energy saving mode also reduces performance, and I noticed that YouTube videos were jerky in this mode. So, in a real world situation, don't expect hours and hours of use out of a charge.

I feel like it helps reduce the clutter in my house.Unfortunately, the primary use I bought this for was kneeling by the tub to help my son take a bath, and it puts me up so high I have to lean over too far to reach him. That means I'm choosing between my knees and my back.I thought it would be easier once he was sitting up in the tub. Not so.Also the pads for the feet fall out constantly. It's hard to keep track of them sometimes.I'll keep it around for a step stool when my little one starts potty training and brushing his own teeth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another so-so product from Safety First","review":"The kneeling stool is great. The padding is sufficient and I love that it flips over to convert to a stool...Very useful! BUT...the elbow pad is a joke! There is a hard plastic honey comb underneath it and hard plastic surrounding it that force you to put your elbows into two tiny areas or risk severe pain from the plastic. Not to mention that to two measley suction cups that are suppose to hold it onto the side of the tub do not work at all. It constantly pops off the tub whenever I put any weight on it. I don't regret my purchase because of the stool which works really great. I suggest that if you still want this product after reading the reviews, you try to find it used so that you don't have to pay retail."},{"rating":"1","title":"tubside problem","review":"i bought this before my baby was born and thought is was a dream. then i tried using it. it put me up to high from the tub and made my back hurt bending over further. also if i didn't have my arms on the top it would constantly fall off. it only took me a week to take this item back. don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sturdy","review":"The kneeler is not very sturdy. I was not comfortable kneeling on it, and I felt like my weight would break right through the flimsy little styrofoam-like cushion. If that is what the manufactorer considers cusioning, I'm not impressed. I might as well kneel on a folded towel. I was hoping for something that would be soft. Also, the construction of the item is not very sturdy. It is made of plastic, and it does not seem at all durable. The elbow \\"cushion\\" is also not very soft. It is not secure, either. When I leaned against it to test it, it slid right off. If I'd been busy bathing my baby, I would have tumbled into the tub with him. I don't recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good product for bathtime","review":"I bought this product several weeks ago and use it almost every night when giving my baby his bath. It is a lifesaver for my knees! Before, my knees used to start aching while I was kneeling. This cushions my knees, and the elbow rest is also very comfortable. I don't agree with the other reviewers that said the armrest isn't the right height -- it must be their bathtubs because it fits perfectly on my tub without the storage bag bunching or sagging. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the little rubber feet on the bottom of the stool come off when I lift the stool, so I don't move it away from the tub. It could just be a problem with my stepstool, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a favorite","review":"This product actually made my back ache! It raises you up off the floor too much, so you have to bend further to reach baby. I'm going to keep it for my son to use as a step stool later, but I was disappointed with it as a kneeler. Now I'm using one of those gardening kneeler pads, much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not stay attached","review":"This is definetly not worth buying.

The suction cups that are suppose to attach to the side of the tub do not work at all and the the rubber feet at the bottom of the base come off everytime I move the stool. Now the only thing I hope for is that it will be a great stepping stool for when my son needs help climing in & out of the tub."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this product!","review":"We got this product as a gift from the baby shower and it is one of our favorites! we leave it up and have used this product every time we have bathed our child. This is one of the best gifts that we rec'd and would highly recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Deep Tub Friendly","review":"I really wanted to like this mat and elbow pad set. Unfortunately, we have a really deep tub, so the sides are tall and the cute little piece in between the elbow pad and mat isn't long enough. I use it, detached from the mat on the bottom because it does save my knees, but I can't use the net because now it is flimsy without the bottom attached and won't hold anything. So, if you have a deep tub, just get the bottom part, otherwise, it will just be a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as functional as I expected.","review":"If you have shower doors on your bathtub, the elbow rest may not stay in place. Our shower doors glide on tracks along the tub edge. The elbow rest does not stay \\"hooked\\" in place over the edge of the tub because of these tracks. It's a constant battle throughout a bath session to keep tehe elbow rest in place and utilize the cushioning.Also, since it's constantly falling off the tub edge, I cannot use the storage pockets in front. Everything falls out of the pockets when the elbow rest falls off the edge.Finally, the kneeler is comfortable but not as useful as it could be. To store the elbow rest and front pockets you need to reconfigure the kneeler - not something I expected to to have to do everytime. Also, there's not as much storage in the kneeler as I expected because of the construction design.For the price, I would not buy again or recommend to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"We had an item called the tubsider for our daughter (now 6) so I knew we needed something to help when bathing our son. This item isn't practical or very helpful. The kneeler part is nice for me...but for my husband it creates more of a back issue because of the bend needed to reach over into the tub. THe arm rest is constantly falling off the side of the time too. Not worth the money...I could've rolled up some towels to get the same benefits."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it, but...","review":"We have the one that is just the part for the tub with the mesh bag (no kneeler). We like it. It fit our tub. We could fit a few toys and bath books in the mesh pockets on the inside of the tub, and could easily fit soap, shampoo, and baby oil in the outer mesh pockets. The only reason we quit using this was that when our one daughter hit about 9 mos. she thought it was really fun to yank the suction cups loose and fling it...especially when we had our hands full with her sister. We'll probably put it back on the tub once they find something new to throw about in the tub."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety Issue","review":"I recently purchased this product to ease my bach aches when bathing my 3 year old son. It definetly relieved some of that uncomfortableness, however, the problem I encountered with this product is the top portion (elbow pad) adhering to the side of the tub. It does not always suction properly and often times would fall off the edge of the tub. The other day my son tried putting it back and suctioning it to the side of the tub. There was a little moisture on the edge of the tub, the top slipped and he slammed his mouth onto the top of the tub. He sustained a severly cut lip and jammed his top front teeth. There was blood everywhere. His teeth are loose now but should be okay. His lip is healing up but he was in pain for quite a while. I would like other parents to be aware of this potential accident in hopes that their child will not be injured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit my tub","review":"I didn't register for this and I quickly realized why. The part that drapes over the side of the tub does not fit my 70 year old bath tub, the fabric wasn't long enough. The blue pads on the bottom of the kneeler fell out and the plastic that was left scratched the floor. Buy a styrofoam pad for gardening...cheaper and more comfortable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!","review":"We got this for the upcoming arrival of our daughter. But, the first time I used it was to clean the tub after my husband gave the dog a bath. IT IS AWESOME! It's very sturdy and has alot of padding. I love the arm rest, it came loose a couple of times but a quick cleaning of the side of the tub and suction cups solved that. I was worried when I read the other reviews of this product, but once I gave it a try I was hooked. Our daughter and dog will never have a bath again without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ban this from the computer ewaves","review":"I unfortunately hear this on a digital service and I just have to get to the next selection before.....

To think this book was written 100 years ago amazes me. Yes, the story is simplistic in today's terms, the characters are a bit 1 dimensional but overall, the complexity of the world he created and the images he paints are fantastic. This is no Lord of the Rings but then again...it wasn't intended to be.The is a fun story with the universal theme of good vs evil. The protagonist really can't do any wrong and is always chasing/fighting for his woman (e.g Popeye).

There were just too many for a, compared to today, small record-buying constituency to digest properly. Yes, Grand Funk Railroad, Deep Purple, and Black Sabbath are the 'nads, but they're just the tip of the iceberg. This is a typical-of-the-time hard rock album, notable for a better-than-average drum solo number (beats \\"Moby Dick,\\" at least). They also had an early Celtic cross Gothic sound that sounds, to these ears, more \\"authentic\\" than Black Sabbath's. John DuCann later played for Hard Stuff, who were just as good as A.R., probably better. This album is essential if you like Sir Lord Baltimore, Deep Purple, or Alice Cooper.

Played it off and on all week even held on to it and tried listening to it a month later to see if I missed anything - nope, still don't get it! It's not a bad disc per se. The production is good, the quality of the music is good, they even throw in a lot of nice sounds - piano, cello, violin. But it just sounds like anything else on your local \\"alternative rock\\" station.

To compare them to bands like Oasis and The Verve would almost be a sin...don't get me wrong...I like those bands but Kent has something that those bands can't offer. I don't know if it's writting ability or an overabundance of creativity that they are blessed with but they stand out from the crowd like no other band today. I'm glad they don't get any radio play in the states for 2 reasons...1...the average U.S. radio listener isn't ready for music like this...2...if U.S. dj's got a hold of this and actually understood how profound this album is they would play it out in no time.

Two weeks ago I would have given it 5 starts, no doubt. However, I just bought Kent's new album \\"Hagnesta Hill\\" a few days ago.

The style is almost identical to Isola, but the quality of the album as a whole is better. To those of you who like comparisons, I immidiately thought of some of the quiet Smashing Pumpkins stuff when I heard the record. In addition to that there is the (well documentet in this forum...) influence from The Cure and Radiohead.Too bad these guys are from Sweden.

I found that the gel lubricates a little better, and the decreased friction seems to result in decreased irritation. A few days ago, I inadvertently replaced a gel cartridge with a lotion cartridge, and I felt the difference right away.I haven't found that my face really likes either the gel or the lotion, but shaving goes slightly quicker with the gel, which is a small added benefit.It's nice that Amazon \\"offers\\" this product itself: five packages is enough to get free Super Saver shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use lotion instead","review":"The razor I bought came with packets of this gel, as well as the lotion.

The novel is set in the early nineteenth century England, during a time that society had three distinct classes: the rich and powerful, the working people, and the tradesmen.While the characters personalities in the book seem exaggerated to make there qualities or faults more obvious, Eliot's detailed descriptions of the people made it easy to create a mental picture of them. Though the book is well written, the style of language makes it hard to read and even harder to understand. I found I had to read it more then once and spend time thinking it through to get to the point of enjoying it. Silas Marner has many valuable moral and lessons in it, the most important one being that people are worth more than gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Years","review":"It's been many years since I first read this book.

The language and literary context is very deep and very advanced...it's a struggle at first to read until you get used to the flow of the book. This is definitely a book that you cannot read/skim like you can in most others. You have to carefully read and think about every sentence in order to comprehend the plot. The book gets better about half-way through, where more conversation takes place and is easier to follow. The worst aspect of the book, in my opinion, is the sentences that run on and on and take up entire paragraphs and in turn, the paragraphs that run for pages.

I love to read and I love books, but I hated this book in tenth grade and many years of life experience since then have not made it one iota more palatable.Please bear in mind that this review is purely based on my personal experience and weltanschauung. Your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, boring.","review":"I was forced to read this book in high school in the 1970's and I still recall it to this day as being one of the most painful reading experiences of my life. And no, I was not raised with heavy doses of the \\"idiot box.\\" I read several classic books on my own when I was in high school without having them assigned: Huckleberry Finn, The Red Badge of Courage, The Old Man and the Sea, and just about everything by Vonnegut. Silas Marner is a very DULL and BORING book and teachers have no business making anyone read it. I'm amazed that being forced to read Marner didn't turn me off from reading for good."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was bored to tears","review":"I am one of the former students who long ago was forced to read this rot for a HS english class. I can not think of a book that would be of less interest to a teen age american boy than this one. All the reviewers who praise this book make me wonder about what else they read. It was beyond boring and had no possible points of reference to me. There are literally thousands of British novels that would be better choices. If you are going to assign students a British Novel pick one that at least they would enjoy reading. Thank god I liked to read or after this experience I would probably not read anything for years. I hope to god that this is no longer assigned or rather forced reading for HS. When there are books like 1984 or Brave New World available why use one that has so little possible interest to students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but Middlemarch is better","review":"I bought this because I had just listened to Middlemarch (books on CD, 28 of them) and loved Eliot's writing so much I wanted more. While Silas Marner is good, it does not have the depth of Middlemarch. Characters in Silas Marner are not as well developed as those in MM with all their psychological nuances, ups and downs, ins and outs. Plus, having MM read by such a talented Brit with all the different accents, tones, intonations, and inflections was like having a theatre in the car as I drove across country. The biographical introduction to Silas Marner was well worth it and I intend to review those facts again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Book","review":"Enjoyed reading it again. I am sure I read it in high school or college English class but had forgotten much of the plot. The writing was wonderful as I remembered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't we read some CURRENT social commentary in school?","review":"I don't know about anyone else, but when I read a plot synopsis on the back of a book, I like for that story to kick in at some point. However, that's not how this book is written. The basic plot doesn't get set into motion until about 120 pages in...and the book is 183 pages. To put it bluntly, the first 120 pages are spent aimlessly pondering life's many riddles and offering sometimes interesting, yet mostly tiring social commentary (I really don't care how the people at the Red House and the Rainbow act similarly despite class differences. I just want to finish this reading assignment so I can actually enjoy my summer). A plodding, slow book for the first two-thirds, it picks up somewhat before somehow managing to wrap things up in 10 pages...making me wonder why the book is even this long in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a classic","review":"This book is billed as a reproduction of a classic edition of Silas Marner. It appears as is someone just scanned the pages of a classic edition and bound them together. There is no warmth to this edition. The pages are overwhelimingly bright white with a reproduced page in the middle. Doesn't even have a book title on the edge binding. This is not the edition for anyone who loves the warmth and comfort of reading classic books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silas Marner","review":"Read this as a Sophomore in high school. There was much I had forgotten. Really enjoyed rereadingthis literature classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scribbles thruout","review":"This book was purchased used; however, the numerous scribbles and highlighting thruout the book was not listed in the description."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional Story of Loss","review":"Silas Marner is quite an unusual piece of work. Not as lengthy as Eliot's other books, yet has more meaning and elements.Fantastic! It may be hard to understand at first, but it's an emotional dive into the deep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant Classy Novel","review":"A lonely weaver becomes poor after being robbed by some rich snobs that need money fast, but in turn recieves a baby at the foot of his steps, only to find out that those two elements that affected his life greatly will twist like vines and create a huge impact on his quiet meek lifestyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monroe shocks 32275","review":"Was really bad shocks it's like old shocks just painting luck like new ones but really bad qualityin my opinion never going to buy this kind of shocks i recommend not to buy anymore this kind of shocks.very frustrated about this and unhappy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"If this is supposed to be an album of \\"the greatest\\" -- I wasn't too impressed. The quality didn't seem that good and the selections, well, not all that popular to my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"It teaches you what it says on the cover!","review":"This book does exactly what it promises. It teaches basic perspective. When I was learning to draw comic books this book was a godsend. It explains the basics with superb accompanying illustrations and easy to follow text.If you need to learn the basics of perspective, this book is for you. At only 48 pages it's a little pricey, which cost it the extra star, but as they say, knowledge is priceless. Treat this as a primer for more advanced perspective study, and you'll be delighted. 'Basic Perspective for Comics and Illustration' delivers the goods.You can't ask more than that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This book is far too contrived for its own good. In trying to make some sort of point about the individual capacity for violence and sex, Stuart creates a silly plot with some totally over the top characters. The plot circles around a London movie producer who is trying to make a masterpiece movie based on an ultraviolent play about warring soccer hooligan gangs. Along the way he falls in love with a crew member and hires a hooligan (presumably a skinhead of sorts) to be a driver. Much is made of how little difference there is between the upper class producer and the lower class thug. For some reason Stuart chose not to use real soccer teams in his narrative, which only further hinders the book. It really reads as if the author is basing a lot of his notions of what he has read and heard about, rather than seen. A novel which covers the theme of violence much better and realistically is John King's The Football Factory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent choice for the money","review":"A very inexpensive way to start learning slide \\"lap\\" guitar.

Honestly, I hope I never need to use it! Definitely worth having in the house just in case. Nothing special to attract or detract from the product. Its a multi-traumal dressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ","review":"This book was awesome and powerful. It is an excellent teaching tool as well as a wonderful resource. It's a revelation made clear of the conection between prosperity and aligning the spirit and soul. I have made it a required reading to my ministry"},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess all that glitters isnt gold","review":"I bought this for my husband a while back and shortly thereafter, this man (Minister) was arrested for beating his wife. My husband started reading the book and liked what he was reading so far, but has put it down, never picked it up and has lost respect. It's hard to listen to someone trying to encourage you when they were arrested for beating up their wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"You gotta love this song...","review":"This is one of those songs that once you hear it once, it never leaves your head. In this case, it's a good thing. A very good thing. There are five variations of the original plus the original here. Well worth the price. If you know the original, the Capitan Jack Club Mix is sooooo tight, you have to hear it. Every party I'm at, everywhere I go, this is the CD they want to hear. Buy it, no dissapointments. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The princess and the pauper","review":"This is a great moral tale about a thoroughly indulged princess who never wears a dress twice. One day, her father decides that she has been too spoiled and he orders that she receive no more dresses. Penelope is horribly upset and a kitchen maid tries to comfort her. Penelope is shocked to find that the kitchen maid only has one dress and the maid is equally shocked by Penelope's 365 dresses. Penelope must have a new dress, so she offers the maid one of her own fabulous dresses in return for the kitchen maid's old sack.The illustrations in this book, along with its vellum-like paper, are memorable and fascinating for kids. The story is fairly solid for the under 8 set. A good book all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be Required Reading","review":"As an author who has turned down numerous requests to write a Dreamweaver reference book because of how daunting a task it is, my hat goes off to Ms. Gutman, Ms. Ayers, and Mr. Booth for a job very well done. As far as I'm concerned, this is \\"the\\" definitive Dreamweaver MX reference work and should not be overlooked. Get it on your bookshelves ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreamweaver MX Disappointment","review":"I found this book to be exceedingly slow to get started and very tedious to work with. While there seems to be a vast amount of information, the flow was awkward and the tutorials took too long to get to the point of anything. I am no stranger to web sites and instructional material so I was very disappointed to have invested in this book only to find it wanting.I believe we all learn best by doing and this book seems to take that approach, however, I continually found the book exploring the minutia of this very capable program, at the expense of accomplishing the stated learning goals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good book.","review":"I'm very dissapointed in this one. I'm not new to HTML, CSS or webwriting, but new to Dreamweaver. This book is literally littered with errors, mistakes and other incorrectnesses. It doesn't look like the proof reader had a bad day; he simply wasn't there! The single chapter about CSS alone is worth looking at other books. It [is not good] is a major understatement. Better look at an online free tutorial for that chapter.Ms. Gutman knows here stuff, so much is clear. But being a teacher is a different profession, and not all can do that. Ms. Gutman clearly can't. A less experienced writer with better teaching skills could do a much better job. I'm currently trying to negotiate a refund from the publisher. I rate this book that bad.I bougth it because it has ASP, ASP.NET and PHP tutorials.Had these been absent, I would have gone for the Dreamweaver MX bible. A MUCH better choice.I rate it one star, because lower is not possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\" Dream Dance: a collection of the best hymns\\"","review":"I believe that the Dream Dance collection is composed of the best mixes by all of the good djs on this planet. The different rythms that each song has invites listeners to the unknown world of electronic muisic. I, have every cd from the dream dance collection and i wish to get vol. 11. The only flaw that exists in all of the Dream Dance collection except for one cd is that thay are not a continiuos mix as for example the Techno Club cds are. The Special Mega Mix edition, from Dream Dance, is a continious mix, and personally the one that i like the most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Hard Rock With Blazing Lead Guitar","review":"This is a fantastic hard rock CD. Everyone plays their instruments extremely well. The drumming is great! And Dave in my opinion never got his due as a lead guitarist - there is blazing lead guitar on this, as good as most any in the 70's. If you like 70's (or any) guitar driven hard rock, you cannot go wrong with this - it rocks HARD. And Dave sings great also, he's as good a guitar player/singer as Mark Farner or Frank Marino were. This is a closet classic hard rock offering, I promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally found this book","review":"I remember being in grade school and having the librarian read parts of books to get us interested in them. I remember when she stopped I was dying to find out the rest of the story.I finally found it and read it.

The moment you turn the first page you step into Chas McGill's magical world. It's the first year of the Second World War and the people of Garmouth expect an invasion by the Germans to happen any minute. Yet the children of Garmouth fight over who has the best war souvenirs collection. Chas McGill discovers the best find ever...a Browning machine gun still attached to a German Bomber. McGill and his friends now have a fortress and a gun capable of smashing though a brick wall over a mile away. How will it all end?The Machine Gunners captures everything there is about childhood adventures. The ones we remember and the ones we wished we'd had. Everybody will be able to take something away from this book. And once you have read one Robert Westall book you will go on to read them all. The guy was a genius who understood children like he was still one himself. Hats off to a fantastic writer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More teenagers should read this book","review":"When I was in Year 8 at High School this book was an English reading text. Keeping adolescent boys interested is no easy job, but this book was one of a few I read in school. The book is fun with adventure, but also highlights some of the harshness of World War, especially when battlefields also extend to neighbourhoods.Nicholas R.W.

Apparently my entire home is full of wires from ceiling to floor.(note sarcasm) Better off trying better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this thing","review":"It's not often I get a product and then develop a seething hatred for it within the first half-hour of use.This is a USELESS product that gives false positives, false negatives, and simply doesn't do what it's supposed to. I know how to use stud finders, I've read the directions, I've experimented with all 3 wall modes, experimented with different starting places... it simply doesn't want to find studs. Ugh.I ended up borrowing the neighbor's much less fancy stud finder... which did the job this one was supposed to in a matter of seconds!I hate this thing with a passion and will try to return it if I can find the packaging and receipt. I can't wait to get rid of this cursed, evil thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"zero star is more accurate","review":"This stud sensor is useless. It beeps randomly. If you tried it ten times, you will get ten different results. I wish I had seen other people's review before buying it at Walmart.

Even though the ac warning of i65 does not work well, at least it locates the studs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infuriating","review":"I bought this at Target, and made the mistake of thinking that because it was one of the costliest and boasted multiple features, it would also be one of the best. After trying to use it just now, I had to come see if it was sold here on Amazon and read what other people thought of it. I wish I'd seen these comments before buying; everything the other one star reviews say is true. What an utterly horrendous piece of junk this thing is. The company that makes these deserves to be put out of business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Absolutely useless. Never worked properly. Seems to beep at random.

According to this sensor, my walls are composed of nonstop, solidly-packed studs that are wrapped entirely in live wires and will surely cause instant death by electricution if I attempt to drive a nail in. If I remove the battery and put it back several times, the same walls have studs placed 10\\" apart (but the entire wall is still live). Sometimes, the studs move around while the sensor is active. It's amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the money","review":"I'm not understanding all of the negative reviews either. I wanted something cheap to hang mirrors and pictures in a new house. It works for that. The AC wire feature is for warning purposes only, so inaccuracies there are forgiven. Once I read the instructions on how to use the stud finding functions, it's been a breeze and a deal for $15. It stays in the junk drawer of my kitchen along with a small hammer and a few screwdrivers. It's not a professional tool, so I'm not treating it as such nor am I reviewing it in that context. For casual use at a cheap price, I can't fault it."},{"rating":"1","title":"$15 piece o'crap","review":"It is noisy as heck, you have to move very slowly to get it to work or it will miss the stud. The depth selection would be useful but doesn't work. The ac light goes off and beeps on every square inch of the walls I have tested. The instructions say it will detect ac up to 18''away from the line. It isn't a very useful feature unless you really just want a general idea which walls have ac in them(you could just use common sense in most cases). This product is barely usable to even hang pictures. It will be going back as soon as I get the dang battery out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"I bought this because of its price and I don't have call to use one that often. I have always figured you get what you pay for. When my unit arrived I was not expecting to have a 100% performance from it.

Not hardly.","review":"Bianchi has been around and is well known for thier gun leather, so I mistakenly thought this belt would be appropriate and provide adequate support for use with a concealed carry, outside the waitband holster. Not so.This belt is made in Mexico. Leather thickness varies from .133\\" to .155\\". After a month of wear, the belt is sagging and showing areas of ripples and weakened areas in the leather. I'm not overweight (waist 33, 6'1\\" tall), so I'm not putting any undue or unusual stresses on the belt.If you are looking for a belt for utility use, to carry a weapon or other tools that may weigh more than a cell phone - - this ain't it. Bianchi has outsourced their product and quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"B 26 gunbelt","review":"I carry a Beretta 92 in a Serpa holster. I had a cheap man made fiber belt before. It started to tear out at the holes and then broke right at the buckle. I ordered this B 26 belt and it carries this setup great. Supports the weight around my waist and does not sag at the holster.

I would recommend highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bianchi Belts - Highly Recommend","review":"I'd recommend Bianchi belts to anyone, whether \\"professional\\" or not. They last.

It's not any heavier than any of the other \\"normal\\" belts I have (although it is more expensive). As one other reviewer mentioned it is also \\"oranger\\" than it appears to be on the website.

My combination? Jacquie Bakers's Beginning Java Objects, Dr. David Taylor's Object Technology: A Manager's Guide, and - of course - Walter Savitch's Java: An Introduction to Computer Science and Programming.Walter Savitch's book is marvelous, repetitive by design; with these three books, there is no place else to go except forward.Good Luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book for Beginners","review":"This is a very easy to read book. Beginners will find it very useful to learn object technology. The downside is that instead of focusing on just one topic, it tries to cover too many things like GUI development and other things. That's why I gave it a four star.I really liked the association matrix method of finding associations between classes.

I found that I understood the examples in the coursework and recommended reading (Deitel and Deitel), but when it came to writing programmes myself I was confused about syntax etc. This book gave a much more comprehensible explanation of what java sytnax meant, and how object oriented programming works. I would recommend it to anyone beginning programming in java, especially those with no prior programming experience. I also think it would be helpful to those with no experience of OO languages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has to be the best..","review":"This is one of the best Java books I've come across.

In fact, this should be the first book you own before purchasing a core language reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book to start with Java programming","review":"Before learning Java, you must master OO concepts,without a good background of OO, you won't use Java language,properly. This book go step by step for newbies,it explains clearly the OO concepts, gives a good introduction to UML(as an analysis tool before programming) and of course explains the java language.If you know nothing aboutjava language and OO concepts, this is the BOOK you should buy to start. You will enjoy the first page to the last.The only negative point,is that the answers of the exercices are not available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear Object Thinking with Real-World Java Examples","review":"As an instructor of many intro-level software courses, I have not found a better book to explain object concepts in a more clear and consistent manner than Beginning Java Objects.

Some of the programmers I have worked with talked a good object game but then created library code as objects. I like how this book tries to teach OO from a different angle.

This DG release is nicely filmed, the audio is well-recorded, and the live performances of the Wiener Philharmoniker in Vienna are really good. I can't say for sure without some closer analysis, but it is likely the same set of late '80's recordings previously released on CD only,Schumann: The 4 Symphonies, which is very highly regarded. If you are a collector like me, and have various \\"classic\\" CD versions of your favorite repertoire, but want something comparable on DVD, this won't disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A very disappointing rendition by Bernstein and the VPO, lacking in finesse, articulation and cohesion.

Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Motivational Inspiring Collection","review":"This book is an excellent motivational tool. It is well put together and laid out. Knowing that the well respected Stephen Covey gives his commentary and insight made the book even more interesting to me. I love the fact that so many inspiring stories are together in one place for me to reference when I need encouragement or strength for a new trial or adversity. It is a great tool for me to use with my children, too!! I highly recommend this book. You must know that it is a compilation of Reader's Digest stories and not a new book written by Covey. He is a contributor. But,it is well done and worth having on your bookshelf!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiration, information and insight","review":"I enjoyed reading all of the stories compiled in the book. It provides motivation to make everyday choices that create character and integrity. It is the type of book that you don't necessarily read from cover to cover, but peruse the chapters as they interest you. I know in my case, it always seems like I am searching for gifts for friends and family members and I never really know what to get them. This book makes a great gift and can be applicable to a variety of people. The stories are memorable and so many of the quotes challenge you to be great everyday.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Every Day","review":"When I first glanced at this book, I thought \\"Chicken Soup for the Soul.\\" I was apprehensive about the quality of a book compiled from Reader's Digest stories. I'm not much of a Reader's Digest fan. I prefer more in depth reading. But I'm enjoying this book mainly because of its organization. There are 7 main topics (Searching for Meaning, Taking Charge, Starting Within, Creating the Dream, Teaming with Others, Overcoming Adversity, and Blending the Pieces). And three subjects under each topic, such as Integrity, Humility and Gratitude under \\"Starting Within.\\" This isn't simply a compilation of encouraging stories. It's a reference resource for daily encouragement, presentation illustrations, motivation. It's well organized and jammed-packed with useful insights and quotes. This isn't a book to read in one sitting but a book to keep on a nightstand or coffee table for easy and regular reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull Stories...not the most meaningful","review":"The book Everyday Greatness by Stephen R Covey, was a book compiled of short stories that are supposed to inspire and motivate you to do great things with your life. Each chapter has three stories and a wrap up and reflections by Stephen Covey that gives you things to think about from the stories you've read. There are also quotations from various famous people that have to do with whatever topic you are reading about. Honestly, I wasn't inspired by most of the stories I read. The only story that was really worth reading was The Cellist of Sarajevo, but overall the stories were just very dull. Also, some of the stories really didn't go with the topic that Stephen Covey was presenting like the one about Pope John Paul II. The quotes at the end of each chapter were interesting, but at the same time kind of overwhelming because there were so many of them. I couldn't wait to just be done with the book. I really don't think this is a book worth spending money on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A source of inspiration","review":"This book made me realized of many good and bad things happened to other people and reminded me to appreciate of what I have in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A collection of uplifting stories, anecdotes and quotations","review":"Since 1922, Reader's Digest has offered its readers uplifting stories and wise insights, spiced with gentle humor. In this anthology, David K. Hatch has collected some of the best of these stories and quotations, with added commentary from inspirational writer Stephen R. Covey. Their book provides numerous examples of ordinary people living principled lives. Without fanfare, quietly and nobly, these unrecognized heroes make the world a better place. They demonstrate what conviction, charity and goodness really mean. Although many of the anecdotes are saccharine and superficial, getAbstract believes that even the most exhausted workers and jaded managers will discover words of inspiration in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review from Leadershipfiguredout.com","review":"This is a very good inspirational book. It is filled with stories of greatness. My favorite sections were that of Courage, Attention, Responsibility, and Innovation. The stories really make you feel like you can achieve anything with a great mindset, attitude, and the ability to take action.This book does have a downside. As it is a great inspirational book, filled with stories and quotes, there are no actionable leadership ideas in this book. Some of the stories in this book will create great emotion, and they have the ability to change your state. I like to read the stories when I am having a bad day to bring myself out of my current mindset.When finished, I did learn what others have done to become successful, and contribute to their communities, and I was inspired to see the world differently. I would recommend reading this book, because you will gain perspective in your life, but remember this is not a how to book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyday Greatness Review","review":"This is a book full of inspiration and motivational stories. This is a book that you can read straight through or over multiple readings. It is a book that you will want to keep handy to refer back to in those times in which you need motivation or inspiration in your life. One of the things that stood out to me as a teacher, was that is was revolved so much around good character attributes. We have a lesson we ready each morning to the students called *Character Counts* and I feel this is such an important lesson to be taught and emphasized frequently. If you like motivational stories or if you are currently needing some inspiration in your daily life, this would be a book that would be worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifiting Tales in a Large Book","review":"Everyday Greatness is a book that demands to be read over multiple sittings. Compiled of stories from Reader's Digest, you will discover the inspirational lessons from celebrities, writers, politicians, actors and more.Each chapter gives you three stories from three different people followed by quotes that fit within the theme.The themes range from finding meaning in your life, taking charge, dreaming (life not the sleep kind), overcoming hardship and much much more.I keep saying more because this book clocks in at 434 pages.The first story had me dreading reading the rest. Not because I didn't enjoy it, but because it was almost a tear jerker. I wasn't ready to read sad story after sad story. Luckily most of the stories are positive and not ending with a death.The things you learn about people like Chuck Norris as a bagger and Mrs. Ford as a drug addict are just a few of the tid-bits you'll uncover as you learn a little bit about yourself on the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This is the first CD I bought from Klee.

I was also amazing how 99% of the Japanese actors spoke perfect American/English. Not that I was expecting realism here...Doesn't anybody look at these mistakes while editing or making the movie.This movie could have been made by an elementary school video class.

All extremely amateurish. Oh, and what was all that black and white flash-cutting about?The one thing I couldn't work out was whether the film is deliberately being ironic or is meant to be taken at face value.

The title monsters are absent through most of this film with the majority of their actions happening off screen as for the fight you see 10 seconds of the octopus wrapped around a mildly thrashing shark then they sink into darkness.

Mega Shark jumps out of the ocean and bites into an airliner full of passengers. It's been a long time since I've had a good belly laugh.

This film really could have been a lot of fun, given the idea, but I can't even say I had fun watching this one.

No blood, gore , nudity, vomit , etc which to me is a rare treat. Its about the monsters but alas the fight between the 2 monsters doesn't occur until the very end.

Lorenzo Lamas swaggers his way to a career making performance as the hard driving military man who has an unexpected sensitive side.

I guess there's a reason why real Canon parts are so much more expensive: my actual Canon batteries work incredibly well and the charge lasts for eons. Even after three consecutive overnight charges, this one is so weak that my camera will barely turn on, and if it does, it won't power the LCD display, even. (I managed to take 2 pictures before it crapped out, but of course I couldn't even see what I was snapping, since the LCD wouldn't come on) Given the price, it might not be worth the shipping to send it back, I might just have to find somewhere local that can recycle it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value battery","review":"Battery is just like oem at a fraction of the cost however, it took almost a month to get to me.

A striking feature of this book is the ability to focus on issues that, in the end, go well beyond Australia and are in fact poignant at this point in time in many regions of the world. It is a book that is a must read for anyone interested in the rethorics of multiculturalism, in the problematics concerning immigration, women and minority rights in Australia but also everywhere. Some contributions are outstanding and so significant to be considered essential at a level of international discussion around inclusion and exclusion, identity, race and ethnic debates."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful and intelligent page turner","review":"This is a beautiful book. Set against the political events leading to the independence of Congo, we are told of the story of a woman's political involvement and her partner's difficulty to grasp the emotional intensity of her commitment. A glance at the political intrigues surrounding the assasination of Lumumba is in itself a reason to read the book, but it is the tale of the reactions of the main characters to the political events which are storming in their lives that make it a truely beautiful story. One of my very recommended novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult to get through","review":"although i liked the setting - and the plot & characters were good, they writing style made it difficult for me to get through this book. it seemed to general where more detail was needed, too much detail where i wasn't interested and in general i put the book down after every few pages, chapters - where is this going, why is he telling me this...it was just difficult to get through. on the whole the story is good, but it wasn't fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One to remember","review":"I read this novel when it was released. It stayed with me like almost no other novel ever has, hence my decision to review it. Simply put, it was excellent. Ronan Bennett told his story with sensitivity for the political climate, and a keen insight into human relationships. I echo the sentiments of another reviewer in that this is a thinking person's novel. Bennett's writing style is awesome. Those not interested in the content but partial to spectacular penmanship should still read this novel. They will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good saga of the decolonization of the Congo","review":"I'm surprised to see it hasn't been released in the US yet, but this is a very well written novel. Not light - the prose is quite intense, and one is often forced to read very slowly. Characterisation is good, and the story is sound. The only problem is that it is not by an African and as such it misses out on the nuances which would be available to one born on the continent. There is only so much that can be gleaned in a trip from the UK. Still, this is the time for more novels of Africa, even if we Africans can't be bothered to write them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic. Gripping. Multi-Faceted","review":"An Irish author, his Italian lover, an American spy, and a host of African revolutionaries compromise an unlikely cast of characters that Bennet amazingly manages to make believable, even compelling.This is a story of love lost, art vs. politics, trust and betrayal, all superimposed on the backdrop of Patrice Lumumba's struggle in the Belgian Congo. The reader can't help but be drawn in by the hopelessness of the protagonist's pursuit of his lost lover. The characters are complex, flawed, and realistic.This is a bleak novel of self destruction and situations out of control. The protagonist is intentionally apolitical (which causes the rift with his former lover) but his story mirrors the political conflict that surrounds him.A masterful, well researched, thoughtful novel. A love story and a political novel all at once, which manages never to be pretentious or preachy. Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mathematics made simple","review":"This is a helpful math book,it covers a lot of subjects from basic math to some pretty difficult topics.My only problem with it is that there are a bunch of wrong answers in the \\"answer\\" section,but it just made me hunt and work that much harder to find the correct answers.I hope they do a revision of this book because I would like to give it as a gift,but not at this time with all the mistakes in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great review - lousy math","review":"Nice review of basic math principles, but there are an incredible number of mistakes in the answer section in the back of the book. Really confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for people with math phobia","review":"As a former university-level math teacher, I have used this book multiple times to help adult students get over math phobia. It presents basic concepts in an organized, simple way. Learning math only makes sense when taken on as a series of logical, sequential steps. If you find yourself struggling with using everyday math, there's a good chance you missed one of those steps during elementary or jr. high school. If that's the case, this book is for you. It fills in the blanks that you might not even know you have. Math really can be made simple, and this book shows how. It's an oldie but goodie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty","review":"Disappointing! At first glance this book does have lots potential in terms of simplifying concepts and formulas, but it is loaded with mistakes - not only in the answer sections, but also regarding some of the methods.

This is not a good buy - even if one merely needs a refresher in math."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!","review":"I purchased this Oratorio after hearing a violin solo from it, and was expecting something similar of the rest. I was sorely disappointed. Unfortunately, I got this item somewhere else, to my Eternal grief (at least on AMAZON, I would have saved $25.00). All the soloists do as best they can with the material given (especially the violin solo in Movement VI), but the lyrics could have been written by a fifth-grader with a Rhyming Dictionary. Here is an example of great talent gone to waste. BE FOREWARNED: just because Paul McCartney's name is attached to this vanity work of supposedly \\"serious\\" music, does NOT make this a good piece of music. Carl Davis has written many wonderful scores for movies, and Paul McCartney can stand on his own past record of good works, but this is so trite, silly, and appallingly bad that I wish I was able to give it minus five stars.

I did not do it and trusted the reviews above and now I have recording I will hardly listen to it again. Everything is nice and cast is well chosen with one exception. Delilah\`s role is essentuial for the opera and Miss Meier is among the weakest mezzo I have ever heard. I can not understand the others reviewer\`s delight, but I could not find anything interesting in her voice. It is dull, weak voice with no lower register /in mezzosoprano!/ and in emotive scenes she has no power. Well, the most famous aria \\"Mon coeur s'ouvre a ta voix\\" is sung O.K. /but not among the best versions/, but the opera has much more to offer in Delilah\`h secenes a there I was really dissatisfied with the weakness and not a mezzo voice colour of her voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"The item was advertised as like new, the slip cover and the booklet were missing, the jewel case was damaged, disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE, AWFUL, LIFE THREATENING PRODUCT - DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!","review":"I wish I had the opportunity to read the online reviews for these travel systems before I bought mine. However due to circumstances I needed to get one fast and this looked great in the store. Unfortunately the two times that I had my son in the car THE SEAT FLIPPED OVER WITH HIM IN IT!!!! The pictures that someone had posted for another Eddie Bauer ITS are not faked. I wrote the company and blasted them as well. I am now returning this to the store to get something more safe. I find it thoroughly dispicable that this product was allowed out of the warehouse and I hope Babies R Us reconsiders carrying it.I gave it one star because I had to in order to post this review. If I had my way it would be zero stars. I will be writing the US Consumer Product Safety Commission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product not quite as I expected it to be","review":"I purchased this travel system last fall for my first child. The first time I used the stroller, one of the wheels had a terrible vibration and when my newborn was in her infant seat, locked into the stroller, her head would bounce with every push. I took it back and exchanged it for another. I got along fine with the stroller and really like it. We now have issues with the car seat. We recently adjusted the base so our baby could be a little more upright. Since we did that, we noticed the seat bobbing and wobbling as we drive. I've had the base installed by a car seat technician in 3 different vehicles and have had the same result every time. I have purchased another travel system from a different manufacturer and will be returning this one for a full refund. I really feel the car seat base needs to be modified somehow to help stabilize the car seat. It's like the car seat is too top-heavy for the base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Car seat not good","review":"We received this travel system as a gift from our registry. My husband was having trouble getting the base for the car seat to fit tightly in the car so we took it to a professional at the fire department. The lady there told my husband that this car seat has a design flaw that does not allow it to be used in all cars. The bottom fits tightly, but the top of the car seat moves all over and could easily tip over when turning a corner. The lady suggested that we use the car seat without the base, but that does not seem safe to me. I called Eddie Bauer and they do not have a recall on the item. Babies R Us agreed to take it back in exchange for a different travel system as long as we could get the receipt since we threw the box away already. Although I have not used the stroller yet, I do think that it's a great stroller, but the car seat is just not safe in our cars (Ford Contour 2000 and Ford Escape 2004). Unless you know for sure that it will work in your car, I would not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unstable carseat","review":"I purchased this travel system over the weekend. My husband and I had no problem with the stroller. However, once we installed the carseat into our car, we noticed how very unstable the carseat actually was. The entire front of the carseat easily moved from side to side. I expected this carseat to not be able to move at all once placed into position in my car. For the amount of money that we paid, I would have thought this product would be top of the line and very stable. Boy was I wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO HARD","review":"I HAD PURCHASED THIS TRAVEL SYSTEM FOR THE NAME EDDIE BAUER WHICH WAS A BIG MISTAKE CAUSE IT WAS HARDER THAN IT IS WORTH THE CARSEAT IS TOO HEAVY AND TOO BIG AND THE STROLLER DOESN'T OPEN WITH ONE HAND. THE CARSEAT IS TOO HARD TO HOOK IN THE STROLLER I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS STROLLER TO ANYONE. IT TOOK ME 20 MINUTES TO OPEN AND HOOK UP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware...Try it out before buying!!!!","review":"We purchased this travel system because we liked how sturdy it seemed. My husband thinks the car seat/carrier is too heavy, but to me that makes it seem sturdier. I LOVE the stroller. It is extremely easy to maneuver, and very user-friendly! We had absolutely no trouble when our son was small, but now, the car seat will tip over when you go around a corner. No matter which way we install this seat (seat belt or tether straps), we cannot get it tight enough. I think it must be our car (we have a montero), because not everyone has this trouble. I highly recommend that you try it in your car before you purchase this. As any parent would agree, the safety of your child is most important!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings Back Fond Memories","review":"A million years ago I listened to this album endlessly with an old friend, Gina on her B.I.C. speakers.

It appeared that the book had been left out in the sun or something--brown around the edges. It did not look like a new book. It smelled musty too.But here's the good news: when I requested a refund, Amazon acted quickly. They sent a UPS truck the same day to pick up the item. I missed them, and I missed the second visit. I was home for the THIRD UPS visit. As soon as Amazon got my item, I received a full refund, credited to my account. I was notified promptly via e-mail. It was the most convenient return I have ever experienced, online or face-to-face. I did not have to leave my house.I do hope Amazon orders a new set of the Hornblower series. I would recommend Forrester to all readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uneven","review":"This is a rip-roaring naval adventure from start to finish, no mistake. But I also find it one of the most problematic in the Hornblower series. For one thing, the action seems much more episodic (and, as a result, much more easily resolved) than in previous installments. But the big concern is that Hornblower is perhaps at his most unlikable in this book. His deeply flawed character has always been one of his most intriguing aspects. But here, he crosses the line into self-absorbed whining, IMO. He doesn't feel as developed as he does in the earlier books, no doubt because this one was written second. Forester seems to have gotten to know his character better as he went, which lends an interesting, but still unfortunate, sense of unevenness to this otherwise enjoyable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENDS ON CLIFFHANGAR","review":"Excellent book. But just remember...BUY FLYING COLOURS AS WELL. This book ends on a cliffhangar that you cannot concentrate on DeCartes' theorems in class because you are aching to know what will happen next.This books completely set the stage for the internally-evntful FLYING COLOURS, especially with the frequent haunting memories of young Horatio. Full of foreshadowing, we cannot help but pity our Captain as he hits rock bottom after so much good luck.Makes ya wonder why everything HAD to happen to him. *sad*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy","review":"My 23 yr. old son asked for this book for Christmas and was delighted to receive it.

The 39 year old Horatio Hornblower is given command of the 74 gun HMS Sutherland, 'the ugliest and least desirable two-decker in the Navy list.' Also, being 250 men short of a crew, he must enlist and train new members. Will this ship and crew be able to handle BOTH the French navy and army? Is this the end of Hornblower? Of course not, otherwise there wouldn't be more books after this, but don't you want to know how he handles a blockaded Spanish coast AND four French warships?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No digital copy for sale at Amazon","review":"I find it deplorable that this well-recieved series still has no digital KINDLE copy for selected titles (Happy Return,Ship of the Line). Other titles in long-running series suffer the same fate.Amazon has made it difficult to like them, and it is getting more and more unlikely they will ever change their ways. BTW, how many requests does it take to have Amazon find it profitable enough to make a KINDLE copy of a publication available?Sounded like a good book, as I have read the synopsis elsewhere. Unfortuantely I just now bought the printed version at a used book store in the city."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than average","review":"I found the Hornblower stories to wear down as he rose in rank, but this one was a little better perhaps due to the internal politics of the fleet.

The stand doesn't stay together, the microphone stand and connector to the keyboard broke. The seat is okay, and they keyboard itself is working standalone. I'm going to see, since there are so many bad reviews, if i can take it back - fortunately I kept the boxes and receipts!I normally give musical instruments a high educational value, but since this one is so bad, I only gave it a 1.

My little guy still likes it but I'm just annoyed that it broke that quickly. I think I'll take it back and get something that is made better.Also, the sound control is awful! When you turn on the demo play it blasts the music. He came running in crying because it hurts his ears. The volume can be turned down but resets itself after every demo play.

The manufacturer should really rething the construction of that microphone, it is so flimsy and the piece that broke off was sharp. I boxed the keyboard up and returned it to Toys R Us the next day....They were out of stock so I couldn't get another one...but after reading all the reviews, I'm glad they didn't have any....I'm going to look for something that will last more than 5 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this toy!","review":"I bought this toy for my two year old twins and it broke within one day.

Period.No company should ever see a dime for such a shoddy product.Like most other \\"complainers\\", my 2 1/2 year old broke the mic stand within a half-hour after assembly. The microphone emits almost constant feedback which isn't helped by positioning alone, might be electrical problems on top of audio feedback.It's a shame really. My daughter is so excited at the idea of a \\"piano for her size\\". It was her favorite toy this christmas.I think anyone else who has had bad experiences should contact Little Tikes. The real maker of this toy, Kid Station, somehow hoodwinked Little Tikes to distribute this thing. Normally, Little Tikes toys are built solidly and we bought on this reputation.

Little Tikes may lose business from us in the future because of this and the hassle we have had to deal with."},{"rating":"1","title":"problems with microphone","review":"Obviously the reason this item was such a good price is because of it's poor quality. A child small enough to use it can't sit close enough to the microphone without it making a horrible squealing noise.

Don't bother spending the money on this one...you're better off spending a few extra dollars to get one that's not so annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS TOY!","review":"Ok, forget the collapsing microphone ...

Ordered from Amazon and immediately the stool was missing. Put it together easily. On day two my five year old snapped microphone stand. Around day six my three year old collasped it and I can't get it back together. And then the microphone pulled out around day nine. The bill came around day fifteen."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS TOY SUCKS!!!!!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!","review":"Like so many of the reviews written I have the same problem. THe mic piece broke right away and trying to get a replacement was a NIGHTMARE!!! Kid Station was very unhelpful and rude. Customer service/ non-support did not care either way if the product was returned or not. I actually called little tikes to complain about them. The Key board itself is cheap, plastic is flimsy, the stool is not sturdy the music is way to load, and the mic holder broke right away! biggest waste of $30. The only reson why i rated this toy a 1 star was b/c there was no way to rate this a BIG FAT ZERO star!! save yourself the hassle and do not buy this toy! buy anthing else but this!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!! I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS TOY","review":"My almost 2 year daughter recieved this as a gift. This is the worst piece of junk we have ever recieved. We have been through three of these now. All three have had the same problems. This toy is made of cheap plastic. The microphone stand has been broken on 2 out of the three. They were broken before we even got the thing out of the box. All three times we have put the thing together for my daughter to play with. All three times it works for about 2 minutes. Then you have to bang it to start it again. The first one the drums never did work. The second one the lights didn't work and now our third one nothing works unless you bang the crap out of it. Then it only plays for a couple of minutes. (...) This toy is going back to ToysRUs again and staying there. I am not exchanging it again. I would not recommend this toy to anyone.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and Unsafe","review":"I feel the need to write a review for this item. Not only did my microphone stand break off but the stool keeps falling apart. This is not just a cheap toy, it is UNSAFE! My daughter could easily be seriously hurt by hitting her head on something any one of the countless times the stool has fallen apart. I wish I could give this toy less than one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 out of 3 broken!","review":"My daughter (age 2), and 2 nieces (ages 1 and 3) each received one of these toys for Christmas. All three of these toys broke within 5 minutes of being taken out of the box in exactly the same spot~ The arm that holds the microphone onto the keyboard snapped at the base. I think this was poor craftmanship for a child's toy. It shouldn't be so fragile."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"My 3 year old son received this last Christmas and in a matter of hours the microphone stand was broken. Dealing with Kids Station was not fun. Received a new mircophone stand finally but it did not fit in the hole. Had to put the keyboard against the wall so that it would not fall over. A year later the toy is in the landfill somewhere. Even if you pay $15.00 for it, it is a total waste of money. Very disappointed in Little Tikes to put their name on something like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BOTHER","review":"My wife and I purchsed this toy for my 2 year old daughter and she loves it. I would have given this toy four stars expcet for the fact that, like other reviewers, it is poorly made. The Microphone stem broke(I did that) and I called Little Tikes for service. Little Tikes referred me to Kids Station. Little Tikes doesn't support it, even though it's name is on the toy!!! What a con game!! Kids Station was even worse. Needless to say, after two phone calls to Kids Station, I still have not been able to order the replacement part. Stay away. Two big thumbs down to Little Tikes and Kids Station."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Tykes shouldnt have put their name on this","review":"Very chinzy and cheap pieces. i had to glue pieces together to keep them from falling apart. also, the battery door has a teeny tiny screw thats virtually impossible to screw and unscrew for battery replacement. YOu almost end up stripping the head of the screw trying to do it. the keyboard is the only part thats half way decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic, doesn't live up to Tikes reputation","review":"I don't think this toy could have been made any cheaper. Ours is cracked in several places, even though it's hardly been played with... My kids really are not hard on toys, and are destroying this one. We also had bought the drumset from Little Tikes, but returned it, because it broke before I could even assemble it. Disappointing. This keyboard just doesn't live up to my expectations from Little Tikes products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never even got to use it","review":"We bought this for our son in August as a Christmas gift. We put it away until then. On Christmas morning, our son was so excited when he opened it. When I was putting it together he couldn't wait to play with it. I got it all together and turned it on only to find it had no power at all. Tried many brand new batteries but nothing. The look on my son's face made my heart sink. He was so upset. We called Kid Station and asked them what we could do about it. They said the warrenty had already expired. They told us we could ship it to them and they would sell us another one for a discounted price. So, we would have to pay for the shipping of this one and pay for another one including shipping. It's not even worth it. So, my advice is to not buy this product. If you do, make sure it works as soon as you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for tykes","review":"We bought this for our son when he was 1 year old. He instantly figured out what the microphone is for. At 16 months, the piano is his favorite toy. He loves making music and singing. This piano was recommended from a friend whose three year old is on his second piano (after wearing out the first).The only down side is that not all chord combinations work - some chords play as expected while others elicit a buzzing sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable at all- broke within minutes","review":"My daughter loves to play her cousins piano so we thought this was a great gift. From the moment we put it together it has been nothing but problems.1st- the microphone attachment broke within minutes of puting it together.2nd- the microphone jack broke, so she can't even use the microphone anymore.3rd - It's dangerous. It keeps collasping when she plays it. She ends up on the floor on top of the keyboard.It is so frustrating and I don't even want her to try and play it, because I know what is coming. Winthin minutes she is crying in a heap of piano mess on the floor.I expect more from Little Tikes. I wouldn't pay a $1 for this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun toy but not durable AT ALL.","review":"We got this toy for my 3 year old son. He loved it! The lights are cool and the different tempos and stuff it has is cool. But like most of these reviews the microphone stand broke after only a few days of using it. I also called customer service and was told to send a request in writing. I could barely understand the guy I talked to and he was pretty short with me, wouldn't even let me make sure I had written down the address correctly. The rest of the toy has held up good but my son loves the microphone and that is why we got this particular one. My son isn't even rough with it and it just broke. I wouldn't waste your money on this. It isn't worth it. And I don't agree with the person who said you get what you pay for. This SHOULD be better constructed considering that Little Tikes has their name on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The quality if horrible","review":"My daughter received this as a Christmas present, and by 3:00 that afternoon, the joint on the microphone holder broke. I was very dissapointed. You would think that the manufacturer would have enough inteligence to realize that kids toys need to be durable! I'm not really sure what they were thinking...or if they even were. I would not reccomend this keyboard to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The stand fell apart instantly","review":"This is fun and a good idea, but the quality of the stand and the plastic is very poor. It fell apart the first time we had it up, and while you can put it back together, unless you want to be doing it every ten seconds, it isn't worth it. The keyboard itself is fine. The microphone overpowers the keyboard music and has no volume on it, but the keyboard does. The microphone stand is really cheap plastic and broke right away. I would suggest buying a cheap keyboard and microphone and just using it on a table instead, or if you buy this product, don't expect to use the keyboard stand for long, but it can work without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good product","review":"My son (3) loves the toy but it is not safe, breaks real easy and half of the buttons do not work. Its a shame because my sons loves music. I just wished they would have made a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"My son received this for his 3rd birthday and the microphone broke off within a week. I called customer service and was told I needed to contact the outside distributor who manufactured the toy. Once I called them, I received the worst customer service and was told I needed to write a letter to the warehouse requesting a new part. I was told that I would have to pay for the part and that it was not even certain that they would have the part in stock. For as much fun as a keyboard is for my son, I would not recommend this particular model. It is truly not worth the hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give this toy --- zero --- stars","review":"This toy is cheap, easily breakable and DEFINITELY not worth the money. Little Tikes should be ashamed to put its name on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of junk!","review":"My 3 year old only had the toy a matter of hours before it fell over and the microphone stand broke. Wrote company, which isn't Little Tikes, for a replacement. Received it but it didn't fit. Also you had to put the batteries in carefully otherwise it didn't work. Worst toy that we have ever bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This piano looks adorable. Unfortunately, the microphone attachment broke within the first week. Also, the legs of the piano constantly come apart. Perhaps you could try superglue, but I don't think that would work for very long either. It is certainly not as durable as most other Little Tykes products. I recommend you continue to look at other options. My children never play with this and it was a waste of money. Poor quality; Poor sound; Doesn't function that well. Very frustrating. Another item for the garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to Other Reviews--DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"The mic stand broke just as predicted and then shortly thereafter the batteries seemed not to work.

The microphone broke off then one day it just stopped working! I changed the batteries but NADA! What a piece of trash now! But we had fun with it while it lasted...which wasn't long!***FYI--I emailed the company and they sent me a new one...the microphone and stand quickly broke, but it is still working. Be very gentle with the stand if you purchase this toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with all the others - do not buy this toy","review":"Wow, was I surprised when I got on-line to purchase a new mike stand, which broke almost immediatly, only to find everybody else had the exact same problem.What a rip off.Also, poor quality sound - too scratchy and loud. I really wish we'd read the reviews on this toy before buying (we saw it in the store and fell so in love with it we bought it before doing our homework). Mistake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed in the Quality","review":"My daughter received this toy for Christmas. It was great for 4 months -- she loved it. Then it just died. When I called for assistance I was told that the warranty was only for 90 days and I'd have to pay to have the toy shipped to them as well as any parts/labor etc. (approximately 10 - 15 dollars for the part alone)I can't believe that they feel they (Kidstation -- not Toys r Us) can charge close to $40 for a toy they can only warrant for 90 days. Shouldn't we be getting better quality?For as much as my daughter loves this toy, it's killing me to not get her another one but I refuse to buy anything else manufactured by Kidstation.And on top of the poor quality of the toy -- the customer service rep was rude as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS","review":"How I wish I had read the reviews! The keyboard does not work. The microphone does not work. The microphone stand broke as did one of the legs and the stand falls apart with the slightest pressure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God we still have the box so we can return it!!!","review":"My son received this keyboard for a gift. He also received another one that is one of those Wal-Mart, Kid's Connection, cost effective/cheap products. Wellll, within two hours of having it assembled, like most everyone else here said, he'd broken the microphone stand. He wasn't being rough, just adjusting it!! The cheap keyboard has entertained him just as much and is more durable. Shame on Little Tikes!! I've always been such a fan because of the quality of the product. I figure if the microphone broke that quick, the legs won't last long either, so it's going back! Also, once assembled, you can't disassemble without breaking the plastic on the legs. BOOO! Worst gift of the year award!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun toy, poor quality","review":"My husband and I bought this for my son, age 2, for Christmas. He really likes it. It is a great toy for him and has many features. I do agree with a lot of other reviews about the quality of this toy. It stinks! My son has already broken the microphone stand. It is made of very cheap plastic, not sturdy at all. Not something that I would expect from little tikes either. I don't care if it was 30 bucks or not, it should withstand childsplay... its a toy!! Great product, poorly made. Little Tikes should consider choosing another company to make this product. Overall I don't regret purchasing this because my son enjoys it, I just would have assembled the microphone differently so it wouldn't have broken so quickly. There is other keyboards out there, and I would consider shopping around because they are similar and all offer about the same amount of features, but maybe better quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have had this 4ever","review":"I purchased this toy for my son when he was 2.5. He is now 5.5, we still have it and it still works!!. His little sister who is now 2.5 loves to play with it. She even uses the stool to use the potty and brush her teeth. It is plastic but is is very durable. Great years of use. You can't beat the price either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun while it lasted.....which wasn't long","review":"My goddaughter received this for her 2nd birthday and while the kids enjoyed it immensely, within 24 hours the microphone was broken. This should have been a sign, but it didn't deter us from buying one for my daughter (3 years old) since she enjoyed it so much. We were extra careful with it but while the microphone didn't break off, the entire unit has stopped working. Initially we thought it just needed new batteries, but once we replaced them the thing just died. What a shame. It was a blast when it worked even though it was poorly constructed and quite flimsy. But now that it doesn't work at all, I'd have to say it's a piece of crap. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Christmas gift for my kids. Had seen them playing a similar toy (different maker) at their friends house. When shopping saw this one, and hoping the Little Tykes reputation would give me a better product, I bought this one instead of the other brand. Boy was I wrong! The second day the microphone arm broke. a month or so later, one of the bubble shaped light caved in. My kids weren't being too rough with the toy, they were just playing like kids would. I am disappointed that the quality is not up to what I usually expect from Little Tykes. If the pieces weren't broken, my kids would still be playing with it. But, they don't like it the way it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"My children love it , but it is not sturdy enough for 3 yr olds!","review":"As with a couple of the other reviewers, my kids 2, 3 and 8 yrs. old all loved it. I expected it to be much sturdier because of the Little Tikes brand, but was sadly mistaken. The keyboard and microphone stands both broke almost immediately, but we kept using it because the kids enjoyed it. It was also a grandma gift, so I didn't want to return it. I was very disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Broke out of the Box Ditto!","review":"This item was purchsed for my sons 3rd b-day and it broke the next day. The plastic that it is made from is so cheap and flemsy. I did not expect it to be so having the Little Tikes name but apparently they did not manufactor it. I fell somewhat decived by this. I thought I was buying a product with the little tikes quality I have come to expect. It was a complete rip off. Pleae do not waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made and the feedback is horrible!","review":"My daughter was very excited when she opened this gift. However, when she tried to play it, the microphone gave off loud and annoying feedback when placed anywhere near the keyboard. She used this for maybe 30 seconds then never went near it again. When we tried to disassemble to put back in the box for return, the stool broke. This is a horrible toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"BROKEN!","review":"I have to agree with others on this one.

The advice is good, without too many new ideas. Nonetheless, it is useful to be reminded of the important things on the often neglected habit of listening.What is really funny is that on p. 11 you will encounter a reprint of an urban myth about Leland Stanford, which the book presents as a true story.

Master Auto Technician with over forty years experience, I was looking for a good shop manual for my boat. The engine is a Volvo 4.3 V6 with a Holley Marine carb...no big deal. The outdrive is other than what I've had experience (brand) with and I felt it would be a good thing to have specific repair information for it. The Internet (Marine Parts Express) gave more information (for free) on what I was looking for than this \\"Paper Paperweight\\" did. I found (in my opinion), the information it contained to be generic and useless. For the unskilled it might serve a purpose, for me, it's a paperweight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you need.","review":"If you are looking for a marine repair manual you probably have some mechanical skill but not so much you want to completely rebuild right down to the crankshaft. This book does the exact opposite. Wasted pages on the basics of four cylce combustion (who is there that would not already know but still care?), chapters on using micometers on everything from pistons to bearings (something usually only done in rebuild shops). But there is very little information the average boat owner can use. Little or incorrect information on replacing risers, pumps or stern drive removal.The Seloc manual is a much better choice although it has many of the same sins, just less so. The Seloc also has much more complete tune up information.

He was always described as crucial to American military and technological supremacy since 1943 or so. A few of his accomplishments: He mobilized American science and engineering during WWII. His leadership was crucial to the Manhattan project. His differential analyzer led to MIT's Lincoln Labs playing an important role in the rise of information technology.

I would look else where before buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most disappointing Frommer's guide","review":"Am usually a huge fan of Frommer's guidebooks. But am disappointed to say that this book was not helpful in ANY way ! There is nothing useful here - from overall insight, to presenting specific materials in a usable, organized format.. NOTHING ! Even the shops she recommended would've been difficult to find without a good map in the book. Most bothersome of all, it seems like the author doesn't even like Thailand very much and it is reflected in her review of attractions, various warnings, etc. Thailand is a beautiful, interesting country with much to offer for any type of traveler. We went to Bangkok and the Southern coast and did not use the book at all- for planning or during the trip.Considering that there is no content, this book was very heavy to travel with ! ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Disappointing to say the least.

I am a male, and at the time of reading, a U.S. Marine who should have been decidely against any form of deviation. But when I read the book, I was so greatly impressed with the pathos of the writer and the beauty of the writing, that I wanted no else in my immediate acquaintence to see this book and possibly ridicule it. You see, I was aboard ship with a battalion of fellow Marines and I knew that such a book would find nothing but patent denigration by \\"all hands.\\" So,I read the book to last page of this beautiful book, closed it, and with tears in my eyes, dropped it into the Mediterranean Sea. I've never forgotten this book in all these years."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books!","review":"I loved the way this book was written. It is haunting, bittersweet, sad and beautiful.

I did not feel it was her choice to make but I understand why she made it- out of deep love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hall strikes a nerve","review":"While I find Hall's prose less than perfect, her take on lesbian life from childhood to adolescence to adulthood is realistic emotionally. It's very easy to relate to Stephen, the main character who must pass all the trials of lesbianhood, including unrequited love and rejection by her mother. I recommend it to anyone who has some time on their hands who wants an inside view into the mind of a lesbian."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"While this book has merit as a \\"literary classic,\\" it's value doesn't go much beyond that. For the most part, the story was interesting, though it certainly had its slow parts. But Hall's language and writing style is unrefined and leaves much to be desired. If you read it outloud, you realize just how cheesy and unrealistic some of the conversations and narrative really are. By the end of the book, I was glad to be done with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, gringada!!!","review":"The Moffats is ALL!!!! This CD is EVERYTHING!!! But I'm in Brazil, so distant of Moffats...

The beginning was good, I enjoyed the meeting between Jasmine and Falcon. The adventure sequence was fine, but the characters ruined it for me. The guy is walking, talking tube of testosterone and the girl is obviously going through an identity crisis . She thinks she's a porcupine. The love-hate thing was good for a while, but come on. But the miiddle of the book, it really got boring. Falcon does nothing but lust after Jasmine and she does nothing but say \\"No\\" throughout the whole book. Can't they at least get a little close? An entire conversation with flying into the roof would be nice. If you want to use the love-hate thing, it's fine; just don't overdo it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlikable Heroine","review":"I enjoyed the first hundred pages of this book.

Can this be the author who wrote \\"A Year and a Day\\"? The hero is quite sexy and the historical detail is very good, but the heroine is such a brat that I couldn't believe the hero still wanted her no matter how beautiful she was. The girl simply didn't deserve her man or the print it took up to write about her. She is a spoiled child who never really grows up. Although I abhor abuse in novels, I was rooting for someone to knock her senseless by the middle of the book. Ms. Henley is known for her characters who are buffeted by the historical events that involve them, but I just couldn't care what happens to this couple."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was just an OK","review":"The \\"customer\\" who reviewed this book said it better than I can. Jasmine said, no, no, no, no, no then yes, yes then no again! She kept getting herself in stupid, silly, dangerous situations where Falcon had to fly to her rescue. Then she still said no.

I'm not sure I even want to give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think Twice!","review":"Illegitimate Jasmine is THE FLOWER. Falcon de Burgh is THE FALCON. As the heroine, Jasmine spends most of the book changing her mind.

What can I say? \\"Jasmine is a difficult heroine to like!\\" What an understatement!While the hero isn't much better - as heros go - at least Falcon de Burgh deserves some credit in dealing with the very annoying Jasmine!

What bugged me throughout this book was the constant \\"ache\\" Falcon had for Jasmine and how she continued to turn him down. And then, suddenly, when she gets pregnant she loves him. Please. It was so unbelievable. I'm all for a fiesty heroine and a dark, brooding hero, but for God's sake this was ridiculous. And the shenanigan's at King John's court were just plain silly. I only read this for the historical content and I was sadly let down with that too. This won't be one I repeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the worst book ever!","review":"I can't believe I wasted hours of my life reading this book!! The main characters were absolutely AWFUL to each other. Like many male protagonists of the romance genre, he was very arrogant. Arrogance/confidence is okay to some degree, but Falcon was mean...downright mean and hateful to Jasmine. Jasmine was a complete and spoiled rotten brat, as well as a first degree witch. I know a good story needs some conflict, but GOOD GRIEF! I found myself hating both characters because of their deplorable behavior towards each other!! I honestly don't even know why I bothered to finish the book. I guess I kept hoping it would get better, but it truly never did.Don't waste your money on this one! If you want a well-written love story, try Julie Garwood, Hannah Howell, Monica McCarty, Kinley McGregor, or Galen Foley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiled brat blows off nice guy and he puts up with her","review":"Setting -- England/Wales/Ireland 1199 to 1202The most interesting aspect of this book is the history element. It's set in the early days of the realm of King John - the king who was so bad that the barons forced the Magna Carta on him.As for the romance, virtually every romance novel involves overcoming obstacles to finding true love. Usually the pair are from warring countries or he's killed a family member or something serious is in the way. In this book, there is no good reason for our heroine not to be willing, if not thrilled, to be betrothed to Falcon. He's young, handsome and even on the same side. Why he puts up with her running off to court and total self-centeredness is hard to understand.Still, the pace is enough that I never doubted that I'd finish the book.

And again, this is so different, the sound is huge, tremendous bass and a feeling of genuine enjoyment. My favorite tune, \\"dope feels good\\", is an incredible pulsing beat grooving through the ever changing voices of the artists, twisting their necks in passing to the Daft Punk cliches.

The songs represent a latin-based, mellow, depressing tone, which is contrary to his initial works. His trumpet playing is rather weak and cannot be heard in any abundance throughout any of the tracks. He plays a variation of an old song, Consuelo's Love Theme, but apparently drags it out to fill up space on the CD. The album is appropriate to help a listener fall asleep or in a depressive episode. None of his original band members take part in this release, and there is no resemblance to his earlier works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total nonsense","review":"This book starts out with nothing and ends with nothing. The author decided what he thought was true and then set about 'proving' it by joining up dots on a map. Having invented an imaginery circle he then goes on to weave a web of self-delusion.

I was convinced on the phone by Siemens tech support that there must be problem with the wiring in my house - even though I am an electrical engineer and should have known better.

Bad reception, pops and breakups in the signal and what seems like a slower rate of communication with the base station. Net net - unreliable and unusable. I have tried new battery sets several times with no improvement... it just seems that there is some fundamenal design or construction problem or component that causes these phones to fail after a while.

Strangely, when I slap the handset in my palm sharply the sound clears up for a few seconds.Seimens support is as terrible as the phone.

Some cool features are included but if you can't hear or talk well with them what use are they."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality sabotage a good idea","review":"I thought this phone had cool design with its small size and lack of antenna. What I found out is the designers sacrificed basic functionality for whiz-bang gadget appeal. The most important feature of a phone is sound quality, and the sound quality of this phone is very poor. It is very difficult to hear people talking even in a quiet room, and if you turn up the volume the mic just picks up more room noise and makes it worse. There also some basic functions that are made overly complex. To use redial for example you are forced to toggle through several menus on the LCD screen rather than just hitting a button. The phone is also too small to hold comfortably and it looks like a remote control and gets lost on the coffe table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this phone at your peril","review":"I loved this phone when I first got it. A friend had a set, so I bought 'em for my home and my small business. They worked great for quite a while. Then the trouble started.After about 12 months, the batteries completely die - expect to replace them regularly.My friend who also had this set started having a serious problem about 16 months into his ownership. ALL of his handsets started \\"skitching\\" when he used 'em. The outgoing sound would crackle in and out. You can twist the phones themselves and it stops for a brief time.At about the same point in ownership, around 16 months, my set started doing the same thing. I expect my 8-month old office set to have the same problem in the near future.This defect makes these phones unusable. Purchase this Siemens set and you'll love them for a little over a year. Then you'll curse Siemens daily as you shop for a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat Features, poor handsets","review":"I've had this system for over a year with mixed results. If you read the manuals, you can access a feature set that is rich and functional. If you are non-technical, you'll have problems as the menu system is not intuitive. In short, no problem for gadget freaks, but our spouses won't fare as well.The system has been susceptible to interference and range limitations. The handsets have a noticable delay and/or non response to pressing keys (all 5 of my handsets, not just a problem unit). This is especially problematic for children and potential emergency situations with 911. We're replacing our system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst thing I have ever owned!","review":"Stop--- do not but this product or any Siemens Phones. I bought the System and loved it at first, I recomended it to everyone. Then Like clock work after one year (which is the warranty) it started malfunctioning. The handsets went in and out, and dropped the call. It has been getting worse and worse as the system gets older (now two years old). Here is the kicker, I know 6 people with this sytem that have the exact same problem!!! Siemens tells me, I can buy refurbished handsets to replace the bad ones, great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The STATIC Maker!!!","review":"This phone is horrible! I would never buy it again. This is the second Siemens 2402 system i've had in the past year, and each system gives an extreme amount of static and cuts out worse than a cell phone in an area without reception when you are 2 feet from the bas or 2 blocks from the base - the phone has the same problems. If it weren't for the lousy clarity and constant static and breaking up - this phone would be a #6 on a 1-5 scale!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice system","review":"I have had the same handset and batteries for two years now (handset made in USA).I spilled coffee on the handset and some buttons became a little insensitive while still usable, but that is my fault. Interference is a problem only when using the microwave. The sound quality is superb under the conditions I require.The base station location with this and any system is absolutely critical. I had no problems with setup of any kind. The manual is simple, complete and easy to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"Terrible! I've had trouble with this phone since I got it. The reception is horrible, it sounds like you are underwater when you speak. People on the phone with you cannot even understand your words. No matter how close or far from the base station, it's the same: terrible. Cool looks, nice features, unusable. Digital phones, for the most part, simple don't work well. I've gone through many.

Those that like westerns are likely to be older people with a passive interest in video games. Neversoft failed to keep this in mind. \\"Easy\\" isn't really easy. For example, even on \\"easy\\" if you don't ride flawlessly you won't beat Tom in the opening horse race. The graphics are great, but I found game play much too demanding for my 37 year old fingers. Since I couldn't get past the tutorials, I haven't enjoyed the game at all. Those that are able to do it are die hard gamers who'd probably rather play Call of Duty. I wonder if Red Dead Revolver or Call of Juarez actually are easy enough for me to fulfill my Western fantasy, or are they like Gun, so hard I want to use the disk as target practice with my real single action revolver?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED!","review":"I normally don't play first person shooter type games because I don't have the quick gaming reflexes necessary to play such games and most games don't have effective ways of controlling your character/aiming & shooting. I took a chance on this game though because it sounded interesting. I couldn't get past the poor aiming and firing controls to delve deeper into the game. The voice acting for the two main characters in the game was really good and the graphics were pretty good, but I couldn't play the game for more than the hour it took to learn the controls and play a ways into the game.

Especailly the third Symphony and Poem of Ecstasy surpass all existing recordings for its gorgeous sound, masterful timing of silence at crucial moments, gigantic finale and incandescent build-up to each climax. Only Pletnev's account of the Ecstasy can rival the grandeur. Ashkenazy's polite accounts do not come even close.Other symphonies are equally outstanding too. The first symphony is hugely under-rated masterpiece, full of inspired melodies and superb vocal parts. What a shame Scriabin did not write more for voice! Rich Philadelphia sound is beautifully recorded with warmth and amazing dynamic range (The distortion is only slight due to the enormous force of the sound at the climax)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finlandia: a little fast for my liking.","review":"The Finlandia is a bit fast for my liking...I guess I prefer the sentimental rich slow Ormandy-esque versions.

Most of the songs on this cd are not that good, but I do have to say that one good thing about this cd is that the song Absolutely Not (Chanel Mix) is included, that's why I gave it 2 stars. I have to agree with what several other people said in their reviews, if you are a Deborah Cox fan buy this cd, but if you are not save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deborah Cox is sensational","review":"This is my favorite Deborah Cox CD. I'm so sorry that it wasn't promoted enough. I don't think it sold well either but it's da bomb. I think she really out done herself on this one. My favorites tracks are five and six. She's a very good singer and I hope she releases another album real soon even though she tackling motherhood right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely HOT...","review":"I bought this CD because a roommate was listening to it... It is an excellent buy the songs are very mixed. She goes from hot james like Up and Down to slow jams. This is a perfectly woven tapestry. Deborah Cox has proven to me that she is a natural singer. She reminds me of what Whitney use to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice CD","review":"...I bought it... and I'm not dissapointed... One Wish was a dissapointment to me... I liked about 60% of that CD, when I like just about 100% of The Morning After. She adds dance song this time around, and her ballads aren't boring, as all have melodies, unlike most the ballads on One Wish. My favorite song would have to be \\"2 Good 2 Be True\\" W/ Jermaine Dupri... it has an awesome beat and it's used in a very big way. I also love the ballad \\"The Morning After\\"... it has a nice, relaxing beat that you will fall in love with. There are 2 dissapointments about this CD, however... \\"Just A Dance\\" should have been cut... it just doesn't flow with the rest of the album, and I wasn't enjoying it as much as the other songs. But the other dissapointment is... IT NEEDS MORE SONGS! Buy it... you won't be dissapointed, if you like her old ballads as well as dance tracks, like Tamia's CD.

A lot of the songs remind me of songs on Brandy's \\"full moon\\" album but even many of them were \\"ho-hummish\\". Too many of the songs like \\"Just a Dance\\" or \\"Up & Down\\" just don't have the \\"oomph\\" as her other songs. They all sound like a million other things I've heard on the radio with very little to differentiate.\\"Play your part\\" sounds more like something Deborah could've had on her last album, and \\"Oh my Gosh\\" is a catchy little tune but even these songs can't seem to redeem this album. It just seems to me that almost anyone with a good voice could've done some of these songs.In all, \\"The Morning After\\" just didn't meet Deborah's full potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope not this morning","review":"I sorry to break hearts but Deborah could have kept this one.It was not a good follow up to this success of her sophmore effort.Please stop try to sing songs that sound like nobody suppose to be here.The Cd Drags .I really thought with the first single that the tracks would be blazed by her powerhouse voice but oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Times A Charm In This Case","review":"Good Tracks:Up And Down, To Good TO Be True, Play Your Part, Like I Did, Morning After, Givin It Up, Up And Down Remix F/ Jadakiss, Starting With You, Mr. LonelyOK Tracks:Just Dance F/ Kurupt, Oh My GoshBad Tracks:Hurt So MuchThe Only Thing From This Not Making This One Of The Best Albums Of The Year Is Teh Lackluster Production On Like 3 Tracks.

One day Liam's brother gets sick and is in danger of losing his job if he stays home. Even though she is terribly afraid of going in the mine, Rory disguises herself as a boy so she can take Paddy's place until he is better.

Believe me I am reviewing this fairly, His lyrics are complete nonsense, it's like he slapped together some cool words and threw in some music so that everyone would like it.

Long before Get Busy was on every radio station in the country (I don't even like that one song that much), I was knocked on my [butt] by the incredible catchiness of Dutty Rock. Like Glue, Punkie, Gimme the Light - incredible songs. And having heard one of his newest (Ever Blazing), I can say that I'll be a Sean Paul fan for life. If a dancehall artist can get a shoegazing indie rocker like me to look up other Diwali riddim songs, then that's proof of his musical genius. Which is what Sean Paul Henriques is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starlite CD Review","review":"I review this CD has a 4 star, great effort. The beats are all catchy, and stick in your head. Even though you cannot understand what he is saying most of the time, you need to understand that he's from Jamaica.

As a yout there was school, food, drink and raga. When I was old enough to hit the clubs at 15/16 I was raving to Tiger, Baju and Red Rat... Those were raga artists. Sean Paul has released two good tunes - 'give me the light' and 'like glue,' and even those tunes, although they are good they lean towards what I consider raga-pop. Sean Pauls album is for light weights who aren't into raw dancehall tunes, Sean Pauls 'give me the light' for instance isn't even comparable to Elephant mans 'Log off.' There's space in Raga for Sean Paul and at least he's better than pop artist Shaggy, however, those who recognise what true raga is need to stay away from Sean Paul or at least pick the cd up for 'easy listening' purposes only."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Beenie Man wannabe","review":"What Crap!

Besides the big hits that were played on the radio (\\"Gimme the Light\\", \\"Get Busy\\", \\"Like Glue\\", \\"Baby Boy\\") and \\"Punkie\\" and \\"Can You do the Work\\", I found that most of this album was uninspired and repetitive and didn't make me want to sing along or dance. If you listen to the album twice in a row, you actually feel to skip most of the tracks the second time around... I would suggest you buy his Trinity album instead, a much more interesting one.

HE DIDNT WIN MANY AWARDS I WAS KINDA SURPRISED, WELL BUY THIS ALBUM ITS GOOD PEACE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sean Paul Review","review":"Sean Paul sounds like Bill and Ben on Crack. His voice is annoying, and I'm getting a refund. Is it me, or is RnB taking over the chart? Blu Cantrell wants her head testing for singing for this sorry excuse of an artist.

But you'll probably hate this cd if you form opinions about music by actually listening to lyrics rather than just jumping on the bandwagon with the latest artist who has a catchy beat and makes stupid 16 year old girls wanna \\"shake dat ting\\" at all the under 21 clubs. This guy is downright awful. Without the beats he'd be nothing and his garbage song lyrics would be exposed. This cd gets a 1 out of 5 at the best. Don't waste your money. Believe me, the singles and the beats get old really quick, and there is not much else worthwhile on the album.And who cares if all the Sean Paul diehards come back to trash me with insults like they did to that Christian dude who actually made a valid point or two as to why this guy sucks. Even if he was wrong about music style, rap/reggae/dancehall who cares? Its still GARBAGE."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best way to get a headache","review":"Okay, this guy cannot rap, sing, etc. Full stop. I have heard him live and he sounds like my guitar when it's untuned. He was basicly singing along with 3 other rappers and it was utter cacophony. There was no harmony, all their was was this discordant rapping.It sounded horrible and probably explains why his music isn't to impressive either. I don't know much about this style of music... but when I listened to 'Get busy' I felt there was no bass line at all. There was only was a drum beat buried by the sound of rapping/singing.I would only reccomend this to those who like R'n'B, rap, or over-procceced pop. I personally do not like the album. I believe that Sean Paul is one of those artists which gets instant success overnight and then gradually dwindles away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story that needs told more","review":"I figure we teach school kids about the Jews suffering in the Holocaust, and the blacks struggle for Civil Rights. It would make sense that kids learn the dangers of homophobic bigotry, by reading this book. It will open your eyes! The same anti-gay stereotypes then, are the same ones now.This book is about a gay man who survived the Pink Triangle, and took him over 25 years to tell his story, as their were still many anti-gay laws on the books there. This man never wanted any public or economic gains from telling his story. In fact the Nazis had more contempt for the gays than they did the 'inferior racial groups' they persecuted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusually intelligent and heart-wrenching","review":"Skillfully woven between the horror of experience and the constant questioning of unexplainable reasons for being \\"selected\\" because of sexual preference, the author speaks with chilling candor. Many detailes packed this book. Receiving brutal physical and physological treatment and forced to undergo humilations due to his homesexuality, the author despairs his treatment by \\"normal\\" men. Excellent reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book profoundly touched me","review":"I read this short book in one sitting and was so moved I had to re-read it again the next evening. All people, I feel, will identify with the story on some level. I have passed this book around my circle of friends, and their emotions ranged from anger and disgust toward the Nazis to profound sadness and sympathy towards the writer. This book is not for the depressed or overly sensative! Oftentimes, one forgets the impact of Nazi aggression on those who experienced torture firsthand. I only wish more was known about the Third Reich's war on gay men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little mp4 Player!","review":"I just purchased this mp4 player for my almost 9 year old daughter, because she really wanted an Ipod. I was a little skeptical at first because of the low price. I must say I was pleasantly surprised! This player has all of the features of the more expensive ones, in fact I like it better than the ipod nano because it has many more features, such as video playback, fm radio, voice recorder and games. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the instruction booklet is not detailed enough, in fact it's not helpful at all. But it's basically a plug and play setup so it's not too hard to figure out. Other than that, I this is a great player and well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"its Okay..","review":"I ordered this thinking that it was an ipod nano. goodness, the picture does look like a nano though. BUT!!! it is not an ipod nano, there ARE 1 GB ipod nanos, but i guess i didn't read throughly. umm...i got this for less than half the price( about 30 dollars) and it was worth that price. NOt close to one hundred dollars. ANYWAY!! the playing sound is good, the screen is a little weird and confusing but i got it. OTHER than that this wasn't really what i expected, and whenever the batteries run out, Im going to buy the actual Apple brand 1 GB nano. HOpe this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SO GREAT","review":"THIS PRODUCT I NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AND IS BROKEN ALREADY.

Stop fronting like I did and get the real thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chill by the pool","review":"This is a nice compilation to compliment the Hotel Es Vive Ibiza. Hed Kandi has taken on the job of compiling the songs and Mark Doyle does a good job. The album is a mix of BEACH HOUSE and WINTER CHILL in terms of sound. 26 tracks in all spread out over 2 discs. Highlights include \\"Why\\" by Therese, \\"Shade of Summer\\" by Cathi Ogden and Dead Stereo, Kaskade's \\"Let You Go\\", Fac 15 feat Cathi Ogden \\"Blue Skies\\", Kings of Tomorrow feat Haze \\"Dreams\\", and many more. Overall a nice album to chill out and relax to."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"this was my first hed kandi purchase and i must say it wasnt what i expected. i was looking for some good downtempo/funky/souful stuff but this is just generic chillout music with shallow vocals.i may give another hed kandi title a shot, but this one was very blah. save your cash, folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better tools out there","review":"This is a rather expensive tool that I would rate as barely satisfactory. It cuts poorly, sands well for limited jobs, and most other tool attachments hardly work at all. On the other hand, I am very satisfied with my Dremel variable speed tool, which always works. Save yourself the aggravation and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"MULTI-MASTER OLDER PRODUCT SOLD AS LATEST","review":"The product is unique but the blades wear out very fast and are very expensive. What disappoints me most is that I was lead to believe that I was purchasing the latest model. In fact, it wasn't. Multi-Master advertises its tool with a easy latch to change the attachments --- what Amazon sold me was the earler model. I am very upset that Amazon sold me the product that is trying to be unloaded, instead of the newer version. Please note that I purchased this tool in late February 2007 long after the newer version was on the market. BUYER BEWARE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wood cutting blades $50 to $60? What???","review":"The Fein Multimaster really is a great tool... We have 3 in our business... But, Man o Man, The blades prices recently increased and we have discontinued them.... Somebody is making money or are they...Doesn't appear to be a long term success for Fein...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool","review":"A great tool for anyone who likes to do most any job that comes along. Yes it is pricy but like other reviews I've read here ,it does cut down on the labor time a whole lot. I have only had it for 1 month but in that time I have been able to refinish 3 large old mahogany windows down to their original beauty and was able to make a few almost impossible cuts to repair a staircase. The tile man left me a mess before I could put in the trim and this tool not only was able to make quick work of removing the excess grout and setting cement and it even allowed me to sand down a few bad edges on the marble tile. So far I gotta say I love it, and look forward to getting a lot more done in a lot less time! Also it is a lot quieter than the porter and cable tool and is quick with tool changes, also being able to put the cutting blades at almost any given angle is indispensable in tight spots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holding power","review":"The tool needs a better way to hold the saws etc. to keep them from moving from there set position. I understand that an improvement is comming. I hope they have a fix for existing tools in use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fein","review":"The blades of this product wear out so fast and are very expensive. I owned this thing for couple of years. Useless product since blade wears out as fast as you can replace it. Fein really need to come up with something else to replace their crappy blades. Do not buy this product unless you are willing to spend roughly 30 bucks for anything that you want to cut (that is how much blade will cost)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best tool on my shelf.","review":"I bought this before these oscillating multi tools became really popular with other brands like dremel and rockwell popping up. I have had no complaints with this Fein Multimaster. I know the other mfg's making cordless versions of this tool. I don't think they would have the power needed to do much cutting, but I haven't used one to be sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"fein tool","review":"Great tool! Many uses. I love it! I do most of the repairs around my house and this tool is excellent for making general small repairs around your home. Great investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The tool is great, the accessories less so...","review":"I've been using the MultiMaster for several months now and am very satisfied with the tool itself. The ergonomics, balance, weight, etc. are very good, and the VS motor is excellent. As others have noted, the accessories are expensive, and some, particulary the abrasives and pads, don't hold up, even under very slight use. Consequently I'd recommend this tool for most of the task for which it is advertised. For sanding however, I typically switch to a tool designed for that purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUltimaster VS XL","review":"This tools is everything it's cracked up to be. I have been using it to do the prep work on my 40 foot Trawler and it can get into almost every nook and cranny to sand or cut. I guess the only down side is the cost of the attachments. I would certainly buy this tool as a kit rather than just buying the tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2\\" Blades Slip","review":"Ok FEIN, when are you going to eliminate blade slippage by upgrading the design of the drive pattern from the current Round to a Star drive? It is my opinion that you are too slow in responding to customer requests to improve the drive design and I reluctantly returned my unit because of frequent slippage. All of you newer blades have the Star drive but the power head still relies on compression, thus friction by the washer and bolt to hold the blade in place. Your current solution is an adapter, which is nothing more than a washer that has sandpaper like surface/carbide particles to increase the friction. Not an acceptable solution for and expensive tool.When you finally get around to improving the design, I will purchase a machine again but I will definitely wait until the new design is released."},{"rating":"2","title":"FEIN IS FINE","review":"USED THE FEIN GROUT BLADE TO REMOVE GROUT, WHEN I HAD TO REPLACE CERAMIC BASE.

Every aspect is covered from furniture to flooring to lighting. This book also shows a nice range of styles.Minuses:The main drawback is that some of the pictures seem out-of-focus and/or small. Also, there are no projects, which may or may not be a minus, depending on your purpose for buying the book.Recommendation:if you are looking for a book to organize your thoughts and give you useful tips on decorating, this is a decent one.

His songs are catchy too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halalujah","review":"I was driving down the road the other day thinking about being able to laugh with God. Joy so uncontainable that it burst out into laughter ya know? A time for every purpose under Heaven. Well then I heard \\"The Cartoon Song\\" for the first time. And to be able to feel that much joy at a random time was awesome. I got online and found this CD. I enjoy Chris Rice's songs so I look forward to adding this CD to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a really good sophomore release by Chris Rice.","review":"Normally, sophomore releases (second CDs) by an artist are not all that good. That's mostly because the first work released represents a lifetime of writing by the artist, while the second work is usually produced under the pressure of a deadline -- not the most conducive atmosphere to creativity. This CD is, however, an exception. This work is very good. Production and arrangement-wise, it's superior to his first work. Lyrically, it's at least as good. Vocally, he's singing in top David Wilcox-Paul Simon form. Best cuts include \\"The Power Of The Moment,\\" \\"Big Enough,\\" \\"And Your Praise Goes On,\\" and \\"Wind And Spirit.\\" It's a throughly enjoyable, restful musical treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swiftly moves to fill a poetic gap left by Rich Mullins","review":"Past The Edges is a wonderful offering of praise and wonderment. Chris is able to take what might otherwise seem beyond our own capabilities to express and turns those feelings and wonderings into downright profound thoughts. I've listened to this CD many, many times and still find phrases and music that make me sit up and take notice. Rice has spent his life ministering to young people all over the US, and conveying the essence of the Good News. While he is still fairly new to the music industry, he is, by no means, new to the creative ability to put his love for Jesus, and God's love for all of us, into musical poetry. 1997 was the year Christians everywhere mourned the loss of contempory Christian music's poet laureate, Rich Mullins. In this listener's humble opinion, Chris Rice is showing the unique ability to step up to the microphone and begin to fill the void."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing but Good things for this CD!!!!","review":"Chris does such a great job!! This CD gives such and appreciation to what God does for us and how he loves us no matter what! I bought this CD knowing only one song but fell totally in love with it! I recommend it to anyone who wants to listen to songs that will make you appreciate things a little more. Buy it and try it, it's well worth the money and the time to listen to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What if cartoons got saved","review":"This is an Awesome CD. Though I've played this CD many times I was surprised to hear a fun song that was after track number 10 \\"Missing you\\".It's must be a \\"bonus\\" song. Has anyone else heard it? The song is \\"What if Cartoons Got Saved\\". It's still part of cut 10 - but there is silence between the two songs from about 4:18 to 6:22. It is a funny song - with a good message. I've always wondered why the track timer kept going and playing silence. I normally just turned the CD off at that point. Hope you like the song."},{"rating":"2","title":"great follow-up to \\"deep enough to dream\\"","review":"Rice's second CD is every bit as honest and \\"praiseful\\" as his first. Nearly each day I have to decide which one is my favorite. Incidently, as the thirty-something father of a 6 and 4 year-old, I would encourge you NOT to keep this music to yourself; his two CDS are at the top of our \\"family van charts\\". Rice's music seems to transcend age-groups. His lyrics will open your eyes, heart, and soul to Hope in Christ. Simply the best Christian music I've heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"A better-than-average follow up to \\"Deep Enough To Dream\\"","review":"Usually, follow-up (second) works by recording artists bring major disappointment to their fans and listeners. This is an exception. In fact, as far as musical complexity and production are concerned, this work outshines his first. Lyrically, there's more depth here than in \\"Deep Enough To Dream.\\" Just listen to \\"Big Enough,\\" \\"And Your Praise Goes On,\\" \\"Live By Faith,\\" \\"Wind And Spirit,\\" and \\"Missing You.\\" You'll be impressed! Vocally and musically, Rice follows a familiar path with his Paul Simon/James Taylor/David Wilcox voice and soothing acoustical style. There's a \\"hidden\\" bonus at about six and a half minutes into the final track -- a song featuring some of your favorite cartoon characters. All in all, for a follow up, it's well worth your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"y did everyone dis will smith's hit switch","review":"switch was not a bad song by any means but when no one pays much attention to it and considers it a kiddy song past it prime u have a hard time enjoying it while i have to admit switch looked to be a type of song that 12 or 13 year olds would listen to that is not a bad thing either you do always have to hear those sexual hip hop and r and b joints usually make but i thought it was one of will smith's better song maybe if he released this song in the 1980s it would have been even hotter because switch has a old school beat to it he should have included rap icon ll cool j in it which would have probably made his song hit the billboard charts a bit longer i wish will could have release another song from his album i think only submitted this song and another song with his beautiful wife jada"},{"rating":"1","title":"He's the Barry Manilow of rap, that's what Larry Elder said","review":"Will Smith is a unique rapper in this generation he stills rap like he did back in the day and people don't care for that kind of hip hop.

To me i was always trying to party songs, but never about his life or what he was feeling or going through. This album was great because it was like he was saying I'm tired and fed up with all the B.S. and i'm not going to take it! This album was like saying \\"Take that\\" to everyone that was against him. and not just like his other songs that tried to get you to dance. I feel like i know more about who Will is and i respect that! Great Album! He actually has a story to tell. Not just spouting about random things.

Way to go big willy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD","review":"This CD is by far one of the best releases by Will Smith. I like each and every song on this CD, and I hope to hear a lot of them played in the clubs, since most of them are good club songs.

I think he is talented, charming, funny, self-effacing and confident. I have most of his albums... and although I love them, I can admit that many of the songs sound alike, and many of the lyrics are similar. Not so with \\"Lost and Found.\\" Will goes beyond his normal beats & phrases (tho he does throw in a number of \\"Mike Check\\"s!) and brings in lots of other sounds (like the strings on one track). His lyrics also have a depth to them that was lacking in his other albums, such as those in \\"Ms Holy Roller\\" -\\"The greatest atrocities ever committed on this planet have been in thename of GodThis country was founded by Puritans, for the expressed purpose ofoppression-free worship\\"and in \\"WHY\\" -\\"souls are capturedDreams are stolen, hearts are brokenEvil blatantly rewardedHate surrenders, Love exaltedHope elated, negativity is shorted\\"All I can say is \\"True Dat!\\" and BUY THIS CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWE-SOME!!!!","review":"I honestly stopped buying rap and hip/hop because I got of tired of the sex/gansta/money yadda, yadda, yadda.

I miss that flavor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now that's what I'm talkin' about....","review":"Ladies & Gentlemen, Will Smith is back. I loved the CD from track 1 to 15 (plus a hidden 16th track, which is just another remix of 'switch'). People don't like to admit that Will is just about the smartest rapper out there. \\"It's the veteran, takin' the mike back..\\" he raps on \\"Swagger\\". It's true. He knows that he has been in and out of the game since \\"Summertime\\". He's not like all the other rappers, which he mentions on the title track \\"Lost & Found\\", saying, \\"truck with rims, throwback jerseys, champagne bottles, lots of models. Damn. That's the list for 90% of yall video's and songs, am I wrong?\\"This album he created is so smart, witty, fun.I think he put alot of questions and ideas about him into each song. It's amazing. It's like 15 mini cd's in one. They all have their own thing goin' on.5 out of 5 stars all the way.And I didn't even think he was all that great until I took a chance and bought the CD. Now, it's stuck in my CD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Perfect...But Very Good","review":"Will Smith has put together a very interesting album with \\"Lost and Found,\\" and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and listenability of the album.Not just another perfunctory hip-hop album, there are actually a number of very good, intelligent songs to be found here; some of them about Smith's personal issues, some \\"old-fashioned\\" dancefloor rap tracks, and some very serious tracks about important world issues.Although this is a surprisingly good album, I don't give it the full 5 stars here for two reasons. First, I think there are too many \\"dance/party\\" songs on the album (It's not that they are bad songs, but this detracts slightly from the interest of the album). Second, I think that at least one of the versions of \\"Switch\\" could have been eliminated from the final cut.Still, I recommend this album, not just for hip-hop and rap fans, but also for pop fans and the music fan in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"You've got to love this one","review":"Okay, I'm not usually easily impressed by the depth of a rappers music but Will Smith ROCKS!

After a couple of good albums early in his career with DJ Jazzy Jeff, Will went soft according to his critics. He's trying to be a little harder now, and he's catching some flak for that. It seems like he'd get the picture . . . He's not good! On Lost and Found, Smith loses himself in attempting to sound like other rappers who have dissed him and who he has tried to diss. A couple of song on this album would make decent party songs at a middle school dance and possibly not lead the kids to dance like skanks, so that's good. Some of his lyrics are ok, but his voice and attitude just aren't suited to them. It's time for Will to move on and focus on his success in other areas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-off","review":"Try this: listen to K-Os' \\"Crabbuckit\\" and then listen to Will Smith's \\"Switch\\". (\\"Crabbuckit\\" can be found on K-Os' 2004 album Joyful Rebellion.) The 30-second samples on Amazon should be enough to let you know some serious ripping-off occurred here. I like Will Smith personally, but -- come on -- give a man his due. K-Os, talented but largely unknown outside of his native Canada, has earned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney Rap","review":"I post this message 2005. He released this album 2005. Theres 200 of this used CD going for 2 dollars. Need I say more about this album?He is a joke. Smith is trying to stir up the rap industry by rapping about others, but nobody cares!! Cause nobody listens to his music, nor do they take him seriously. Sounds like he just mixed up a recording because he needed extra money.The only good song that Will Smith made was \\"summer time\\". THATS IT. His lyrics are lame. Beats are weak. Like Larry Elder said and I quote \\"Will Smith is like the Barry Manilow of rap\\". Ok, he made it into acting...better stick with that ( and his acting isn't even that good ). He sure did mess up that Ali movie, Ali suppose to be a legend.

The man is in his 30's still actin like he's 19. And what is up with that video \\"Switch\\"? It looks like a hip-hop ho-down! I think Will Smith is extremely talented and needs to focus his energy elsewhere, because right now it looks like he's having a mid-life crisis. I hate it when celebrities get bored and start churning out bad albums to us...JUST LET IT GO! Jay-Z knew when to retire, why can't Will?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Look man...Im grown","review":"and I understand that life is NOT all about gettin' money and women.

BUT after I bump my 50, Jada, Jigga and Geto Boyz. Gimme some Common, De La, Outkast and hell gimme some of that Will!This CD was a pleasant surprise compared to his last 2 CD's. Its very listenable. I gave it 4 stars because the beats can knod your head but they dont challenge you til you're like \\"YO! das a bad beat!!!\\" I like the CD, so It'll save us time if I just tell you the tracks I skip...Cool?3, 7 (sometimes) and 13.And to Will.

I was first drawn to it because I love the rhythmic beat in \\"Switch\\", and loved the video. Expecting mainly dance tracks, I was surprised when I started hearing Will's lyrics about politics, religion and, essentially, the state of humankind. This album is incredible. I couldn't agree more with what he is saying, and I love hearing him bare his emotions and get angry in some of the songs. \\"Holy Roller\\" reflects my exact views on organized religion, and, in fact, he has very insightful messages in all of his songs. This is a refreshing, impressive, *honest* album."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS WHAT HIP HOP SHOULD BE!!!, SOMETHING U CAN MOVE 2","review":"FORGET THE PHONY BLING, BABY MOMMA, HOOCHIE, DISRESPECTING PEOPLE OF COLOR MUSIC THAT HAS PLAGUED THE RADIO STATIONS, THIS IS SOMETHING FRESH AND NEW, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DONT GET IT, I THINK YOU HAVE BEEN BRAINWASHED BY THE OTHER LESS TALENED HIP HOPSTERS WITH PRETTY MUCH NOTHING TO SAY, OR IT SEEMS THAT WAY BECAUSE THERE NOT INTELLIGENT ENOUGH TO DELIVER THE MESSAGE WITH OUT RESORTING TO VIOLENCE OR CURSE WORDS.

FIrst off Will's beats sound like one of Jerry's kids trying to sound like Timbaland, they are plain annoying. Will's lyrics are straight first grade rhymes, my little sister sounds like big daddy kane compared to him and all her rhymes are about mary and her little lamb.This is truly an album for soccer moms to play for their kids when trying to put them to sleep in their mini vans. Sad, sad, sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"keep your cash","review":"Will gave it his best effort, but this album truly is trash. as someone poitned out, all the beats are Timbaland throwbacks, nothing truly hot here. He does touch of some deeper topics, but his flow is lacking on all levels. Even when he 'disses' Eminem (not even a true dis) he steals his entire flow for teh whole verse. most of the songs are full of filler to cover his lack of true content. I like Will, dont get me wrong, when i was 12 and Big Willie Style dropped, it was hot. But the market has changed and his attempt to keep up just doesnt work. He'll def get tons of spins on MTV and top 40 stations, but anyone truly into music won't think twice about this disc. Go pick up some real hip hop, I suggest waiting for the new Common to drop but untill then, look for one of the Murs albums- a true story teller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop Playing","review":"This ishhh is horrible!!!

The photo of Will Smith standing on the corner of West Philly and Hollywood is incredibly poignent and should clear up any talk about him sinply becoming a 'sell-out'.

Since he is mister Smith he gets the best beats right any beat maker wanna stand next to this mainstream pothead. The person that made the beats needs to get em to a real rapper not someone who sounds like they are practising a normal conversation. he has no flow. This cd reminds me of viagra he just thought he got older a comeback and bader like a old dude with viagra. somebody throw this fool of stage seriously when i listened to it i only enjoyed the beats i developed a automatic block to his voice.

Some of the album has filler, but some of it is great. \\"Switch\\" is an awesome dance song, \\"Pump Ya Brakes\\" is cool to see Snoop Dogg and Smith combining talents, \\"Ms. Holy Roller\\" is Will Smith taking the other side rarely taken in the religion debate, almost a counterpoint to Kanye West's \\"Jesus Walks\\" (and I have to say that I agree with Willie 100%), \\"If You Can't Dance\\" is plain hilarious, and recalls the days of DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince, while \\"Mr. Niceguy\\" is Smiths \\"ode\\" to the haters of his music.

I placed the tape in and within five minutes of the tape playing it ate the tape. We could not get the tape out at all so I am returning this item, especially after reading a review with the same problem. I was trying to save money by purchasing this item and I guess I got what I paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constantly Tipping Over","review":"The product is very durable. That's a good thing since it has an incredibly poorly designed base that causes the recorder to tip forward with the slightest shake or bump. The recorder sits on a tripod of legs - two out the side and one in the back that allows it to lean back a little. But it does not lean back far enough and is very front heavy, so it tips forward very easily. If you leave it on a shelf or piece of furniture, you will find it lying on the floor with the battery compartment popped open and batteries all over the place. And never put it up somewhere where it will fall on your child as it will cause injury.My advice to potential buyers - buy something else. My advice to Little Tikes - try actually testing your products before putting them on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this piece of junk","review":"I wanted a tape player that my son could use to listen to music and sing along into the microphone. His voice comes out so quietly you can't even hear it. It won't stand up on it's own, so you have to lay it down on the ground to use it.

The microphone barely picks up his voice and the tapes he makes are fuzzy and not clear. The tape that came with it is sometimes garbled and slows down and speeds up, even with new batteries. Although our 3-year-old does play with it, I don't know how long that will last with the fuzzy sound and not able to hear his recorded voice. I definitely would not recommend this recorder.

Yes, you can play the tape that comes with it but that isn't what we bought it for, if we were interested in that we would have bought a regular tape player. The microphone is the PITS! It could never pick up my sons voice or even my voice for that matter, you have to speak directly into one particular spot on the microphone and then at best it plays back as a barely audible muffled sound, SO dissapointing!

They had so much fun with it the first few days, though it kept tipping over. When a cassette tape was inside it was heavy in the front and kept falling down. That was alright, we just laid it down on the speaker to play. It was dropped and the battery door fell off. Then just by lifting the recorder the battery door would fall off. So I went to get some tape to secure the battery door when I noticed one of the springs that holds in the battery (and supplies current) was missing. So the recorder after 4 days did not work. If the spring had not falled out it would have needed tape to keep it functional. Not a very good quality toy. I would suggest another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unstable and Poor Quaulity","review":"This toy topples over VERY easily (It has three legs). This toy lived three months.

I think they made this toy unstable and of poor quaulity so that you have to buy a new one in a few months. This brand should not be trusted.

After just a month with an adult using it the toy ate the tape. When I called to have the tape replaced I was directed to a company in association with Little tikes to get the replacement part. They want a letter sent to the corporate office in order to receive the tape. I was also told to return the product and not use it. Don't waste your money. This is not a quality Little tikes toy.

My largest complaint is that for a children's toy it should be able to handle a few knocks. Within 5 minutes of my putting in the new shinny batteries, the tape player fell over (it does not stand well because of its base) and all the batteries fell out as well as the tape. My son did love the microphone, but you practically have to eat it to get it to pick up your voice. Also, this may be a battery saving device, but the micrphone wouldn't work unless a tape was playing. The directions said you could use the microphone by \\"turning it on\\" without a tape, but ours apparently did not have that feature.Overall, I think that since all children (and adults from time to time) drop things, a toy's battery section should be screwed on. What is the point of giving a child a toy if every 10 minutes he needs the batteries reloaded."},{"rating":"1","title":"It ate the tapes","review":"My daughter got this as a gift and absolutely loved it! She loved having her own music and signing into the microphones! She was only able to use it a few times though. It kept eating tapes.

The Semantic Web is an attempt to use primarily automated methods, that mostly still have to be devised, to \\"understand\\" web pages. The problem is that these pages are geared towards human wetware comprehension. And pages are often badly cast, with typos and just different uses of the same terminology. Due to the impreciseness of any human written language.To analyse these, the papers in the book offer fuzzy approaches. Instead of using binary valued logic. A very promising direction that may prove fruitful.The book also contains a keynote paper by Lotfi Zadeh, the founder of fuzzy logic. This paper looks at the search problem.

Every LCD has eventually failed. The portable handsets still work, but are useless without the base. I invested a fair amount of money into handsets, and they are now worthless.

It would be a good system, but for one major problem. The LCDs on these phones are prone to failure. Without a readable LCD, you cannot use many of the phone's features.

The range is about 1/20th the range for a 900 mhz Sony that cost 1/5 as much (the Gigaset will NOT even reach across the house). This is not an isolated instance, two base stations did the same thing as do multiple handsets. The Sony and the gigaset were in the same location too so it was not a factor of varied locations. Whether it is the 2.4Ghz vs 900mhz, I do not know, but the range is very bad. And Siemens' support line was no help at all in resolving the issue.2. The handsets are flimsy and seem low quality.The concept itself is very good, but Siemens needs to do a LOT better job in building a product that reaches its goals. I like the features for the most part (e.g. auto-updating the time on the base station, transferring directory entries between phones, needing only one base station, but having the option of having too), but the problems are sufficient to make the features useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"The great disconnect","review":"I would not recommend this or any Siemens product to anyone.I have had this phone for less then 1 year, back in June the phone began disconnecting any call that I was on when call waiting was activated.

One day, their screens would be lighting up intermittently and no communication possible between the handsets or between the handsets and the base station.It seems Siemens doesn't really care about making products that work.

The worst problem was the face that it would \\"own\\" a phone line when it connected: if I was on Line1 on the main base, nobody on any extension could join me on Line1. So it was impossible to do conference calls with others in the house. Also, the extension handsets are shoddy and poorly-manufactured; the buttons were hard to press and non-responsive.I replaced the entire unit with a Panasonic KX-TG2740, which has a very similar featureset but actually works well. :-) More about the TG2740 on my review over there..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable ... unit - No factory service if it fails","review":"Do not buy it, unless you buy a good extended warranty from the seller.

Now that I see these reviews, I realize that this is the way they are--unbelievable for the price paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Product","review":"The well designed telephone worked well for about 6 months then the LCD display began to fade so call-id and other messages could not be read. The handsets then began to have difficulty synchronizing with the base station and the effect was similar to making/receiving a call on mobile phone with poor cell coverage. The low battery life and long charging time made SOHO use impossible. Finally, after 9 months of use, the buttons on the handsets began to fail and you needed to push each button very hard to record an entry. A very poorly designed product. I replaced the set 9 months after purchase with a Panasonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cordless handset quality problems","review":"I wish I could give the Gigaset 2420 a good review. After all, the base unit has a lot of good features and seems to work well. Unfortunately there is a real quality problem with the cordless handsets.I've had the 2420 system for 6 weeks and am now returning my 3rd cordless handset. Two failed almost completely, not responding to any keys. The only sign of life was the blinking backlight in the LCD display, but nothing displayed. The third \\"skipped\\" on the received sound. Outgoing sound was OK, but it acted as if the frequency hopping technology was missing a few frequencies. The unit I returned always skipped. I still have problems with one of my \\"good\\" units skipping occasionally. I have to end the call and retry.I'll keep sending back bad handsets until I get fed up. Then I'll return the whole thing and maybe go with a Panasonic. I have a Panasonic 2.4 GHz and the sound quality is exceptional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Initially great-currently disappointing","review":"As others have stated, out of the box this phone system was great. I experienced superior sound quality and acceptable range (no problems inside or outside 4 bedroom colonial on .75 acres). After 2 years of use most of the handsets have developed an annoying garbled interference that begins shortly after using the phone. This makes it impossible to talk and leaves you scrambling for another phone. Siemens support has been disappointing. I have 4 handsets and only one works correctly. Despite my initial enthusiasm with the system-I will not buy another Siemens product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out GOOD, then went from BAD to UGLY","review":"I used the Siemens 2420 with 8 handsets for 3 years. It has great features, but has had some reliability problems which ultimately proved fatal for this phone.THE GOOD: Easy call transfer, intercom, caller ID log and answering machine. Sleek appearance.THE BAD: Very limited range - I had to locate the base in the middle of the house for the handset in the far corner room to work. Generally susceptible to interference. After a couple of years, one of the handsets refused to hold a charge even after the batteries were replaced. After 2.5 years, one handset also started generating pulsing static noises on most calls, making it unusable.THE UGLY: The base station allows outgoing calls, but locks up on about 50% of the incoming calls. The LCD lights up every pixel and resets the entire system, with no way to answer or identify the incoming call.I finally decided to scrap the system and replace it with a Panasonic - hopefully that will be more reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Siemens 2420 telephone","review":"This people send my telephone to the wrong address.I have being waiting for my phone for 3 weeks with 0 results.I will never buy anything from this people.Bad business"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Does Not Work","review":"In mid-2000 I purchased two base units (with a total of 8 hand sets)for the Sieman's 2.4 GHz system, and I have found the system to be a major disappointment! Incoming calls are regularly dropped or cut-off; calls are often \\"garbled\\" (even when the phone is as close as 5 feet to the base unit); the \\"range\\" is no more than 60 feet; and a transfer of a call often results in it being dropped. Add to this non-existent customer service and you have a formula for a very unhappy customer. Would anyone be interested in buying a used system?! I strongly recommend that you avoid this (and any other) product from Seimens. It deserves a \\"no-star\\" rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your Money ! !","review":"The base station worked and it had many of the features I was looking for in a home/office environment but the quality is just not there. The handsets have the most limited range of any cordless I have ever used and Siemens has the WORST customer service anyone could imagine.

I can say I won't be relying on their reviews in the future! The main problems:1. The range is terrible (1/20 the distance of a Sony in our house),2. The handsets feel cheap and tend to break easily3. The buttons on the handsets give continuous problems, the display on one flickers in and out4. Siemens DOES NOT CARE. We initially called about the range and they said there was nothing that they could do. Then calling about handset problems was met with a 'so' even though they were not that old.In short, the ideas and the concept are good, but the implementation is terrible..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Siemens 2.4GHz - Don't buy!","review":"We originaly purchased a Siemens 2415 but it was Dead On Arrival. (We also puchased a 2400). That should have been our clue...so we bought a 2420. There are some good features such as tranfering directory numbers to other handsets and the basestation, and intercome features. But the performance of the product has been awefull. The phone cuts out whenever held between ones shoulder and ones ear or if one presses on the phone against your ear. (It must be something with the location of components near the earpiece.) The user interface is the worst I have ever seen in any product. The answering machine is accessed and used via a combination of cryptic hard to understand voice and on screen commands. One must put the unit to ones ear and then remove it to look at the screen several times just to listen to a message. Half the commands are visual and half are audio with no rhyme or reason as to which. I am sending mine back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost all the way","review":"Ok. let's get to the basics: I would buy it again definetively.On the pros side: Nice Design, Good memory directoy with Alphanumeric characters, 4 speedial keys, headset plug at both the base and handset, excelent speaker reception (very few people notice they are on speaker!), caller ID at base and headset, overall best value.The cons : You can't transfer the tel. directory from the base to the handset (absurd!), I have seen better reception. (Actually I am looking for the Gigaset repeater, which supposedly doubles the range-hope amazon carries it.)Exceleny buy if you don't want to spend in a PBX+ wiring at home of if you have a nice office."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desk Station hangs up on callers.....","review":"I bought a Siemens 2420 desk station and 2 handsets. Everything worked great in the beginning. Within a year the desk station stopped working altogether. I took it back to Office Depot where I purchased it because I had purchased a warranty. They replaced it.Soon afterwards the cordless units would not hold a charge, nordid they hold a charge after I purchased the exact duplicate batteries.Then the desk station would shut down on the second ring of an incoming call. All the buttons would light up red and the LCD display would be all blocked out on the second ring. It would then reset itself and repeat the process on the next incoming call.Siemens technical support HAS NO authorized or unauthorized service/repair centers. They suggested I take the phone to my local electronics repair shop.......or buy a new one. Yeah right.I would definetely NOT purchase another Siemens product."},{"rating":"1","title":"12 months and you're out of luck.","review":"The phones are great. The most functional and best sounding cordless phone and system I have owned or used. One problem though--Siemens will not repair them out of warranty. Siemens will replace then in-warranty but will not touch them out-of-warranty. I developed a bad LCD on the base unit after 18 months. Siemens will not touch it nor will they provide any place to have it repaired. Their suggestion was to go on eBay and buy another. For this reason, I will not purchase any more Siemens phones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it's supposed to be","review":"If you use this phone system in a small space with no walls, you might love it. but put it into a normal office or home setting and it sounds like you're under water.Anything more than 50-feet, or if the signal has to go through two walls, forget it! It is almost not usable.I would rate is \\"0\\" if that were available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"All in all I've been very disappointed with this phone as have two friends who bought it at the same time. The range is less than my 900mhz Sony, the handsets are not very reliable and it is very difficult if even possible (haven't done it yet!) to get messages over the handset. The idea is good, but Siemen's implementation is not. Too bad because it has potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much promise so much disappointment","review":"This phone system couldn't clearly communicate to a hand unit more than ten feet away. Any wall in my 90 year old home was too much for the system. I did find the functions relatively easy to use but there were annoying quirks as to how to release a line when switching to another, the LED is not backlit, and the handset on the base is fuctionally stupid although good looking. These are among many other small problems. Overall the biggest problem is the handheld units did not work which is why you would buy this system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can be much more","review":"This system is not the most user friendly system out there. The user manual is not very user friendly and has too many unsaid instructions. First I brought a recondition system, it did not last very long (three months) before it stop functioning, I then brought a new system expecting much better service. I have return all of my handsets for replacements for nonfunctioning reasons. The customer service people are very good and will send you another replacement when you are not satisfied with the system.

My suggestion don't repeat my mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad phone, worse service and support!","review":"Not even useable as a boat anchor. If you come across one of these phones, pick it up and throw it as far as you can. This will produce more gratifying results than any wasted phone calls to Siemens. Text on display looks like alien gibberish. One handset burned itself up and never really took a charge right, even with a new battery. Always plagued with background noise, warbles, and pops during calls. Siemen's advice? \\"Did you try rebooting it?\\" and \\"It's broken. We suggest you buy the newer, more expensive one.\\" I'm amazed that it ever passed FCC or UL tests."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"We purchased the Siemens 2420 Gigaset 2.4 GHZ system and two handsets when it first became available several years ago.

It has performed as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time if you need any distance","review":"I'm returning this because I can't get the handsets to work from more than 15 feet from the base station. I called Siemens and they said that the phone was notorius for only working in short distance situations. I have a regular stud and sheetrock house and it won't work while going through a single wall. They should warn you about this.

Rendell's (even writing as Vine) always fascinating insights into the minds, moods and actions of her characters do not fail here.

Hippocrates asks Socrates if mathematics is worth studying, thus initiating a genuinely Socratic dialogue on the nature of mathematics and its relationship to the real world.Even as a long-time consumer of mathematical thought (and now a mathematics teacher) there was plenty of substance in the dialogue for me: nice analogies and a sense of conviction of the importance of mathematics.I picked this book up at a university book sale for $6.

It could have easily been titled \\"Confused People\\". It's rather dark and ugly story, and if you like to connect with at least one character, you'll be hard-pressed to do it in the movie. If anyone, I felt sorry for Christophe, the young man who would have done anything for Alain, except Alain was incapable of commitment and coming to terms with his sexuality. While the story line is a common theme, I found the film at times slow and disconnected. Although I cared less for most of the characters, the acting itself was good. Nothing outstanding from the standpoint of cinematography. I see it's listed as a \\"romantic satire\\" - don't be fooled. What I recall most from the film is how a series of people with apparent low self-worth chase about the confused and disrespecting Alain. if this theme catches your fancy for 90 minutes, have at it.

Randy Orton's theme, Lita's theme(the new version w/lyrics), and Edge's new song were the songs I mostly anticipated, only to be disappointed. Why did Victoria switch to this horrible hip-hop song? She should've stuck w/the russian lesbian club song(All The Thing She Said). They could've added an old skool WWE tune or two(I'm STILL waiting for them to release Dusty Rhode's \\"Americana\\" theme, Sherri Martel's version of \\"Sexy Boy\\", and The Rougeau Bros. \\"All-American Boys\\"!!!

The slip case is classy, so is the libretto and it comes with two post cards of Callas. But once again EMI has screwed up. The recording is pitched incorrectly coming in a little flat.I'm so sorry I sold off the original CD edition which contained tape hiss but was much brighter in sound than any of these state-of-the-art reproductions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low fidelity with Roady wireless FM modulator","review":"The fidelity with the wireless FM modulator is poor. The unit is convenient if you don't mind a muffled sound (the high end is very poor or non-existant).

The modulator was free with purchase but I got what I paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was okay when it worked!","review":"This was alright, except the power is so intermittent you have to leave your XM unit on...not great when the receiver gets so hot.

Wish there was a more reliable way to get Sat. radio to play through a standard GM in-dash CD player..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than nothing","review":"This is used with a Roady XM and it is a fair solution. Of course the best install is to hard wire. Second best is to use the cassette adapter. IN DISTANT THIRD PLACE IS THE DELPHI FM MODULATOR. It is cool that it is a custom accessory to the Roady but on long point to point trips you will be changing the frequency often as fringe stations easily overpower it. But for portability of the Roady between cars where no cassette is available - it will perform at an acceptable level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Today Texas, Tommorrow the World","review":"From the opening crunch of \\"Lefty\\" to the final thump of \\"Maybe\\", Pushmonkey delivers a disc-full-o tasty rock. Very few bands can communicate the power, force and energy of their music as well as these Texas rockers do on their first Arista release. Pushmonkey has always had a solid and energetic following for it's live shows and now the world can sample what we here in Texas have been enjoying for several years. Long-time fans and newcomers alike will leave this one in the CD player for days. Open the windows and crank this one...it's a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good","review":"there isn't much to say about this album, other than the fact that it is just awesome. I love every track on it - the combination of their riffs and melodies makes for such great music. it was recorded a little loud though so make sure you spot the volume a bit before listening, but man...it's good. you don't need the other albums, IMO - this is quintessential Pushmonkey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock On Pushmonkey","review":"When a friend first told me you gotta hear Pushmonkey I went \\"Who?\\" and then he made me listen to No Dumb Wrong and Loner, I was hooked, next chance I had I was at Best Buy, buying the CD. Since then I have seen them live and they put on the best live show I have ever seen (and I've seen a lot). Lefty is a great starter but Maybe is an even better closer. And what's in between will keep you wanting more. Gems are Caught My Mind, Spider, Astray Red, No Dumb Wrong, Maybe and I could list the entire CD but I think you get the point, if nothing give these guys a chance, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd give this CD 1,000 stars if I could!","review":"If you are a rock music fan, you should be ashamed of yourself if you still don't own PUSHMONKEY. I've been following the band for four years, and I own everything they have ever put out...this tops it all. The energy they put into their music cannot be found anywhere else. Pushmonkey's music actually means something, it stands for who these guys are and what they believe in. To own their CD wil make you a Pushmonkey fan, to catch their show live will make you a Pushmonkey adddict."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Band","review":"This is a great band That works really hard and is very dedicated to there music, and there fans. I have followed them around Texas for about 6 years and they really put on a show. I have all of there CD's and love all but the last on el' bitche.

It is hard to find any redeeming quality about this disc. The cover's of JB Lenoir's \\"Mama, Talk To Your Daughter\\", Ray Charles \\"A Fool For You\\" and Jimmy Reed's \\"Bright Lights, Big City\\" are performed with absolutely no enthusiasm or feeling. You get the impression that these guys are merely going through the motions. The covers of Son Terry's \\"Walk On\\" and Joe William's \\"Big Legged Woman\\", while slightly better can only be described as mediocre. The CD includes two bonus songs only available on the CD, wow!. Those two songs are Frank Zappa's (that's right, Frank Zappa) \\"Trouble Everyday\\" and Percy Mayfield's \\"Dangerzone\\". both songs will make you wish you purchased the cassette.

That said, it mostly turned out to be a good idea. Ralph Tresvant's singing is a big plus, and had he been around at the time that some of these songs were originally made, he would have been a great lead singer for them. The production is unmistakably 80s, but with enough restraint so as not strip these great oldies of their dignity. On the minor downside of things, there is a bit of a lack of creativity, with some of the songs sounding very much like the originals, but this is pleasant listening overall, and certainly good if you like to hear classic songs with more of a contemporary vibe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor","review":"I have had one of these but I've lost one half somewhere in Yellowstone last year so I've decided to order a new one.

It's going back again for the same reason (See JL32's review above) as soon as I can get back to CompUSA. The motherboard and power socket was replaced last time and it still overheats even when the grills and heat sink are totally clean. The system automatically shuts down. This happens especially if the room temperature gets much above 70 degrees (F) or when I run multiple demanding programs. And this machine never gets used for gaming, mostly internet browsing and writing papers.UPDATE: Toshiba seems to have found a fix for this serious flaw.

It is a good deal, and but it has its draw backs.Lets start with the good:The pressesor is very fast and the screen looks great. The keyboard is big enough to type easily on it. DVDs play great on this computer (it even has 5 extra buttons on the side just for DVDs).The bad:Sucky, sucky battery life. I get an average of about 2 hours on long-life mode. The other things is that the graphics card (a Mobile Raideon 9000) isn't the best. I can play Battlefield 3 on it on the lowest graphics settings, but I get serious lag on servers of more then 32 players. The only other thing is that the hard drive is kinda small, at only 60 GB.Overall, this is a good laptop.

Other reviewers disagreed with the choice of adding the Byrds and the Dixie Chicks, but to assume that Bluegrass has not or can not change from the groundwork laid down by Flatt and Scruggs and the Carter Family would be limiting and fatal to Bluegrass itself. The Folk movement has added it's stamp to modern Bluegrass, a la the Byrds. The Newgrass Revival, here represented by Bela Fleck, Edgar Meyer and Mike Marshall, is equally important. I would have liked to see an Avett Brothers or Old Crow Medicine Show track as well, just to show that Bluegrass continues to grow, even as we rediscover and reinterpret the roots of it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"sunsets","review":"sunsets glenbrooke series book 4 by robin jones gunnelissa is a travel agent and is just moving into a new neighborhood. she doens't like longterm things so moves often. she recalls her past as things that happen brush into her life and she must deal with them.she starts to believe in God again and things smoothen out and are easier to deal with. 3 of them start out to help move one of their sisters to oregon. things just get worse as they go on but her faith comes to the rescue again. the doctor doesn't have a good report but he will stand by her and she has faith in God also."},{"rating":"2","title":"This booked turned me on to reading!","review":"This was the first book I read by Robin Jones Gunn, and the first book I had ever comepletely read through.

It was fun to catch up with all your old friends from previous books. Also, this is the book we meet Shelly from Clouds and Jake from Waterfalls. The two main characters, Brad and Alissa, were interesting but I cared about them less than some of the other people this series has introduced us to in the past.

Go to Germany, France, Greece, just any were outside the US and see that most people do not have this sick obsession on the naked body. They do not have \\"nude beaches\\" They just go to the beach some with cloths some with out. Our country has the largest % of sex crimes in the world.

I used enjoy the work of David Hamilton more than Mr. Sturges, but after reading this one I will defiinitly support Mr. Sturges with a greater passion.

The casting is ideal. Kiri Te Kanawa as the Marschellin, Anne-Sophie von Otter as Octavian and Barbara Hendricks as Sophie. The voices of all three are beautifully suited to their roles, and they blend together so well in the third act trio. Richard Leech is perfect in the cameo role of the Tenor and Kurt Rydl makes a suitably boorish Baron Ochs. The orchestral playing and balance with the voices could not be better. Bernard Haitink does a fabulous job and the Staatskapelle perform with passion.In short, this is a recording of Der Rosenkavalier that competes with the best.

Even Tolstoy thought this book was crap when he finished it. He almost never published it.

Levin's internal struggle over peasant-noble relations and the agricultural revolution are nausiating. The religious conflicts several of the characters experience become equally tedious.

His meditations on his conversion from a \\"callow youth\\" to a Doctor of the Church, although in admittedly archaic language, is persuasive and, at times, touching. Well worth the investment in time and energy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Confessions of St. Augustine","review":"This was a bit difficult to read because of St. Augustine's manner of speaking for after all his life time was from AD 354 to 430, therefore his vernacular. Regardless, his triumphant struggle to understand his place in the world with relation to truth given the limited freedom of recourses in those years, was impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!","review":"This product works just like it says, except for the fact that the double tent cot is made for two small people (NOT ONE BIG PERSON)! When you open it up, you quickly find out that there's a metal support bar that runs down the centaer of this tent, preventing anyone from sleeping in the middle (i.e., you have to sleep on the left or right side of this tent). If you are large (i.e., over say 250lbs, that's beeing nice, really you'd have to be pretty small to sleep on one half of this thing) this tent will not work for you. I ended up getting their \\"oversized\\" version instead and that works very well. I wouldn't normally give this tent such a bad rating, but big folks should know about the ridiculous metal bar that basically cuts the tent into two useless halves."},{"rating":"1","title":"problem design, Cabela's quality control and review censoring","review":"A tent that is not waterproof, what do you do if it, uh, rains. Missing parts in another review. Delight? wow? great company? Not exactly factual terms. Also be warned if using the Cabela's website -- Cabela's picks and chooses the reviews you see, that is, the reviews there are biased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deluxe double tent cot","review":"I have had this item for about 3 years and used it a total of 6 times. It is very heavy and bulky but since I didn't need to pack it very far I was OK with that. The central bar down the middle is a downer if you thought getting the double size would give you more room. The set up is pretty easy except that the bottom legs keep trying to fold up as you unpack it. After 4 uses the plastic parts that hold the tent to the frame have broken. Now all four corners are broken. There is no way to get it fixed and the manufacturer did not return my calls. Cabelas also does not offer any spare parts or service for it. Bottom line it costs $300 and when something breaks you have to throw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music that depicts very powerful genres of music.","review":"I found this album to be a variable mix of three genres of music. First progressive, second hard rock (leaning to heavy metal early in the bands existence), and thridly avant garde jazz. This is one of the better incarnations of Atomic Rooster (the one heard on 'in the hearing of..' a close second). For any one interested in hearing music that is different, very powerful, yet atmospheric I sincerly recomend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muy bueno","review":"Compré este album en Cassete hace una más de una década.

She is a little advanced so she knows how to operate the toy. She loves to play her Mickey Mouse CD and sing along. I like that there is a volume limit but it does get plenty loud. I do however have to supervise the CD insertion and removal but that is because she likes to play with the cd's and they get scratched. Overall she loves it. This is the 1st of this kind that I have bought or seen. But it is great so far. I would like to rate it again in about 6 months. Little Tikes has a great reputation so I trust it will last.One negative thing I have noticed is if it gets bounced around the cd stops.. but if that is the worst I am ok with that. It is a kids toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a sad Christmas morning......","review":"It was a sad Christmas morning when my 5 year old granddaughter opened this gift. The CD compartment wouldn't stay closed and we went ahead and fixed it with tape so that she could enjoy the player that day.

I can't believe I even have to give it a star. My mother-in-law bought this for our daughter and within a week it wasn't reading CDs, I then returned it to TRU and bought a replacement one online, well wouldn't you know it wouldn't even work out of the box, so I had to hustle back to TRU to return it and can't even get my money back for shipping - not only was this a HUGE disappointment, but I would have hoped for better service not only from TRU and Amazon, but from the manufacturer. You are better off buying a much better system with a name you can trust.

I usually find little tykes to be a reliable brand, but be forewarned this toy is not actually manufactured by little tykes it is manufactured by kid station. I bought the predecessor of this toy, which only had one microphone which broke about two months after my son recieved it as a birthday gift. I called Little Tykes who referred me to the other company. They promised me a replacement mic in six to eight weeks. Ten weeks later I contacted them again to be told that they don't order replacement parts at that number. I had to write a letter and explain my situation and then I MIGHT get a replacement in a few weeks. Meanwhile my poor kiddo is singing his heart out into a broken mic and waiting for the mailman to bring him a new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"True crimes","review":"Both games work great they got to me on time games started up fine never had a problem love playing bith true crimes games"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game.

He puts flare into the music very selectively, not into everything played. The simplicity of his playing makes the violin sound almost like a human voice, and I find that very appropriate for the Sibelius violin concerto. Beautiful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sibelius was pretty....","review":"pretty boring! This is a piece that needs to have real blood, and yet a coldness in it at all times. This recording didn't have anything close to that. It was a standard run through for the Sibelius concerto, one that I would not like to listen to again. A plus though is that Kennedy navigates some of the technical parts of the third movement much cleaner than his contemperaries. If you want to hear this piece the way it was meant to be played, check out Heifetz/Beecham on EMI."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic!","review":"Kennedy's fame is entirely beyond my comprehension. (I supposeit has something to do with clever marketing.) He is a sub-mediocreviolin player who 30 years ago would have had little chance of making a career beyond his home town. His approach to Tchaikovsky and Sibelius (like his approach to all other music I've ever heard him play) is sentimental, limp, bloodless, an unstructured morass. His tone is thin, his sense for rhythm nonexistent, his phrasing a mixture of gooey, scratchy and choppy. There is neither emotional nor intellectual honesty in his interpretations. He undermines the standards and accomplishments of the great ones before him: Szeryng, Heifetz, Milstein, Oistrakh, Kreisler, Huberman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abraham Material at It's VERY BEST","review":"I have grown so much through reading the Abraham material... and the new books are the frosting on the cake!

There are no more excuses, as Abraham gives us practical techniques and processes with which to embrace EVERY situation and find the POSITIVE and ATTRACT or ALLOW thoughts and feelings that make us feel good. So many ways are contained within these pages to deliberately and intentionally have everything we could ever want in life. This book takes us on a journey of simplicity, showing us that if we just get out of our own way there is much joy, happiness and anything else we desire there for the taking. I love this book - it would be great if there was a copy in every home. I come back again and again to the support offered therein."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Usual-Great Abraham stuff","review":"Although I personally prefer \\"Ask and It Shall be Given\\", their previous book, because I am fond of doing the \\"games\\" or processes (and have had tremendous results), this book also has the processes listed in the back, just in abbbreviated form. But it it is easy , good Abraham reading with some new pearls of wisdom. THIS STUFF SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN EVERY SCHOOL IN EVERY COUNTRY- THE RESULTS WOULD BE AMAZING! Abraham's words of wisdom on how to be true to yourself and mainly that happiness is a good thing- the only thing that really matters- and that we can have all we desire in life is truly liberating -these teachings make so much more sense than the superficial, sometimes ridiculous things we are taught in this country.

The second half of the book is all about how to apply the concepts and use the processes. The detailed examples describing different real-life challenges and Abraham's explicit use of the processes give you a very good idea of how to use the processes in your own life. Also, the language is a step further from the first book, which really helps you \\"get\\" the concepts and truly understand why your desires are not manifesting.

Not just repetitive generalizations......VERBATIVE repetition. Jerry and Esther have squeezed how many books out now that say exactly the same thing? If you have read the original Law of Attraction, then you have read them all. I have bought almost all of Jerry and Esther's books, hoping for some new material, but there is none. It is really starting to bother me that they keep churning out the same material over and over.....and in this one and The Astonishing Power of Emotions, they repeat the same life scenarios over and over within the same audiobook! I'm feeling very manipulated and am finally done with these two. Please save your money! I find that there is a greater honesty with authors like Wayne Dyer and Eckhart Tolle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Yet","review":"I tried to read Ask And It Is Given, and have worked extensively with the various processes in it, but this book, although it may cover the same topics, goes far beyond the first and is so much more accessible and readable.

After reading it, I ordered two copies and will advise all of my friends to get it and keep it by their beds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Similar to Ask and it is Given: Different Title","review":"This book is ok, but the reason I give it two stars is because it is contains the exact same material as Ask and it is Given (which I would give five stars).

Why are so many people struggling with sickness every day? Why are there so many women looking for years for a mate? Is that because they don't desire them or they are not clear on their goals and desires? These books are there to make you feel empowered, but will your reality change?

It just isn't necessary and seems like they are using this as a ploy to make extensively and already written about ideas by other authors, seem like something spectacular based on their channeling. I did pick the book back up later and skimmed some of the chapters. There are just so many other authors saying about the same thing, and with a little more intellectual depth for my tastes.

The teaching's of Abraham may not be everyones cup of tea however anyone can take what is intended from this book and their others, which is what we think we attract, then receive, then we must allow. This all occurs whether we are wanting it to happen or not. We are all vibrational beings living in a vibrational world.

It may be spot-on as political commentary but certainly not as comedy. Although perhaps some people enjoy listening to someone read from a Promisekeepers program. I can't get rid of this boring CD quickly enough.And before you attack me, I enjoy left wing and off-color comedy immensely. In fact most of the best comedians are both left-wing and off-color.

This album is nothing more than a long sad meanderring political rant from a disillusioned and pissed off man. The laughs, for the most part, never started for me and at the end of the album i was left with a bitter taste in my mouth. Trust me, if your a fan of Mr. Show, don't assume this is the same humor as you'd expect on that jolly half-hour of funny. I'd like to think that David's joke was getting us to spend $15 dollars on this sad rant, and that he is somewhere chuckling quietly and counting the tens of dallars he made off this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time/money","review":"This is a terrible cd. There are funny moments and a few funny bits but, overall, I feel [unsatisfied]. While I don't mind a comic who expresses his political and religious views for a laugh, Mr. Cross tends to go way overboard. He spends far too long expressing his opinions then forgets to turn his views into something funny. I buy comedy albums because I want to laugh and be entertained, if I wanted to hear long-winded political opinions and theories I'd watch C-Span. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone; however, if you must own it, I'll be selling mine...next week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely Disapointing","review":"As a big Mr. Show fan, this was a real let down.

He's standing in line with George Carlin and Bill Hicks. It's an angry album that spares no one and minces no words. It takes a few tracks to really get rolling, but the back nine of the album is blindingly, tear-inducingly, leave you gasping for breath funny. Do you like Jesus? Are you a Promise Keeper?

This guy is brilliant. He attacks everyone from John Ashcroft, morning crew DJs, to the Pope in this 2-disc CD. There are too many funny bits to mention, but the most memorable for me is the flag waving bit and the bit when he describes what it was like in NYC in the days following 9-11. There are, mind you, a few lame parts, like when he goes into the redneck bar fight. Sorry, but this bit goes on for far too long. Overall though, if you're in the mood for something really funny, and at times shocking, get this CD ASAP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed out loud","review":"David Cross is hilarious. I'm a Mr. Show fan, and when I heard Cross on NPR's \\"Fresh Air\\" show plugging this CD, I knew I had to get it. Warning: some of the political views he spouts get old after a while.

Might be the least funny comedy CD I've ever heard. Virtually all the material in the album has been done before, and much better, by other comedians. Most of the bits just lay there and die.

They only gave him polite appluase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out in left(ist) field","review":"As a general rule I enjoy David Cross' stand up routines, in addition to his great work on Mr.Show, but this septic rant doesn't do him an ounce of credit.His disjointed style can often be entertaining and refreshing, but when he does stop to focus on something, he focuses on all the wrong things. It's one thing to be edgy and irreverent, quite another to be distasteful and offensive - even to the edgy, irreverent crowd.The title of this CD is more appropriately used to review it - since about 20% of the routine is funny, for the rest you just want to tell David 'Shut up, you f**ing baby!'. So I'll give it 1 star for the 20% that's worth listening to, and another star for the fact that he hates John Ashcroft...."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOP Fun-Timey","review":"This CD should be inserted subliminally at all GOP events in order to make <our America> a better place in the future.David, Bill Hicks would be so proud of you!

After seeing play the character named Donny on \\"Just Shoot Me\\" and seeing snippets of his stand-up act on The Comedy Channel, I had high hopes for this CD. What a let down.After picking on the funny accents of gays and rednecks, and an ironic bit about how Hollywood is full of talentless yet hopeful morons, Cross recedes into a seemingly endless rant against President Bush, John Ashcroft, and other conservative figures. I like to think that I can laugh at almost anything funny, but this is hardly comedy...just hateful leftist rantings.My biggest regret is that my purchase put money into the pocket of this no-talent hack. It went from my CD player into the garbage can. David Cross isn't funny. He is an actor playing the part of a comedian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny","review":"Many people tackle social issues with their entertainment. Many people do it well.

However, to dismiss this work because of it is a huge mistake. The thematic intent is all Mahler's: Cooke just added some orchestration to some of the movements, but either way it is powerful to the extreme, the climax following the quiet musing in the first movement is arguably the most moving passage written by any composer ever and the way in which it turns full circle and finishes with the adagio, which is warmer than the nineth and with more hope, is just sublime. Rattle is meticulous and at the same time brings out white-hot excitement from the music. He is without doubt the best conductor alive today, especially in this kind of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect recording of Mahler's Best Symphony!","review":"Deryck Cooke's version of the Mahler 10th has always impressed me. This recording is fabulous, the first one released by Simon Rattle way back in the early 80's.

However, the first trouble was it would do its 12 seconds of beeping and then not spray. I would have to monkey with it to get it to work properly on several mornings. Then it stopped working all together. I discovered the residue built up in the battery case, making the contacts full of goo. Cleaning that off, it would work for a while, then go back to the other problem of beeping but not spraying.Coupled with the rate at which it goes through solution, and the amount of maintenance I've had to put into it, I'm throwing mine out today.

As a test, we tried using the liquid from the refill bottle just to see if it had the ability to work with manual application and it didn't appear to work any better than the rest of the many products we've tried. Whether or not it does, however, the spray from the dispenser does not reach the back wall higher then 6 inches above the floor and the overlap where the 2 doors meet (1/2 inch) prevents spray from reaching the second door.

But now that I live in a house w/ well water, it doesn't make my shower cleaner but on the contrary, it makes it worse - by leaving these streaks of semi-sticker residue all over!

Highly recomended !!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"still looks and sounds fresh after 22 years","review":"I have owned this film on VHS for many years, so I was not in a big rush to buy the DVD...but I'm sure glad I did ! This is one of the rare instances where a movie complements the music instead of diminishing it (unlike Quadrophenia, for example...)This is one film that I can't stop watching - once it starts I'm hooked until the end. The 90 minutes really fly by. And to those who say the real life and animation do not comfortably coexist - I say \\"rubbish !\\" the transitions are smooth and seamless. My favorite part is when the school kids, with their faceless masks, are marched through the factory and into the grinder. Classic Pink Floyd. And I say Bob Geldof's portrayal of Pink is flawless. Buy this DVD - you won't regret it !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not perfect","review":"I was thrilled to finally be purchasing one of my favorite \\"musicals\\" of all times, especially at the thought of enjoying The Wall in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround-sound. While the musics tracks of the DVD were awesome, as well as some of the special effects (explosions, etc.), the dialogue was poorly mixed in with the soundtrack requiring me to constantly adjust the volume (quite annoying).The picture was clear enough, and altogether it was a good experience. Any die-hard fan of The Wall will truly appreciate the enhancements of Dolby Digital as well as the sharp digital picture. I highly recommend it - just be ready with the remote for those volume adjustments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worst movie ever made. I LOVE IT!! Alan Parker is brilliant!","review":"Not really Oscar material, this movie is so disturbing and strange that it's exciting. The cinematography and art direction is amazing. It's these bizarre films from the 70s and 80s that are exciting in they way they show things on a movie screen that no one ever sees in a conventional film(like Ann-Margret swimming in baked beans shooting out of a TV in TOMMY and dead corpses sucking blood from a live person in TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. Alan Parker is really great at adapting \\"pop movie musicals\\" to film after seeing his work with FAME and EVITA in 1996."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's \\"just another brick in The Wall\\"...","review":"Those who think books like Jack Kerouac's \\"On the Road\\" and movies like \\"The Crow\\" actually have something to say about their respective 'generations' will probably like the film version of \\"The Wall,\\" as well, and laud it just as highly. For me, though, the movie is a soulless, emotionally sterile, and bombastic 90-minute music video that's nowhere near as affecting as the album that inspired it. Okay, so a little boy's father dies in a war. He has fantasies about being a rock star and, wouldn't you know it, grows up to be a Hitler-esque dictator...or something. The subtle humor from the album is gone, instead replaced with super-literal interpretations of the songs. \\"The Wall\\" will remain popular, I think, only as an oddity in the annals of pretentious filmmaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profundamente decepcionado!","review":"Eu já possuía a primeira verso desse título em DVD, e, equivocadamente entendi que essa \\"edio especial\\" apresentasse diferna que muito me interessa: imagem no aspecto 16:9. O formato widescreen Hi-Definition anunciado na descrio do produto, no é nada mais que o mesmo aspecto da edio anterior, que deixa largas faixas pretas acima e abaixo do filme. Definitivamente, no era isso o que eu queria!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I actually thought that i was buying the cd for my husband. But when he opened the dvd, he was happy. The item arrived before the time stated in brand new condition. I would buy from the seller again in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dumb movie that makes people dumber","review":"I'm a film teacher and I've had a number of students who were crazy about this movie, so I've watched it: they tell me that what they LEARN from the movie is that \\"war is bad,\\" and that crowds at rock concerts are sort of like groups in war and groups of students in school. With every fan of this film I've talked to, the bleeding obvious is converted into what they think is a profound insight. Why does this movie fool people into thinking that its tired old ideas (war is hell, crowds don't allow for individual thought, etc.) are new just because of the flashy visuals and animation? Just in case anyone was wondering, I'm not anti-Pink Floyd: I think the talentless Alan Parker is the problem here. This is one stupid film, and a pretty blatant copy of the film version of TOMMY to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is difficult","review":"First of all, when I saw it the first time I hated it. Probably because I hated the trial scene and it is really shocking. It was far too dark the first time through, and I have gradually grown attached to it. First though, there are some great scenes, like comfortably numb, hey you, blue skies, the happiest days of our lives and all three bricks. Those are spectatular. The flowers fooking though, that is a bit much.I am not really sure wheither the good scenes really redeem the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rock Film Of All Times!!!","review":"If you are Pink Floyd fan but are only going to see this movie for the first time, do not let any negative reviews cause you to think twice about buying this film. This movie is Deep. You either understand it or you don't. Appreciate it for what it is and the statements that it makes. Remember that it was made 30 years ago. Enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereo CD sounds better","review":"I'm a fan of the wall. I was hoping for a good 5.1 transfer. The 5.1 sucks!!! The stereo version is much better sounding. They funnel all the vocals in to the center channel speaker. It sounds out of place,they should of kept the vocals true to the orginal recording(L&R). I would not buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very fine movie","review":"The wall is a brilliant movie and an excellent adaptaion of on of the greatest albums ever.Get this with Quadrophenia from the Who."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Pink Floyd you will like The Wall","review":"To begin, if you really love Pink Floyd and you haven't seen this movie yet, I am shocked and ashamed. For those of you who are not very big fans you will think, \\"what the heck am I watching?\\" First you need a good stereo system hooked up to your TV. There is very little dialogue through out the movie, for the most part just musical bliss. I must say that I am writing this after reading one persons review that said this was not art. Of course this is art. This is someones interpretation of how they feel about dealing with life. The movie goes sequentially with each great song on the album, The Wall. There are bits of cartoon clips that fit very well with the theme of the movie. You definitely need to see this at least one time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dour and mesmerising","review":"You should watch this. It is not the easiest of films to view or follow, but the marriage of the music and images is sometimes irrelevant, and at others brilliant. Geral Scarfes cartoons are a real treat and there are occasions when there is real (black) humour. I often wonder about Roger Water's mental health; is he chronically depressed, experiencing psychosis or brilliant? A must for Floyd fans, should be watched by as many others as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is what DVD was made for","review":"\\"The Wall\\": a masterpiece. The only way to watch this movie is on DVD. I've watched this movie for years on VHS, but on DVD, it's like watching it for the 1st time. If you don't believe me go straight to the \\"trial\\" animation. YOU WILL BE BLOWN AWAY BY THE QUALITY. I cannot stress enough how great this film is. And as for the \\"secret buttons\\" (the little square pics on menu screens), when you play \\"the wall\\" in your DVD-ROM and click on these pics, all you get is a sound byte. This could have been a great added feature, but it is virtually useless (unless you just have to hear 'IF YOU DON'T EAT YOUR MEAT' on your pc). In summary, buy this movie, then go out and buy Pink Floyd's \\"Final Cut\\". This album deserves high praise since it's really the 2nd half of 'the wall' and not just a flat 80's album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressing Genius","review":"Pink Floyd's depress-o-rama/work of genius in all it's acid-drenched glory. If you're reading this review, you surely know the tale: Roger Waters artistically relates his walk on the fine line between genius and madness, love and hatred, self-loss and self-redemption. You will be hard-pressed to find many works of cinematic art transferred to DVD with as much care as this rock opera masterpiece. The picture quality is sharp and crisp and the sound has been processed with care. This is a must-have for any Floyd fan with a DVD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wall ,, What more need be said.","review":"I went back in time for couple of hours. I first tripped on this in a DRIVE IN in the 70'S Do it with a friend"},{"rating":"2","title":"the wall","review":"if you love pink floyd you will love this dvd.alot of great music paired with some videos and different backings for the songs"},{"rating":"1","title":"All in all...just another milking of \\"The Wall\\"","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love Pink Floyd (and The Wall too) but this constant rehashing of DSOTM and The Wall into \\"Anniversary, Special Editions...ad nauseum\\" is just plain ripping off the fans.How about the long awaited DVD release of Pulse or Delicate Sound of Thunder instead?"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOTLEG","review":"I just want to say that I am always looking for a smooth, satisfactory transaction. I do not spend my money online \\"for fun\\", or because I have just so much of it to throw away, I make purchases to save time. In doing so I expect not to be deceived by the companies that Amazon represent. I bought a DVD from Movie Mars. The item I received was NOT what I agreed to buy. The DVD that was sent to me was a bootleg copy that could not be read by ANY of my devices unless the drive region was changed. This is FRAUD! Getting the company to resolve this matter has been slow, bothersome and down right annoying. I will never purchase from any company that Amazon represents. Thank you for your time. You should thank me for mine....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa","review":"Ok people im gona keep it short and simple for you. The wall is a trip movie. Yes it is brillant but just like their music, its made for stoners who are chewen on some shrooms or on acid or lsd. It is good when you are in your right state of mind but Excellent when your blitzed. I recomend this to everyone! Also check out 2001 space odessy, fantasia, and alice in wonderland. Sorry if you dont agree but it is the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie, but how is it a \\"special edition\\"","review":"I am an ardent follower of Pink Floyd and recently purchased the VHS re-release. Although the movie is just as good as I remembered it, contrary to what you see above, the VHS edition is NOT in wide screen format. There are very few added scenes, but nevertheless it is a very enjoyable and well-done movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This movie was a spectaculer view of Pink FLoyd's music. It takes a little while for you to realize whats going on in the movie but all in all, it was an awesome movie. The animation was crazy and amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Picture","review":"I often heard how great this film was and finally decided to see for myself if the reviews would stand or not. This is an incredibly shoddy and boring piece of work. There is nothing but boredom in this production. I think the only decent scene was some of the fascist stuff but that was it. Not recommended at all. The director also flopped out with 'Evita' another lacking film."},{"rating":"2","title":"looking for the wall on dvd or laser disk","review":"hey,pink floys fans(like my self)i've been looking for almost 2yrs for the pink floyd's the wall(the movie)on dvd or laser disk.please if you have ANY idea how could i get one,e-mail me..thax"},{"rating":"2","title":"true classic","review":"I must say I came to this site to finally order myself a copy after all these years, and I find that is not being published this is trully a shame. It definetly is one movie that I always believed a person could be to young to watch, it is deep, the imagery, the content, exposes the inner dilemmias of young man on the road of mental musings, in his adventure of being a rock icon."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I had four hands, I'll give it 4 thumbs up!","review":"Pink Floyd out-did themselves in producing this video. I love music and of all the music videos I've seen, \\"The Wall\\" is my favortie. Anyone who sees it can relate it to a time in thier life or in someone elses. If you haven't seen \\"The Wall,\\" you have to see it. It's really a great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Movie of All Time","review":"This movie is the embodiment of how the human mind can be corrupted into degredation and insanity. With no conventional dialogue, you find yourself sucked into Pink's inner psyche through the music of \\"The Wall\\". Through the flashbacks and memories, you see how a madman builds his perfect isolation brick by brick, sealing himself from the pains of losing a father, an unfaithful wife, an overprotective mother, and the pressures of rock stardom. You just can't go wrong with this abstract representation of the journey into the mind of a man who has lapsed into insanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily one of the greatest artistic works ever created","review":"The Wall is not an ordinary movie. Instead of regular dialog and plot, the movie is a visual experience of the album of the same name. The movie explores the darkest parts of the human mind and forces the viewer to consider many ideas he or she may rather not think about. Animation combined with video, all casted in time with the music to Pink Floyd's album, The Wall, this movie must have truely been difficult to direct and create.Several of the movie's producers do not share my opinion of the film, and even Roger Waters himself expressed dissatisfaction with The Wall, but I see the movie as a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont believe the hype...","review":"Ok, just like the album, ive watched (listened in the case of the album) this several times, both sober and not-so. I must say, although many people like it, i think it is pretty boring. Just like the album there are spots of absolute genuis, but there are plenty of times that you would kill for a fast-forward button. Some of the acting, and all of the animation, is riveting, thought provoking, and just plain intense. But after is all said and done, youre left with the feeling of... \\"what a waste of time\\". Rent/Borrow it to check it out. Then buy it if you like it, but DONT spend your hard earned bucks just because the hype says the wall is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound for the 22nd century.","review":"The moment DVD was announced with true digital surround sound (be it Dolby Digital 5.1, DTS or MPEG multichannel) it was destined to rejuvenate the music scene that hasn't basically left its one-dimensional straightjacket since the arrival of the stereo LP.It has been too long a waiting for new or remastered music (video) productions, but what an incredible reward 'The Wall' brings ! The scale and complexity of the typical Pink Floyd soundscape rendered in a full-circle panorama provokes a 100 minute eargasm.If remastering nearly 20 year old material can bring such joy, try to imagine what new projects specifically developed for the surround format will bring.5 years from now we will know: 'That was when it all started. That was when it all began'. Be part of the future. Rush out. Get this DVD. (Get the hardware to play it on as well). NOW, while it's still the 1900ths."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for non-wall lovers","review":"If you own the original \\"Wall\\" DVD, or even VHS, throw it away and get this. The picture quality is pristine and the sound unbelievable. And while someone who's not a fan of Pink Floyd would find the storyline eratic and confusing, it's still an interesting piece of art thanks to brilliant animation and wild photography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"This movie provides a creative story, set only to the music of Pink Floyd. Still, it shouldn't be viewed as an rock opera, but as a real movie, and should be enjoyed like a real movie. We are told, in fragments and memories, the story of Pink, who grew up fatherless and under the control of a stifling mother, and then went on to have an unfortunate relationship with his wife. He slowly becomes more and more detatched from reality, until we realize he has finally snapped, and has been building a \\"Wall\\" for years to distance himself from the world. The story plays out in a very interesting and visually artistic way. The music gives every scene a dazzling emotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for Music Fans","review":"This is a must have for all music fans, especially for a fan of the legendary band of Pink Floyd. The sound quality of this DVD is amazing. I found myself hearing things I've never heard before on VHS. DVD is the way to go for this timeless story and biography of the band Pink Floyd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album, Good Film","review":"This is a great movie if you watch it a couple of times to understand it. There is a plot to the movie and it takes a brain to understand it. Anything thats made by Pink Floyd takes in depth thinking to fully understand. This movie is way more in depth than just a kids dad dying when he was young. Theres the whole theme of hate with the hammers theres color themes that change throughout the movie and I could name off a whole list of things. If you only have 1 or 2 Pink Floyd CDs and you dont know literally anything about the band or its history then dont buy this movie, but if your a big Pink Floyd fan this is definetly a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece, a mind's voyage to its own feelings","review":"This film made me cry, scream, and tremble with emotion. It inspired me, it made me see the world in a different way. The fact that this film is out of print terrified me, I had it once but soon got lost, most probably in some guy's hands. I got to have it. I need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch it more than one time and you'll see.....","review":"I am addicted to this movie, and go to see it in our English-speaking cinema as often as it's on.

If you are in the US, I highly recommend going to Best Buy to avoid headaches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant...","review":"In a visual perspective, it's provocative, shocking, and highly disturbing to the point of it being too overwhelming for words...but overall, the movie creeped me out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wow","review":"this movie has changed my life. I wish that i had never seen those horrible scenes i was forced to watch. A friend of mine brought the movie to my house, i did not realize the terror i was about to see. It caused me to have insomnia and spasms in my right leg. Everytime i see a single object that reminds me of that video i start shaking and my leg moves uncontrollable. I cried throughout the entire film and i know my life will never be the same again. thank you pink floyd for ruining my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"Pink Floyd is my second favorite band after Led Zeppelin. I got into rock music because of them. still, with all my love for PF, this is the worst movie I have seen in my life. Waters was either smoking crack, or he wanted to make some extra money, I dont know. How could this calm psychedelic band that created Meddle, Wish You Were Here and other masterpieces, make such a brutal, nasty and disturbing movie? If it was slipknot or mudwayne, I would not be surprised, but why PF?This was a huge disappointment and I got rid of it the next day. The soundtrack album is very good, though. If you want a PF video, buy Live At Pompeii, don't buy this crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"I was looking forward to the movie, but it was dissapointing. In fact, my sister walked out within the first 45 minutes of the movie.1) I hated the animation of the film, especially when the two flowers are having intercourse.2) I hated the acting, if you could even call it that (the people were basically just staring into space for the plurality of the movie.3) I REALLY hated the sexual depiction. It became way too out there when one of Pink's peoples raped the girl, and also when Pink's wife was cheating.4) I did not like the amount of gore and violence. I mean, why does he need to go into a pool of blood for no real reason!But, at least the music pulled me through, and there was some type of plot entact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Movie","review":"This movie is awesome! I just watched it today because school's over and I was bored. I was spellbound the whole time. Contrary to other reviews, there is a plot, but it is very confusing and hard to follow due to the fact that it isn't in chronological order among other things. It certainly isn't a popcorn movie; you actually have to pay attention to enjoy it.But, nevertheless, it is a superb video. I myself am not even a big fan of Pink Floyd music; but I was entranced by this film. But, be warned, the film is very depressing, shocking, violent, and graphic at times; especially the animations. Although they obviously aren't real, some of them are very creepy.I'm 16, and although I could handle it, it was quite disturbing in parts. I wouldn't recommend anyone under that age watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Floyd Shines On In New DVD","review":"To put it quite briefly, this is a deluxe release of one of the definitive rock 'n roll picture shows, all trimmings included. The bonus features, including commentary and interview footage courtesy of Roger Waters, are welcome additions. I have no complaints; just one question: How does one access the \\"secret buttons\\" described in the features listed on package? Anyone with any info, please email me at boneyard@smurfs.com. Thanks. Overall: one of the few films that merits a deluxe dvd release. Worth the cash, not just for Pink Floyd fans, but for film and music devotees alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"llaw eht ni kcirb rehtona","review":"This is an awesome DVD. Don't expect a storyline, and don't try to make sense of it.

I watched it in awe, not believing what I was seeing. The movie somewhat lived up to the hype I had heard about it, but it's something you have to see to believe. The music really enhanced the movie a lot, so if your a big Pink Floyd fan and have not seen this movie, you don't know what your missing. The DVD extras are nice too, which makes this DVD worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Floyd The Wall on DVD...WOW!","review":"If you a Floyd fan, or a DVD buff...you gotta get this one.....The Wall as the best interactive menus i have seen on a DVD so far.

We tried a regular movie in them and it worked fine. I'm not saying there was anything bad about the disc but I shouldn't have to change country codes just to watch it then switch it back to watch other movies. There was no reading material in there either, just the disc which I found kind of odd.

How can you have any pudding if you dont eat your meat??!!The Wall is about a man named Pink - and how he builds THE WALL, then how THE WALL comes crashing down on his head. We all build our own little wall to protect us from the nasty things life throws at us, and sometimes those nasty things can tear down our wall, exposing us before the world - making us feel small and hopeless. This is what happens to Pink. Set to the music of Pink Floyd, the movie is like a long music video with live actors and some wild animation sceens, and a powerful message. This is a movie that will make you think, and you will want to watch it more than once. A MUST OWN for any Floyd fan, as well as for those who just enjoy films that stimulate the brain!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it's the same as the previous DVD release...","review":"If you've already bought \\"The Wall\\" on dvd, this is just a re-packaged version, it has no additional features or footage."},{"rating":"2","title":"IF YOU EVER LIKED PINK FLOYD....BUY THIS DVD","review":"I can only sum this DVD up by saying one thing: I spent two hours watching the supplemental material before actually watching the movie. The huge variety of choices afforded the viewer (captions of lyrics or of the dialogue, other special features) makes this movie a must have for Pink Floyd Fans.

But alas no. It tries to set a movie to the album with a few songs missing and one extra. Ok i love the album it is magnificent but by putting a movie to the music you don't get the chance to actually listen, the scenes get kind of drawn out and repeatitive. The cartoon snippets are awesome yes but the take a back seat to the predominent live action parts.It is the story of Roger Waters so you got to feel for him a bit, it tells his story but why mix that with the music and inserted trippy cartoons."},{"rating":"2","title":"watch this with Antichrist Superstar!","review":"This movie has stunning images and a dark interior and i'm sorry, but i'm actually not much of a Pink Floyd fan.

A bad \\"visualisation\\" of the album and stage shows. Bob Geldoff is excellent as Pink. But this is the only good part about this film.It certianly makes the story easier to understand than it's album and stage show predacessors. However it's shoddily done and all the acting with the exception of Geldoff is hammier than a pig sty.Also several tracks are edited or just completely left out of the film. The keyboard solo from Run Like Hell is absent and Hey You isn't even used!.I have a lot of respect for all three of the individuals responsible for this flick.

Of course it is my personal opinion but i think it is required of me. My contentions are that the acting is tepid, the concert scenes look corny (run like hell), and the pace is unnecessarily slow. There is no art here..for example, the scene where the school kids rebels is done stark(yet unpowerful) with no subtlety and when there is symbolism it isnt very intelligent...(children going through meat grinders?).i'm giving two stars for the animation which is visually stunning and conveys a very powerful message to the viewer....other than that...give this a miss....i wished i had a wall between myself and this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Dramatization","review":"I was disappointed...too much movie and not enough music.

It gave me a new understanding of what Waters was trying to accomplish, although foggy due to the frantic rush of a movie that it was. The movie, I believe, could be about one of two things. First, it may be about what happened to Syd Barret after he left Floyd and his solo career flopped. Second, it could be Waters' fear of what the future was bringing to him. I choose to believe the latter, because it was more like what his life pattern was becoming. The movie is a wonderful work, and even though it is totally outrageous, it'll still make the album make more sense...

The movie is interesting to watch, a bit longwinded toward the middle but overall worth a couple hours of time. The extra features are as spectacular as promised - gotta be at least 4 hours of material on this disc.Unfortunately, no matter what sound configuration I used (including 5.1), the sound mix on my copy was atrocious. Either the volume had to be all the way up at 85% to hear the dialogue, or 35% to keep the neighbors from complaining about how loud the music was. For that reason alone, I would not spend money on this product - it's definitely a rent before buy.I really wish I could give this more stars. The movie is fascinating and the music is superb.

It tells us, the younger generation, that no matter how bad your past or present may have been, or how lowly people may make you feel, you do have your own mind, your own values, whether you know them or not. And the only thing stopping you from finding them is your fear of doing so. Find your wall, and break it. That is the story.

None of them weigh over 50 lbs. After a few days of use it started getting water inside but still inflated okay. They enjoyed a full summer of fun last year. Unfortunately this summer we were only able to play on it a few times. The inner liner deteriorated and the outside liner began to rip at the seams. We contacted Little Tikes who told us what patch to buy and so we patched it in several places. It worked for one day then the slide did not blow up fully anymore. The kids hit the ground when they tried to slide so we had to throw it away. It was a waste of almost $400. Needless to say we were all quite disappointed. Also, just to let you know, the slide was always properly taken care of and stored properly. I hope this helps someone! Definitely save your money, there are better slides out there!CandaceMadison, MS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After 3 months of using this slide maybe 8-9 times it wouldn't hold air anymore. We only found a couple of very small holes and patched them but still the slide wouldn't hold a child. After major investigation we found that the inner lining of the fabric in the doorway had shredded. Air was escaping because the vinyl lining underneath the fabric was ripped. These weren't little tears, it was unfixable. Little Tikes customer support said \\"too bad, it's past the 90 day warranty\\". I've always loved Little Tikes products but this was a major disappointment. I ended up getting some vinyl at the fabric store and gluing it over the doorway fabric. We were able to use it today, thankfully. The kids love it, it's very fun, but it's not very durable. I agree that it's a pain to put away. It takes in alot of water and takes forever to drain out and dry out. I would never recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad waste of money...disappointed kids","review":"This slide was Awesome when we purchased this less than a year ago. This year, it doesn't hold air or the weight of my little ones. It is sad as we had planned an outdoor party with their 7 yr old friends and now we have no slide. This product was purchased after researching others for their durability. Little Tikes is supposed to be a good quality manufacturer- Not so with this item AT ALL. This was not a cheap purchase either as we paid close to $300 for it last summer and can't use it this summer. Please, I advise not purchasing this for your kids unless you do not mind throwing away your money. This is NOT a durable item for your family. This will not hold up."},{"rating":"2","title":"slide and slam","review":"I bought this slide because it was one of the least expensive and I wanted to see what the inflatable slides were all about without investing a whole lot of money. I can say that this was a great purchase! My three boys, 5 and under, love this slide. My littlest...too small to do the whole slide loves to be put half-way up...and they all love the hoop! It is an energy zapper...all they do is climb and slide! All three will have abs of steel (from wall climbing) by the end of summer too! It is less expensive, a great starter slide and made by Little Tikes (solid product company with a customer service). I would recommend this to a friend. In fact, I already have...twice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable at all","review":"We bought the slam n slide for our two kids to use during the summer. Probably used it about 3 times a week,completely taking down and putting it back up each time and it lasted for only about half of the summer. Once it got water inside, it was impossible to dry out and then the two layers came apart and ripped across each of the outside walls. The first couple tears or holes we fixed assuming it would last a little longer, but it was short lived. The hoses all cracked at the joints and I had to patch each joint with a hose clamp to make it work.It was fun while it lasted now the new version is smaller, made of the same material by the same manufacturer and costs $100 more. Definitely not worth it if you consider value for your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't go wrong with the SOG Blink","review":"I had bought this knife as a replacement for a Gentleman SOG I'd owned for nearly ten years which I'd recently lost in a Taxi in Bangkok.Unlike a previous reviewer, I did not find the spring to be too strong.

For my tastes and needs, I'm glad I ordered the Twitch, because the Blink, I think, has just too small a blade...at 55 mm or 2 3/16th inches, its stubby length just doesn't..cut...it. The extra 1/2 inch length of the Twitch's blade, and it's narrower profile allows it to slice cheese, bread, fruit, steak, rope, and perform general tasks more effectively. Its extra weight of about 1/2 ounce is worth it, to me. In my medium large hand it handles better, and the secondary opening blade \\"kick\\" provides a nice finger guard.So, the Blink is too short, too wide, therefore clumsy in hand and use. Twitch it is, for me.Both are beautifully constructed, the bead-blasted aluminum handle actually has some positive tactile \\"traction\\" for even calloused fingers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small blade for the size of the knife...","review":"I had a SOG Twitch I and lost it.

Others may feel differently though, and that's OK!Matt"},{"rating":"1","title":"SOG speciality knives","review":"I find the SOG knives to be clumsy, awkward, slow access. Check out Buck, made in USA products. True one hand operation. With fore finger, flip the lock safety back, flip the \\"trigger\\", voila, eyes closed, blade is out and ready. SOG, meanwhile, the slide thing has to be moved to the \\"red\\" ready access, then maybe with one hand after much practice, you may have a blade out. For a reliable switch blade alternative, in my opinion, the Buck is the only choice. And the Buck is razor sharp and seems to retain edge.

I've never seen a book with so much useful information packed onto each page. There are 100's of lists of ideas for the reader to choose from in a great step-by-step preproduction process. The digital parts on storytelling are revolutionary and really helped me see where I could use some simple techniques to make my film more hip and original.

A perverse twist using the teachings of the bible for false doctrines of evil spells and spirits."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite spooky movie","review":"I can watch this movie over and over and still notice new things. I am surprised that this movie wasn't more successful, as I juat happened across a used copy. Kate Hudson is looking good and the acting is good. The ending will blow you socks off. That is what makes the movie. You never see it coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Orleans before the flood.....","review":"Is about the only thing going for this puppy - DOA! Kate Hudson dressed in skimpy underwear wandering around in a creepy old house (in the bayou of course) might be enough for teenage boys, but thats about it. Gina Rowlands and John Hurt are just \\"collecting\\" their checks in this one. Basically the big \\"ah ha\\" at the end (the exchange of characters - ghosts for the living) might have made for a good Twilight Zone or Night Gallery episode - but at two hours - it is like watching something slowly sink in quicksand. One would expect more from such a talented cast and from a director who made the wonderful \\"Wings of a Dove\\" - one really wonders how a project like this gets greenlighted - what a waste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ending Just Ruined The Movie","review":"On TV, when the trailers of 'The Skeleton Key' played, I thought when I watch this movie, it better live up to what it says, because this movie said it was suspensful, spine chilling, had a twist ending that will keep the audience guessing and etc. The movie better be right. The beginning and the middle were good. It was intresting, give me scares here and there, but the ending just ruined the whole movie. I don't want a twist ending, and twist endings - we know the ghost will always win. (That is not a spoiler, it happens in every movies, and we all know it).Caroline took a job at an old house in the south. She takes care of a man who is suffering from sickness, and she tries to save the man, as the woman who lives with him is trying to sacrifice him for her own life. This movie goes in the voodoo and sacrificial horror section. It's an okay movie. Watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"i feel bad for this person","review":"i have to say i feel bad for this person that wrote a review below. (writer & psychotherapist who loves movies \\"nepadf---for the psychological perspective\\". You know I work for a large company in the Supplier Diversity orgn and understand the plight of minorities as I am one myself and deal with it everyday at my job and in life. However I must say NEPADF has completely missed the boat on this one. you are reading way too much into a simple thriller. You give Hollywood way too much credit.The movie was a good little thriller and that's that. Also just a thought about the \\"twist\\" at the end. I had it figured out pretty early on but still enjoyed the movie. However I'm amazed at the amount of people that have written reviews and seem to have purposefully told the entire story. I'm glad I don't read reviews on here before I see movies. You people have ruined the movie for a lot of people which i'm sure was your intent."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending ruined the enitre movie for me","review":"This movie starts off a little slow, but once it gets going, it is like a run away train. Honestly it could have been a four or a five star movie. The girl takes a hospice job for an old couple and weird stuff starts happening. She learns of the voodoo magic going on and the dark secret of the house.****SPOILER****The reason I hated it is how it ends. The girl is tricked into making a \\"protection\\" circle in the attic to keep the evil old woman at bay, but it turns out to be a holding circle. Then she starts working her spell to trade bodies with the girl. The girl fights back and loses. I can't say for sure why, but the ending really annoyed me and my wife as well. I watched this yesterday and it is still annoying me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern chills and thrills","review":"Loved the atmosphere in this movie. Big old houses, especially ones on plantations can be inherently creepy anyway. But this house, seen by a swamp, in stormy nights, with a mysterious history, fits the bill if you want a disturbing setting for strange goings-on. A thought provoking excercise in putting this New Orleans area based movies' blues clues together... Hudson and Rowlands are outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I loved this movie. I enjoyed it. Not one of my favorites, but I always enjoy watching it. The plot is fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully creepy, if not terribly surprising","review":"Although the big surprise twist isn't that much of one, The Skeleton Key is still a very entertaining and stylish supernatural thriller, with an all-star cast, wonderfully spooky scoring and great directing like they aren't supposed to do any more. And what's more, it gets the difference between voodoo and hoodoo right.Kate Hudson and especially John Hurt absolutely sell the story, and the entire conceit of hoodoo not being dangerous unless you believe it teases viewers not to believe.Recommended for fans of supernatural thrillers like the Serpent and the Rainbow, the Ring and the Sixth Sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I went to see this movie the second week that it came out. It was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Lately, all the movies that come out are either stupid or unoriginal. However this movie was original, not so much scary because I didn't get scared at all but the plot is good and Kate Hudson gives a good performance. If you believe in ghosts and voodoo, then this is a must-see."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD!!","review":"\\"The Skeleton Key\\" is a unique movie unlike no other because of its multiple bone-chilling aspects such as an unexpected villan and an unforeseen twist at the end. Caroline (Kate Hudson) is a Hospice employee who eventually gets fed up with her job and finds an ad in the paper that fits her financial needs. Once she is moved in she begins exploring the spooky old plantation and uses the skeleton key to discover a deep dark secret in the attic. A good movie filmed in a perfect setting, will keep you guessing till the end. Once it is over you have to think about it to understand the mastermind behind this thriller. I thought this movie had a great twist in it. The acting was great and the overall look and feel of the film was well developed. This thriller/mystery is entertaining and worth the watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Watching","review":"The cast did a wounderful job starting with Kate Hudson as Caroline, Gena Rolands as Violet and John Hurt as Ben. John Hurt had the most challenging role. His character Ben is not able to talk in this movie yet we can see the anguish and fear he is trying to show us. Best job of the lot.The film is well written and directed. We are given enough clues throughout the movie to figure out what is happening. But not enough to ruin the suspense. This is one of the few movies I almost had to wait for the end to know what was going on. The story knows how to keep us on the edge of the seat in suspense. And when the end finally does come. We are offerred an extra bang for our dollar when it all makes sense. You will finally see the string of clues that lead to the very ending. Though I must admit you really have to pay attention to figure it before they show you. Good luck, it is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Better Horror Movies Made Lately.","review":"I was wondering how well Kate Hudson would do in this film and I must say quite well. The other actors did a well job themselves and the storyline was not confusing to follow. The plot itself is interesting and different, which is always a good thing. And the ending was, to me, very creative and understandable. Unlike in many horror flicks, it is not cliche. I've noticed some horror movies make it too easy in the end, and some just make it too hard to understand. This movie fell nicely in the middle, so this movie gets a good four stars from me.I recommend it to people to at least watch once- I have a feeling many other horror fans will like the movie as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Skeleton Key\\"","review":"Storyline: A young woman gets a job as a caretaker for an elderly dying man. As the movie goes along, creepy events keep you guessing until the end of the movie.The movie took awhile for it to get to the part where Kate Hudson gets the job, and I almost walked out of the theatre. But as soon as Hudson gets the job the movie becomes interesting and exciting. I'm glad I stayed. You should definatly see it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"talented cast and director wasted on this film","review":"The acting and direction of Skeleton Key are high quality. The story line is not.Something is wrong in a bayou home, where Kate Hudson's character cares for an invalid man. It seems 'hoodoo' is at work, and souls such as his, are either being entrapped, or tortured, or something.Hudson is hot stuff on the bayou, and John Hurt (!) has a creepy bit part as the invalid/hoodoo victim. This cannot save the film however, as films require an interesting plot, and development of empathy with its characters. What I cannot forgive, is the lack of CCR's 'Born on the Bayou' on the soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Skeleton Key","review":"We had to look at this movies three time because just going back to see the missed clues. Every time we looked at it we learn something new. It's a little slow in action but very interesting to look at and figures out the clues"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie made my heart skip a beat!","review":"This is a solid movie, with really great acting.

It is a thriller, not necessarily a horror movie, but will scare the hell out of you!Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Skeleton Key","review":"The movie is a horror type movie which I love. It was very good and had a surprise ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Effective Atmospheric Thriller with a Killer Twist Ending","review":"I just got back from seeing The Skeleton Key starring the ever cute Kate Hudson. The first 90 minutes or so were good, but I would have given the film only 3 stars if it weren't for the ending. There are a couple of twists towards the end, but the final one is totally unexpected. I thought surprise endings were played out after all of the recent films that have tried to copy the Sixth Sense, but this one really caught me off guard. This film isn't scary in the least, but it is rather suspenseful, has great bayou locations, and Kate Hudson turns in a good performance. Worth checking out in theaters."},{"rating":"1","title":"It can open any door... But never really does.","review":"I was so let down by the ending of this movie that I don't even know where to start. Friends told me how great of a twist this film had and how I would just love it... They were dead wrong! I felt that the end of this movie was cheap, predictable, and really, really stupid! How many time are we going to have to see this crap over and over again???Please, if just have to see this movie rent it first. You may just be as dissapointed as I was!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie was not good at all!","review":"This was the worst movie ever. I wanted to turn the movie off in the middle but veryone was saying that the ending was the most shocking ending since the sixth sensce. The ending was not good at all. There were no scary parts. I hope this stops someone from seeing this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste the time, if you do not believe in ghost and magic much.","review":"I do not believe movies have to be scientific, but this is is too far out. So if you are not deeply religious or someone who always believe in ghost or magic, you might not want waste time on this. The movie itself might not be too bad. But it will be just a total non-sense to you.Also the characters in the movie lacks regular common sense. Either the director is trying to insult your intellence or himself is not too logical. So if you consider yourself are somehow intellectual, think twice before buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD YET!!","review":"This DVD smells and looks like they going after while down the road comes out with double disk or UNRATEDCUT OR EXTENDED CUT for SURE!!

I couldn't agree more. There wasn't a thing interesting about her. Oh, she's a pretty, perky hospice worker who wasn't there for the death of her father. Oh, the irony... *yawn*Sure, it has a nice twist at the end, but 90% of it is pretty evident from the first 20 minutes of the movie. The other 10% is catchable if you pay attention through the movie rather than yawning and/or debating about turning it off.I'd never heard of hoodoo before watching this movie and the bits I picked up from the movie interested me enough that I don't consider it a total flop.It reminded me of The Sixth Sense a bit, if you take out the annoying kid and every ounce of novelty and interest that movie held."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like this movie.","review":"I watched this movie 2x and I am still not sure who was who and what became of the children.

Other than some occult imagery though, I wouldn't give it much praise. Not especially good, nor especially bad. Overall, an o.k. thriller however."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOIN THE HOODOO THAT YOU DO","review":"Rich in Southern Gothic atmosphere, THE SKELETON KEY is a spooky little movie, far from perfect, but above average for the recent spate of horror films---and it's NOT A remake!!Kate Hudson gives a good performance as a young woman who takes on the hospice responsibilities for a recent stroke victim (John Hurt, effectively eerie). His wife, well played by the dependable Gena Rowlands, has hired Hudson to take care of her husband until he passes on. It's not long, though, before Hudson suspects something is going on in the creeky old manor. She stumbles upon a secret room that strongly hints of hoodoo practice. Without relying on gore or violence, SKELETON KEY moves eerily along with a twist ending you may not see coming. Peter Sarsgaard also stars as a young lawyer who tries to help Hudson through. THE SKELETON KEY is a stylish thriller with enough jolts to keep you on the edge of your seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy.....movie worth watching but do not carry your skeleton key.","review":"Saw this while on vacation and being a big Kate Hudson fan, i was looking forward to seeing this voodoo movie. I believe it is Kate first taste in this type of genre and she does a superb job as caregiver Caroline working for Voilet in taking care of patient Ben. As always, i will not give out the detail plot but it has the atmosphere and accent to make the storyline very believeble in keeping me on my seat. The ending is where the secret is revealed where you will go 'auuhhhh no wonder' and being satisfied yet a feeling of sorrow for the victimS.Fan's of Kate or of the supernatural thrillers....rent it when it comes out on DVD. It won't disapoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is 4 stars but the DVD is 1 star","review":"This DVD is listed as the Directors Cut, but truth be told it is just plain hacked!!

Can't wait for a uncut version...Hopefully Blue Underground picks it up and releases it on Blu-Ray!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Transfer & sound could be better","review":"I remember watching this movie on HBO as a kid. So when I saw it released as a \\"Digitally Remastered Director's Cut\\", I picked it up.First, The movie has not aged that well. The editing & the way the story just cuts around (especially in the beginning) and during other parts of the movie makes it feel like a lot of stuff got cut out between scenes.Several times throughout the movie the sound cuts off as if someone pushed a mute button during the transfer.The \\"Digitally Re-mastered\\" picture doesn't seem so. There are several scratches or lines that go across the whole picture during a couple of frames that last a good while before clearing up. There is grain and fuzziness throughout the movie, but does look better than previous releases of this movie.Overall this release is a little disappointing. I am also guessing this is the same transfer done for the dvd version as the artwork & release dates are the same. Not worth the price unless you really love this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you, Anchor Bay!!!","review":"I remember seeing this little movie when I was 10 or 11 and was quite shocked by it.

Vet Ginty seeks revenge on the creeps who ripped up his best friend with a clawhammer (Steve James- who briefly adds \\"life\\" to the movie). There are some hilariously bad gore scenes, including the decapitation in the opening scene which has to be seen to be believed, and how could I forget the sequence with the meat grinder?

She also makes some statements that I find offensive.If you're planning on writing for Guideposts or for Chicken Soup for the Soul, snap this up. If you're a suburban heterosexual mother of four, this book may be inspirational.

I think the novel could have been much improved if it had again focused on the viewpoint of one main character, as was done in The Rowan and in most of Damia. This would have alleviated the problem of too many jumps in plotline with too little elaboration. The characters seemed flat as well. I found it boring, and very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mushy, spotty plot with unoriginal characters","review":"Disappointing story about Damia's children and their \\"great\\" exploits. The story tries to cover as much time and action as possible in as few a words as possible creating a disjointed and thin plot. It's even a bit hard to follow there are so many gaps; not one of McCaffrey's better works.

The first talent books, Pegasus in Flight and Pegasus in Space were interesting and fun because we were reading about real characters.They had Talent, but they were still real people.The characters in the latter talent books are nothing less than gods, with an almost all-powerful Talent, and seemingly little or no personal problems or limitations (which makes th books dull). Also, what the books really portray, without actually saying it is basically a Talent autocracy. Non talented are inferior and unimportant, and the talented rule over everyone else with their powers. This reminds me of Star Trek, where everyone is law abiding, and the authority of the Federation is unquestioned.So what happens to those who question the authority of the Federation? They are automatically outlaws.

The recipes appear to be rather authentic and easy to follow. There are many good pictures of the food, and she suggests multiple ways to serve particular dishes (for example, with different sauces or sides).While this isn't my very favorite Asian cookbook, it is one I refer to often.

Instead, Sean B. Carroll tells us, in his charmingly offhand style, animals turn out to share great numbers of genes. In particular, we share master genes, the ones responsible for controlling embryological development. These master genes have been highly conserved for hundreds of millions of years, have passed into both great branches of animals, and have been central to the evolution of what Darwin called, \\"endless forms most beautiful.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Just missing one thing","review":"Very good book for the person with a general interest in science, but who is not a professional biologist. I knocked off one star because the book very badly needs a handy glossary, a handy lookup for a concise definition of the more important terms."},{"rating":"1","title":"science reader","review":"Too technical for the average reader. One gets lost part way through. It is obviously well researched, supported by other research and seemingly very thorough, but it comes across as having built an exquisite ocean liner that sinks the moment it sets sail. I agree with the other reviewer, Dr. Carroll speaks of evolution, argues strongly for it, yet uses the word design over and over again and never ever explains how this toolbox evolved. Why wouldn't the hand, the paw and the fin come from the same genetic area? That doesn't prove evolution and the book doesn't prove it, either. Had he written this was a pro-Intelligent Design book, he would have received more stars from this reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sean Carroll has done it again","review":"This is a fantastic read; informative, yet laid-back enough to make it easy to digest. Carroll has a way of integrating just enough humor to keep you interested, without going overboard. If you're super science-savvy, you may be a bit bored in a few places where he goes over the basics of DNA structure, etc., but the fact that he starts at the bottom makes his books suitable for a much broader audience. If you want a good popular-science style read, this is your book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting reading","review":"This is an interesting take on evo-devo. I'd recommend it for the popular science reader (its stays in pretty shallow waters scientifically)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"This book explains very well the way that DNA works. It answers some questions like, \\"How can I share 90% of my dna with a mouse?\\" \\"How do mutations eventually lead up to a change in an animal's form?\\" I had never heard a satisfactory explanation for how genes function before reading this book. It was very easy to understand, and an enjoyable read.It was a tad repetitive, with the author listing a couple of very detailed examples for every point he made. To be honest I appreciate this, but I did skip over some material after I had gotten the point of the chapter.I love popular science, particularly books about prehistory and evolution, but I avoid those books that are all about God vs. Evolution. Yes, the religious right is a very large, colorful, tantalizing target, but I prefer just the science. This book was great in that respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Endless Forms Most Beautiful by Carroll","review":"This work is an excellent rendition of the evolutionary development of biological processes. It shows the diversity of the animal kingdom. For instance, the same human genetic that controls the arm is similar to the genetics of a bird's wing or the fin of a fish.These types of relationships allow us to study fossils morecarefully in order to make projections to the modern animalkingdom. An important strength of the work shows us how geneticinformation is stored, coded and de-coded. There is a master genewhich controls eye formation in flies.

The audio and graphics were excellent. The story line was superb but could have been longer. Some of the shortfalls of the game were as follows: I would have liked to experience more ranching quests with other cowboys riding with you instead of by yourself or with the owner of the ranch. A wagon train quest and a train ride quest would have been excellent. More interaction with the town folks would have given the game more debth as well as interacting with the whores in the saloons. The store where you purchased upgrades should have more diverse products similar to Fable as well as more games in the casinos.

Once you are complete with every mission there really is nothing left to do, unless you want to shoot up a town to start a showdown which won't last very long.

I use it to read meters from a distance several hundred times a day, 5 days a week. It fits nicely in my shirt pocket, the focus is ETREAMLY FAST! The fact that the scope rests in the palm of your hands steadies the finger shake picked up from barrel scopes. The offset in the optics allows you to invert the scope to give you an extra inch of height when looking over fences, as well as the fact the scope is operated entirely from one hand, which is priceless when standing on your tippy toes to see over something, or are hanging from a wall you've gotta look over. There is only one draw back I have with this thing. It's only available in 8x, if it were a 10x32 it would be absolutely perfect.

Before, the optic on my rifle is what I would have used, but this is much safer as I can find what I'm looking for without having to point my firearm at it. As an added bonus, being a monocular, it allows you to focus on a far away obect with one eye, and yet still have full peripheral vision with the other eye.The one handed manipulation is great when carrying a firearm, as setting the weapon down to pick up binoc's is noisy and the motion can attract attention. Being able to simply pull this up to my eye is much quicker an quieter than any sighting system I've had before.This thing is LIGHT. I almost forget I have it on me.

While the movie has some similar elements to that series such as ongoing catastrophic events, there is absolutely no attempt by the moviemakers to tie them to the actual story (such as it is). These events are instead incidental to the story of a mom trying to find her daughter. One she's reunited, and after she runs into some shadow group who's purpose is never really explaind, the story ends.

The third, \\"The Dangerous Thread of Things\\" is muddled. . .but it steams, and thus deserves its place in an collection of erotica. The second, well. . .(Sssh. I enjoyed it. It made me laugh. It is insightful. It is a sketch of two interesting, memorable characters. But here's my theory: the producers asked each filmmaker to make something erotic. Soderbergh simply misheard and made something neurotic.)Each film is introduced by captivating, surreal animation--a tie that binds the collection--a joy to watch themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and quite uneven","review":"The three stories are quite uneven, being the Wan Kar Wai's segment the most interesting: well acted, well photographed and with a kind of catchy story line. However, the other too are a wonderful invitation to sleep. The Steven Soderbergh tale is awfully dull and nothing really interesting happens. The Antonioni piece is the most disappointing one, not only for being the worst but for being Anyonioni's. It's absolutely pointless and confusing; in many instances, it seems to be an amateurish test from a lazy cinema student. It's a pity it's Antonioni's since his reputation deserves more than this.

I hated Gene Tierney's character. She was a snob and ruined various people's lives out of greed and vanity. Clifton Webb is an annoying presence in all of his films. Suprisingly Tyrone Power did a good job in this film. His acting wasn't as stiff as it is in some of his other films. I still didn't like his charactor, however.

This makes it hard to learn Java, and hard to use as a reference later on.2) The code provided is poorly written. Not only does it occupy too much space in the text itself, but the code is so poorly formatted as to be unreadable. If any dev working with me formatted their code this way, I would force them to rewrite it.If you're looking to learn Java, you're much better off buying Head First Java.

Thomas composed rich orchestration to compliment the vocal part and the singer's (Hampson, Anderson, Graves, and Ramey) bring the art of French Opera to life. Hampson, especially, brings out the nuances within the music and is perfectly legato throughout! Although, the Spectre infernale, is a bit slower than I was used to hearing/performing it...I fell that it definitely brings out the mystery of Hamlet speaking to his father's ghost for the first time. Being the only recording of the Complete opera available, I highly recommend this for opera lover's!

I don't reacommend getting it at Amazon. You might have to pay a little more at petco or petsmart (can't remember each place carrier this item)...it was the same price but shipping and handle made it more. Amazon clearly sent me a damage bin because the box was not damage but the lid on my bin was cracked and the lid won't line up with the bin. I called Bergan and they fixed me up with replacements I needed. I'm not buying anything from Amazon anymore unless I can't find something I really need any where else.

I don't see why there isn't a game slot so you dont have to take of the hatch..and the battery..and all this other crap I don't feel like explaining. My best advice is to save money and buy a gameboy advance and a cell phone seperately. It's cheaper, better, and SMARTER. The GBA has so many good games and you can buy and mp3 attachment for it.

The only song that comes close to the classic onelinedrawing songs of old is \\"Livin' Small\\", all the other songs (with the exception of, perhaps, \\"We Had A Deal\\") seem silly and cheap (I'd say \\"Oh Boys\\" is a fine example of this).. and where previous songs have excelled with silliness and a simple approach (\\"Smile\\", anyone?)... these songs do not.Download this, but buy everything else Jonah has put out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coolest....

You've probably already read them.This edition presents them in a classic manner -- it is a lovely book, lovely dust jacket, and Christopher Hitchens does the intro. I usually find him funny and a little snarky, but in this intro, he is serious, high-minded, informative, and respectful.I wanted to read 1984 again, since so many people are kicking around the terms \\"Orwellian\\" and \\"Big Brother\\" regarding current politics. I'm so glad this is the volume I bought. I know I would have gotten the same *words* in a flimsy paperback, but this was a really nice read.I read both novels again. It has been... 20 years?

As for the edition itself, I would suggest to someone who is interested in either of these novels and does not yet own a copy of them to buy this edition. Even if you have a copy of one, I for example had the signet classic of 1984, this is still a good option. You get an attractive hard cover that conveniently has both the novels for a decent price.

The main reason I didn't give this CD a 5-star rating are the non-Bach selections, which although played brilliantly, are not among my favorite compositions. The exceptions are the charming Renaissance pieces for lute and the impressively transcribed and skillfully performed \\"Empress of the Pagodas.\\" To be sure, there are some beautiful and dazzling passages within many of the other pieces, which makes this CD definitely worth it.

Her 2000 album, The Heat, tells the story of a woman who faced loss from her man, bankruptcy, and trimuphs over the difficult road to happiness.The songs on The Heat are a bit more edge than Secrets and the Toni Braxton album. Although not as strong as Secrets, the songs have a more modern R&B vibe, with hip hop grooves, and dance mixes. However, there are some simple love songs on the album, like Spanish Guitar and I'm Still Breathing, written by Diane Warren. Also, hip hop songs, He Wasn't Man Enough, written by Rodney Jerkins, and The Art Of Love, pack a dominant punch to cheating men everywhere.The Heat by Toni Braxton, remains a true album of female power. Nonetheless, the music still is strong enough for a man, but has the seductive soul of a woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heatin up the Radio","review":"Toni Braxton makes a comeback on this impressive cd. As a young fan and one who never really paid any attention to Toni until now, I was impressed by this disc. Toni starts off with the Darkchild hit HE WASN'T MAN ENOUGH FOR ME. The 2nd single JUST BE A MAN ABOUT IT is also a hit and is very strongly R&B. THE HEAT (the 3rd song) is a catch fast song that should've been a single. The ballad SPANISH GUITAR is one of the weakest songs on the CD. Some other strong songs are NEVER JUST FOR A RING, MAYBE and a few others. Toni is still showing them that she can hang with the youngins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do You Feel The Heat?","review":"\\"The Heat\\" was definitely one of my favorite R&B releases from last year, due in part to the smash single \\"He Wasn't Man Enough\\", but also because of an enjoyable collection of smouldering ballads, including \\"Spanish Guitar\\" and \\"I'm Still Breathing\\" and a few catchy party tracks, like \\"Gimme Some\\", which features a guest performance by TLC's Lisa \\"Left-Eye\\" Lopes. Now, I've never been a ballad person, but this a great collection, Toni's rich voice puts alot of force to what would normally be quite a bland collection. Her husky singing definitely makes what could be a mediocre album into something exceptional, it earns all four of it's stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite CDs","review":"I make a point of looking for Toni's stuff. There isn't a song on this CD I don't like. I bought a second copy for my car!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Heat is On","review":"Braxton delivers a spicy mix of soul-pop just right for hot summer days. She has grown as a writer, so much so, she does not even need two bland ballads provided by Diane Warren. The title cut, Fairy Tale, and Maybe are awesome stand outs. The heat is on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talented Singer","review":"An artist has to change sometimes. There is some of the old Toni and some new Toni. I really like this album it is really great. She is up there with some of the great singers like Whitney, Mariah, and Monica not like Mary J. Blige who thinks she can Sing. Toni is all that."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Heat is AWESOME!","review":"Hey, I just wanna let you know, If you dont have THE HEAT yet, You MUST get it! Its definately Toni's BEST album to date. It has something for everyone! She has pop songs, R&B songs, Ballads, Uptempos, everything! Her voice has never sounded so great. :) I expect MANY Grammies for this album, Go pick up a copy! It's AWESOME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT ANITA BUT THIS WILL DO","review":"THIS IS MY FILL UP TO ANITA BAKER AND I LOVE NEVER FOR A RING THE GIRL BLOWS THIS SONG OUT ,THIS WHOLE CD IS WORTH THE PRICE I JUST LOVE HER VOICE I CAN PLAY THAT SONG ALL DAY ,SHE WAS TURNING TO A BIT OF A HOOCHIE ON HER LAST ALBUM, AS LONG AS SHE BELTS HER TRADEMARK SONGS SHELL BE GOOD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can a white people listen to this CD?","review":"I'm not a racist,but except \\"He wasn't man enough\\" and \\"Spanish Guitar\\", I can not listen to any of the other songs.They are really all the same between them. Just listen how the songs start. I find useful this CD only in the nights when I put it in the CD player in order to sleep. And it's a pity because the song \\"He wasn't man enough\\" is one of my favourites."},{"rating":"2","title":"toni is bomb and always has been!","review":"i think anyone who downs toni's work is just playa hattin'you know you really like it and you dont understand why it took so long for this album to take off i am an artist my self and im in the works of recording my debut album now so i know how hard it is and if you found that there was somthing wrong with the album you have to remember that toni did go bankrupt and having a recording session is not free! considering that and toni's very buitiful voice that i could hear! this album was bomb! if you have any comments for me e-mail me at ivanm69@hotmail.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the new album \\"The Heat\\"","review":"Ok so I've been reading the bad reviews on this album and I just cant agree. I think the album is better in some ways than \\"Secrets\\" because it has more of a hard edge with the first single \\"He wasnt man enough.\\" But it also has the ballads, the best one I think is \\"Spanish Guitar\\" and it also has mid tempos such as \\"The heat.\\" I can admit it seems as though the songs werent as well produced as last record. But its a change that isnt half bad and should get some recognition for it. Keep in mind her legal struggle etc and that might be why the album turned out the way it did. Well I love it newayz and you all should check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SHE'S BACK FINALLY!","review":"I ENJOYED THE ALBUM PRETTY MUCH. SHE SOUNDS LIKE SHE DEFINATELY HAS BEEN THROUGH SOME DRAMA WITHIN THE PAST 3 YEARS, BUT I STILL BELIEVE THIS ALBUM WILL BRING HER BACK ON TOP. I THINK SHE IS A VERY TALENTED INDIVIDUAL AND I ENJOY HER MUSIC. I AM JUST GLAD TO HAVE HER BACK IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY. FROM A TRUE FAN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Toni Braxton is back after a long absence, her previous album, Secrets, was released almost 4 years ago. She helped pen 8 of the 12 tracks, one of which she wrote by herself, called Speaking In Tongues.The Heat is a wonderful collection of songs, that suit Toni's voice. The first track, which is the hot new single, He Wasnt Man Enough is a wonderful opener of the album, getting the listener ready for a fun ride, of this R&B filled album.Toni's voice lends well to the songs on this album, especially the ballads. Her voice, sultry, sexy, deep. Some highlights include the title track The Heat, Spanish Guitar, Gimme Some (featuring TLC's Lisa \\"Left Eye\\" Lopez), Im Still Breathing, Maybe, and Never Just For A Ring. All the songs are well done.Its clear why Toni Braxton still remains to be one of the best singers out there, with her distinctive voice, her songs, and her love for the fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"STEPHANIE'S OPINIONS OF MUCH WORTH","review":"I LISTEN TO ALL TYPES OF MUSIC AND I AM CURRENTLY WORKING ON MY OWN RECORDING. I RATE TONI UP THERE WITH THE BEST. HER VOICE IS RARE AND HER BEAUTY IS BEYOND WORDS. SHE HAS GROWN SINCE HER FIRST ALBUM, AND PROBABLY WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. IF ANY ARTIST EVER STOPS GROWING IN THIER MUSIC THEY MAY WANT TO GO AHEAD AND HAVE A SEAT. I LIKE ALL OF TONI'S SONGS; OFCOURSE SOME MORE THAN OTHERS. I PARTICULARY LIKE \\"JUST BE A MAN ABOUT IT\\" AND \\"HE WASN'T MAN ENOUGH FOR ME\\". \\"HE WASN'T MAN ENOUGH\\" GETS ME ENERGIZED EVERY TIME I HEAR IT. SHE DID A TERRIFIC JOB ON THAT ONE. I STILL JAM THE OLD ONES THOUGH. \\"I LOVE ME SOME HIM\\" IS PROBABLY ONE OF MY FAVORITES. TONI DID A REMARKABLE JOB ON THE BET 20TH ANNIVERSARY PROGRAM. SHE LOOKS GREAT, SHE'S GOT A GREAT VOICE, AND THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH EXTRA HAIR OR PERFORMING 1/2 NAKED. I SAY MORE POWER TO HER! I WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT MS. TONI BRAXTON IN WHATEVER SHE DECIDES TO DO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"I am a HUGE Toni Braxton fan and had very high expectations for this long overdue album. Man was I disappointed. Contrary to Amazon's review of the album, I find it much too dance oriented and unmelodic. Secrets was a GORGEOUS album, whereas The Heat barely displays beauty. In addition, this album relies far too much on background vocals, by actually pushing them to the point they overpower Toni's gorgeous voice. Spanish Guitar has so much promise, but is ultimately mired by backing vocals that don't match the genre. They sound like they would be more at home on an Osmond Brothers album. Like Mariha Carey, I wish Toni would do a stripped down album with no vocal pyrotechnics or backup singers. Don't waste your money. I give this two stars primarily for what I think are the two \\"best\\" tracks: \\"He Wasn't Man Enough,\\" and \\"Spanish Guitar.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice","review":"good steady soul. smooth and well sung. but nothing spectacular. her singles are quite nice but I didn't think that they were that great. In the end it seems like Toni gets a bit worse with each album which is disappointing"},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Disappointment","review":"Weeks before the album was released I put in my order with Amazon.com. I had liked Toni Braxton's last album so much I thought this one would be great especially after I heard the song, \\"..Man Enough...\\". Unfortunately, I found the album to be a hodge-podge of different musical styles with almost no memorable songs, and certainly none that I'd want to hear over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a really good cd!","review":"First of all.....this is a good cd, sure \\"secrets\\" was the best cd Toni had realeased since.But \\"Heat\\" is the best I've heard from Toni! ...her hit single\\"He wasn't man enough\\" is da bomb! other tracks that r great : \\"Spanish Guitar\\" and \\"I'm still breathing\\" r tracks u want to hit repeat. So to all the people who hates her new album! u don't have good taste in music! ...believe me....this is 1 cd that's a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's still breathing","review":"Okay I know that this isn't Toni's best work but it's still worth it. The definite high's were I'm still breathing, Never just for a ring, Maybe, Fairytale, Spanish guitar, He wasn't man enough, The heat and Just be a man. The low's were Speaking in tongues, The art of love, Gimme some and You've been wrong. I think she should have worked on more songs with the likes of Babyface, Diane Warren and Daryl Simmons but the lot she has is enough not to be detrimental for the album. I love the new image and I think it suits her well. Be it the album is not all that or what we have to give it to Ms Braxton cause she's definitely Still Breathing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"She tries different sorts of beats although most of her songs, many of them are about heartbreak. they're still good. her vocal aren't as powerful or as with emotional as much as those on her first cd, but this is still a great cd. she's not exactly pulling a mariah carey, this is definately worth buying. she's not doing the mariah, she's losing some fire, but not all of it. hopefully her new label will be better for her and she can pump out more music.overall though, great cd, great beats, and lovely lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not hot, but definately good!","review":"This is album is certainly not hot- with only 3-4 fast songs. However, the fast paced songs are good, and so are the ballads which take over the album successfuly.Songs like \\"He wasn't a man enough for me\\" and \\"Gimme Some\\" with the late Lisa Lopez are bouncy and catchy. Songs like \\"Spanish Guitar\\" and \\"I'm still breathing\\" are beautiful ballads, and songs like \\"Fairy tale\\" will melt your heart , and \\"Maybe\\" is simply sweet with it's kisses sounds at the first part.Her voice is of coure great, which just makes this album a bigger pleasure.Weak songs however have to be \\"the heat\\" and \\"the art of love\\" ."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is her best work!","review":"I really liked Secrets, but this album is amazing! If you don't like it slow and hot, you won't like this album. I don't agree with others who said that this album is \\"hip-hop\\". It is slow and extremely sensual. It is an awesome romatic evening cd with a touch of nasty (believe me, I put it to the test!). Toni has finally resurfaced with the class that I knew she had all along. This is the kind of music she was born to sing! Her voice is sexual and full of feelings. I didn't really care for \\"Fairy Tale\\" and the next song after it, as they are more on the \\"Unbreak My Heart\\" pattern, but \\"The Art of Love\\", even tho the only thing you hear from Toni is a few whispers, is SO incredible and will make you feel sensual from the inside out! This is a GREAT album, I highly recommend it for that \\"get down and dance for your man\\" evening that you've been planning for years! It worked for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can You Take The Heat","review":"Let me start out by saying this is Toni's best work in years. It's much different from her past albums such as (Toni Braxton, Secrets) but the change she has made is definately amazing and breath taking. All of the songs on this album all have a story line to them and none of them are repetitive. This cd shows off Toni's exceptional skills as a talented songwriter and producer not to mention a remarkable pianist. She also has some help from her sisters (The Braxtons) in a couple of songs (You've Been Wrong & Never Just For A Ring)This album is definately one of the hottest albums of the millenium so far it's a must have to your cd collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is a really good cd. Toni has definately done it again and this time with more hits than ever especially the song she does with Dre! I absolutely love He Wasn't Man Enough For Me! I love the video too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Comeback","review":"I was an avid Braxton fan and couldn't wait for her to come back and sing again. I found this CD rather disappointing, and repetitive. There's potential club music here, and some interesting chances that she's taken, but not the Toni Braxton who sang \\"Unbreak My Heart.\\" The same beat (or so it seems) goes from song to song. Some lyrics are garbled, not like her crystal clarity of before. Maybe it's just me, but I was not too thrilled with this new CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is soul?","review":"Sounding like a somewhat less overwrought Whitney or Celine, Toni Braxton delivers a mildly-interesting 48 minutes of silky pop-funk. The almost-relentless mid-tempo groove,however, soon turns to plodding, and the weak lyrics quickly grate. Only Braxton's vocal performance and the seductive production work move it up a star. Never settle for mediocrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much Formula","review":"When Toni Braxton First came out it Looked Like She was Gonna Be a Force.Problem on the First Album is The same with this one&The 2nd disc.Too Much Formula.A Couple Good Uptempo Songs&The Rest is Sappy.Her Music doesn't go with her Image.it Shouldn't take 4 years for this.Dark Child Rodney Jerkins does Her Justice on He Wasn't Man Enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Heat, No Fire","review":"Toni Braxton has her own special brand of schlock R&B, not that it's good, mind you, but it does sound a little different from the undifferentiated legions of wanna be divas out there. It's sort of like slowed down fast music, with crackley vocals. The Spanish guitar in \`Spanish Guitar' was good, although the song is marred by the presence of, well, Toni Braxton."},{"rating":"1","title":"TONI'S HEAT IS TOO COLD.","review":"Toni Braxtons latest effort \\"The Heat\\" is her weakest album to date.The only standout song is the first single \\"He Wasn't Man Enough\\" which I think is still a weak song to say the least, from earlier efforts.The rest of the songs are just a mish mash of R & B \\"I have heard this before\\" ballads, and mid-tempo songs that have no standout potential.Always Braxton is in fine vocal form, but whatever she does she can't turn this piece of coal into a diamond.Unfortunately I think because she lent a writing hand to 75% of this CD, and in my own opinion I don't think Braxton is a songwriter.She should do like Janet Jackson does and have Terry Lewis & Jimmy Jam do their job, and if the artist has some input then fine.Braxton is a singer, and what a beautiful voice she has, but she is not a songwriter which drops this album to just a average run of the mill piece of dribble.A disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toni Toni Toni What happened .......","review":"I loved Secrets, and her debut album had Breathe Again, and Seven Whole Days, and I know times change, but except for \\" He Wasn't man Enough\\", which i don't really like ( but it is Toni Braxton .. have you seen the video...

She has such a sultry sexy voice sets the tone from the beginning.There are a few up beat songs on this as well and I think it was made popular from the single \\"Just be a Man about it\\" as well as \\"He wasn't man enough for me\\" but it's a all around good CD.Respectfully Reviewed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"This album is great. If you are in to relaxing or slow music, this is good.There are a few song that are fast,like Gimme Some ft.

The material, as well as the vocals, could not even come close to that of her last CD, \\"Secrets\\". I have been a Toni Braxton fan since day one, but somewhere along the way, we lost Toni! It seems to me that she spends so much time trying to be so GRAND & a whole bunch of other things that she's not, that the Toni we all loved is GONE! I don't even enjoy her stage performances anymore. She just seems so fake & phony. You'all should have left a good thing the way it was. LaFace, I suggest you spend more time promoting CD's that are worth a person's hard earned money! A perfect example is \\"Shanice\\", her last CD was awesome! And well worth every penny! As far as \\"The Heat\\", I want my money back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She Is Hott!","review":"let me say toni toni toni this album is da bomb! wit slow jams (im still breathing) and upbeat club hits like (he wasnt man enough)make this album her best ever! with her sister Tamar in the biz now she better watch out coz' she got some competition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album will incraese your heat !","review":"Toni Braxton's 3rd solo-album is a sign of a powerful return. She continues to be one of the leading stars of R&B. The most romantic track of the album \\"Spanish Guitar\\" and the 1st single \\"He wasn't man enough for me\\" are the most successful songs. If you have liked her previous album \\"Secrets\\", probably you'll enjoy \\"The Heat\\" too. Buy it now not to regret later :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good CD!","review":"It sounds like Toni is trying to be something she isn't - too hip hop - not very original - seems to be taking the same course as Whitney Houston - predictable - boring and trying to be hip - bring the old Toni back (without the whinning love songs!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waist your money unless....","review":"i don't know about you, but when i heard \\"he wasn't man enough for me\\" i thought the rest of the album would be just as good if not better, and that at list there will be some tracks which will be \\"single honored\\", but...

Then came 'Breathe Again' her most beautiful song ever, but some songs on this new CD equal the greatness of her earlier ones. Take the first song 'He Wasn't Man Enough'. This song rocks, she conveys a sense of pain and longing, exactly what 'Another Sad Love Song' was all about. 'Spanish Guitar' follows in the footsteps of 'Breathe Again' and 'Un-Break My Heart' in their incredible vocal beauty. Her voice is in top form on this CD. 'Just Be A Man About It' is great as is 'I'm Still Breathing'. The standout? I think it would have to be 'Fairy Tale' because it is just so damn beautiful! Like 'How Could An Angel Break My Heart' from Secrets. I like the fact that she wrote many of her own songs on this CD, 7 in fact out of the 12. She is growing into a wonderful lady of soul, and this CD reflects just that. Four out of Five."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"I didn't think she could top Secrets, but the Rodney Jerkins produced He Wasn't Man Enough won me over, it was a perfect Spring/Summer single and he is an AMAZING music producer, great choice Toni. I expected more tracks like that on the album, but with the exception of the track featuring left eye, the rest turned out to be slow jams, though very good ones. The Heat was perfect to listen to at the beach, as well as Spanish Guitar(though it sounds like Unbreak my Heart part 2), Just Be a Man About It was a song with a common situation, anda the Art of Love was a beautiful, instrumental jazz-flavoured piece. If you like good r&b/soul music, get this album.

These two songs could be a retake of \\"Unbreak My Heart\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toni Braxton's WORST work!","review":"I have been waiting for Toni to come back with a new album, because her last album ''Secrets'' was the best album of 1996. But when I bought this cd today I was so upset because this album had only 3 slow songs, and all the rest of the songs were fast and had no meaning. The slow songs on this album make Toni's voice sound flat and bad, and the fast ones..well, there is to much beat you can't even hear Toni sing. I miss the old Toni Braxton...what happend to her, it seems like Toni wanted to get popular with teenagers on this album bringing in Dr.Dre and Lisa from Tlc..to rap! Please toni RAP music is not your thing, you have always been popular with adult's..but now you have let them down...Toni I wish you luck..but this album was your worst..take some voice training and focus on your ballads...Ballads are what made you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yucks!","review":"This is probably the worst pop music CD I've ever heard so far. Perhaps my exposure to such weird music genre is not enough or perhaps I just prefer the refreshing Classical music more.....Firstly, the singer's voice is so loooooowwww, to me, it spoils the overall appeal of the CD. I was expecting a much higher-pitched voice, think i'm more used to it.Secondly, the music is absolutely monotonous and has a dull melody line. All I could hear was the same old few notes being sung over and over again and the range of notes was never well explored. I suppose it's more suited for being a lullaby....Also, the lyrics can't be deciphered, there's not enough publicity , the singer lacks the sweet looks of Britney. The CD seems to give me a devillish feeling.I sincerely apologise if I was too critical and harsh. However, this review is just to let u pple know there's someone out there who doesn't really go for such stuff....

A dancable beat and creative theme. Not often do you hear the ex-girlfriend warning you about the dog you're currently dating. \\"Spanish Guitar\\" is pure seduction. \\"Be a Man about It.\\" Could have used more rhythm but what this song really needs is to get rid of the guy who's talking through out the entire song. With the exception of \\"Still Breathing\\" the rest of the CD wasn't worth a second listen and in parts made the first listen difficult. Her upbeats songs were so watered down that they were hard to distinguish fram the ballads. And she lacks the vocal impact of her first album. Even her heart felt ballads sound more whinny than passionate. My advise, pass on THE HEAT and just wait for the songs to come on the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BANCRUPCY FAME","review":"I think this album is the bomb. Nobody can sing like Toni Braxton.

The definite highlights of the album are I'm still breathing, Fairytale, Spanish guitar, Never just for a ring, Maybe, The Heat, He wasn't man enough and Just be a man about it. The definite lows were The Art of love, Gimme Some, Speaking in Tongues and definitely You've been wrong. On the whole the album was enjoyable although she could have done better by sticking to more of Diane Warren and Babyface's stuff. A bit hurried maybe?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toni's comeback album","review":"TOni Braxton was one of the premier R&B; divas! Her sultry low alto voice entranced and soothed many listeners. She crossed to pop, jazz, adult contemprary, and of course R&B.; Although Secrets is her BEST work to date, her albums are always quality.THe Heat was Toni's comback album that brought her back in a big way thanks to her single He wasn't man enough(best song on the album).Toni brings some new elements this time around instead of her trademark ballads and steamy mid tempo jams. Although she still brings them... they don't quite have the umph that Secrets did.However, that doesn't mean her album isn't good, infact its very good. Secrets to me is a very high standard to live up to. He wasn't man enough, Just be a man about it, Never just for a ring, and Gimme some are stand outs.Toni Braxton is at her best when with Babyface (only one song here) or running the emotional gamut of heartache and pain and for the most part she doesn't disappoint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Heat","review":"I remember this album when I was in the 7th grade. I love this album and I bought it based on the success of the single He Wasn't Man Enough and that the album was successful. The Heat showcases her creative growth and her expansion into songwriting and production. The album explores the themes of love,passion and romance from the standpoint of a young woman dealing with the realities of life in the 21st century. The Heat adds a very personal stamp to the album. This album has been certified 2x Platinum. Remember,this was 2000."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ready for Prime Time","review":"As a historian of the IWW, I bought this title hoping for something new and insightful. While the presentation is new, it really suggests what Henry Adams referred to as the devolution of America. The real IWW did some interesting things with the graphic arts -- none of which are cited or displayed by the author. While portrayed as a serious history, this is truly a comic book posing as history. I would not buy it again/"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh!","review":"I just couldn't get into this book. I usually finish a book once I crack it open, and I really tried with this one but it was a no-go.SEP is one of my favorite writers for her fun, witty books. I guess that was what I missed here - there wasn't much fun. The story had angst and wrong choices gone really bad. Sure, eventually there's a happy ending with the right guy, but the journey was pretty much of a downer. Again, I look to SEP for fun and wit."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were you thinking SEP??","review":"I have to admit Susan Elizabeth Phillips is my all time favorite author. With that being said, I will NOT recommend this book to anyone. It is almost as if another author wrote the book. It's not a romance. It left you feeling crappy and almost upset. Don't waste your time with this book. Read Ain't She Sweet or Dream A Little Dream, those books won't disappoint you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointed","review":"I've read all SEP other books and once I started one, I could not put it down. But this one, I had to make myself keep reading in hope that it would get better. According to my Kindle, I was over 65% through the book before it seemed that SEP came to the party! The female lead was a doormat for most of the book and the male lead should have been on medication. The research was good, very tedious and boring to read through. SEP books have always been entertaining and funny, with fun characters...these characters seemed to have a heavy veil over them, and you had to wait and wait for them to be seen. I suppose SEP was trying something different, but I think it fell flat. Sorry, cannot recommend this to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book - Fast Read","review":"As usual, this author produced a great book that's compelling, with characters you care about.

Especially since I really enjoyed SEP's other books like First Lady and Kiss An Angel. Her writing style is definately different with Hot Shot. It is more factual and there wasn't enough humour in it to hold my attention for long. It took me three days to finish the book when I usually can finish SEP's books in one day. That's how boring it was!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a must read","review":"If you love SE Phillips' later works, this is not the book for you.

And I had to give it up half way through it as a good gesture to myself! I think you've got to be terminally bored to stick to it till the end. The characters are so flimsy, the plot line so unimaginative, it is not worth the while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the SEP I'm used to reading","review":"Hot Shot is an interesting book. However, if you are looking for a funny romantic novel, this isn't it. I would not even categorize Hot Shot as a romance novel. It's a book about a woman's journey to self awareness and self appreciation. The romance is secondary to the story.It's obvious that SEP put a lot of effort into researching the back story, and I really wanted to like this book. However, I thought there were too many characters and side-stories, disrupting the pace of the book. I've read over 10 of SEP's novels and this is the first one I did not really enjoy.With that said, this book is still better than some of the formulaic romance novels out there. I wavered back and forth between giving this book 2 or 3 stars. I gave it 2 stars because I didn't find the story compellinge enough, and it took me awhile to get through the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough Read....Boring!","review":"After reading most of her books in one night, I forced myself to finish this one, hoping it would pick up. It didn't. I am not a romance book reader by nature, but found her other books hard to resist. I have read all of her books in less than two weeks.

The orchestral accompaniment and solos from the Berlin Philharmonic are as perfect as you would expect. Tempos are somewhat broad but not sluggish; Barenboim gives the music enough room to breathe without being indulgent. The sound is excellent; it is a live performance, but other than some shuffling in the audience between the first and second movement and brief applause at the end you won't notice it.I'd rarely recommend a disc with a 38 minute playing time, but when it's a piece and a performance like this (or Brahms' 4th symphony with Kleiber and Vienna), who could complain?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Ceases to Disappoint","review":"This product shoots a concentrated stream of steam at a small space.

I am trying to find out the dates of the examples given, as it seems that they were all taken from operas performed, mostly in New York, probably in the early days of Domingo's career. It is enthralling to hear the appreciative applause for tenor arias which possess all the exuberance and joy in performing which are frequently only heard in youthful artists- and what fine singing in most of the exerpts chosen. How the other reviewer can be so unappreciative I cannot imagine, as I was most impressed with the choice of music and would recommend this CD to all lovers of opera,and in particular admirers of tenor arias."},{"rating":"1","title":"If there were an option for no stars . . .","review":"Save your money and your time. I recommend leaving this potshot at the Native American non-fiction genre in the pile of unread books next to the rest of the myth-and-legend creation stories written and edited by \\"white\\" authors where it belongs. The problem is not Fuller's overambitious and sometimes nonsensical prose, the lack of basic evidence to support much of what he deems factual within the text itself, or the fact that Fuller himself presents fuzzy portrait of the man he is trying to recognize. The words of Yellowhorse himself are absent from this book; in that emptiness, there is little left that furthers the recognition of the integrity of Native Peoples in history, aside from that which has been outlined being of great importance in conventional, non-Native society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swenson Coloratura?","review":"WHEN ARE WE EVER GOING TO HEAR THE BEAUTY OF THE HUMAN VOICE?

Install is very quick - it only took 4 screws and about 5 minutes. I used the adhesive backing to get the tray on the wall, ran in about 6-7 cables and then 4 sheetrock screws later I was done.The only thing I'd change about it would be to have the actual cover snap onto the tray instead of requiring the Y-looking spread ends to hold the cover in place. If that was the case, it would be completely drill-free and perfect. It's a small gripe though, because the covers look great and very professional, and the end result is nice and tidy.

Though that may seem like a happy ending, Clegg doesn't rely on the predictable to complete his tale, which I really love. The book is appropriate for younger readers, those who would appreciate Poe or maybe even Twilight Zone. It's a novella and can easily be read in a couple of hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not what I ordered, I recived Mr. Englers other Book","review":"The Book I recieved was definitly not the Book advertised.

Throughout the novel, the author (Mette Newth) utilizes light imagery to foretell the events of the story. The title, \\"The Dark Light,\\" is a blatent contradiction. Tora's life is also a contradiction. Although she leads a life that would be perceived as hopeless by many, she manages to find success and beauty. The success comes from her mastery of reading, and the beauty comes from the friendships that she cherishes as she resides within the horrid conditions of St. Jorgen's hospital. There, she cares for other lepers in order to pay for her stay. Tora finds her spiritual answers toward the final point of her death as the spirits of her mother and her two best friends answer her question \\"Does God exist?\\" They inform Tora that man creates his own gods; the answers of life lies within each of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stupidisco ~ Junior Jack","review":"Stupidisco~ Junior Jack is a great dance track with a great refrain good beats, sounds and a great feel.

It's impossible to tell if the underlying extract of the opera (i.e. the story) was supposed to be joyful, sad, pathetic, light, dramatic, with anger etc. Her style is uniform: heavy and dramatic. She does not get into the personality of her characters or at least cannot convey them. Her tone is always a bit too low and almost manly sometimes, the airs stay stuck in her throat, her voice is stuffed.Probably a question of taste, I guess I prefer clean, limpid and cristal clear voices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Emotion","review":"This is one of the best that I've ever listenned to.

Admittedly, for some this may seem like quibbling, but for those wanting to invest the money and time to listen to this otherwise exemplary audio production, it is a mistake that a little checking could have easily avoided-- (even if by only watching the film, where the character's name is, of course, pronounced correctly)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only by Nadja!","review":"Music lovers are not ambivalent about Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg. You either love her for her passion and commitment, or hate her because it appears to be histrionic. I'm definitely in the first camp. Only Nadja can play Sibelius like this.It is the most amazing recording of this concerto I know. The way she plays the second subject of the first movement alone is worth the price of the CD. There is an expression of total anguish coming through here that you'll find on no other recording. It is so easy in this piece to be blown away by how any of the top violinists play the bravura passages. It is in the slower passages that, in this recording, Ms. Salerno-Sonnenberg sets herself head and shoulders above all the rest. The adagio is one of those incredible intersections of time, soloist, orchestra, and conductor that happens but rarely, where everything is just exactly right. You just have to hear it to believe it (and you should)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Working hard to stay in the spotlight","review":"Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg was featured on 60 Minutes as the untrammeled artist who couldn't be stopped, the underdog who swooned and swayed onstage, lost in her expressive rapture. That's what her fans expect, and she more or less lives up to the image here. This is very wayward playing, in which the soloist bends over backwards to keep the spotlight on herself. As a result of ignoring the composer, the score is pulled around like taffy.Perhaps this is the new romanticism, and I would be thrilled if NSS's ideas were fascinating. But on the whole she swoops and exaggerates for no other purpose than ego display. There are breathless pauses and sudden leaps of excitement that make no sense. Tilson Thomas plays along by forgetting the tempo and waiting for his soloist to get through her next stunt.It's funny, because I am all in favor of NSS's shtick about artistic freedom, but this junky Sibelius concerto is her personal trip, pure and simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took my back to my childhood...","review":"This little tome took me back to my childhood memories of my parents, my mother in particular, telling me the do's and don'ts.

Why on earth does this cost this much when I can buy a CD-R for less than a dime! This seems excessive even accounting for the artist to make money on his recorded work!

Scarcely anything that could be considered objectionable by anyone willing to accept nude photography. Most of the photos date from 1996-2000, (one '83 and one '95),and are generally of girls or young women mostly nude but a few photos of clothed people. I liked the way Sturges handles light in almost all of his photos, composition did seem a little stilted to me in a few of them. I think it's great that he was able to use the same subjects over the years, obviously the man can get along with people. The color photos were welcome, showing the man is willing to vary his medium and well capable of doing so. One improvement over his last, self titled, book is the inclusion of his subject's name,location and date on the opposite page, much easier to follow than a separate sheet as that last book was presented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not So \\"New Work\\"","review":"Jock Sturges' current book, entitled 'New Work' would be better entitled 'Latest Work'. There is nothing really new here apart from a small number of photographs in color. This is Sturges as we have come to know and admire him, although the work itself seems less inspired than previous efforts. The book however shows the total commitment of the publisher. It is wonderfully designed, the pages are in a VERY large format and the photographs are reproduced wonderfully with exceptional tonalities. Some of the problems with his earlier books with photos crossing the fold are absent here. Sturges deserves such treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"It's wonderful to see a modern master overcome adversity and continue his art. This book shows maturity and change in Sturges painterly sense of composition and form. The sheer size of the volume (larger then his others) I think shows his willingness to grow and develop.

All the character does is \\"drink all day and smoke\\". He seems to have left the book awhile before returning to the ending which seemed far fetched and absurd. Other stories in here include boring cliched type horror stuff that isnt really stimulating. This book would have been good if I was 14 but now it is just average."},{"rating":"1","title":"MEDIOCRE AT BEST","review":"I hate to go against the grain here but I found this book to be mediocre at best.It started out decent and I especially like the attitude of the main character, but the ending was a huge disappointment. I believe it could have had a much better ending in keeping with the general tone of the rest of the book.The last half of the book had me confused until I figured out that it had nothing to do with the first part. As I haven't read any other books by this author, I thought maybe my copy was a misprint.If I had it to do again, I wouldn't wast my money. My advice is to save the money on the book and if you just have to know the story, go see the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't my cup of tea","review":"I must say that I went into this expecting it to be more like the movie but better. I didn't know it was basically a short story. This book short story whatever you would consider it was all over the place. It went from being a vampire survival story, to a medical/scientific discovery. The main character seems to be two totally different people as the story unfolds. once the climax comes and it seems you may finally get some really meat from this story it comes to an abrupt end. To me the script writers did an amazing for the movie taking what little the author have them and expanding it into a passable story. The movie wasn't amazing but was much more plausible than the random thoughts that were jotted down and called a book. Just my opinion"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good!","review":"This book really showed very little imagination. Having seen the movie I really expected more. \\"Hats off\\" to whoeverhad the vision to adapt this to the screen. There were very few surprises and too many contradictions. Having been a long time fan of the genre I know that you can't over think, but even the basic suppositions of this book had gapingholes in it. I personally need someone to root, for or at least identify with and from the beginning I didn't carewhether the main character lived or died. It was a complete waste of time but having invested in the book I completed the transaction but should not have thrown good time after bad money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An exploration of vampire myths","review":"I liked this book but i listened to it on audio and it isn't very long. I think the story could have become broader and the story could have been longer. Also, i think there are segments of the story that were not totally explored, such as the vampire virus where it came from etc. Overall it was a good classic vampire story especially for the time it was written in , i believe it was copyrighted in 1954."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legendary!","review":"I have to confess right away, I have yet to read the other stories in this edition of Matheson's classic. I rushed to finish I AM LEGEND to review it Fri the 13th:). The plot of the title story is deceptively simple. Robert Neville is the last human in a plague struck earth. The rest of the population have become vampires.Matheson writes an incredibly exciting and compelling tale of vampirism. The action is continous throughout the short novel, and he offers alternative theories to the mythology. I still lay awake 48 hours after finishing it that is testament to how spooky the atmosphere permeating this story is, and I am a jaded horror reader. There is little gore in Matheson's horror, but great suspense/paranoia and a chilling climate compelling readers' to turn pages at furious page until the superb ending.This novel is a must read for fans of the Vampire sub-genre horror fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"$14 for a short story","review":"$14 for a short story. Too much. I didn't realize until i purchased the book that the book contains several short stories, one of which is I am legend. Cashing in on the impending film?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Classic","review":"Classic vampire/zombie/end of civilization book. Matheson influenced many of today's horror authors. A simply outstanding story and fun to read. I recommend you add this to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better than the movie","review":"Now, I love Will Smith as much as the next gal, but this book was soooo better! It made me cry a few times and the ending was unexpected. It's still relevant today even though it was wrote in the 70s. Definitely a good read if you like sci-fi/disaster/zombie type stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read all of the book","review":"Obviously, the main story is why most folks buy the book, but I highly recommend that you give the other shorter stories a try also. I guarantee that they will stick with you. The fetish doll story is a classic and my personal favorite was 'Witch War', a three page story that still haunts me! Oh yes, 'I am Legend' is a great story, but don't forget the rest of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't seen the movie, but I know the book is better.","review":"I decided to read the book after an online acquaintance told me about it. It's a really excellent read, with biology added in for effect. The reader follows the Robert Neville's psychological torment from being the last human alive. The book cannot be put down until the final scene. And even then the final scene must be read twice. The effect is that good. And it's nice to read a story about vampires that's not a pretty, rainbow and butterflies love story ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A defining vampire novel","review":"I just finished reading this book and was completely blown away by Matheson's gripping story of a man living in a post-apocalyptic vampire-infested world. I'm almost afraid to see the movie now, because I generally feel that the book is better than the movie. This is probably one of the best novels I've ever read.As an aside, a few of his short stories were published with this novel and I found one of them, \\"Prey,\\" to be the basis for the 1975 television horror movie, \\"Trilogy of Terror\\" which gave me nightmares for a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only Modern Vampire novel","review":"This is the only vampire novel I've found that brings the myth into the modern world, not only through science-fiction science, but with the modern state of politics and society. As such, it is viscerally terrifying, not distanced and picturesque like current books still stuck in the 19th century (time and place or attitude). The suspense does wane at the end, but this is a satisfying book to read and re-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than movie","review":"The movie was pointless. And it missed the point. This story is engaging and explores a lot more of the character. And makes way more sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Time","review":"I read in a review that this was the book that inspired Stephen King to write horror..so, of course, I ran to the library to check this bad boy out...I loved it! Your heart goes out to the main character Robert Neville. Imagine being the only one to survive the plague. A plague that has turned everyone into vampires. The vampires' lures and taunts became a part of his everyday life.....while he struggles with justifying reasons why he should keep on fighting if he's the only human left.After years of holing himself in his house at night, (complete with soundproof walls to block the vampires' screams), and slaying vampires during the day, he meets a woman. And together they fight to stay alive....With a twist at the end that you wouldn't believe...this is definetely worth the time...The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that it was so short...it left me wanting more.....which is not a bad thing....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over Anne Rice, here is the real vampire story","review":"Richard Matheson can really keep a reader in the seat, or under the covers frightened of what may be lunking in the dark. I Am Legend made me think twice about going outside alone at night. The most interesting thing about the book, however, is the science behind the vampires. No doubt Matheson did extensive research to come to his conclusions. This made for a very good read. Everything that Anne Rice and other vampire authors neglect to explain is written here in black and white. Great book! It kept me from sleeping soundly..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Classic Vampire Story!","review":"This is a classic novel. One of the best vampire survival stories I have ever read. The terror that you feel for the last survivor of the human race is incomparable. I loved it.Basically the story is about the last man who has survived on the Earth while vampires have taken over. As the story winds down, the ending is one of the best you can get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as ordered","review":"Purchased as a replacement for a damaged library book. Found by searching ISBN number and got the exact edition that the library wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy and Fun","review":"What a fantastically bleak tale. I decided to read this after seeing previews for the movie. Of course, the book is always better than the movie, so why not read what all the hype is about before seeing Will Smith present it. Just from seeing previews, I could discern a number of differences between the movie and the book, but that didn't stop me from enjoying this great story.Robert Neville is a survivor, the last human among a world of plague-ridden vampires. You probably know the story already, so let me emphasize the mood. Matheson creates circumstances that are so believable and an atmosphere that is so gripping that I felt like I was surviving right along with Neville. As I watched Neville evolve in his situation, I wanted to cheer him on and encourage him not to give up. This book was so masterfully written, it's no wonder it inspired the likes of Stephen King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horror fan","review":"I am a huge horror fan, but that being said this is my favorite of them all. It is the most amazing books I've read and believe me I've read thousands. I love this book because of the meaning behind it. Needless to say if you haven't read it and your looking for something that will make a profound impact on your thinking read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stories","review":"As expected, \\"I Am Legend\\" was not like the movie. It was a little confusing (living vampires? dead vampires?), but was still thought-provoking. The other short stories in the volume were a little dated, but still good stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great post-apocalyptic novel","review":"I am Legend was made into 3 movies, Vincent Price's \\"The Last Man on Earth\\", the Charlton Heston film \\"Omega Man\\" and the Will Smith film \\"I am Legend\\". Each of these movies are superb, yet the novel is different and better.The story is set in a post apocalyptic world and tells about Robert Neville, the last survivor of a mutant virus that turned all humans into evil vampires. Neville fights with depression as he deals with being alone, and is haunted by the vampires from outside his fortified home. Over several years, Neville kills the vampires in the day as they sleep. He experiments with different methods in repelling and killing vampires. A surprise ending, that pleases the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Read","review":"This book was a new way to look at vampires. It was very well written and I thought the concept was great. What a great ending! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am Legend: Ground breaking book.","review":"It's really hard to believe this book was written in the 50's. You can clearly see where modern post apocalyptic books/movies are getting their ideas from. I am Legend is very well written, the author does a very good job of placing you in the mindset of the main character Robert Neville. If you enjoy all of the similar books/movies that have been released recently, you will most likely appreciate this book.-Graf Exum"},{"rating":"2","title":"Portrait of Despair","review":"Drag your soul through the mud. One of the most compeling and disturbing books I've ever read. Not for the suicidal or depressed. Matheson creates a castaway without hope of rescue, a protaganist whose suicide would seem a victory. This is not your father's horror novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic Horror","review":"It inspired NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. It changed the way we see vampires (no longer counts in castles), and practically invented zombies (no longer voodoo victims). It even made a young Stephen King pick up a pencil and begin scrawling out horror stories.I AM LEGEND is without a doubt one of the most powerful, influential and important horror tales ever woven. Like Stoker, Poe, Bierce, Shelley, Lovecraft and Stevenson, Matheson's work is mandatory reading for any true fan of dark literature. No movie could ever (despite two attempts so far) capture the brillant terror of this book, and no other books by Matheson, although all of them are excellent (Hell House, 7 Steps to Midnight, ect.), are as good as this one. It is more then worth the money, for it is a book you will read more then twice!If you enjoy King, Clive Barker, Poppy Z. Brite, William Peter Blatty or Ramsey Campbell, you will shriek for Matheson,... and vice versa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa","review":"i found this old weird looking 1950's paperback of my dad's and read it, it was getting on in the day, and reading this book as the sunset neared, i grew very edgy. i was alone in my sister's apartment reading about this unbelievable world and setting. i just can't believe how mattheson can write cliffhangers, my favorite part was him describing the protanganist's favorite hobby was looking for his undead neighbor to kill him. also amazing when the protaganist was experimenting with killing the undead and he realizes his watch had stopped.... jesus just the best. my commentary doesn't do it justice, but he painted a mood so hopeless and dreary..... i will leave it at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Am Legend","review":"I'm not sure how I heard about this book, but I sure love the title. It's intriguing. So I read the novella about the last man left on Earth who fights vampires every night, and really enjoyed it. I enjoy reading Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles, the series includes some of my all-time favorite novels, and I Am Legend, although much different, was effective at creating an atmosphere of dread and despair. The title comes into play on the very last page if I remember correctly, and the ending has stuck with me since I read the story a few months ago.Matheson's story is similar to a Stephen King story, and it is interesting to see how the main character survives every day in an empty world inhabited by vampires. I don't want to supply any plot spoilers, but the ending is fantastic, yet eery. Anyway, if you like vampires and a decent tale, then give it a try. Oh, the short stories included with the story are just OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for a vampire fan.","review":"I grew up look and reading anything about vampires.One night I saw a movie on tv title the omega man. I loved this movie. I found out that this movie was taken from the book I am legend. I had to find this book. I found the book at the age of 39. The book takes you into the life of the last man on earth. The last normal man for everyone else are vampires.The book take you on a ride into the mind and will of the last man on earth. This is a must read for a true vampire fan,and for fans of a good book.Anyone who thinks that they know the story from the omega man,and will not read the book are missing the story altogether. The movie can not touch the book in anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book misrepresented as a full novel!","review":"Although the title story of this book was good enough, it left me deeply disappointed when I reached the end (after only 170 pages!) On no spot, except a small area on the back cover (which many readers avoid to prevent spoilers) does it state that this is not a full novel, but an anthology of short stories. I felt especially sore after investing my twelve dollars on this softcover collection. I will not say that \\"I am Legend\\" was not a good story in and of itself, but when a reader anticipates another several hundred pages and turns the page and realizes the story had already ended, there is a sense of being cheated. Praise for the author's \\"short story\\", but shame on the publisher for misrepresenting it's product and tricking the consumer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out well, but fades, and drops away.","review":"I purchased this book/short story in anticipation of the upcoming Movie. Generally i like to read the book first, because most of the time, they are different, and the book is usually far better.This remains to be seen in this case. I cannot recommend this book, it starts out good, and it feels like it will build to a natural climax, but it does not, it kinda just fades away, and ends.I really hope the movie isn't the same. I paid $14 for this, and i'm disappointed. 170 pages is the short story, then the rest of the 300 and something pages is alternate stories. Don't be fooled at the size of the book itself! Off to ebay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"This book is not at all like the movie that was released with Will Smith. It instantly pulls you in, alternating between the struggles Neville must face psychologically as well as physically it goes deeper into the Horror genre than just running scarred. He has to accept who he must become in order to live in this bleak new future. New plot elements are introduced in such a way as to keep you on the edge of your seat, hopeing and praying that Robert Neville will find the peace he needs to somehow be happy again. In the end, I was completely surprised by what happened.This book is a whole new adventure from the movie and is far better in my opinion. It is not very long and very enjoyable. I highly recommend it to anyone who is even remotely a fan of psychological fiction, horror, zombies, vampires, post-apocalyptic future, etc.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it in one day","review":"Sometimes I have a hard time getting into the classics, but this one was the easiest thing to get into. I was surprised to see the book was very different from the Will Smith movie, but I loved this version too.A superb book, filled with such powerful emotions when pondering the existence of humans.Yes, this book is Legend.5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book - DON'T READ ANY MORE REVIEWS FURTHER ON!","review":"Great book - genuine masterpiece of SF and horror.However, don't read any more reviews as half of the reviewers seem to think that a review consists on revealing all of the plot (including twists) and will definitely spoil your enjoyment of this book.The only plot a person can reveal without spoiling it is the stuff that's in the blurb (the bit on the back cover). If you want to know what the book is about then go read it! The only people who won't like it are the people who think that Freddy Kreuger is the pinnacle of intellectual horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"old books are the best ones!","review":"I really loved the movie with Will Smith, but this book (as all books usually do) blew it away! i loved the twists and each step Robert took especially psychologically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I Know Why it's a Classic","review":"I decided to read this book because it's a classic in the genre, it basically gave form to the modern zombie. Although the word vampire is used in this book, and aspects of vampire lore (garlic, crosses, etc..), the behavior of the \\"afflicted\\" is really what later characterizes the zombie.The author's writing is superb, he creates great vivid imagery and you really get inside the mind of the main character, Robert Neville. Since I felt I knew the character so well I found it hard to put down the book. How can he survive alone in a world where everyone else seems to be infected and wanting eat his flesh and drink his blood? How long can he stay boarded up in his house while the \\"vampires\\" try to break in night after night?When you have finished the book you will understand the meaning of the title, and the real meaning of the book. For fans of horror, zombies, etc... it's a definite must. If not just for its historical value in the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the fuss","review":"I eagerly anticipated this book and I have to honestly say that I hated it. Nothing ever really happened in the story and the ending seemed imcomplete to me. What a disappointment. If you want to read good vampire related material, try the Anita Blake series"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great first half, terrible second half!","review":"The first half of this book was very engrossing. I don't even know what to say about the second half...I would love it if someone could explain to me what the heck it was about!! I hated the last half of this book...it made no sense. I just kept thinking that it would all come together and make sense at some point, and it never did. Thankfully, the movie was very different from the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy, Awesome story","review":"Richard Matheson's style phenomenal. I picked up this book looking for a good vampire book, and got way more than that. The story is absolutely fantastic. The characters are very deep and are constantly developing. A deep look into all the emotions somebody would go thru being a complete outcast, last man on earth. Lots of cool stuff, very complete and full. Hits on all the emotions a book like this should. Very well written.Robert Deville is the last man on earth, everyone else is vampires. He holes up in his house during the day, drinking, listening to music, trying to stay sane. At night these vampires come out and beat upon his house, thirsty as hell for his blood.I would definatly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read.Exciting, dark, terrifying, classic =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!!!!!","review":"If you see this BEFORE you purchase (wish I had done some checking before I purchased...) be advised the \\"I am Legend\\" story encompasses about half the boook's size...the remainder is a series of very (VERY) short stories that are completely and totally unrelated to the title of the \\"book\\", as well as to each other. I learned after the fact that I was not the only one to be completely confused while my brain was trying to make the leap from the main story to what I had waded into after finishing \\"I am Legend.\\" The title story itself was ok, however, had I realized I was paying for such a tiny little read I would have left it on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo","review":"Ending sucks so boo on you and the book though what dream as may come was absolutely awesome so yeah"},{"rating":"1","title":"A deceiving title","review":"I know that not all movies are gonna resemble the book. Sometimes the movie is far from the book. This book is far far far from the movie. I dont know how they made a movie from this book but it's 100% different. And there are all these different stories that have nothing to do with what I am Legend was supposed to be about. There is nothing that states there are different stories mixed in which I may also add make no sense. I wish I could return this, it was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"has little in common with the film","review":"I wasn't a big fan of the movie, which I saw first, but this book was even less noteworthy. Some broad themes were used by the film but it ended there. Mostly a vampire book so if you are into that, perhaps it is worth a look. Otherwise, don't waste your time. Not science fiction by any stretch of the imagination. I found the writing tedious, the pacing glacial and ending a disappointment. Thank goodness I got this as a Kindle book for 99 cents. Even that may have been too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck!","review":"this book did not intrest me at all!Yeah it was scary but not the good kindof scare if you know what I mean.I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie way better then book","review":"not too many times I can say a movie was better than the book - this is one of those times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Twilight Zone\`","review":"I don't know how much more I can say that others haven't already said. \\"I Am Legend,\\" and the short stories in this collection, all remind me of the classic \\"Twilight Zones,\\" with their psychological insightfulness and incredible twists. This is a must-read for those who like their horror stories on the sophisticated side."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars for the title Story - 4 stars over all","review":"What a gripping, amazingly well written story!I am Legend, is by far the best vampire story of all time. Dracula might win in name recognition, Ann Rice's popularized vampires, they all have a color of fantasy to the story. Matheson's story not only twists the story even darker by focusing on the non-vampire Neville, but sets the story in a realistic, modern (even though it was written in the 1950s!) backdrop. The effect, is that the vampires become a reality to the reader.It reads much like a diary of a shipwrecked sailor on a remote island - a Robinson Crusoe - following Neville's experiences, triumphs, isolation, and humanity. Matheson addresses quesions like what does it mean to be \\"normal\\" or \\"human\\", and Neville keeps wondering why it is that he fights to live on all by himself, against all odds.The other short stories in this book are delightfully (and disturbingly) well written, but \\"I am Legend\\" is by far the greatest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile, with a truly powerful ending","review":"I AM LEGEND is a powerful tale of one man's life in an alienated world. While seemingly an 'end of the world' novel, Matheson manages not to fall into clisché, and his story is allways powerful and centered. The book is somewhat dated, and at times maybe unclear, but those are minor points. the ending, when Matheson's tale switches, is powerful, unexpected, and touching."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Vampire story of all time.","review":"I bought this book about a year ago on a whim. I was in the mood for a little horror, and the cover looked cool, so I thought I would check it out. I was absolutely blown away. The book could really be considered more of a psychological drama than a horror story. The way Matheson sets up his world and the dramatic conflicts that face the main character, Robert Neville, is superb. I will not go into the plot of the book, since plenty of other reviewers have already done so. I will just say that I was enthralled by the book, and I had a hard time putting it down. As for the short stories that accompany this edition, I found most of them to be pretty good, especially Person to Person, and the short but funny The Funeral. Do yourself a favor and get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is a very entertaining, albeit pretty short (170pgs) book and I would recommend it to anyone that likes survival type stories.Only problem is that now I don't think the movie will be anything near how good the book was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Writing of a cailber you just don't see anymore","review":"This book was the best book I have read in a long time. It was short, but very very worth it. His writing style and vocabulary are top notch and this book keeps you glued to your seat for the whole thing. There is no way you can read this book in small bites. It's just too good. Best vampire story I have ever read. Can't wait for the movie now and I hope they make it exactly like that book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't forget the other stories.","review":"I am legend is great, propably the second best vampire novel since Dracula. I just want to mention the other (short/er) stories in this anthology. Alot of reviewers only talk about \\"I am Legend\\". I can understand that; since it is the title story and the longest story of this anthology. But, in my opinion, the story \\"Dance of the Dead\\" is far greater. It alone is worth the price of this anthology. It has the dystopian atmosphere of \\"A clockwork orange\\" and the nightmarish visual themes of the great J.G.Ballard. Only a master writer can get that mix within 17 pages (and before Anthony Burgess and J.G.Ballard)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it for the ending if for no other reason!","review":"\\"I Am Legend\\" is a horror story written in 1954. It is a founding book in what we now classify as \\"post apocalyptic\\" genre. The story revolves around Robert Neville who is a one-man army against a land filled with Vampires. In his quest to survive, we follow Robert over a three year period where he struggles with survival, depression, alcoholism, and the ever present hope that he is not the last \\"normal\\" human in the world.The book was short, but it was an engaging read that really drew me into Robert's battle for life. I felt for the guy as I learned about what happened to the world, and specifically his wife and daughter. I also felt the highs and lows Robert encountered throughout the story.The ending had one of the best closing lines I've ever read in a book. I won't spoil it for you, but I will encourage you to read the book if for nothing other than the ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Part Good, Part Bad","review":"I was interested in listening to the audio presentation of 'I Am Legend' and was not disappointed in it. The story differs greatly from the movie and it was a pleasure to hear it. The narrator of that story did a great job.However, when I got to the 'Other Stories' part of the audio book (about 4-5 disks into the 10 disk set), I found myself very disappointed by the poor narration (performed by a different narrator). I suppose some of the stories might have been ok, but like a previous reviewer, I stopped listening at about disk 7 because I couldn't stand listening to the narrator anymore ... couldn't even force myself. I've listened to a lot of audio books because I do so much driving and of the hundreds of books I've read this narrator was by far the worst. The short stories weren't Mattheson's best. I have read many of his short stories and liked others much better.My recommendation would be to find another audio version of I Am Legend that doesn't include the short stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing beats the original!","review":"The three adaptations of this book are well done but they will never be as good as the original.When the last version was produced I just had to pick up the novel. I have seen all three versions in film and enjoyed each and every one of them immensely.The novel for me was a real page turner and I could not put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO SHORT!!","review":"I didn't know it was a book of short stories!I Am Legend was too short for me~! Is that it??Half of the book was other short stories, I felt ripped off!I thought I am Legend was too simple, vampires,, snore!I will not see the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was average at best","review":"It's sad that they had to put Will Smith on the cover in order to generate interest. I'm pretty sure that the movie remake will be much different than this book. There will probably be more action and plot holes will be filled and expanded. And Smith doesn't seem like he could portray the same tortured soul from the book.Anyway, on with the book review - after all the hype I expected something better. This story has influenced a lot of authors and filmmakers so I wanted to like it. And Matheson is the guy who wrote Stir of Echoes which is one of my favorite movies. But I didn't enjoy reading this.The plot seemed to be lacking something and there were not really any characters I could relate to except maybe the dog. In fact, I might have enjoyed this better if it were from the dog's point of view rather than a misogynist drunk who somehow miraculously teaches himself bacteriology and solves the riddle of the plague all by himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"If everyone is a vampire... then what do they eat?","review":"I think fiction has to follow rules it creates. Take example the last sentence at the end of the paragraph at the back of the book.\\"How long can one man survive in a world of vampires?\\"Twist this around...\\"How long can vampires survive in a world of one man?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very unique in my experience","review":"Kind of a combination of Dawn of the Dead meets Dracula. I was so not ready for the ending I kept turning the page, like what happened. It just ends, that's it? I didn't like it at all, although I will say at times I found it disturbing. Short story material, not a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cheap. Slightly small","review":"For those who does not bother about editions, covers, special introductions, and so, I think this is definitely a great chance to buy a great book.However, it is still a bit small, which means small letters but handy on the other side.Nice purchase"},{"rating":"2","title":"BETTER THAN THE MOVIE","review":"This is a great book, and I cannot stress this enough, NOTHING LIKE THE MOVIE! You can read/see one without the other and not have anything ruined for you. I really liked this novel, the spin on vampires. Its reminiscent of a post-apoctalyptic zombie novel (one of my fav genres) and overall a great story. 4 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"chilling","review":"Wow. The style of this book is probably its best aspect, perfectly attuned to the pace of the story, showing how a man deals with a Robinson Crusoe scenario, alebit one where his neighbors and friends are the undead trying to suck his blood. I would give it five stars but I didn't like the ending, not enough of a wrap-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I don't typically read vampire novels, but when a friend tossed I Am Legend my way I gave it a shot. If this is 'one of the best vampire novels out there,' then I will never read another one. The premise of the story is looking at vampires from a biological perspective, and the author never substantively departs from that single idea. Even then, Matheson fails to make his vampires original in any sense. The book's action is weak, emotional appeals are less than compelling, and there is virtually no horror. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK at best.","review":"This book was a real letdown. I did enjoy the story but when I came to page 159 I was shocked to see that it ended. I think a lot more of the story could have been told. I looked over the entire paperback to see where it stated that it was a book of short stories. Nowhere does it state that. Even the narrative on the back cover only talks about the \\"I am Legend\\" story. I've been robbed!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and very sweet","review":"Decided to read this book after watching the trailer for the movie. I couldn't put the book down. The power of this book is that the main character development is fantastic and then the author completely shocks you with a plot change. Just when you think you know what's going on, the author surprises you. Loved the book. Just wished it was longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book!","review":"I bought this book just based on reader's reviews and found it to be a good read. It has more than just I am Legend within it and found it to be a lot more than I had bargained for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased and scared","review":"While I was doing research for a thesis article, I came across this title and heard positive reviews for its writing content and its affect on literature after its publication. I was not disappointed when I read this book. I was not a huge fan of the film, but I really wanted to try the original story to see where the film came from. I think that it can sometimes be hard to sort through a book that is completely internal and contains essentially only one character, but the thoughts and trials, and behaviors reflected in the main character, were an enthralling exploration into the human mind. The end of the film and the end of the book are completely different. Personally, I think the film should have taken more from the book. The ending was perfect and wonderfully daunting. As far as the other stories within the text, some made me very scared, some just didn't do anything for me. I would absolutely recommend this book for anyone who love science fiction and influential literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"The novella is fine, but the short stories are even better","review":"Many readers have already written fine reviews of this riveting book. While I enjoyed the novella, \\"I Am Legend,\\" and will only comment that it's look at the psychology around isolation was interesting, I was more impressed by some of the short stories in the second half of the book. I was especially glad to read \\"Prey,\\" the story about the Zuni fetish/doll that was the basis of a filmed trilogy of stories starring Karen Black sometime in the 1970s. \\"Mad House\\" was also an excellent short story that focused on an academic man's descent into madness. These ten short stories could very well have served as the foundations for some fine \\"Twilight Zone\\" episodes with their spooky, bizarre and macabre twists. While I can certainly recommend the entire book, I especially urge readers to take a closer look at the short stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the movie","review":"Excellent book that has a twist at the end. Something the recent movie version completely failed to capitalize upon among many other problems. The only negative I have with the book is that it's comes across a little dated as far as setting is concerned. That's easily overcome by the overriding arch of the story though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Vampire Novel I've Ever Read!","review":"I've read this book a total of 4 times. And I must say that once I start reading this book, I cannot put it down. It's so damn realistic that I always end up trying to imagine myself as a survivor and joining forces with Robert Neville to battle the creepy vampires. That is, until I find out we were the bad guys who needed to be terminated..."},{"rating":"2","title":"HARD TIME","review":"I have a really hard time giving a book five stars when I don't like the ending, however in this case I feel the writing is definitely worth it. As a helpless idealist, I prefer happy endings, all is well with the world, everyone good survives, all the bad guys somehow miraculously are killed, jailed, converted or cured ... Oh yeah. But somehow all the best books are more realistic, maybe because that's what life is! Oh well, guess when I need a good happy ending, I'll have to pick we a nice romance novel, but for now ... I loved this book ... all of it. Even though the ending was unexpected, or wanted (LOL), I can certainly imagine a book two with a surprise beginning! I doubt it after all these years, but you never know. Maybe Mr Matheson has one hidden somewhere that will be a surprise release someday. In any case, I loved reading all the places where the movies (3) got their beginnings. Great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"It's a very good story and quite different from the movie version. I finished it in a couple of days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome read","review":"Nice story with surprising twists, turns, and ending. Having only seen the Will Smith movie, this completely different storyline was refreshing to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story, not what I was expecting","review":"I really liked this story. It was very different from the movie, in fact, so different I think of it a a totally different one! Actually, I would like to read the version told in the Will Smith Movie. The ending was sad, and a little bit of a bummer, but I still enjoyed it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Is Legend","review":"There were some things I really loved about I Am Legend. First, it is number one on my list for most scientific books about vampires I have ever read. I was surprised to see the book was very different from the Will Smith movie, but I loved this version too. The thing I liked most about the novel (especially compared to the movie) was the ending. The events of the ending portion of I Am Legend really came out of left field for me. I wasn't expecting what happened, at all. It is very much the most important part of the novel. It leaves us with a message, questioning what we have known and what we believe. I thought it was poignant and powerful, and it certainly left me thinking.A superb book, filled with such powerful emotions when pondering the existence of humans.Yes, this book is Legend."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am the legend","review":"This is a great book that ties in with the movie it's based on.I think you should read it and enjoy.I hope you read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was OK","review":"I bought this book in anticipation of the film starring Will Smith. I must say it was a very short story. I continued on into the short stories afterward thinking I was still reading I am Legend, only to quickly realize they had nothing to do with it. I was very disappointed. I suppose I should have looked over some of the other customer reviews first.I would not have bought this had I known that merely half the book is I am Legend. I gave it 2 stars because at least what I read was interesting enough. I hope the movie is better and doesn't end the way the book did."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Feel A Tad Ripped Off","review":"I've seen the 1970's movie version called \\"The Omega Man\\" based on this story but I'd never read the original which is why I purchased this book. The story is okay... not bad. My rating is due to the fact that I assumed I was paying for a novel and instead bought a book of short stories; the first of which is \\"I Am Legend\\". There is nowhere on the cover... front, back or spine, that warns this is a collection of short stories. I rarely buy short stories. As a rule, I prefer novels and would not have bought this one had I known. Tacky way to sell books... tacky and blatantly dishonest.Richard Matheson is decent author and screenwriter but this book is merely a means to use the upcoming movie to sell a handful of mediocre short stories. Appalling way to treat his fans and consumers in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Vampire Story Ever","review":"\\"I Am Legend\\" is not to be thought of as anything other than a masterpiece. Unfortunately, I had to give the book 4 stars instead of 5 because the accompanying short stories that fill out the other half of the book aren't remotely as good. It doesn't matter though, because \\"I Am Legend\\" is just too powerful a story to pass up."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing like the movie..","review":"Usually the book is so much better than the movie, not in this case. First of all I Am Legend is a short story. The only things the movies and the book have in common are: a dog is briefly in the book and the main character's name is the same. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It had good intentions...","review":"This book is vastly different than the movie, and there's a reason. The movie producers didn't want their movie to suck. About half way through the book, the story ended, then the author started writing short stories that had nothing to do with the book.So you have this fantastic vampire story that has tested time, then suddenly BAM brick wall. After the brick wall, you have a dozen short stories about voodoo, a man who magically wins carnival games, and coming of age stories where a kid is shocked because she experiences a rave for the first time. Oh no!"},{"rating":"1","title":"reviewing the book, not the story","review":"Rather than repeat the good reviews on the story of \\"I am Legend\\" I am offering a review of the book itself. I am disappointed in the marketing ploy of this book, relying on the movie to sell the book. Nowhere on the cover, the back of the book or the inside flap does it state this is a compilation of short stories. It instead relies on the reader's interest in the movie with Will Smith to sell the book. In fact, the story itself used to sell the book is only 159 pages of the 312 page book. There are in fact 11 stories in this book. Not all of them great reads. I probably would have bought it anyway but I resent the obvious deception that this entire book was a novel of the one story, \\"I am Legend\\" and was hoping for much more. The story itself was good and well written. I will wait until the DVD is released to see the movie. I won't buy books again from TOR without researching further to find the truth about their packaging and what is actually inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Am Legend","review":"Excellent descriptive writing. Unfortunately, there is more description than plot. \\"I Am Legend\\" turns out to be more a novella than novel and the paperback contains several unrelated short stories that immediately follow. Regrettably, there are no notes that indicate this arrangement and one finds oneself wading through the short stories (also heavy on description, lean on plot) before realizing that \\"I Am Legend\\" ended many pages back."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am legend","review":"This book sucks, you read it and get to the middle of the book to be left with no sort of ending. The author then just goes off and writes a whole bunch of stupid short stories which you think are going to bring you back to the main character, but doesn't and your left feeling like you just wasted all your time reading this stupid book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!","review":"I received this book for Christmas from one of my children because I had said that the movie looked interesting and I wanted to read the book first. What I though was a 300+ page fiction thriller is a 170 page half baked silly story about vampires followed by a group of uninteresting short storied. Guess I won't bother with the movie. After reading three of the \\"short stories\\", I don't think I can even find the interest to finish the book. I'm really bummed (especially since I'm at my evening job with nothing else with me to read)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I don't like horror books","review":"This is one of only a few horror books that I have read, but I didn't think this book was good at all. Maybe it was inventive at the time it was written, but now it doesn't strike me as very clever at all. It is extremely boring for one thing. It isn't exciting, it isn't scary, it's really depressing and boring. The end is good, but even that can't make it get above a 1 star for me. I was happy the book was over (I hate to stop reading a book in the middle)."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book sucks","review":"I read this book with great anticipation and was sorely disappointed. The first half was great! The second half really sucked. The 2nd half appears to be a mish mosh of disjointed unrelated little stories. They didn't have anything to do with the story in the first half. I hope the movie is better. Don't waste your money on the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Audio Book","review":"Not so much about the content, but the item is defective.

This was the first book my book club has read and we all agreed to never read it again!Also the first time any of us has ever been able to say that the MOVIE was actually better than the book!!! lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am Legend book","review":"This book is nowhere even close to as good as the movie. I have never read a book which was made into a movie in which the movie was better than the book, until now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately not his best work...","review":"This is a story about the sole survivor of a plague that has turned the world's population into varying forms of vampires. While the idea behind the story itself is intriguing, it feels more like reading an anthropological study than a horror novel. The whole novel is filled with the protagonist repeating the same actions and his reactions to those actions over and over again.There is little in the way of plot, rather the story plods along aimlessly. Matheson may have done this intentionally to convey the protagonist's uncertainty about the past, present, and future. Nonetheless, it makes for a less than gripping read.Matheson's writing style is, at best, mediocre in this novel. I had to force myself to finish reading it. On the plus side though, it did have a good ending. If you're new to Matheson and must read something of his, pick up Hell House, a far superior novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"What took me so long?...","review":"... to read this novel? I see there are already 300+ reviews before me so I'll just say that this was an AMAZING story!! Real book lovers will want to read this sometime in thier life! The added short stories that are in this edition are very good as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary...very scary....","review":"In \\"I Am Legend\\" (which is a short novel at best) Robert Neville finds himself the only \\"human\\" in existence. By day he barricades his house with garlic and crosses and searches the barren city in his car looking for food, gasoline and other necessary things to survive. By night, he hears vampires call his name and he can see them as they try desperately to figure out how to get to him.The tension in the book is amazing. Matheson builds up the plot layer by layer and it is clear that Neville's time is running out. Still, Matheson gives you hope that maybe Robert Neville will find other humans or animals that can at least help him try to survive the emotional turmoil and fear that he lives with knowing the vampires want him dead.There are other short stories with this edition and all of them are excellent, but \\"I Am Legend\\" is an incredible vampire story and worth every second of your time to read and see the genius that is Robert Matheson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reading","review":"Good reading and interesting enough to make it a fast read. I was a littel surprised to find out that I am Legend is a short story. It is followed by many other, much shorter stories. My wife read the book too. She felt there was not a good line of demarcation between I am Legend and the following stories--so much that she was surprised and thought the book was hard to follow.I am Legend though is definitely worth the read. The character is well developed by the end and the story is hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT IS A GREAT CLASSIC SCI-FI HORROR NOVEL!","review":"IT'S AN END OF THE WORLD NOVEL WITH SOME TWISTS ABOUT VAMPIRE LEGEND.FINE HUMAN DRAMA WILL GET YOUR HEART! AVOID OTHER STUPID COMMENTS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read But Nothing Like The Movie!!","review":"Was a good read for sure but nothing like the movie at all if you watched the movie first like I did. It was so different I actually don't know if the director of the movie even read the book at all lol. Still worth reading though and was actually glad it was so different because it would have been boring if it was the same as the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"To my understanding, this book is what most modern vampire and zombie movies are based. A great ready for any fan of the genre,but yet also a great read for anyone who likes a well written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quick read!","review":"I Am Legend is a great quick read that keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for what's coming next. This is a collection of short stories, and I enjoyed I Am Legend better than the others included. This is a great imaginative twist building on vampire stories of the past. It has a much darker outlook than the movie. I think Hollywood decided it couldn't leave their audience hanging without hope. I preferred the original story to the movie, but enjoyed both.The influence that Richard Matheson had on Stephen King is apparent."},{"rating":"1","title":"high hope , big disappointment","review":"With the upcoming release of the new movie starring Will Smith, I really wanted to read this book. I saw the Omega Man starring Charlton Heston and thought it was great. But I HATED this book.I know it was written in 1954. I know it is considered a classic of horror. But that is not the reason I read today. I read to be entertained. 50 years ago I am sure it was cutting edge, but today it is slow and borderline boring.The story itself only takes up 154 pages. The remainder of the book is filled up with other short stories by the author.If you want to know what was scary back in the 50's, good luck. If you are trying to pass the time with something that is exciting and fun to read, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Has No Point","review":"This book is about a scientist who is in a heavy depression all by himself. He drinks all day and sleeps all night almost everyday for two years. He spends his days starring at naked zombie women. That is pretty much the book until the ending that is beyond stupidity, It makes the book useless. He contributed nothing in the story and somehow he is a legend. I for one have never seen a legend do nothing and then fail at everything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and misleading","review":"This book is has been misrepresented as the entire \\"I Am Legend,\\" rather than a compliation of short stories. Of course, it is my ignorance that led me to believe that I Am Legend was a novel rather than a short story.Regardless, the story starts off as an attention grabber, but it only goes downhill from there. While Matheson creates a fabulous premise for a novel, he fails to deliver a well developed literary work -- particularly with the end. It just falls flat, as if Matheson got bored and decided to cut it short.I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie, becuase most times the book has greater detail and character development, particularly when the book precedes the movie and with these such subjects. However, this time, I am hoping that Hollywood can save this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writing, almost a good book!","review":"I was given this book as a gift. I wanted to read the book before I went and saw the movie. I now hope the movie is better than the book because the book leaves a lot to be desired. I also didn't know the story would end halfway through the novel and was mildly surprised at the ending. I can't say I'm a huge fan of \\"horror\\" novels anyways, but this takes the cake for worst I've read. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I wouldn't waste my time with this novel. Its' unrealistic portrayal of the protaganist is odd even for the realm of Science Fiction. Neville's bizarre fits of sexual lust and his awful decision making leave you shaking your head. His situational awareness is like that of a chicken. Who acts this way?? He's a ridiculous person who has been given a chance no one else has, and he blows it. The scientific jargon is silly and dated to the extreme. You don't care for him at all, and if that is the point, what a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I am an avid reader; I read perhaps 3-4 novels a month. I've read dozens of horror/suspense novels from great authors like King, Koontz and Ludlum. I've also managed to find some less than impressive offerings. This however, is among the worst. I'm sure it has great literary prowess, but I found it difficult to follow and ultimately unsasifying. Many times it seems to lose track of the basic story motivation, and becomes soley about the characters battle with alcohol and self-loathing. It is a virtual certainty that movies spawned from a novel don't live up to its forebearer, but in this case, I think the movie has improved upon it exponentially."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd never started it.","review":"Life is too short to read a book like this.

I eventually got better, but a few years later I read this book. At that moment I wish I would have died just so I could have been spared reading this goobly-dee-gook.And the vampires are the dumbest vampires in any book. How do you have a vampire book where no one dies? The protaganist kills some vampire, yeah? so what, I mean at least he could have had a flashback where his family is eaten or torn to shreds rigth before his eyes...oh man, that would have been sweet.

The solitude of the main character was interesting, especially for the decade this was written. But it falls short on a lot of explaination. There were a lot of opportunities to really explore the psychological aspects of an isolated man left dangling.The short stories (most of which were featured on the twilight zone) inserted at the back of the book by the publishing company were a lot more enjoyable than the main story. Save yourself a headache, rent the movie, or wait for it on cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't judge a book by the movie","review":"I heard this book was better than the movie from a number of sources...and those sources are all correct.

If you like post-apocalyptic/zombie/horror books, pick it up also. Worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious horror","review":"I had first read this story when the movie came out. But, realizing that (as usual) the story far outweighed the movie in terms of plot and twists, I continued reading the other shorts within.

Keep the nightlight on."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a novella with a collection of bad short stories tacked on!","review":"I gave this 2 stars because the novella, I am Legend, is interesting. Had it been published on its own, or if there was at least some warning that completely unrelated short stories were going to immediately follow it, unannounced, as just chapters, I would have given this 4 stars. I am Legend is drastically different from the movie. Just consider it a different story with the same name. The short stories that follow the novella are nowhere near as interesting or good in quality. I wish I had read some of the reviews here beforehand so I wouldn't have wasted my time reading them, bored, and highly confused as to how they related to the first half of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I had seen the movie (with Will Smith), and I loved it.

I would give the rest of the book 3 stars.This is review specifically of the audio book. The audio book also seems to follow this breakdown as well. There is a different narrator for I Am Legend than the rest of the book.

I'm not proud of that knowing that he pretty well thought of but after reading, or at least trying to read this I'm not exactly sure why. The main story here while almost nothing like the movie also wasn't that good. The story could have been fleshed out and the \\"science\\" didn't make much sense. The ending was good but overall not very good in my opinion. Sadly the rest of the book contained short stories that I struggled to get through then finally relented and gave up. Cliché followed cliché which is odd for stories printed so long ago. Overall this is something that is better about than read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I AM HAPPY!!!","review":"OK so i got the book today when i got home from school today and I looked at it and its very good condition and it still has that freash book smell, and I cant wait to read it !!!

Great story, though much shorter than I thought. The reason for this poor review is because of the packaging. I had no idea I am Legend was one of almost a dozen other short stories in this book. The book itself if 312 pages long. I am Legend ends around page 162. No where on the cover, spine of back cover of the book does it say \\"I am Legend and other assorted short stories.\\" I thought I paid for a novel, not a short story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius","review":"This book was one of the most amazing novels I have ever encountered. It was truly captivating from the first page to the last - I read the whole book in one sitting. The monologue is thought provoking, profound, yet realistic. Rather than taking the conventional route of fantasy vampire novels, Matheson takes a more scientific approach, as he explains the true vampire through an analytical approach. The plot is very believable, and the main character is very well developed. If you haven't already done so, BUY THIS BOOK NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twisted but brilliant mind","review":"The title of my review says it all. Richard Matheson is obviously twisted, but the way he takes such horrifying things out of his imagination and puts them onto paper is rather amazing. I was expecting something entirely different from this book; for one thing I didn't know that it was a compilation of various stories. However, it held me entranced the entire time I read it, and I would definitely recommend that you check this book out if you want to read something VERY different."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Just Don't Write 'Em Any Better!","review":"What can I say about Richard Matheson that hasn't already been mentioned here. He's great. He's amazing. He's a master at his craft and nothing exemplifies that more than his novel \\"I am Legend.\\"The first time I picked the book up, I couldn't put it down. And when I got to the end, my throat constricted and a tear almost--I said almost--appeared at the corner of my eye. When words on the printed page can do that to you, you know you've found serious talent.\\"I am Legend\\" belongs on any serious sci-fi or horror fan's bookshelf. I'm getting a chill up my spine just by writing this review.I'm going to stop now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic rock my ass","review":"The selection of songs for this book was most remarkable: There is no Hendrix, The Doors, The Stones, King Crimson, one obscure Led Zepplin etc. in a book with 350 songs of \\"classic\\" rock. However you can find plenty of Elton John, Bon Jovi, Heart, Sonny and Cher and other \\"pop\\" classics instead. The actual sheet music has confusing arrangements and major ommissions of song parts (ie: the introduction to Traffic's \\"Low Spark of High Heeled Boys\\" was not written in). This book was a frustrating disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice selection of songs but some questionable transcriptions","review":"I purchased this book after seeing the table of contents and the great selection of songs. However, I found the book difficult to use because of the typeset. The chords are all written in very large bold letters often buried next to other large letters indicating sections of the songs. The chord letters were also written in an italizised font that made them difficult to read at times. That would have been simply an annoyance if the songs sounded like the recordings after playing them. However, many of the transcriptions sounded far off from the original recordings when played on a piano.My only wish is that I could return this book and apply that money to some of the much better fake books out there such as \\"Hal Leonard's Classic Rock Fake Book\\" or \\"Hal Leonard's The Ultimate Pop Rock Fake Book\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting To know The Bengal","review":"If you are planning to get a Bengal Cat by purchasing or adopting, and are looking for information, then this is the book for you. I've looked around about a month and currently there are not a lot of books that deal with the breed except in a superficial way. In this book specific information regarding Breeding, Genetics, History, Care, Diseases and more are covered. I do want to point out that there is a lot of information on the internet available but it's easier to just buy the book unless you want to spend hours on the internet. A couple of caveats one this book is short, a little over 100 pages and two somewhat small but I found it to be worth the cost despite the minor shortcomings. Anyone looking for more in-depth discussion will need to go to textbooks on Feline Genetics, Feline Anatomy and Physiology and Feline Diseases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Color","review":"Keep looking for a photo of the color, it's out there somewhere.

Otherwise, you should check out 'The illustrated band', which is the same band, plus some, but Page is obviously not driving the bus, and that's a very good thing. The grooves on 'Vida Blue' are weak and don't even begin to demonstrate the monstrous talent of Otiel Burbridge and Russell Batiste, and even Page for that matter.Overall it's not terrible, but it is very dissapointing.

He is average build and height and a medium worked well for him. We did not find the sizes to be off like other reviewers. The costume was of decent quality. There are a lot of cheap ones out there and this was not one of those. My only complaint was that the belt was a little hard to get on since it's kind of tight and you have to pull it over their head or up from their feet. All and all though I thought it was a good value for the price and he was definitely happy. His 6 year old brother was Anakin and they thought they were pretty awesome together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what is pictured","review":"The quality of the costume was very low and not what is pictured. The material on the shirt/tunic did not have finished edges (as shown) but was rough cut and already fraying when it arrived.

I returned it, five days before Halloween."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for the price","review":"I ordered this costume to my son who loves Star Wars.

Don't think the \\"boots\\" will hold up even through one wear. Really over priced. The costume in the bag doesn't even match the packaging. It is about what should be expected for this type of costume, but the price tag doesn't match. It should probably be about half the price. My youngest son's costume is a WAY better quality for a whole lot less. Would never have bought this if I'd found a better option. My little guy had his heart set on being a jedi and I couldn't talk him out of it. If you have even the slightest sewing ability, you could make something much nicer and cuter. Too bad my little jedi's mom isn't craftier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lot's of fun","review":"This costume was perfect for our 5 year old. He loved it and felt like a real Jedi!

I really wasn't expecting great quality since these costumes are usually pretty cheap, but this is beyond cheap. The boots aren't sewn on correctly. One boot faces front and one faces backward, which mean when he wears it, he has to twist one of the pant legs so the boot is facing the right direction. My son doesn't seem to care though, so I won't be returning it even though I should. Also the velcro that holds the back together is only sewn with a few stitches so I don't expect it to last more than a few wears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Costume review","review":"Ordered the Jedi Knight Qui-Gon Jinn Deluxe Child Costume for son for Christmas.

The picture shows a costume with hemmed edges, and a nice belt made on faux leather. Not so. All edges were raw cut edges and the belt was painted and ugly, and won't hold up.

To enjoy listening to her voice, one must be aware of her work as a dramatic performance rather than a technically perfect and beautiful voice. She sang with her soul, her heart and all the deep feelings a human being can experience and this led her to the top of the opera world, although her voice never achieved beauty and evenness as it would be expected of an opera Diva. Listening to Callas is for those who really want to experience a deep and strong experience within themselves. If you want a beautiful voice, try Tebaldi, Mirella Freni or so many others who did achieved voice perfection -- but could not touch one's heart as deep as Callas did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant recital!","review":"La Divina means \\"The divine one\\"!!

If you want a pose-able figure to play with, I suppose the cape could get in the way.I love the way he looks with one exception. His belt looks like an army version belt with pouches or pockets around it. I can't seem to find any comics where MK has this belt on.

When I was a child the Welsh Baptist churchgoers still sang the hymns in Welsh, the neighbors spoke Welsh, my grandparents spoke Welsh, and everyone worked in the mines. While this book is a memory piece set in Wales, it might as well be set 70 years later in my hometown. Every character is authentic; every word is authentic; every emotion, reaction, sentiment and family situation is authentic. There are lots of \\"big canvas\\" sagas, and memoirs, and historical novels, but there is no other book I can think of that so honestly recreates a lost time, place, and people.

I bought a trike from Costco for $15 and she has more fun with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUNK - O - JUNK!!!","review":"This toy was the biggest waste of money. I bought it for my son's 2nd birthday. We put it together and - like all the other reviews I've read here - the wheels do not turn! So much for riding or scooting on it! The only thing left to do with this toy is to play with the little box that makes noise when you push the buttons. Well, like I've also read in all the other reviews - it fell off! Now the little box is somewhere in the bottom of his toy box.... outta sight, outta mind.

I will say that I would have not purchased it for my son, considering the bad rap that scooters have with young children. However, my son (who's one year old) really digs the electronic noises and loves to hold the handles to 'ride'. It is really low to the ground and can accomodate a young child easily. Although the wheels appear at first to not move well at all, closer inspection revealed that I had to place them on with a firm push to really click them into place and now it wheels fine - not too fast, not too slow. Set up is relatively easy, but bothersome with all the screws. Thus far, I am pleased with the item, and feel that the plastic is not flimsy in any way. It appears to be a well-constructed item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly designed","review":"I got this for my 2 year old thinking he would love it. It could grow with him and turn into a scooter, he got it at his 2nd birthday party.

The wheels were extremely hard to get on (my husband had to put it on the floor and use all his might to press them in), but once we did seemed to be ok. The sound base comes off way too easily and the weight of my 2 year old (and he is average size if not a little small for his age) caused the toy to press on the wheels and they were too hard for him to roll sitting or even standing as a scooter. Don't waste your money. It's a piece of junk. Buy something your child can enjoy. It might be better with a much younger/smaller child but they certainly won't be using it long.

Let's face it, you have to be a complete Andy Warhol obsessed freak to make it through this book. If you have finished the book I'd be curious to know what you've gained.If you took the name Andy Warhol off this book it would never even see the light of day. I'm sure Andy was aware of this and that's the reason why he did it. He was caught up in that type of celebrity status and probably got a kick out of putting one on us. In that sense I tip my hat to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parkening's interpretation is lacking.","review":"Parkening's version of the Aranjuez is severely lacking in musicallity and emotional interpretation. This may be due to how the CD was recorded, in that, the RPO recorded its part and then Parkening dubbed in his part at a later time. This is highly dubious and definitely works as a disadvantage for the overall interpretation of the work. Parkening's performance may be technically acceptable, but for those who want a performance of the Aranjuez that is not only technically dazzling, but is also emotionally rich and musically fullfilling, buy Pepe Romero's recording with the Academy-of-St. Martin's-in the Field under Sir Neville Marriner released in 1994. Not only is it the definitive recording, but it was one of the composer's favorite recordings of his concerto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dries out fairly quicky.","review":"I was looking for something more liquid and instead I got a gel.

Jonathan manages to get around, and one day when Penny hears him having an affair, she dies on the office floor (sounds highly improbable to me). Jonathan is apathetic at first, but starts seeing the ghost of his wife everywhere he looks.Meanwhile, Jonathan's son, Winston, comes home from Europe to help keep up the company. Winston is swamped by his new duties, and receives no help whatsoever from his daydreaming father.Somewhere along the way, Winston gains a foreign girlfriend and Jonathan and Penny are finally united forever.The plot is utterly ridiculous, and the director does not bother to explain several peculiar moments.

It will be like nothing you've ever heard, certainly new and inventive. Be not mistaken though; there are some hard hitting, greasy funk tracks mixed in with a sound people would orientate with African rhythms. A very good album and worth the scratch.

But start of with this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome talent, beautiful performances.","review":"It is a mistake to view Sarah Chang simply as a very-talented child prodigy. Rather, despite her youth, she is a great violinist by any standard -- fully worthy to be compared to the finest violinists of the recorded music era. Her performance of the Tchaikovsky concerto is as fine as any currently available and better than most. The Brahms dances are equally superb. If you love the violin and haven't yet heard this outstanding artist, do yourself a favor and buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal","review":"For her age, Miss Chang continues to display a developing talent that is starting to rival those such as Jascha Heifetz and the squeaky but great Anna Sophie Mutter.

Sarah Chang was only 11 years old when this was recorded, yet it surpasses every recording. First of all, Sarah thinks about how she can play each phrase, you can hear every emotion that can possibly be brought out of the music. She makes sense of eveything. There is never anything that is just, there, everything has meaning. Secondly, while this may be a tad slower than other recordings, it is for the better of the piece. Never has there been a recording where you can hear that many notes, that in tune, and that cleanly played. It's like you're reading the notes right off the page. This aspect also gives the music a sense of prolonging and savoring every moment of the music. Finally, Sarah's lucious tone and artistry top it all off to make this the finest Tchaikovsky out there! A must have for all violin lovers, or someone that is new to violin and wants to hear more.

For those business professionals without a background in Ken Wilber's work (or without an interest in reading some rather lengthy and complex material), this book is a fine starting point for basic integral ideas (not so much for practice).Paulson presents Wilber's integral theory in an easy to understand way. Onto that Paulson builds a hierarchy of organizational levels using Wilber's AQAL matrix. Popular business theory and practice is then categorized within the four quadrants and across the organizational levels. The result is a typology of common practice within an integral framework. That's as far as it goes.For business practitioners possessing knowledge and experience with Wilber's integral model, this book has little to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good!","review":"Fantastic band! singer James Grant, vocals are excellent. However each of the bands album's after 'strange kind of love' ,seemed to get slower, more moody and dark, more country in style and more obscure.

He has some other solo projects which you can get through some scottish music sites and itunes. I havn't heard these .For me, the Steely Dan sound & style of Gary Katz's production on 'strange kind of love', is great it just rocks out more with these really cool jams & jazzy back beats...just an ace album and definite desert island disc. On this album/greatest hits, the track, 'who in their right mind' only on this album, is the standout & perhaps worth getting this compilation for the track, although you can download this track alone on itunes ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait","review":"Even though I have most of the listed titles on vhs (taped from a T.V.

If these episodes coming out on DVD are of good quality, I will be buying any later releases also.

The music of that time was great and you get to hear some of it throughout the movie like The Stylistics, The Staple Singers & Aretha Franklin just to name a few. Also, clips from nostaglic commercials and TV shows like The Partridge Family and Soul Train (the first season) are also featured in this story that makes this movies worth watching.And I think the formula used for CROOKLYN may have been some sort of inspiration for the 2002-2005 NBC show AMERICAN DREAMS since they were both produced by Universal Pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to see this movie","review":"Spike Lee made an amazing film about the life of an african american family.

Reminiscent of \\"Do The Right Thing\\" with the neighborhood flavor, odd characters, a richness of detail and editing. But expecting it to be funny and light, I was disappointed. The family was always fighting and Alfre Woodard always yelling at her sons. I do have trouble with that. But they all seemed to love one another and the episode of Troy with her southern aunt was very well done, except for the odd way it was filmed. And the little girl who played Troy was effective in her role. Woodard is a truly gifted actress. I've liked her in everything she's been in. She should've gotten an Oscar for \\"Passion Fish\\". It never ceases to amaze me - the range of films that Lee has made. All of them good; most of them exceptional. Only Woody Allen comes close to such a body of work. Lee's characters are just so believable in their humanness. It's like you're looking into their lives and troubles and joys."},{"rating":"1","title":"A realistic review","review":"This movie has no point.

The pieces do not start out overly simple and are progressively more complex. Each piece introduces some new musical elements (accidentals, key change, triplets, etc). All exercise both left and right hands. And all are enjoyable to hear.Because the pieces are all fairly short, I began playing from memory more than from the written music. To counter that, I suggest playing three or four during a practice session.By the way, with a little googling you can find MIDI renditions of these songs on the internet to compare with your playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"I would rather claw my own eyes out than read this book again.

First time i bought a 2pac CD and took it out of the CD-PLAYER after 3 days was when EMiNEM got his hands on them. Hes RICH and Hes WHITE and he is taking over what BLACK MEN have created just like every other white man in this world. (BY THE WAY, I\\"M WHITE)So GOOD LUCK finding music to bump to in your RIDE and lets hope some new stars get into the game because RAPPING is a sport and some people need to retire legends then go out LOSERS!

But putting all of the other stuff out of the way this is a pretty good effort from 50. The content of the album goes deeper than get rich or die trying, its not just boosting about having it all but giving some insight on certain topics. Baltimore Love Thing and God Gave Me Style or evidence of that. I wish people wouldnt give to much credit to all the beef since 50 really doesnt sell of the beef records (in da club, Pimp, Disco inferno and candy shop are all club bangers not beef records) So the content goes further than all the contreversy and as a whole it is a decent album.best songsthis is 50Im supposed to die tonightoutta controlski mask waygunz come outgod gave me style"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album but 50's a baby","review":"The album is aggresive but good, besides that said below \\"game was the only hope for g-unit.

Every other song sounds the same, he talks about the same thing on every song, he sings almost every hook( a la Ja Rule), there isnt much to this album, but ryder music is a hot song, but if you're a true hip-hop fan, you will feel let down by 50."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got rich , through trying","review":"I knew this album wasnt going to be close to \\"Get rich or die Trying\\", but damn i almost want to call him gay for this B.S he calls the massacre. people please download,buy it for less than 10$ (bootleg), or whatever you can do to keep from bying this album.

I wish I could just play some classic Eric B. and Rakim, Gang Starr, Brand Nubian, TCQ, etc., then you would hear what real rap and hip-hop was. My sister keeps bragging about how great this CD is and I just have to pop in \\"Don't Sweat the Technique or Midnight Marauders\\" to show her what rap is.

We see this all the time in the music business. So for anybody who doesn't have a clue on how to buy good music, don't expect somebody's second album to be better than their first. And one more thing for those who bought this album, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE INTERNET AND LISTEN TO ALBUMS BEFORE YOU BUY!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Game Over","review":"It is too bad 50 had to let the Game go, the Game and him worked so well together and it made for a better album in The Documentary than 50 could do alone with The Massacre. I knew 50 was in trouble when his first two singles were remakes of Loyd Banks On Fire and Lil Kim's Magic Stick and the rest of the album doesnt even live up to those tracks. Piggy Bank and Gunz come out are \\"B\\" rated tracks and the rest are all down hill from there. Some of 50's best tracks on his last album came from the help of Eminem (patiently waiting) and Nate Dog (21 questions). Add this to the success of How We Do and Hate it or Love it where he was the Games sidekick and it becomes obvious that 50 does his best work along side other talents. Its too bad only a handful of tracks are set up this way on the Massacure. Plus... Nas? I believe someone's boss once rapped \\"It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from Outkast,Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me\\"....not smart to upset the ones that the boss respects"},{"rating":"1","title":"I cant give 50 a 1 but his cockyness is unheard of.","review":"From a commercial \\"pop\\" rap album this is good. But that is it. The lyrics are a far cry from his first album and even the hooks are horrible. Candy Shop has to be one of the worst singles of the year. 50's said if he sold one album less than he did on his first album it was a failure. Well this looks to be a failure. The b.s. beef with Nas is incredibly stupid on 50s part. Nas is a legend. Nas makes rap, hip hop music; not commercial pop records. 50 can sell his millions to the youth of the nation who have no idea what rap is and only listen to it to look cool. If you wanna hear real hip hop pick up anything Nas or either of Talib Kweli's records. Even better Snoop Doggs Death Row greatest hits. 50 doenst deserve my $15."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't hate 50, but this is crap","review":"As said in the title, I don't hate 50 at all, but now I do thanks to this crappy CD.

Yes, that's how bad it is! Some say his rapping style sounds like he's out of breath or that it's due to the bullets he took. Whatever it is, it does not work. 50 raps without ANY emotion.In every other \\"song\\", sounds of guns being cocked and bullets being fired attempt to present 50 as being hard. Yet, the only thing that's hard is being able to sit through all the tracks of this garbage.While listening to him, I await him to stumble over his words. Listen closely and you can hear his speech slow as he pronounces words with three or more syllables. Seriously, he sounds like he's learning to read for the first time-slowly pronouncing every word. Save your money on this one folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"GO FIDDY!!!","review":"I think all of Ja Rule's cousins need to back away from their computers!! I think the main reason for all of the Fiddy hate is his cocky attitude. I know...I know...how dare he proclaim himself king, and challenge everybody who crosses him.But let's put personal feelings aside. Although Massacre is no Get Rich...its still pretty darn good. Fiddy isn't as tight a lyricist as Nas or Jadakiss...but his melodic flow and wit more than makes up for that. He takes the same old hood tales and makes them fresh again.

Mainstream rap today has destroyed what true rap is. This has to be one of the worst CDs I have ever heard. If it weren't for the beats, this would get a big fat zero. I guess it isn't hard to sell records when you have producers like Scott Storch, Hi-Tek, Em and Dre despite how talentless you are.

It has nice beats and he has gotten better on the Mic even thought he is still only average. There is nothing wrong with Get Rich or Die Tryin 2 just look at Mobb Deep and Hell on Earth which was The Infamous 2 but it was still dope none the less. I am probally the person with the Most Beef against the guy plus his battles are childish with the likes of his group mate The Game(Best Rap album of 05) to his never ending quarels with Ja Rule and other beefs with Jadakiss and Fat Joe. If Big L were alive he would probally kill 50 Cent because Joe was in his crew plus 50 wants to be Big L.I don't get his beef with Nas. Nas will shut out 50 Cent. I want to see if he goes after KRS-One next. Maybe we can have some comic relief after KRS-One lights him on Fire lyrically. His beefs and him are stupid but the album is not. 4 Mics"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well....","review":"This CD was way over hyped by 50 himself.

He makes people like me who actually cherish good music almost despise rap. 50 Cent raps about the same stuff, he has no game he barely even switches up his raps and if he does, he doesn't sound original or even good. His voice has lil character, nothing like Jay-Z who has a million an 1 different types of flows. Even Eminem has more lyrical character then 50 Cent. 50 Cent is never gonna be embraced the way that he once was. I'm so glad people are over that finally. I used to be a hardcore fan of his at that. I loved the first CD, but since this is his sophmore CD shouldn't it be better then the first?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot","review":"50 Cent only has a three good songs on here.

If you are looking for REAL hip hop, the first thing you should do is turn off your radio and your tv.

Fifty's style on this album always inspires me to get out there and go for mine. I know most people think that he's all about flossin', pimpin', or starting drama, but if you really pay attention to the overall undertone of his album you'll see that he's really talking about grinding to get what you what out of life and not letting anyone stand in your way, especially, yourself. So I encourage any fan of Hip Hop to definitely get this album and expand your artistic mind and really listen for Fifty's ability to inspire entrepreneurship, and self motivation; Something we all could use during these economic times.Keep Grindin'Patrick"},{"rating":"1","title":"4 listenable tracks and 18 sad, sad duds.","review":"Candy Shop - 4/5Just A Lil Bit - 3/5Disco Inferno - 4.5/5Hate It Or Love It (Remix) - 4.5/5All Others: 2/5Cover Art: DInside Art: CSongwriting: D-Vocals: D-Vocal Emotion: FProduction: C+Length: F-52/22 = 2.363636363636362.36 - .3 for clean version (yuck!)2.06 stars.Overall: D-"},{"rating":"2","title":"G-unit 4 life!","review":"HELP!!!!Great album!!!

There are some decent beats on this album and that's why I gave it 1 star. 50 Cent is a bad rapper (and even those that enjoy this album should agree). He has nothing new to offer and the ONLY reason he became such a huge hit is because of the help Eminem & Dr.Dre gave him. I highly recommend that you spend your $ somewhere else. This CD will get old really quick."},{"rating":"1","title":"What others said is true...","review":"Though this album has 22 songs, only a few (~7 songs) are listenable.

Theres nothing new or unique, just plain old garbage with weak beats and poor lyrics.(two Dr. Dre beats...THAT'S IT!!! and the song with Eminem sucks ass!) This doesn't compare at all to GET RICH'. This isn't even worth downloading. It's pure crap!!! If you want to listen to real rap, listen to The Game, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Jay-z, Nas, or NWA, or anything but this crap.

When he was young he had nothing and now hes got what alot of people dont have. If you had the life he had and now you became famous wouldn't you talk about your life in songs?

I really didn't like his first one. 75% of his new cd sounds like something he has done before, 4 Ex: Disco Inferno sounds just like On Fire by Lloyd Banks or In the Club. Candy Shop Sounds just like Magic Stick By Lil Kim and Him. I really don't understand the hype. he talks about rappers he has no chance at being better than.

It does not deserve the one star I gave him. Don't buy his album. If you really want it, BURN IT. The cd is about him being angry at everyone. Would we even know who 50cent is if he didn't have beef with every one in the Rap game. And how dare he attack NAS. 50cent can't even pronounciate his words let alone compose them lyricaly like NAS. The album has some good beats but thats it. The lyrical content is weak. Please don't support this album. And to make matters worst 50cent said in an interview that he does not even spend time with his son because he is so busy. He said that he just gives him money and thats the extent of his fatherly duties. So not only does he suck as an artist, he sucks as a black man and a human. F**k 50.

I'm a fan of rap music. I don't like what he's using it for and producing from it. I don't like the way he copies Nas's original genius (Telling a hood story from the perspective of the gun) and then turns it into second rate copy cat bullcrap (telling a hood story from the perspective of a \\"drug\\"). Way to go Vanilla Ice. You're right, that sounds nothing like \\"Under pressure\\" you're totally original.I've already wasted five more minutes than I intended to.

Some of the beats are decent, but the rap itself is bunk.

You're a poser to simply put it. I heard on various interviews that this guy doesn't even do the 'hardcore' stuff he talks about like drugs and whatnot. Well of course he doesn't, none of them do, well except maybe Snoop Dogg since he is actually a CRIP. All he does is talk trash about rappers who are more talented than him (not by much, however).Ok let's review the album now-Songs 1-30029 whatever (albums today have WAY too many songs)I gave a -10000000. The duets with a Olivia are just a rip-off of those Ja Rule did and thats not saying much since he sucks too.Ok here's the part where I try to be helpful, want REAL RAP KIDS?Tribe Called Quest, Das EFX, NWA, Run DMC, Public Enemy, geez even Outkast are better, at least they don't try to be tough.So in conclusion the album is 100% pure filler!

I can understand taking shots at Fat Joe and Ja Rule but to go as far as to diss one of the greatest artists ever. Nas has layed down some of the best verses in history. Also he has made some of the most influencial rap songs ever with songs like \\"One Mic\\" and \\"I Can.\\" Lets face it 50 is not in his league and never will be..put some content in your songs for once. He said The Massacre would out sell Get Rich or Die Tryin..its not going to because he doesnt put out much quality material.

My problem with him is that he is such a shameless sellout who cares only about making money, not about making great music.This album is very weak, but like Ludacris, Fat Joe, Nelly and all the other sellouts who are contaminating rap these days, 50 knows he does not have to make great music to have great record sales. Do yourself a favor and save your money for Ready to Die, Life After Death, or one of Pac's albums. The Massacre is trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARGABE!!!!!!!","review":"I listened to this whole album and there are maybe 3 songs on there that are any good. The worst song is by far Gatman and Robin ( with Eminem ). The best song is piggybank. The production is good ( that's why I gave it a gracious 2 stars ) but the lyrics are terrible. I thought it was just me until I let a couple of my friends listen to it also and they all agreed with me. I was looking forward to this CD for a very long time. When I finally heard it I was very dissapointed. 50 is trying to sing on just about every hook on his songs ( isn't that one of the reasons why he dissed Ja Rule ) and he does not sound that great.

Judging by the singles that came from this cd, I thought it was going to be awesome. NOPE, 50 just used up the only decent songs on the album to produce singles, minus a few other songs on the cd that are aight.

But this album simply sucks! I m not oneof the people who r sayin that 50 cent is not hip hop or is a pop artist! he is not! he is a rapper because music is entertaintment! Rap is music so it is also entertaintment. and that's what 50 Cent is doing. He is a entertainer!!Now going towards the album, there is not much to say except it is not what i expected! after listening to \\"Candy Shop\\" and \\"Lil' Bit\\" i was expecting the same thing as GRODT but obviously it is not!What I don't understand is why 50 wants beef wit NAS!!!! I mean if he really wanted a promo stunt, beef wit Jada and Fat Joe is enough! There is NO WAY he gonna be able to beat Nas!I gave this album 2 stars becuz of the beats and \\"I'm Suppose to Die Tonite\\"!Download the album if u really want to listen it or u can just download few songs cuz rest of the album is wack!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just repetitve","review":"I know alot of people hate 50 right now for starting unnecessary beefs. I think its unfair to judge this album on his behavior. Its obvious 50 just cares about selling records thats why he did that. I did hear this album and was REALLY disapointed because i did like GRODT alot. This album lacks the Dr. Dre beats that made GRODT a great album. His lyrics are very repetitive, he basically raps about the same stuff (being a gangster, selling drugs, killing people, growing up in the hood) Come on 50 your no gangster, Queens is not the hood. Maybe this album needs to fail to motivate 50 to rap about new stuff on his next one.

The once thought provoking and lyrically adventerous rhymes of 50 Cent have yet to be found on this album. Offered from the newcomer with fading potential are dirty lymerics of self indulging tripe, sexual deviance, and poor humor. The musical growth rate of 50 Cent cannot even be charted. He is treading water in a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put on a freakin' shirt Fitty!","review":"I won't go off on some essay about how 50 is a fraud and does not represent Hiphop music and Kulture, I think people are starting to notice the bullsheeyat.

So if you've already got suckered into buying this cd and you're sorely disappointed with the product, here's my advice that will make that $15 worth it all:Take this cd and case and place in the middle of your lawn or in your closest neighborhood park. Then, take a shotput and keep throwing it from approximately 20 ft. till you hit the target! Once you connect, your delight should well be worth that $15 you wasted on the cd.

Disco Inferno is tepid garbage. He is calculating enough to know that the brain dead white teenagers in America will buy anything that supposedly sports a \\"hot\\" beat but any true fan of hip hop will recognize that he is utterly devoid of any inspiration. He has nothing positive to say, just the same old tired cliches we have heard a billion times before.The fact that he has the audacity to diss Nas, who could rap circles around him is stunning. He never abandons the single syllable rhyming structure while Nas is one of the most athletic rhymers on the planet.Of course Rolling Stone and other lame ass publications will promote this but that doesn't mean it is any good.

He talks about the same played-out subjects over and over. Another thing is that it's not wise to diss Nas on your album; Jay Z already tried that and failed after Nas tore him to shreds. I don't think that 50 wants any part of Nas, in terms of a lyrical battle. After all, Nas is a rap legend with four classic albums (Illmatic, It was Written, Stillmatic and God's Son) whereas 50 is just another below-average rapper who has to boast and brag about getting shot.

This time, 50 tried some new producers on his songs, which his last album Dr. Dre and Eminem basically produced the whole thing. The current single, \\"Candy Shop\\" produced by Scott Storch is by far the highlight of the album. It is radio friendly, really sexual and features Olivia who stands out on the track, and in the video. Other great songs include \\"This Is 50\\", \\"Piggy Bank\\",\\"Outta Control\\", \\"Disco Inferno\\", and \\"Just A Lil Bit.\\" There are some really good club type songs on this album as well as the usual hood talk and gun talk.

Ever since that ive been hoocked. Its not as good as his first cd, but is still good. There are a mix of different types of songs, he got the slow jams, the club bangers, and the gansta joints. Its a good cd, just give it time, and it will grow on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But Not Great","review":"www.gunitspot.com First off this album has nothin on Get Rich or Die Tryin. That album was hot. The Massacre is a pretty good rap album, its got some great beats ad 50 Cent does his thing with some others joining him.

When I bought, I thought it would be average. But almost every song on the album could be a hit. My personal favorites are Gatman & Robin (Eminem & 50 come strong on this track. Bangin Beat), A Baltimore Love Thing (I think is the best song. Some deep sh--), My Toy Soldier (hard beat. tony yayo & 50 kill it), and Hate It Or Love IT (remix)(G Unit is fire on this track. great way to close). Overall, this album is fire.

Olivia's bad vocals messed up the song. She can't sing worth of crap. Just A lil bit is pacing up the charts. I dont see how. These songs are lame.

Not even close but he pushed the buttons when he dissed my boy Fat Joe (Boricua 4 lyfe). He disses people that don't have much rep' anyway. Also he's doing the same thing he dissed Ja Rule for doing! He's singing his own hooks and is making 'Pop-Bubble-Gum-Rap' just like Ja did. This album is way over rated and only has a couple of good beats.

I dont know what happened with this, but I really wouldnt bother with it. It kinda makes sense all the beef with Game just started going down before he dropped this. It's gonna sell records.

I personally don't care who 50 is feuding with...seems to me he's a bit too oversensitive. Anyway, this CD seems exactly like his last one.

I think the songs sound pretty much the same, with their medium tempos, medium beats and almost flat choruses. \\"Disco Inferno\\" is fun, but after a few listens it just fades away. And everyone seems to love \\"Candy Shop\\" (it did rule the chart for 9 weeks, didn't it?) but I think it is nothing special. The beat doesn't even make me bop my head, and the background sound (kind of Asian sound, I think) doesn't fit the beat. Even the chorus is not as infectious as that of \\"21 Questions\\". The current hit, \\"Just A Lil' Bit\\" also doesn't stick to my ears, I just can't distinguish it from all other rap songs out there. So what's going on? 50 Cent has lost his creativity? Only with his second album? What a pity, because I really like his first release, and I thought he would become one of the most influencing rappers in the future. Better luck next time, pal."},{"rating":"1","title":"terible","review":"the massacre from 50 cent is as bad as his first one. that's it im not getting more 50 cent albums. because 50 cent your time is up."},{"rating":"1","title":"straight up garbage","review":"dont get me wrong his first album was tight..but now 50's doin exactly what he's dissed Ja-Rule for doin....he's crossed over and went \\"pop\\" and MTV..he's singin his own hooks and only makin music for the clubs...if any of ya'll think this is real hip hop..u need to educate yourself to the culture...50 continues to hate and trys to bring every emcee down with him...he shouldnt have titled this album the \\"massacre\\" but instead \\"the downfall\\" 50 better come hard with his next album or he's destined to fall off....u want a good CD from the G-Unit camp pick up Buck's \\"Straight Outta Cashville\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"LADIES AND GENTLMEN...THIS IS NOT HIP HOP","review":"Commercial Hip Hop is a disgrace to the hip hop culture.

His lyrics sucks, his voice is annoying, and the beats are WAY overproduced. The only reason why it will sell is because of Dre and Em producing the tracks, creating and publicizing him. The ONLY reason why it will sell is because of one) stupid teenie club songs and two) All the beef is talking is going to draw attention to his new albumn, WHY ELSE WOULD HE BE DISSING EVERYONE!?

Oh yeah and how much money I have. every song sounds the same and it all sounds like his first song and every chorus he writes for g-unit. Game is the only hope for that crew. What is even more dissapointing is the track eminem produced, piss poor. Also if 50 is going to attack every rapper from NYC he better come harder than that.

He sings on just about every track to try to cover up his lack of lyrical skill. All of his rhymes could of been thought up in about 20 seconds. Piggy Bank is probably the worst diss track I've ever heard. Besides Tony Yayo, who's really not a rapper at all, 50 cent is the least talented member of G-Unit (and that's saying something). It's a shame that G-Unit is now sucking in actual talented artists like Mobb Deep. The only good thing to come out of The Massacre is Jadakiss response to Piggy Bank (Checkmate) where he absolutely lights 50 up. If you like mindless mainstream pop rap The Massacre is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"hustle harder","review":"50 is a hustler.

Infact, i can't even lie but his first album \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\" was actually a really good CD. 50 has gone further down the Ja Rule path, singing on almost every track and trading in much of the gangsta imagery which made him popular in the first place for a ladies man persona. He should have named this album \\"Get Rich and Stop Tryin'.\\" A lot of Fifty's songs are deriviative of himself. Nothing on the album is outstanding even Eminem's guest appearance is lack luster.

All the street elements are nearly gone, everything he hated about Ja Rule has come back at him and he is now a hypocrite. I wished this album was a joke. I guess it is time to give up on rap.

There are some good rappers left, they just are not on tv. You don't have to rap with N'Sync and Country singers to get attention. I do like the new Game album though. I miss Death Row so much.

Overall, this cd is cool.You gotta really be where 50 is from to understand a great deal of his lyrical content. Think about that then LISTEN to the cd.

Get Rich or die tryin was a great album but this one just plain sucks. i thought maybe he would show a little maturity on this album and talk about something other than getting shot, women, and rims. this is not real hip hop at all this is just commercial garbage.Have you heard those beats? how can you say that is real hip-hop? oh and by the way piggybank is the worst diss song i have ever heard. 50 i don't think its wise to diss some of hip hops elite especially nas. didn't u see what he did to jay-z? nas is a hip hop legend and is lyrically tons better than u and will rip u to shreds (just like he did to jay-z). this can't be the work of dr. dre because he knows what real hip-hop is. you can see game got a lot more advice from him which is why his album is 10 times better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Because 0 stars is not an option","review":"I hate 50 Cent with a passion so deep, that whenever somebody mentions his name, I foam at the mouth and become overwhelmed with rage. He is the very embodiment of every black male stereotype you can think of: the muscled, dark-skinned, gut-tootin', crack-dealin', oversexed, Popeye's-chicken-eatin' thug. It is truly disgusting. I cannot even stand the sight of him. Nothing else in the world would make me happier than to see this album flop.

How the heck you going to be proud of being shot 9 times?? Loser! Back in the day, we were proud when we did 9 backspins. The only reason he is even considered decent is because he's behind a legendary Dre beats. It makes me mad cause this guy is rich and famous for no reason at all, he's not a good looking guy, he has no talent, no knowledge of real hip hop, no acting skills, he's just a thug that brought his hustle into the mass media - taking all your guys money - if you want his music, download it for free, because thats what its worth, to me its not even worth taking up my bandwidth to download it for free.

I'm sure that will give you some more street cred to diss jlo, I mean shes hard core! And your boy Eminem did a single with jada...wanna explain that one? The only reason he's popular is cause of the hype everyone makes about him, so what..he's from the streets, that doesn't make him a good rapper. 90% of rap sucks anyway, very few good rappers left. it's all POP rap now, it's sad.

Since \\"Get Rich or Die Trying\\" dropped I have been feverishly anticipating his next LP. However \\"The Massacre\\" is nothing what I expected. The beats are really the only thing keeping this CD from being the worst album of the year. The whole \\"diss err body and they momma\\" thang is played out and his ABC rhymes are worse than ever.

Yeah, one of his song's may be catchy (\\"In Da Club\\" is his only good spark) but after that he went all flip-flop. Seriously, not many people like this album (look at the mass of 1-star reviews!) and his new film (one of the worst of the worst) was a tradgic flop too!

There, you can let girls lick ur lollipop without having it told to 50 million MTV viewers.The hype of excitement and anticipation put on the album was the only thing that got it this far. The quite lame lyrics and derogatory and sick statements such as 'I'll let u lick the lollipop' on 'Massacre' are hopefully going to make people realize that not much has changed about 50 Cent since his debut 'Get Rich or Die Tryin'' album, which will hopefully also lead them to realize that 50 Cent is a WASTE OF MONEY!So basically what I'm trying to tell those reader's is that you should save you're money (and ears)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ther's music in my penis","review":"i like this album except there is one flaw in the case of ravaging dog swing waterballs the force forests to burn the great temple of China.

That is nuthin to be proud of. There is nuthin new or fresh on this cd. No growth as an artist.The rap community does not need this negative type of music.

He steered away from his old style and decided to go in a different direction which turned out to be the wrong move. There are probably at most 4 decent songs on this album. I mean wtf is this piggy bank crap!!! He needs to stop dissing people it and most of the time when u diss on people it ruins the song. What the hell is happening with 50 and Game.

But 50 has proven that there is a sophmore jinx. This is the worst album I have heard in the last 5 years (please take note that Chingy has dropped 2 cd's in that span of time that I havent even heard)!!!!!!!! Out of 22 tracks there about 4 songs that are ok. I felt that he was more lyrical on the first album then he was on this album. I think 50 has gotten cocky after selling 11 million (on the first cd), that now he feels that he can put his name on anything and it will sell crazy like it did the first time.

Get Rich or Die Tryin is way better. The Massacre is no way to follow up a classic. 50 should have never kicked anybody out the group that put out a better CD than him this years. The Documentary is still by far the best Rap Ablum this year. The only good songs on 50's album are \\"Piggy Bank (Good just because of the hype and beef), Hate It Or Love It Remix (Just Because Game And Buck were on the record).

It almost seems like 50 didn't even try to make this album lyricly he isn't using the word play and punch lines he used to. I think he needs to take more time consintrating on writing his raps like he used to rather then braging about how much money he's got in interviews and how much other artist sold. Also don't get it twisted I am not a G UNIT Hater at all I own every one of there cd's and mixtapes before there deal plus Get Rich Or Die Tryin ,Beg for Mercy ,Banks ,Buck's and former G Unit Member The Game and they are all better then The Massacare ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired","review":"I'm so mad I don't even want to review it.

So why not dis the fake NY MC's, such as Cam'ron, Mobb Deep or Fabolous? The only good songs on here are God Gave Me Style, Gatman And Robbin' feat. Eminem and Outta Control.

They're all wrong. After Get Rich or Die Tryin' I became a hardcore 50 fan, and I was unspeakably excited about The Massacre. There was no possible way it could live up to my expectations or the standard's 50 set with his debut album. I'm not gonna tell you he did reach 'em, cuz he didn't. And i think this is why people are bashing The Massacre so much. Just because the guy can't live up to the ridiculously high hype he had doesn't mean the album is bad. The first few times through it might not seem so good, but each track grows on you the more you listen to it. There are some outstanding songs on here like the singles, Candy Shop and Disco Inferno, along with Outta Control, I'm Supposed to Die tonight, Gatman and Robbin', and My Toy Soldiers. So anyone who loved 50's first effort, you would be missing out if you skipped The Massacre."},{"rating":"1","title":"let me count the rappers that are better","review":"This would take a whole book to fill, so i'll keep my list semi-small...PumpkinheadSupernaturalVast AireCageRA the Rugged ManGza and the entire Wu-TangMursSlugBlueprintZion IJus AllahVinnie PazIll Bill and Non PhixionOne Be LoPhil Da AgonyDefariEvidenceC Rayz WalzMr. LifKool G RapCanibusBeanie SiegelJay-ZNasthat's a good mix of commercial and underground rappers who are better than the biggest snitch/hypocrite in the industry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dis music the bomb yo!!!

If you already have the Tupac, Dre and Snoop albums, you've pretty much exhausted the best there is and should perhaps branch off into far richer musical avenues. If you're some angry cholo or a scrub with limited musical intellect, by all means get this it will make you thump and is so simple that even you can get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's kinda hot!","review":"I can't lie, I didn't like the CD at first.

Before he hooked up with Eminem he used to be a TALENTED underground rapper. He also used to tell his fans that he would never sell out and that he hated mainstream rap. Well 50, was it worth it? You ditched all your true underground fans to go mainstream with \\"Get Rich\\". You got your wish and you're now rich and famous. Now what? Your TRUE fans hate you for selling out and now your teeny-bobbing fans are forgetting about you and moving on to the next rap idol. So in a desperate attempt to get them back you release \\"The Massacre\\". Very appropriate title for album because it describes what happened to your short-lived music \\"career\\".

Rap used to be good when Public Enemy was doing it back in the late 80's, but then rap became one of the major sellout genres of all times when the new millenium dawned. Actually, I don't care for rap, as I listen to rock music, but the most overrated and sold out is 50 Cent. Listening to this \\"music\\" is as pleasant as getting burned by acid. Why does Amazon only have the option of one star? It deserves negative infinity stars. One star is being WAY too nice.If you want good rap, I suggest Public Enemy, Nas, Beastie Boys, 2Pac (before he died), Notorious B.I.G. and that's all that can pop up in my head. For good rock music, get some Fear Factory, Killswitch Engage, Shadows Fall, American Head Charge, Lamb Of God, Bleeding Through, In Flames, As I Lay Dying, Darkest Hour, At The Gates, Himsa, Pantera and stuff like that.

The rest is generally same old stuff, nothing that haven't been said before. Most songs on the album lack substance, and lyrics are pretty mediocre. If you've listened to previous albums you will notice that 50 repeats a lot of stuff he said before, and his rhymes don't seem to change much. Well, you can go with the hype and buy this album, but honestly, it's not worth the money...Last note. If you are looking for club bangers with nice beats, and don't really care about quality of rhymes or topics covered, then I would say that this could be a decent buy. If you are looking for something deeper which actually has meaning, steer away from this album.-F1"},{"rating":"1","title":"He's crazy","review":"I just can't get past the fact that he has the balls to diss Nas.

With the panphlet inside you get some nice pictures of 50 pointing guns at your face, that's always nice. The fact that this album had so much commercial success is what really perplexes me though.

Normally I will forgive a song poor beats as long as it has good lyrical content, but there is absolutely NOTHING salvageable about this album or his cookie cutter G~Unot lackys. Sorry to say but 50 and guys like him are what is wrong with rap today."},{"rating":"1","title":"this cd is garbage","review":"i dont know what is wrong with kids these days. look im a college professor and i teach poetry. rap basically is poetry and i love rap. but come on. im going to say this to everybody they do have to admit. 50 is no true rapper. first of all he made fun of ja rule for singing in his songs.in this album he does the same thing in some of his songs. so what if he got shot 20 times or whatever. i got stabbed by one of my students. he has the worst voice. he cant write any poetry. he is a middle school dropout. 2pac is a good example he actually studied in school and tried hard. i dont get u kids anymore. ive had it.em is not a good example but u can see that he tried hard to get where he is. i have to admit he can be catchy but that does not mean anything. rap is words people. not beat. words. and im black so trust me im right."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid","review":"y do ppl like 50 cent he sucks so does rap and the massacre is stupid they call him 50 cent because thats all hes worth dont buy this BS"},{"rating":"1","title":"This deserves zero stars","review":"I don't blame him...I blame his fans.

Ponder on this for a while, 50 Cent took issue with The Game because he was getting left on the side while Dr. Dre was churning out 'The Documentary' (a much better album and a fine first commercial release). 'The Massacre' is crap pure and simple, you only have to listen to 'Piggy Bank' to analyse how badly 50 cent misses Dr. Dre's magic touch and when Dre dos contribute the lyrics do not reward the fantastic production in fact I found my self ignoring the lyrics completeley and just settling in to the beat (listen to 'Gunz Come Out'). Scott Storch also puts a dent in the monument of dissapointment that 50 has constructed with 'Candy Shop' and 'Just A Lil Bit' but unfortunately it is not enough to enable me to let this album cling to 3 stars. Okay at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"go listen b4 you buy!!!","review":"Opposite of his previous work! Of course I wasn't as exited as Get Rich Or Trying Dying to buy the CD for I had a feeling it would be a bad one. Regardless I got the CD and OMG!!! I never knew it would be so bad.

I would recommend people to listen to the CD b4 buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just \\"Good\\" Music","review":"Alright I've read all the hating in the reviews. But what all y'all didn't seem to note is that 50 Cent has never been all that lyrical. 50 Cent is an great song writer, he's the only rapper today that does all his hooks (it's different from ja rule because fifty is still rapping in the hooks not singing). The point is hate on the lyrics all you want but this is a CD that you can listen to all the way from track 2 to 22 in your car. Which is what you can't say for most of the rappers out there. So don't get on dude because he does his own hooks, because other rappers just get R & B Chicks to do the same thing. He just keeping the money in the camp. So listen to the music and stop hating cause he doesn't say \\"like\\", and talk about his \\"ice\\" alot. Cause I garantee that you will remember all those hooks, the bounce your head along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring a better album then","review":"Okay... Just got the new album and listened through it. I think its an awesome album. I am a hip hop fiend and there is not another album out there that I would put before this one.

I'd rather listen to the Ken Kaniff skits off of Em's albums. This is ridiculous, this is the worse sophomore effort I have ever seen. I think 50 could've done a lot better.

It sounds like he just tried to get the roughest beats he could find, take 15 min. to write a few verses and said hey put it on the album. It was just an all around horrible album and it was boring on top of that. I fell asleep listening to this. The only bring spot is his duet with Olivia on \\"So Amazing\\" which brings me to my next point. Didn't he just get on Ja Rule for singing with Ashanti yet he goes and does the same thing with Olivia. Well, just know that Ja Rule and Ashanti did it better. You'd be better off going out and buying his first album again and pretending like he re-released it or something cuz The Massacre is a very good description for this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bootleg or download this crap but don't buy it!","review":"When you go into that record store you go to, and you see the new 50 Cent album, walk right past it.

The beats are hot, the lyrics are great. You can hate the person, I hate 50 as a person, but you can't deny that his music is great.

I will admit he has great beats on the CD, but still his rapping skills definitely leave some to be desired. I would highly suggest artists such as Jim Jones, Young Buck, and Tru as better new CDs in the gangsta rap genre. Save your money and listen to a friends copy of this CD before buying it, due to some might really like it but i personally feel I could have spent the money on a better CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not saying anything","review":"It is a sad fact but although 50 is definately a better rapper than The Game his album isn't in the league of Game's. Nor is it close to his first album. Although there is some clever rhymes and flow on some tracks overall it is a mediocre album. Other than the singles we already know tracks worth hearing are Ski Mask Way, Piggybank, Ryder Music and Supposed to die Tonight. Only buy if you are a big 50 fan otherwise you can find something better to spend your Money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight out the hood, then turned Hollywood...","review":"I just can't seem to understand what happens to rappers as they move along in their careers. How can you have such grit and intensity on one album, and then turn into an R & B act on the next? I am extremely disappointed with this 50 Cent album. \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\" was an absolute classic, front to back. And 50's releases prior to \\"Get Rich...\\" were strong lyrically, even if some of the production was weak. But \\"The Massacre\\" is just straight garbage! Now I know why I've always gone back to listening to underground and local hip-hop... the artists still care about the music. First 50 Cent dates Vivica, now he's trying to BE like Vivica... Hollywood! I hope his soul is worth all the cash... because the respect that he's lost with the TRUE fans of rap music can never be replaced.

They are here for one purpose and one purpose only and that is to get rich. Hip-Hop is being exploited and it's become the new age hustle. If you are out to make fast money then Hip-Hop is the best and safest way to get rich. People have realized that it no longer take much to get rich in the music business. The heart & soul that artists use to put into their music no longer exist anymore, we have a very limited amount of those and they are always pushed aside for crap like this. Everytime people go out and spend money on artists like 50 Cent, they come back disappointed, unless you like garbage because I honestly cant see someone who has love for music to enjoy this.

Stylistically this album is a total departure from Fifties hard culturally inspired background and when he tries to up the dose on tracks like \\"This is Fifty\\" he really dooms himself with his scary rapping peers who will be waiting after his shows fully equipped with hardware. Fans may ask what happened? well letting Mr. Belladonna adjust the beats tempos here and there spelled disaster......things could have been different but tracks like\\"Get in My Car\\" really wear you down with their metaphorical jargon about lost puppies looking for their old Judas Priest albums. Hey I'm a huge fan of great rap but geeeez what happened to the old Fifty who wrote great songs like \\"In the Club\\" I guess we'll have to wait for the next album and hope that Fifty can produce some great stuff without that falsetto whining moron Belladonna."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?.........","review":"am I even wasting my time writing a review for this trash.

The radio singles \\"Candy Shop\\" \\"Just a Lil Bit\\" and \\"Disco Inferno\\" do exatcly what they are intended to do, be hot club bangers, and they might be the hottest club songs of the year. The street stuff is very good too like \\"This is 50\\", \\"Gunz Come out\\" and \\"Ski Mask Way\\".

The production is great, but all of the songs sound very similar. The lyrical content is not the best ever either. The album mainly focuses on the things that \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\" focused on: shootings, rap rivalries, and getting a woman to shake that almighty ass. I understand that the level of quality in not only the new rap music, but in all music in general is at an all time low, so I wasn't expecting this album to be very ground breaking. Given that fact, this album is definitely not one of the best ever made, but it is way better than most of the garbage heard on pop and rap radio lately. Hopefully rap music will climb out of its dark hole and become diverse and creative again someday soon. Until then, go listen to some Public Enemy, Run DMC, Tupac, Beastie Boys, or any classic rap if you want to be exposed to quality rap music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Aiyo, why do people say that he's a snitch? No, for real, I'm just wondering what the story is. Did he rat out his homeboy or what?Anyway, this crap sells because of Fifty's marketing genius.

Lyrically, there are only 3-4 songs worth listening to (\\"Baltimore Love thing\\", \\"when the Guns Come out\\", \\"Toy Soldiers\\"...). Bu even there his rhymes are awful at places. For example on \\"Baltimore Love thing\\" on one bar he rhymes only 2 words - \\"you\\" and \\"too\\".

How can we, as individuals of society, allow such a talent-less wannabe rapper become so successful, simply because he was a drug dealer who got shot nine times. Fine, if the music actually had substance, I would understnad, but it simply doesn't. The tracks all sound the same, in their profane, mysoginistic and voilent way. 50 cent simply doesn't have the interllectual capability to write anything slighlty meaningful or sinifcant, and will hopefully be forgotten with tomorrow's waste. He is probably the most brain numb rapper out there.A good beat does not justify an album's existence.

As a reference let's say that the 'devil' is Curtis Jackson A.K.A 50 Cent. Being bad as (not bad-ass), and make music for the money and not for the music, the 'devil' will get you by screwing over your wisdom and IQ making it less than 20, you'll never escape the wrath of 50 Cent; ever!

On the other hand, this CD is not even half as good as his first CD which was still a heap of garbage. Now he has \\"blessed\\" us with his life story and a movie to top it. Its too bad that Tupac never got the opportunities that 50 Cent has received. Rap music died with Tupac and it needs someone to revive it. 50 Cent is not the answer to the dying rap music scene. However, he seems to think that he is. I listened to his unreleased CD called \\"The Power of the Dollar\\" which was never released due to bootlegging. That CD was actually really good. However, the fame got to him. 50 Cent can't sell a CD without standing on the front with his shirt off. If sex really does sell, than that may be the only thing that 50 Cent has going for him because his lyrics aren't going to sell his music. God help us all."},{"rating":"1","title":"this album was a massacre, to my ears...","review":"this album proves that mainstream culture has a low iq supporting garbage like this, i don't need to get into detail why this album is awful, it really does speak for itself. if you want to listen a good rap album check out the new Common CD, thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS","review":"Wanna be GANGSTA raper 50 Cent is nothing but garbage he is one of the worst raper i ever heard ad this CD which he claims to be better than the 1st.

You have to admit that J-Lo does not have vocal talent, or songwriting abilities (that's why she doesn't write her own songs). Yet she is achieving big success with her second rate singles and albums.Now take 50 Cent. While I do enjoy some rap artists, (Outkast and some Eminem come to mind while typing) I feel that when you are rapping, you should have a style of speaking, not just mumbling, what 50 Cent does in all of his songs.The lyrics are also very weak. Disagree with me? Look up The Beatles, Coldplay, Kate Bush, anybody with talent - look up the lyrics, and compare them to 50 Cent's (obviously there's bad language). See the difference?Rap can succeed with excellent beats. However, 50 Cent's beats are rather dull and unexciting, playing over and over again.As a whole, this is a very poor album which was not enjoyable to listen to.0/10 - Terrible"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some of the greats","review":"Wow im amazed some of you havent mentioned some of the other rappers who helped the whole rap concept and made it mainstream..MC8, Easy E, Sir mix alot..(Kinda)..Erase E, Boss Ballin, Too short, DJ Quik, Outkast,salt n pepa, JJ Fad and many more helped paved a way for new artist to create and recreate in some cases these artists masterpieces into something new. Then comes along some crap hole like 50 cent whos awesome marketing team thought up a way to promote him quickly to destroy everything artitst had worked to accomplish..Every song or album 50 cent produces is another brick fallin from that empire that we call rap..Every building has its breaking point..you take away to many bricks it falls..same with rap you take away all the talent and VOILA its gone.

You don't suppose there is some second sexual meaning there, do you? Maybe some of the AIDS and rape problems in our society can be traced back to moron \\"artists\\" like this one who include lyrics like this in their albums. I really don't have anything personally against rap. It's just that I have never heard of a rap song (that I can recall), that actually had meaning. They all sing about violence or sex.

Just listen to the boring production. Production is half the battle in rap/hip-hop because it has to make up for the fact that rappers usually don't SING A MELODY. The instrumentals are all horrible, with the exception of the excellent standout track, 'Outta Control'. The only time I listen to this album is to hear 'Outta Control'. It's hot.As for 50's lyrical ability.......It's certainly not as good as it was on his debut album. Yes, he took 9 bullets and he deserves to brag all he wants. But that doesn't make him an excellent rapper. Why can't people distinguish good music from bad music? If you want to hear EXCELLENT production with good meaningful lyrics, listen to Kanye West or Outkast. However, if you are satisfied with this dull crap, keep buying into it.

There is only a handful of songs I like on the album, which are \\"GatMan & Robbin,\\" \\"GunZ Come Out,\\" \\"Hate it or Love it,\\" and \\"Piggy Bank.\\" The rest I feel were just filler. Also, 50 Cent thinks way too much of himself, thinking he is this big #1 rapper, and trying to start something with all these other rappers... it's just stupid.

If you are looking for Sleeping Beauty in a dynamic, clear recoding with 2 jam-packed CD's for the price of one, I suggested looking for Sleeping Beauty as conducted by Antal Dorati and remastered by RCA. Dorati's stressed stings, and gutty attack on the music bring out the beauty of the Russian-ness of the ballet.

When CDs came along, I wanted a newer, digital recording to replace my vinyl. However, none of the newer interpretations I listened to could match these by Steinberg and the Pittsburgh Symphony.

Rundgren's terrific songwriting skills are shown liberally here, as are his pure pop music sensibilities. Unquestionably one of the great \\"undiscovered\\" musical giants of our time -- here's hoping this multi-talented gentleman receives one-tenth the appreciation he deserves while he's still around for providing (already) two lifetimes worth of incredible music.

So what's different about this book?What I liked about her approach, specifically, was how she gets the reader to look more deeply at the dog he or she has with the intent to understand who that dog is first. With that understanding, Cantrell leads the reader to learn how to make better connections with the puppy in a way that makes sense to the puppy. Hence, no force is required in this training method because you are not inadvertently pitting yourself against your dog--but rather working with your dog's natural energy and inclination.Love the silent training section. That alone is worth the price of the book. If your puppy is driving you nuts (and hopefully before your puppy is driving you nuts) read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top of the heap recording of complete Beethoven sonatas","review":"When American Record Guide did an overview of Beethoven piano sonata recordings, it singled out two complete sets: Wilhelm Kempff and Claude Frank. For my taste, Frank's is the set to have. He's the rare artist who seems equally attuned to all Beethoven's moods, whether it's the impetuous fireworks of the \\"Appassionata\\" or the genial \\"Adagio grazioso\\" from Op. 31, No. 1.It's sometimes whispered among pianists that Frank is a tad sloppy, but don't let that put you off this stellar recording. Here, Frank is every bit as finger perfect as more celebrated names, and he adds a flair and obvious love for the music that shines throughout the entire set.The sound is good late 1960's vintage, and the price is low. You'll find no better bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent bargain","review":"I agree with the positive comments of all the reviewers below. A couple of points that that might interest prospective purchasers:1. Most of the repeats, but not all, are observed.2. Although I agree that the level of playing and interpretation is VERY high, I found Frank's mannerism of anticipating the right hand with the left occurred often enough to be annoying.That said, this set will give a great deal of pleasure, but I agree that I wouldn't want it to be the only one in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beethoven Sonats, Claude Frank","review":"I purchased this particular set to go with the Teaching Company course on the complete Beethoven sonatas. I have enjoyed the recordings very much because of the wonderful technique of the performer and the familiarity that comes from having heard the same recordings discussed in the course. The set includes 10 disks. The sonatas are not in any particular order and are typically 3 to a disk. (Each disk is approximately one hour long.) Track numbers are not on the disks themselves, but are in the booklet that comes with the set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Several things send this complete set to the head of the class. First, Claude Frank plays these sonatas with vitality and taste, and - above all - consistency. There is no weak link here. This is a strong, cohesive overview of the 32. Second, the original LPs were a disaster, so having them on CD is a blessing in its own right. Tied to this, lastly, is the remastering job. These sound dynamite for late 1960s recordings. Lots of warmth in the piano, both in the playing AND the recording. For sound, I compared this to the Brendel digital set. I think this sounds better, both on my Bose home stereo and in my car. For about $40, this set is a steal for collectors as well as being a great starter set for the Beethoven sonata neophyte."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beethoven lives forever","review":"Like one other reviewer I bought this set after listening to Robert Greenberg's lecture series., even though I already have the Goode recordings. I must say that it is quite good, and if you don't have Goode's complete Beethoven's piano sonatas, this is a much less expensive alternative. Maybe the recording quality of the Goode set is better,after all, technology is much more advanced, but only slightly. In some cases, I can't even tell the difference between Goode and Frank. For the Beethoven afficionado, it's worth having both, or even Fischer, or Brendel...."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the originals","review":"As good as the originals.

It is the story of Patrick \\"Irish\\" Donnelly's experience in Vietnam, juxtaposed against his current post-service life. Probably one of the more accessible Vietnam War stories you'll read. Mort limits the number the characters, allowing us to feel invested in their lives and in some cases, deaths. One reviewer of the book called it a \\"fictionalized memoir.\\" Maybe.

The plot is highly predictable and the scare factor didn't live up to what I expected based on other reviews. After looking up the \\"whatever-happened to\\" details of the careers of the two young lead actors in the film, Lon McCallister and Allene Roberts, I was not surprised that their acting careers produced little beyond this film. However, much on the positive side, I was reminded of the outstanding acting ability of Edward G. Robinson who redeemed a pedstrian role with the same intensity he poured into his other, more memorable ones. Robinson was a consummate actor who deserved more honor than he received in his career. If you are into B movies of the 1940's, you will probably find this one enjoyable but not likely a favorite.

The hero tells his girlfriend that he'll have to \\"bust open\\" the \\"red house\\" to get to the bottom of the mystery. Hmmmm. Robinson's character seems to have a sexual interest in his adopted daughter. All that and a big bad wolf character that seems to hang out in the woods all day (and night) looking for stray girls.

A tour de force performance from the great Edward G. Robinson backed up by the bewitching eyes of Judith Anderson and a chance to see Rory Calhoun and Julie London as kids...if anything as sultry as Julie London was ever a kid!

First malfunction was when the unit's disc eject mechanism broke. Second malfunction was when the unit started to experience startup troubles and would repeatedly cycle through its power-on/power-off sequence. The latest malfunction involves an annoying high-pitched whine emitting from the speakers when the unit is playing in Video 1 or Video 2 mode. Unlike other owners who experienced this problem, I am not willing to open the casing and poke around at the unit's innards. I'm just fed up with this system and would discourage any prospective buyer from considering this unit or any future models branded Sony Dream System."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay","review":"Maybe it's because I'm not doing this daily, or because I'm still waiting for the \\"big bang.\\" Either way, I'm still working on it.

The description/review by Jennifer Sivolella is actually for another Chet Baker disc - this one is a 5-disc set with the same name \\"Time After Time\\" (UPC 8712155121241). There lies the confusion. The covers are completely different. Jennifer's review appears on both discs. Like I said, the 2011 disc has only 6 tracks - the 5-disc set has exactly 100 tracks (20 on each disc). I couldn't get much more information on the 2011 single disc. I have not listened to the 2011 issue. I'm giving it a 4-star review simply because I'm a big fan of C.B. If you use the UPC code I cited above on Amazon, you will see the detailed listing of the 5-disc set. I went ahead and order the 5-disc set. Hey, 100 tracks of C.B. for about $8. How can you lose?

The new baby shows up at the very end of this story, so admittedly, that is not the main focus of this book. (The book might be better titled, \\"The Berenstain Bears' New Bed\\".) If you want a book that gives your child details on a new baby (what happens at the hospital, how to breastfeed, how to help take care of it, etc.), then you obviously need to buy a different book.

One of the reviewers even asked \\"What universe is this book from?\\" Yes, this book is written in another universe: it's written in a universe where bears wear overalls and moo moos! These people need to be reading something from \\"What to Expect When Mommy's Expecting and You Want Your Two-Year-Old To Experience The Miracle of Childbirth.\\"This is a nice children's book, which has more to do with Small Bear adjusting to life as a big brother and not being an only-child (or an only-cub in this case). If the former is what you're looking for, I highly recommend \\"The Berenstain Bears Meet The Birds & The Bees.\\"Relax and enjoy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't this a book about a new baby?","review":"I was disappointed to find out that this book had very little to do with having a child adjust to a new baby. The majority of the book is about Papa Bear and Little Bear going into the woods to make a new bed because the old one was too small. Little bear kept asking what would happen to his new bed and when he returned there was a new baby in his old bed. I'm just not sure I thought this was a good book to introduce the concept of a new baby. Although I like the series I would avoid this book for its purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for showing what happens when new baby arrives","review":"I was dissappointed in the book because I was looking for something to read to my 2 year old which would help her understand what things would be like when new baby gets home. It doesn't even scratch the surface of that topic. It mostly talks about the older child outgrowing his bed and getting a new one so that the new baby can have his old bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best book for a sibling-to-be","review":"We were given this book for our son when I was pregnant with our second child. It's not one I would recommend to any other expectant family -- you can really tell it was written in the early 1970s, its description of the birth of a new baby is so strangely indirect (the pregnancy is discussed very little -- the focus of the story is mainly on building a new bed for the older sibling!) My son also found it upsetting that the son and father in the book go off for the day, and return home to find that, surprise, the baby has been born while they were gone -- he said, \\"Didn't the mommy go to the hospital? Didn't the daddy help her? Was she all by herself?\\" Not the best choice for your older sibling-to-be -- we recommend Joanna Cole's books I'm a Big Brother and I'm a Big Sister instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I want my child to understand about new siblings","review":"This is a spoiler, but. . .The little boy bear realizes his bed is too small. His dad takes him out to build a new bed. He keeps asking what will happen to his new bed, but he never gets an answer. They get home that afternoon/evening to find the new baby in his bed (that he slept in just that morning). The baby smacks him in the nose. Then one or two pages later the book is over.We were given this book to help our daughter as we prepare for a new baby. Foolishly, I read it aloud to her before I read it myself. I was horrified. They never prepared the older sibling, and the new baby literally just took over his place without warning. We're looking for other books, but this one will not remain in our library."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed!","review":"As a lover of Berenstain Bears books since I was a small child, I was horrified to read this book! All the other reviews capture all that is wrong with this book. We have relied on the Berenstain Bears to get through to our 5 year old for years, so I trusted that this book would help explain a new addition to our family. I could not have been more wrong! It turned into a discussion on all that was wrong with the book- Very confusing for a child. The Berenstains should SERIOUSLY consider rewriting this book as a service to their loyal fans. I must say, this book is atypical and the rest of the series is FABULOUS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Case is too tight","review":"We purchased this case for our Samsung A640 phone with Sprint service and it is too tight for the pone. The directions say \\"your case may seem snug when you first try to insert your phone, this is normal and it is important for you not to force the phone into the case but rather insert it gradually. The case will quickly stretch to conform to the phone's shape.\\" We followed these directions and it is still too tight. When the phone is inserted, the case depresses the photo button, turning on this function and disallowing the use of the phone for talking. Also, my wife liked this case because of the stylish stitching, well, it started to come undone immediately.

He directed himself both recording and edition, only letting in the final product the best of his judgement.Though he tends to overact sometimes in presentation of each suite (the organ transcription played by himself introducing suite No. 6 does not add much), his insights and connection with the creative process gleaned from Bach in each introduction are relevant.Interestingly, the sound take with microphones somewhat far from the stage, coupled with the stone vaulted ambience, make for a not so crisp, detailed recording, yet Rostropovich masterfully renders the different musical layers essential to the structured Bach music in a transparent way in spite of the environment.This is a must have for every serious lover of essential music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bach Cello Suites No.1~6 by Rostropovich","review":"I meant to listen to Bach suites and I finally purchased. Unfortunatelly Rostropovich passing on. I am taking cello lesson and I can say that this CD is true classic and true cellist of dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not cut it technically","review":"I don't play the cello, but I imagine that these pieces must be very difficult given that Rostrapovich's recording is plagued with inaccurate intonation. When listening to this recording I find myself listening for the missed notes (practically every other one in some pieces) instead of to the music. In the liner notes Rostrapovich says he believes this to be the greatest music ever written. Unfortunately, the special affinity he has for this music doesn't come through in the performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rostropovich's personality gets in the way of the playing","review":"It's not that he pulls tempi about. It's just that it is incredibly lifeless and mechanical in many parts, without much phrasing at all. It's hard to believe that a musician of this distinction could come up with a recording like this. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"If you are going to purchase this collection, you've probably heard them before and want to own them. I can listen to them again and again, but admittedly this kind of classical is not for everyone.I'm not an expert on the variations and renditions of the cello suites, like some of these reviewers, but i can say that i am very familiar and a regular listener of classical music, and i find them very beautiful to listen to. The quality of recording is very high, so it you have a high end sound system, you may take great delight in listening to the suites again and again.Worth the $$."},{"rating":"2","title":"I lost my Zappa cherry with this album","review":"If you've heard of Frank Zappa, it's likely you've heard of \\"Don't Eat the Yellow Snow.\\" This is the album that's got it, in a rambling, always changing, keep-you-off-balance Arctic epic about Nanook and friends. The music is good enough; it's the lyrics in the four opening tracks that is the true grabber. Musically, listen to \\"Uncle Remus\\" for some great piano work. I entered the world of FZ with this album in 1977, and I never looked back. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great barking Biscut","review":"You'll laugh, you will cry, you might even get offended.

This album is a must in each well classified collection of FZ. I still miss him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Zappa, proving his song writing genius once again.","review":"This album is a jazzy, funky, instrumental compilation, with off beat guitar riffs, and unexpected Zappa monologues. Zappa's best album in my opinion, and with the way every song tells a story and blends together, possibly the best album of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic Upgrade","review":"The 2012 remaster project has given FZs entire catalog a significent sonic upgrade. The early albums, and the releases from the '70s seem to benefit the most; there is greatly improved seperation & detail, and the nearly 20-year sonic veil that clouded these iconic titles has been lifted. The Ryko releases (as well as my Japanese imports) are audibly inferior, and any serious fan will find these remasters well worth the upgrade. Of course, the better your system, the more apparent the improvements.

We listened to it for a bit, and I bought it a few days later because it is so good. I would recomend to anyone this album or any other of Frank Zappa albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apostrophe - Frank Zappa","review":"Every song on this CD shows the incredible genius of Frank Zappa, in my opinion one of the top 3 electric guitar players of all time. He was backed up by other rock greats such as Ansley Dunbar on drums, Jack Bruce on bass, and Sugar Cane Harris and Jean-Luc Ponty on violins, among others - as he should be, as not many artists of his time were capable of playing Zappa's music.The only disappointing feature of this CD is that this version does not have one of the songs I bought the CD for - Dynamo Hum."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd Zappa album in my life, and still a fave...","review":"Being a middle child in life, my parents ignored me. It's a strange way of starting a review, but bear with me. One of the benefits of being a middle child is that since your parents completely ignore you, you are left free to do pretty much anything that you want, including listening to music that your parents normally wouldn't allow you to. Hence, Mr. Zappa. It was almost a badge of honor to have a Zappa album, as people felt your intelligence was superior to theirs. This was my 2nd Zappa album, and I still dig it. It may not be as avant garde as Weasels Ripped My Flesh or as musically complex as Hot Rats, but so what? It's still Zappa, and it's pretty damn good. Father O'Blivion, St. Alphonso's Pancake Breakfast, and Stink Foot are fantastic songs, ones that Zappa did in concert quite often. Zappa rules, but you already knew that."},{"rating":"2","title":"' !","review":"Apostrophe is a great second or first album to listen to if you're trying to get into Zappa. This andOvernite Sensationare both great places to get your feet wet.Top Tracks: The first half of the LP all plays like one long song so its hard to pick top tracks for this album. To be honest the entire thing is brilliant. As I said before this is very accessible and even non-Zappa fans should like Uncle Remus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zappa in top form","review":"What a great record this is. It came from, I think, the very best period of Frank Zappa. All the band is in top form, and the compositions are all very interesting and funny at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"very safe zappa for those who fear the bizarre","review":"This cd is fun. Simple as that. Seems as though FZ wanted to broaden his fan base with this release and the follow up OVERNIGHT SENSATION. I think frank did broaden his fanbase, but FZ was too creative to keep his medium within those boundries and he went into overdrive in the late seventies 80's. Great songs, and great fusion of musisicains... like george duke, jean luc ponty, chester thompson and ruth underwood to name a FEW...even a guest appearance by the famed CREAM bass player Jack Bruce. Great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"is this zappa's best album?","review":"Maybe so. It is also probably his best band. FZ has often said that music shouldn't get in the way of good lyrics. He has also practiced (though not explicitly said) the opposite. This album is the exception. The two combine in a way rarely found: Humour and some of the most sophisticated music you're ever likely to hear come together here. I have a real problem if I have to compare this album to \\"we're only in it for the money\\" or \\"200 Motels\\" or \\"Live in New York\\", or \\"Hot Rats\\". But it may just be the best. I dicovered FZ through this album when I was 15. I have never looked back since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comik Debris","review":"I enjoy this CD very much. Frank Zappa was a talented muscian and songwriter. This album shows how good he was as both. All of the songs are upbeat and sardonic, which makes a protest song like UNCLE REMUS most effective. The characters have a cartoon quality about them. Nanook, Alphonzo and Father O'Blivion demonstrate FZ as a great story-teller. Not to be outdone by anyone, APOSTROPHE includes a great guitar jam. If you are interested in fun, entertaining music which does not sacrifice sophsitication, or if you are interested in guitar music of the early seventies this CD will interest you. It's proabably as good a place as any to start listening to FZ, in case you have been putting that off, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very good common sense summaries, low on scripture usage","review":"This book does have quite a bit of actual Christian common sense content in the chapters; however, the actual chapters might have only two or three scripture references in them. To me, a book about \\"What God wants\\" should be quoting scripture a little more often to back up the content; scripture should be the \\"meat and potatoes\\", and in this book, it isn't referenced very often.To his credit, Michael Scanlan does an excellent job in the summary sections after each of the nine chapters trying to give actionable steps relation to each chapter. Again, though, it only gives you the \\"big picture\\", and has no supplemental scripture to reflect on while praying about the topic in the certain chapter.I'm not giving this book five stars due to the lack of scripture content to accompany the content in the chapters as well as the actionable summary items. However, I'm giving this two stars for the great summary sections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Entertainment!!!","review":"This is a great family film that everybody can enjoy.

If you look at this book, you see that none of the predictions on \\"earth changes\\" came true! The result is that the whole book is a waste of time. The only value here is in seeing how far a clearly intelligent person (the author) will go to defend a psychic's record when he has put his faith in that psychic. He jumps through hoops to reinterpret everything so that maybe it really is true afterall. Pathetic. The fact that the book is published by Edgar Cayce's foundation helps explain why it is so sympathetic to a ridiculous collection of incorrect predictions."},{"rating":"1","title":"help the axis of evil has shifted!!!","review":"the problem wiht psychic prediction is that they can often be a bit 'symbolic'.

Not to offend anyone who did enjoy this book, but I did not like the writing style at all. Very basic and unprofessional with the word 'confidence' written over and over so many times that it was annoying. There were also other words used twice in the same paragraph which surely could have used a better synonym... it made it very difficult to try to figure out if there was really any substance to the book because I was busy trying to figure out if the author had used a good editor. Not sure that I will finish reading the book or not. Oh, and also, I bought it in 'good used condition' from a seller on Amazon, and it had a sticker \\"clearance .49 cents\\" on the cover!

I feel as though Mr. Morris were very rushed when he wrote this book. It spans many years, and speeds through the Salem Witch Trials at the end of the book, which I felt could probably be a separate book by itself. I still enjoyed this and learned a lot about history. I do feel it was a bit preachy at times, though. I'm looking forward to reading more in the series. I hear it gets better!

The story of the two friends never rises above the mediocre.The characters are so roughly sketched in that they certainly do not live in the book though the reader may be able to find similar characters in Alcott's other works. Rates high on my list only for the good, old fashioned values it tries to express but would probably be rejected by todays readers as being too preachy, a fault that does not plague Alcott's better efforts. On the whole a must only if you are a staunch fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this book.","review":"I love this book. Took a star off for the typical Alcott preachiness. But I read it off the Gutenberg project and loved it so much I bought it off Amazon. It's so sweet.

Sounds boring, but the characters are interesting and sweet. And they're believable.

It was a bit deflating that there was no book-specific cover art or back cover material--it is a standard, rather ugly cover and the back text advertises the publisher itself. But I guess there's no arguing with that part. Far worse, my daughter found a minefield of typos in the first few pages, which proved very distracting. Then she found that about 1 1/2 pages from 3-4 were repeated verbatim on pages 5-6. She showed me both problems and she was absolutely right: the printing process had gone completely haywire. There was no reason to expect these issues were confined to the first few pages, and we had lost faith in the whole edition. Regretfully, we have sent the book back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovable, But a Little Childish.","review":"This book is an interesting improvement on the clasic nursery rhyme.With its twist of humor and sadness, Jack and Jill emphasises the value of friendship and the comfort that simple creativity can give.In spite of all these good qualities, I would rate this book as far from Alcott's best. It is too predictable and rather disapointing. Although less \\"preachy\\" than many of Alcott's books, the sermons are more direct and lack the pleasing maturity that gives such works as Little Women, An Old Fashoned Girl, and Eight Cousins their originality.All considered it is still a sweet, cuddle-up-by-the-fire book.

Sawallisch shows that he is a fine interpreter of Hindemith's scores, most notably in the Mathis der Maler, which is emotionally intense, gripping, and yet, not nearly as loud or bombastic as other accounts I've heard. The Philadelphia Orchestra truly shines in this recording, playing with as much warmth and technical skill as you'd expect from the likes of the Berlin Philharmonic, Vienna Philharmonic or Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. Anyone interested in a fine introduction to Hindemith's major orchestral works won't be disappointed with this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tract Porter Artesian Road Salad Server","review":"Very delicate, I would never have use these if you still have children in the home.

For us younger types you'll see this movie has had an influence on many films and cable programs of the past several years in many ways, but not in terms of its ultimate outcome. This movie doesn't try to secretly seduce you off the path, there is no secret line you can walk to be sophisticatedly addicted. No wink wink nods of trying to glorify the same bad habits that some shows obstensibly are trying to portray in a negative light, no late night cigarette drag examining life through marketing spin and glossy self delusion. I don't know for example if the people behind AMC's Madmen really want to portray things as bleak as this movie ultimately does, but even if they did the studios would ultimately steer them in a different direction to make things more pallatable and to keep those boxed-sets moving off the store shelves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"I watched this movie because I love Jack Lemmon. Mostly I like his comedies, like The Odd Couple and Some Like it Hot. Although this wasn't a comedy, I still enjoyed every bit of it for its brilliant acting and powerful message to alcoholics everywhere.Joe Clay can not stop drinking, and meets a girl who becomes an alcoholic too. Joe finally destroys his father-in-law's flower garden just trying to find his hidden booze, and ends up in AA, the leader of which is played by Jack Klugman (another of my favorite actors). His wife is unwilling to attend the meetings, and thus, never recovers.This is a wonderful movie that should inspire any alcoholics out there to never take another drink. It is also really well acted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest","review":"This is one of the best films to discuss and age old disease. Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick are superb!

Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick become alcoholics and separate after having a child. Lemmon sobers up. Remick does not. I had a drinking problem in my 20s. I should have given this film more thought. Lemmon was a great actor, the average businessman struggling to make it in the city, funny and tragic at the same time. The title was taken from a poem by Ernest Dowson. \\"Vitae Summa Brevis\\" laments the brevity of life: \\"They are not long, the days of wine and roses.

The film shows a couple who meet, fall in love, marry and have a little girl. The disease of alcoholism smacks into them like a freight train. The husband finds AA, the wife does not.

(Tender Mercies is probably the best movie on this subject). The narrative arc is somewhat overwrought. The Jack Lemmon character goes into delirium tremens twice! He does this not after he goes cold turkey and as a result of withdrawal symptoms but after one night of taking up drinking again. That doesn't make sense. Lee Remick's fondness for chocolate as a precursor to possible tendencies to alcoholism I think has been pretty much discredited. Nevertheless, you do wind up caring what happens to the characters. The supporting cast is great. I would recommend the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Title Song Won Oscar: The Movie Was Good, Too","review":"I knew the title song before seeing the movie.

Beautiful in many ways where every single track is a masterpiece of composition. Now this album mini-lp sleeve packaging is a work of art in itself and like most art, costs a bundle. The sound quality is patchy and the volume levels are higher for some tracks than they are for others. As this version of the disc is not remastered either, you'll have to decide whether or not to pay the much higher price for this disc if you either already have the remastered version of this or even any other version if the packaging is not important to you. If you are new to Kate's work and don't yet have this, you may have to decide if sound quality is important to you as well. Otherwise, although the tracks are good and the album itself is worth getting, I'm not sure if it makes economic sense to pay so much just for the mlps. Just my 2cts worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but Not Spectacular","review":"This is my least-favorite Kate album. My favorite one is THE DREAMING. I know that the majority of Kate fans consider HOUNDS OF LOVE to be her best work, but I guess I'm in the minority. The first side of the album is more pop-oriented, and also more enjoyable. The best cuts are the first two. The second side of the album is certainly interesting, but overall not terribly exciting. Kate gets a bit too arty for her own good at places, and I don't find these excesses all that ingratiating. Basically, I just feel this album lacks a punch that makes you want to come back for more. Of all the Kate albums, this is one I seldom come back to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE REMASTER!","review":"For some reason, Toshiba did not include the 18-track 1997 EMI remaster in this package.Unless you just HAVE TO HAVE this mini-sleeve version, you would be spending 4X for inferior audio and six less tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Potent and Powerful","review":"\\"Hounds of Love\\" is a classic example of Kate Bush at her best. The dreamy beat of \\"Running Up That Hill\\" was Kate's first hit in the states and the first song that drew me to her as an artist. Side one (we used to have two sides back in those days) is a collection of singles including the title song, \\"Running Up That Hill\\", \\"The Big Sky\\", and \\"Cloudbursting\\". Side two is an arch of songs strung together. The highlight for me on this side is \\"Waking The Witch\\", which has you/her waking up from a good dream only to find that you are living in a nightmare. This is a cerebral, haunting tour de force from one of pop music's most powerful and original voices."},{"rating":"2","title":"I admit my bias first of all...","review":"I believe Kate Bush is quite possible the greatest female artist England has ever produced. Never have a known an artist so perfectly entwine emotion, intrigue, realism, poetry, surrealism, musical mastery, lyrical genius and vocal exception.Kate is like an whirling mix of every art form imaginable, the stuff you like, recognise and which speaks for you as well as the stuff the draws on different and not so favoured emotions and responses. All this with a liberal sprinkling of good old fashioned, British eccentrism. Every time I play one of Kate's albums it's like visiting an art gallery and seeing old masters along with peices I have to work a little harder on to get to the message.This album is no exception in her vast catologue of intrigue and mystery. It is sublime and addictive. A sensual pleasure and a emotive joy. Classic! Did I mention that this lady just happens to be ethereally beautiful too? So the intrigue grows and the mystery unfolds without end......"},{"rating":"1","title":"I must humbly disagree with the other reviews","review":"I must be crazy but I think that this CD is simply awful! Maybe it is Kate's style but this CD to me is about as enjoyable as listening to fingernails on a blackboard.

A real Excederin headache for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received","review":"CD never arrived. Consider this a loss and a lesson learned.

Eerie, surreal and penetrating even after sixteen years of listening to it.As many reviews have pointed to this is a concept album; the first side deals with unconditional love from various points of view. The second side (called the ninth wave) deals with dreaming, hallucinations, and death. This album has many layers, from powerful imagery to intoxicating musical atmospheres to eye-opening philosophical lyrics.EMI also reissued this CD with six bonus tracks, which were not included in the first release. Although only available on import, the track \\"Under the Ivy\\" is worth the price justification. Other Bonus tracks include: The Big Sky (meteorigical mix), Running Up That Hill (12' mix), Be Kind To My Mistakes, Burning Bridge, and My Lagan Love.A Masterpiece!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than before!!","review":"I was very glad to find Kate had re-released Hounds of love with extra tracks!! For a start, Under the ivy is one of THE Best Kate songs ever made. Period. Be kind to my mistakes and Burning bridge are 2 brilliant upbeat tracks and Lagan Love is simply gorgeous. The remixes are good enough. If you liked the original album then this is worth re-buying for the new songs, also there are lots of new Kate pics, which is an added bonus!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can see why many would hail this as her best but...","review":"Kate Bush is a dear to me. Such a child-like figure with her playful voice and her flair for theatrics. (Although her subject matter can be dark or sexual, not exactly suitable for children's ears). Every album I have of hers has made me fall in love with her style. Even though this isn't my favorite album of hers musically, it nevertheless has the Kate Bush charm I've come to expect. For some strange reason I had a hard time getting into this, partly because I had just come off \\"The Dreaming\\" experience and found \\"The Hounds of Love\\" to be less invigorating. Now, after 4 listens I've come to respect this album and I place it 4th on my Kate Bush list; after \\"The Dreaming\\",\\"Lionheart\\", and \\"The Red Shoes\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kate saves us from drowning","review":"I bought this lp (remember those?) the day it was released.

But this album could be released tomorrow and would easily garner the critical praise and audience excitement and that it did in the mid-80s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for life","review":"I grew up on Kate Bush's music food, and today it still nourishes the soul. Somebody please give it up for the maestros Paddy and John Carder Bush whose phenomenal extraordinary skill with musical instruments, vocals and sheer orchestral skill add the unforgettable taste that Kate's music has. My favourite tracks are - all of them, but in particular the haunting sound of Watching You Without Me, and the contrasting Beautiful, lively Celtic sound of Jig of Life. If you're serious about serious music, Buy it and also The Red Shoes, Kick Inside, and Never Forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music to make you float above the clouds!","review":"One of the best Kate albums of all time.

The CD feels like a play is being enacted in front of you. The songs are very visual and you can \\"see\\" the escalation. The instruments are wonderful. The strong strokes of the cellos and the little ticklingof the piano keeps on various songs. \\"And Dream of Sheep\\" has this light delicate playing of the piano with suttle pauses and the sounds of heavy sound thunder every so often, for effect. This is a CD to enjoy while lying in down with great sound muffling head phones. You can close your eyes and enjoy how different instruments come and go in each song. \\"Running up the Hill\\" has to be my favorite of this CD. The strings are delightful and galvanizing while the rest of the music gallops up that hill. \\"Waking the Witch\\" is startling after listening to the more mellow songs before it. Try it, you will see what I mean. That song is a little dificult to describe. It has an interesting backbeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Kate (How sweet the sound)","review":"If you thought the LP or the original CD sounds good, This totally remastered version is incredible, Plus the addition of 6 bonus tracks makes it cool for the collector.

She is the best. If you don't like her, go listen to someone \\"more accessible.\\" I suppose that would be Celine, or Mariah or maybe even Britney Spears. Whatever. This woman runs circles around Tori and Sarah (both of whom should be paying Kate royalties for stealing her act). Hounds of Love has the most amazing batch of songs, and the b-side which is called The Ninth Wave is a haunting cycle of songs that remain as one of her crowning achievements. Yes, The Dreaming and Never For Ever are brilliant, but Hounds of Love is simply a masterpiece. Six years and counting to the next one... it will be worth the wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply outstanding!!","review":"Definitely the best Kate Bush album, combining all of her eccentricity and talent.

As an adult, I had to reunite with such a nostalgic piece of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Lionheart","review":"I first discovered Kate Bush when she released Lionheart. I can no longer play that old vinyl album, so I thought I would buy it in CD. After logging on and reading the reviews, I decided to by Hounds of Love instead. If it's better than Lionheart, it must be great. I am very disappointed. She does not display her vocal range on this CD, which was one of the things I originally found fascinating in her music. I didn't find the haunting or varied melodies I expected. And only a few tracks demonstrated her abilities with lyrics. Several of the reviews suggested her music had 'matured' with this CD. My impression is that she dumbed it down, or made it more generic, to appeal to a wider audience. I'm going back to Lionheart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"This used CD was in perfect condition.

The plot line is good, heroine prejudges hero due to her past superficial attitude. (Who says construction workers have no ambition are not educated, what do they teach you all in the USA?) Hero rightly prejudges heroine for her high maintence, superficial ways. I did not root for them to get together, I wished there was a twist at the end where the guy dumps the woman permanently after finding out that she only finds him suitable, even tho she is very attracted to him after she finds out he used to earn big bucks and has 2 degrees.A weak link in a series that is not really about the romance and more about the town."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not well written","review":"I read this book without having read the others in the series. The story had enough background to stand alone. The plot was good. Two people are brought back to their hometown to care for aged and or ailing grandparents. The problem with the book was the author's lack of character development. All of the characters in the book were flat and one dimensional. The heroine was very difficult to like. She liked the guy was wouldn't date him because he was a construction worker. Without ever having any in depth conversations with him, she decided he lacked ambition. He was likeable enough but pegged her as high maintenanced, which she was, but he dated her anyway. At the end, he considered going back to a corporate culture he hated to please her...A lot of characters were sterotypes and not very plausible...Story just didn't live up to the potential of the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic!","review":"It's wonderful to see Indigo Girls in their younger days, really rockin' out and showing their passion and amazing skills.

So recently I decided to purchase their early years DVD \\"Live at the Uptown Lounge\\" from 1990. I found it to be a disappointment. There was no back-up band, the two female voices were not as harmonized as in later years, they were dressed poorly, and the sound/picture quality was not as good. The two singers are young and enthusiastic in this DVD concert, as are their audience members. But overall, not worth the purchase price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Film","review":"I bought this film for my grandson and didn't expect to enjoy it so much myself. It's a sweet film, all the more interesting being it is based on the true story of Rinty.

It is not based on the actual Rin Tin Tin line and is a total shame on the trademark name of Rin Tin Tin. This is a lawsuit in the making and I only hope the owners of the REAL Rin Tin TIn do something about it. You can go to the actual Rin Tin Tin web site and find out that the makers of this movie knew at the time that they were violating the trademark and released it anyway.

Amazon is combining reviews for this movie, although multiple products are available. I am reviewing the 1 DVD version. This is exactly the same thing as the 2 DVD version, except the 2 DVD version has a second disc that has a dts track. So basically with that more expensive DVD, you are getting 2 of the same thing. Weird. Just go with the cheaper 1 DVD version unless you really really want dts. The picture is very high quality. This is a high bit rate low compression DVD. Excellent picture and sound. And yes, it will play just fine in the USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I thought I was getting an absurdly awesome killer robot film but what I got instead was an absurdly awesome killer robot film with a really fantastic plot along with it.

Lots of features, really cool sounding stereo sound from the stereo speakers. But.... I use my cell phone average 1500 minutes a month. The slide does not hold up. The phone sections separated on one side, I got a sim card failure message on the phone screen and the off button would not turn the phone off.

Having spent my whole life here, I often wondered \\"what's the story behind that house/park/street/building?\\" Now I have the answers. The section on Millionaires Row (Grant Street) and Cheesman Park are especially interesting.

Get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ghosts of Denver Capitol Hill","review":"I was so excited when on Ghost Adventures I saw Phil Goldstein talking about his book. I had to have it. I mean it had to be good being on the show. By the way love the show! The seller got the book to me fast! So I started reading the 472 page book with excitement. The excitement quickly turned to what the heck! This book is about the detailed history of Capitol Hill with a few ghost stories. I will give it to Phil I have never seen a book so detailed about the history of a city he did a good job on the history part on the ghost part I'd give him an F. If your buying the book because you like history its a must have.

I hope David continues along this path, doing his thing rather than trying to hit the pop-rock zeitgeist as sometimes seemed the case over the last decade. He's a brilliant artist who only needs to look inward for his inspiration. Heathen is an excellent offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Classic Bowie","review":"This is really good. Bowie continues the return to his 70's style that started with Hours but this is better. The album starts off with the ominous \\"Sunday,\\" which sports a very heavy sound followed by the catchy and accessible \\"Cactus.\\" The best tracks on the album are the memorable \\"Slow Burn\\" and \\"A Better Future.\\" Also notable are \\"Slip Away\\" and \\"Everyone Says Hi.\\" The lower points are \\"I've Been Waiting For You,\\" and \\"The Angels Have Gone\\" but they are far from unlistenable. Definitely worth owning and a must-have for those who were fans of Bowie before its release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't call it a comeback, he's been here the whole time...","review":"This album is a lot different than his work as of late. Albums like Earthling seemed to focus on Bowie's ability to sound like a millenium man. That album was missing the feeling of a real band, all you heard were big beats and synthisizors. With this new album, you can hear the instruments, and feel the beat at the same time. This is a great combination of band and big beat techno.The other great thing about this album is how moody it is. It is a laid back vibe, especially on the first track \\"Sunday.\\" My personal favorites for this are \\" I Took A Trip On A Gemini Spaceship,\\" \\"I Would Be Your Slave,\\" and \\"Cactus.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"best of his recent work, which is garbage","review":"Several covers and return of Toni Visconti make Heathen a worthwhile listen. It is hard to believe anyone who has actually heard early Bowie, would claim this is 'as good or better'. Every release has people saying hes better than ever, but a year later no one is listening to the same record. His 70s and 80s work, remains influential to this day, though his body of work overall seems out of fashion at the moment.This is pop from a pop genius who long ago lost his muse and inspiration. What remains is servicable pop, and a few excellent tracks to discover among the mire. It is hard to say Bowie ever made a bad album, everything past lets dance, has been at best unimportant, at worst mediocre formula pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duped Again","review":"As with the Elvis Costello release earlier this year, I once again fell victim to the hype and rushed out to buy Bowie's new one. What a disappointment. I know it's almost sacreligious to denounce a Bowie effort, but I just don't see what all the excitement over Heathen is about. There's really not one tune on here that hops off like a \\"Diamond Dogs\\" or \\"Golden Years.\\" In fact, the Bowie I hear on the radio these days is not Bowie from Heathen but rather Bowie from the early days. This cd is probably playing well with those grasping to hang on to their \\"Aren't I cool cuz I listen to Bowie\\" mentality that may have meant something in the 70s and early 80s, but it's over folks. Move on now. Bowie is washed up and Heathen proves it. Am I going to hell now?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was forced to give this a star!","review":"Tear off your dress and send it to me! Com'on David. Your last few CD's have ****** I wish I could get paid for regressing. Don't waste your money. Don't waste your time. I kept trying to find value in this. My wife said forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying too hard to relive the past....","review":"Bowie's newest is one of his least inspiring. Bowie used to be proud of the fact that with each new record, he would start anew...and not be bound to what came before...but now, in his sedentary middle-age, he seems content in making a bad reproduction of how he thinks fans want him to sound...Unfortunately, Heathen sounds more like one of McCartney bad solo efforts (ie McCartney II) than The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust! Bring back TIN MACHINE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bowie is Back!","review":"Bowie is back!... No really, he's back... I swear it's like he tapped into the Bowie genius and brought some of it to this cd. Not on every track or in every way, but it's there. He did that a bit on the last cd as well. And that's good... because when Bowie is good he's brilliant. If you're a Bowie fan, who knows this is true, give this new cd a listen. I'm starting to believe that Bowie's best work might still be ahead of him. Can you imagine how cool that would be?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fine entry in Bowie's catalog","review":"Bowie brought back Tony Visconti to assist in the creation of another high quality artistic endeavor. Slick as this cd is, Bowie is one of those few artists who never fails to deliver new and exciting music possibilities whether he is reworking tracks from other songwriters or striking out on his own. I highly recommend you take a listen to Slow Burn and Afraid."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Bowie's best release in over 20 years...","review":"This is a great album. I didn't realize how good it was at first because it's so understated but upon repeated listens it has grown on me so much. He has brought back his old producer Tony Visconti, and the sound is just amazing! He also has David Grohl playing guitar on Neil Young's \\"I've Been Waiting For You\\" and Pete Townshend sounding like a cross between Jimi Hendrix & Robert Fripp on another song. He also covers a Pixies song. Plus there's a 4 song bonus disk that includes a demo of \\"Panic In Detroit\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down his best since \\"Outside\\"","review":"Unlike most people, the first DB album I ever owned was \\"Earthling\\", which I believe is highly underrated. Since then, I have gone on to collect most of Bowie's catalog, and I can tell you with absolute certainty, \\"Heathen\\" is easily one of my top 4 albums he has ever produced. This is a surprisingly relevent, well thought out album that maintains thematic unity while striving for a breadth of material that will constantly entertain the listener. My favorite track is \\"A Better Future\\", and if it's not released as a single, I will be shocked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triumph with Heathen","review":"Bowie is alot like technology. It began strong, grew stronger, lost its momentum and declined shortly, but just like the revelation of the internet, rose again in all of it's original glory. And so it goes with Bowie, while technology is in stasis to reinvent old ideas, Bowie brings the world \\"Heathen\\". Now the Berlin era feel is there I admit, but this time the approach is darker. Like \\"Hours\\", it seems Bowie is finding more inspiration in the darker side of life for this album. The Pixies cover, \\"Cactus\\", is a more melodic version of a simple song; which makes it all the more amazing. Bowie shows us that life continues as does music, and I hope he lives forever so I can hear 100 more albums by him...at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"The old style, refined","review":"With Heathen, Bowie brings a knowing, polished maturity to his late 60's to mid 70's style. At this point, his subtle sophistication has become quite powerful. Of course, with his maturity, we will find a lack of driving energy or flamboyant risk taking. This is a mature rocker showing why he's a master. This album will get zero airplay on commercial radio. But for dedicated Bowie fans, many of whom are almost as old as Bowie, I think most will feel Bowie has reached his pinnacle with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bowie CD to date!","review":"This is simply the best recording David has made since Scary Monsters. It is equally as good. With David Torn on guitar and atmospheres, all the essential elements that Fripps guitar had on the older Bowie material is now present once again. Jordan Rudess also adds to the tracks he plays on. Great lineup of musicians on this one and Bowie's material is classic Bowie! Took a trip on a gemini spacecraft...and I thought about you... Dont' pass this one up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He's still got it","review":"Not much to say about this album, except that it's great. This is the old Bowie here. 5:15 The Angels Have Gone is quite a good song, but the album is actually really solid throughout, musically very interesting and always assured. It's just a fact that Bowie doesn't inspire the same sort of nostalgia that, say, the Rolling Stones do. The Stones have been making garbage for decades and selling it to Baby Boomers who still remember them as the band that did Exile on Main Street. Bowie's output post-Tin Machine has actually been pretty good, but apparently people aren't noticing. That's just how life works out sometimes. It's a shame.My point is that Bowie is not some nostalgia act. He's still a great craftsman who is still invested in putting out a good product. Check out the album. You will not be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"David's In!","review":"This is David's best CD in over 20 years! Fantastic, inspired, brilliant. I have been listening to this CD all summmer and I still find it irresistible. Bowie has picked top-notch musicians for this one. David Torn (on guitar) adds all the right ingredients. Torn is a guitar genius who collaborates with many other progressive artists. He adds guitar atmosphere's much in the same way as Robert Fripp did on Scary Monsters and Heroes. Tony Levin plays bass on one track and Jordan Rudess (Dream Theater) plays keyboards on some of the tracks. Bowie has achieved a high level of art on Heathen. His writing is as good or better than anything from the past. Very current with the times. He has tapped into the source on this one! Strange none of the reviews I have read on these review pages even mentioned Torn's influence on this CD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd","review":"Great album by the most creative rock artist of all-time. This album is a must have.

Unlike the book featuring John Walker, there is no new knowledge to be learned. The book reads as if the author's entire research was done by what was printed in the N.Y. Times and Washington Post. The book does not really explain how Hannsen got caught but continues to repeat over and over the same sexual fantasies Hanssen has of his wife. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"1/2 of the story we wanted to read","review":"I expected a book about Robert Hanssen - how he spied and what made him tick. That came across in about half of the book. Unfortunately, Mr Vise didn't have enough material to write a book of reasonable length, so he improvised with a lot of uninteresting material on the life of FBI director Louis Freeh, and way too much rehash of the Aldrich Ames and Timothy McVeigh stories. Although a lot of interesting details emerged on Hanssen, I still don't understand the man. Several aspects of his life appear to contradict each other, and the psychiatrist explanations left me unfulfilled. This book in no way approaches the \\"Betrayal\\" book on Ames by Weiner, Johnston and Lewis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"In the beginning I found this book interesting but in the later chapters Mr Vise began to drift away from the crux of the book.In one chapter, he devotes 16 pages to then FBI Director Louis Freeh and his clash with former President Clinton. He touches on the bombings of the Khobar Towers, Oklahoma City, the Atlantic Olympic Park in 1996, and the investigation of Wen Ho Lee, the mathematician at Los Alamos National Lab. What has this have to do with Robert P. Hanssen? I suggest that if you really want to read this book go to your local [store] and spend a few hours there to peruse it rather than purchase it. I was very dissapointed in the author to add pages of useless information in an effort to boost the price of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"I was excited to read this book but was very disappointed. The book attempted to juxtapose Robert Hannsen's life with that of Louis Freeh's but, in the end, didn't do justice to either one. The background provided to Hanssen's upbringing was informative, but after the onset of Hanssen's spying, the book simply seemed to bounce chronologically in no coherent fashion between Hanssen's spying and Freeh's career at the FBI. Paragraphs seemed to be independently written and then patched together in the best manner possible from the author's point of view, but the book laked flow. Moreover, numerous digressions into events like the Oklahoma City bombing and Ruby Ridge served no purpose other than to increase the number of pages in the book. Having read and really enjoyed Stuart Herrington's \\"Traitors Among Us,\\" another book about Cold War espionage, I thought this book fell rather flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic writing; exploitative passages; naive analysis","review":"What a fascinating story and what a dissapointing book. The book is written at the high school level at best. But aside from the authorship, most troubling was the level of pure exploitation of Hanssen's perversity. The lengthy quotation from Hanssen's pornography (including an entire appendix) can only be considered gratuitous. Why humiliate Mrs. Hanssen by offering her husband's lewd tales of their sex life? Finally, the virtually fawning descriptions of Louis Freeh's career show a very naive understanding of the way such cases are brought, and it is disrepectful of the many agents and line prosecutors who actually brought Hanssen to justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ninth grade level writing...","review":"The cover notes that the author is a Pulitzer Prize winner, but he won't get one for this book.

Atmosphere, texture and character development are pushed aside by oversimplifications and cliches (Freeh is described as \\"square-jawed\\"). Juxtaposing Hanssen's story with Freeh's story is an amateurish device. Attempts at a psychological understanding of Hanssen lack depth, and ultimately collapse into pop psychology. In Hanssen's treachery there is an exciting, complex story to be told, but this book fails to do it justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a gossip column","review":"There are several books on this topic and I was uncertain which to read. I went with Vise based on his Pulitzer Prize. Frankly, I was disappointed. The book is not very well written. There's not much new here you couldn't get from the New York Times. Vise fills pages by writing alternating chapters about FBI director Louis Freeh. But Vise's lionized portrait of Freeh as courageous crime fighter rings hollow, particularly in light of September 11, and other FBI failures on Freeh's watch. The book gives you all the relevant information about Hansson, who was clearly a very dangerous and disturbed person. But the writing doesn't read like top rate journalism; it feels like gossip column filler. Although I haven't read the other books on this case, I'd recommend starting elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"general waste of time","review":"save your money and check it out from the library if you must read it. however, i'm sure there's better, more qualified books out there on this guy. do i have to give it a star? how about negative stars? disappointing book. gratuitous sex was insulting...bedroom antics didn't have anything to do with hanssen's destructive betrayal of this country. book seemed to be thrown together. was it about hanssen, ames, clinton, freeh? who? title infers it's about hanssen, but author must have run out of resources to copy. there's nothing new! glad i didn't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial","review":"I was expecting \\"The Falcon and the Snowman\\" (a far superior book), but I got information which was probably lifted off of the pages of the New York Times.

I echo the sentiments of several customer reviewers who accurately observe The Bureau And The Mole is long on opinion, weakly drawn conclusions and pop psychology, and short on documented fact. No doubt to compensate for a dearth of substance as to how and why Robert Hanssen did what he did, Mr. Vise sloppily weaves in a parallel biography of former FBI Director Louis Freeh which, while mildly interesting, only serves to distract and detract from what should have been a compelling narrative on the most dastardly spy in US history. A story this big and complex warrants a far more serious effort than that put forth in this altogether disappointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfocused","review":"This book was unfocused and the authors' method of paralleling the careers Robert Hanssen and FBI Director Louis Freeh failed miserably. Robert Hanssen began spying for the Soviets long before Freeh became Director and the mistake is compounded by detailing the fued between Freeh and then-President Bill Clinton in excruciating detail.

The book is a strong example of a great topic with a horrible delivery. Hanssen betrayed our country' secrets and the best the author can do is bore us with how Louis Freeh should be our hero.

Robert Hansen is the traitor.The parallel bio of Louis Freeh is a distraction."},{"rating":"1","title":"a rush job","review":"I heard the author, David Vise, being interviewed on the radio (on the PBS program \\"Fresh Air\\") and found him very interesting. Unfortunately, the book is a big disappointment. It's a rush job and a pastiche, without much new information. The chapters on Louis Freeh are a complete waste. They were presumably thrown in to give the book some \\"structure,\\" but really have nothing to do with the Hanssen case and tell you nothing you wouldn't know from any press digest or encyclopedia yearbook. I am hooked on the Hanssen case, so I guess I would have read the book no mater what, but this book is a dud. It tells you little and is not particularly well written or researched. Plus, there's a lot of padding (e.g., chapter on Freeh)."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"Did I just spend $(...) dollars for this. This book simply fails to deliver. It spends little time exploring the life and psyche of Philip Hansen, and dwells on useless filler. It provides us with a rather detailed sycophantic account of Louis Freeh. It juxtaposes this idealized picture of Louis Freeh to the dual, hypocratical, and deceitful Hanssen. This is supposed to give this book a pseudointellectual flavor, but instead it bores the reader and falls short on delivering the biography of the worst spy in American history. Lastly the appendix describing the sexual fantasies of Philip Hansen is an egregious move on the part of the author. It does not add to the already incomplete and shallow account AND it also victimizes innocent family members."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bureau and the Mole","review":"This is a book seriously in search of an editor. It is a sophomoric tome which could easily be condensed into a three page article for the Reader's Digest.For such a serious subject, the text is completely unsubstantiated.

I'd been hoping for the inside story and lots of juicy details. And there is some inside story and there are some juicy details. But there's lots of dime-store psychoanalysis that is repetitive and not very illuminating. There's as much - if not more - about Louis Freeh to the detriment of details about the espionage aspect of the story. And the bottom line is that the writing just isn't very good. I wish I had better things to say - I'd heard big things about this book and was eager to read it. In the end, though, it was quite a letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read a better book","review":"This book doesn't compare with David Wise's book \\"Spy, The Inside Story of How the FBI's Robert Hanssen Betrayed America.\\" There seems to be a lot of assumptions and conjecture's in the Vise book. Wise has much better sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"There are maybe 40 or 50 interesting pages in this book...70 if you like porn. David Vise really didn't have enough material to write a book about the topic, so he filled the rest with an inconsistent bio of former FBI Director Louis Freeh and some weak psychological explanations of why Bob Hanssen did what he did.What is most disappointing is that it reads like a series of newspaper articles and not like a book. Vise really doesn't tie the story together well and he has no point to make.Finally, a minor beef -- the whole 'Because he ratted out KGB moles who were later tried and executed, he committed the equivalent of mass murder...' line is BS. Those guys betrayed their country too.

It so disconjointed and messy that its hard to read. The author tends to jump back and forth a lot or go off topic even like the Oklahoma bombing which would be intereting if that was what I was reading about. You do get a clear view of what a creepy dude Hanssen was and wonder why the FBI dropped the ball when his brother in law told them Hanssen was a spy back in 1990. The Russians were more amusing in how they made sure to include \\"thank yous\\" and \\"good work\\" for the creep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book!","review":"The book provided background on not only Robert Hanssen, but also the individuals associated with the job.

There is such a profound disconnect between the singers actions and their voices that I found it unwatchable. Did the singers lip-synch to a previously recorded track? Or did they dub the vocals after having shot the film? Either way, it makes for a very odd viewing experience. I can't even comment on the quality of the performances, as the soundtrack sounds as if it were recorded in a barrel, hollow and distant. You'll be far better off watching any of the marvelous Metropolitan Opera productions or the Covent Garden Cotrubas/Shicoff version. Even Baz Lehrman's updated, somewhat funky Australian Opera production is more true to the spirit of the piece than is this.

I assume acting in a movie like this is much more difficult than acting in a fast paced thriller. But in my opinion this movie is slow, boring, with endless close ups of the actors. It is not a movie someone would want to watch after a hard day at work when all you want is some relaxation and entertainment.

Prior to installing it, I'd been keeping the salt in the original bags and frequently made a mess when trying to pour it into my handheld spreader. Now it's super easy and quick to pouring exactly the amount I need with zero waste. It also keeps the salt high and dry in my garage. It easily holds two 40lb bags of ice melt with no problem. Time will tell how robust it is, but it's looking good and makes me smile everytime I use it. As a precaution, I followed the advice of other reviewers and used large metal washers to spread the mounting load more evenly over the thin plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"We purchased this wall-mount food container because our dogs were occasionally \\"breaking in\\" to the closet where food was stored and over-eating. The dispenser is now mounted on the wall in our garage and we LOVE it.

I mounted mine with a wood cleat inside to make sure it was sturdy. I use small kibble dog food so sometimes pieces will get stuck where the food dispenses so I will open and close it a time or two to clear it out. I weigh my dogs food to make sure they get the same amount each time, I dispense into their bowls first so it works good enough to be pretty accurate about that. I can add a tiny bit more or just put the extra back in the top. Keeps food fresh by dispensing the old food first, plus no more crumbs and dust in the bottom of a container or dog food bag.

Some of the other, more industrial-like tracks, are reminiscent of the album The Downward Spiral, a favorite among many fans.

Either you are losing touch with all things musical or you are simply too deafened by your own rants about how bad all the music is out there. You seem to be falling into that very category that you so arduously created in order make people believe that you are the greatest thing in music. It worked for a while, but its clear now that you are NO genius but only play one on TV. Good show man !"},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss old NIN","review":"I miss old NIN. This is the first time I've actually been ashamed to blast a NIN album. Somewhere between Trent's high-pitched chanting and obnoxious dance beats I decided that NIN just wasn't hitting the spot anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed fan","review":"I have been a huge Nine Inch Nails fan for years so it's hard to give this CD a bad review, but I will. On a positive note the CD is straight to the point and I'm sure the songs will sound great live because of the lack of extra electronic sounds, however it sounds like the whole CD was thrown together. Trent's lyrics at times seem quite jumbled and sometimes he sounds like he's singing in a garage. A matter of fact, major portions of the CD sound like it was made by a garage band. Many fans will hype up this CD but I feel that this is the one CD that doesn't need to be in your Nine Inch Nails collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big gigantic let down","review":"It has been six years since Trent has released a disc, and this it the best he can do?This may be just as dark as Pretty Hate Machine or The Downward Spiral, but it lacks spirit, it lacks enthusiasm, it lacks...teeth.The best songs on the disc would make really great Garbage tunes, or material for an awesome Smashing Pumpkins reunion, but for NIN it's just boring.Next time when you take six years off Trent, catch up with modern times. My Chemical Romance, Spalding Rockwell and The Used are putting out much better discs, and you can guarantee they aren't going to wait six ####ing years to put out another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 stars","review":"High points\\"Only\\" 9/10The best song on the album, catchy but not to poppy (like a few songs on this album)\\"Right Where It Belongs\\" 8/10This albums \\"hurt\\" is a keeper even though it is lacking in complexity. It makes up for this with sincerity.Low point\\"You Know What You Are?\\" 6/10Trent is Definitely try to recapture some angst that he has lost. Let it go man you are no longer as pissed off as you once were.Many fans don't like this album because it mixes more mainstream almost pop electronic elements into nin standard style. I think the main thing holding this album back is nin's angst that seems forced on this outing. Despite this I still recommend the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"Took a couple of listens, but it is really worth the buy.

But honestly, this cd isnt good at all....the best song is the most commercial song he has ever dont, the single...other then that the cd is like a live show in a basement or something, his voice never seems to be on the track or the beat, and the drums are to obnoxious from mr foo fighter...i dont reccomed this cd at all, i want my money back"},{"rating":"1","title":"NIN is done!!!!","review":"I have loved NIN for many years now and I was pretty happy to see this album come out. BUT I hate to say it sucks pretty bad. Trents \\"I'm a dark depressed loser\\" act has run it's course!! With the teethuhhhhhhhhhh it the worst NIN song I have ever heard!!! Also, stop with the DUALDISC CRAP!!! make one damn cd then stop! It's just a lame way to make money on a lame album!! Also, good ol trent just rematered the the downward spiral cd too. WHY???? Isnt that the whole point of cd's? so the sound is digital audio from the start?? Don't be fooled. I did give this 2 stars because I love RIGHT WHERE IT BELONGS, but other then that this cd blows.

I can not believe people compare it to Pretty Hate Machine, no NIN album is comparable to PHM, especially this one. The good songs I thought were #2 and #6, the last one was ok, but nothing stood out in it to make me remember it and want to listen to it again. Number 8 just makes me lose all faith in Trent. This album, and any other NIN album will live up to Pretty Hate Machine, but if your into nowadays music then you'll probably like it, but for oldschool fans, this sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was so excited for this release.

I thought the Fragile was the best album Trent ever did. With Teeth, on the other hand, has no bite. I get the feeling he slapped this together in under a year. The deep full instrumentation from his last release is gone, none of the songs grab you or even wake you up. The last track is probably the only one I liked. I really hope it will grow on me, but after 3 listens I wish I hadn't spent money to hear the downfall of one of the great bands of my youth. Yuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trent shines again as a master in his dark domain.","review":"This is a very impressive album from Trent and the NIN crew, this album shows the pure talent of Trent as did Tools Lateralus album.

You'll like this...","review":"This new NIN album is different from the other releases in that it has a heavy focus on live drumming! There aren't as many machine-produced beats as there are real drumming. There are still a few tracks that have the more electronic sound to balance out the album and give it that mysterious feel. There are solid classics on this album, as well as intricate intense/heavy songs.I can't see why you wouldn't like this album if you like NIN. It's good (...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"this bad will rock your socks off","review":"what i have to say is this band is amazing they been in the music scene about 15 year and thire still together most bands today are always breacking up i can name 30 bands that broken up but i dont feel like naming them.so the new album its ok so go and buy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring.....","review":"If you don't care about the fact that there is nothing new on this album then it's ok. OK.There is nothing new on this album at all. He says nothing new at all. There's nothing new to the music.Yes, I got it when I was 15, but come on Trent, grow up.

I already heard the horrible bite the hand that feeds you bite the hand that feeds you bite the hand...oh sorry, I got repetitive..probably from that damn song. I was never much a die hard fan so when this album came out I said \\"Hmm, maybe I will have a looksey\\". Boy what a fricken nightmare! Lame and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the Deal with this band?","review":"Yeah their stuff sounds cool, but for me, one CD of it is enough. I mean, With Teeth is basically the same CD that they realeased what, 5 years ago? The only real stand-outish track is the single, \\"Hand that Bleeds.\\" The rest are all just kinda ehhh...If you want to get into really good industrial-type metal, then check out Tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, he's branching out...","review":"No, it's not the best Nine Inch Nails record, (although I feel like ranking an artist's work is futile and silly.) It's a good, solid rock record, very focused on sticking a few songs to you and getting out of town. The more organic \\"band\\" approach is refreshing, and some of these songs are meaner sounding than anything Trent's done previously. The layers of guitar in \\"Know what you are\\" and \\"Getting Smaller\\" are absolutely stunning, and deserve to be heard on a huge stereo. (The thought of people MP3ing this record for tiny headphones seems tragic.) Overall, I really enjoyed this record, and have no idea why some people complain about it. He already made \\"The Downward Spiral\\" & \\"The Fragile\\", let the man do what he wants."},{"rating":"1","title":"almost 6 years for this?","review":"This album only has 1 truly amazing song and that is the first single the hand that feeds. The rest was like what was that? In a bad way. It makes you think wow I waited almost six years for this? The first song all the love in the world is half a good song, the second half is good the first half is like what was that crap? Another one beside you in time, once again the second half of that song is good, the first half was like what is this crap. Do yourself a favor and listen to this before you buy it or simply buy the hand that feeds single with the remixes which are good. This is only the second time ever one of my favorite bands who has never come out with crap music, finally put out crap music. The first was fear factory with their latest album archetype."},{"rating":"1","title":"DUAL DISCS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH PC CD DRIVES!","review":"This not a review of the album itself. I hear the album is awesome and is reminiscent of the downward spiral.I wish I could review the Music but I have a small apartment and so use my pc exclusively for multimedia entertainment. I did not realize until I received this that the CD SIDE ON DUAL DISCS DOES NOT PLAY ON PC CD DRIVES! The DVD side does play. Google this topic and you will see this is true.I understand that record companies need to protect themselves from pirates but many people have home theatre PC's and MP3 players and no longer have a plain jane cd or dvd player. Unless I borrow my friends boom box this cd is worthless to me. It is too bad the record company could not be more forthcoming about this \\"incompatibility.\\"Even though there will be a penalty because I had to open it, I will return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I have been a NIN fan since Pretty Hate Machine. I think Trent Reznor is a brilliant musician. All of his previous albums have been absolute genius....until this? I pre-ordered this album anticipating another masterpiece. What a disappointment!! I still can't get over how terrible this album is! The only song that is worth mentioning is \\"You Know What You Are.\\" That's the Trent I know! I purposely skipped the tour just so I didn't have to hear the new stuff! I hope this isn't it for him, but I will be cautious when the next album comes out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NIN no more","review":"Trent once said that he would loose his job if he went and saw a psycologist (yes he actually said that!) and I think its time he does what he said. Everybody who likes it are his \\"new\\" genre, who aren't aware of his old achivements, that he was once a genre by himself. Now he is another rock-star, an entertainer, who is pickpocketing us to keep his luxirous life alive, like Marilyn Manson. Thats all he is trying to do.. Ripping the adult people who buy the image, rather than the music. I have always believed in him, I loved every single song of him, I didn't download his songs but bought original CDs because I thought he deserved it. But not anymore. I am not gonna listen his junk anymore. They aren't gonna rip my $$ anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it at all","review":"I'm a big NIN fan, I have all of their albums except this one. Since I listened to the single \\"The Hand that Feeds\\", I was surprised at how trendy it sounded; still I was hoping the album would offer something interesting. Sometimes musicians should be honest with themselves, after awhile you simply have nothing more to express, and this happens in any kind of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the wait","review":"I keep hoping NIN will release something as great as BROKEN or THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL or even PRETTY HATE MACHINE, or if not then go somewhere new. Reznor's obviously an incredibly talented musician. And to be fair, SPIRAL was one of the best albums of the 90s, so he's set the bar very high. Now he has a tough decision to make: try to top SPIRAL and fall short more often than not, or try a new direction altogether. WITH TEETH is the former. The same layered, angry, self-loathing stuff as SPIRAL, just not as good. A few decent tracks, but overall a letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows on you","review":"I have to say the first time I heard this album I wasnt impressed with it. However that being said after a couple of listens it starts to grow on you, much in the way all his other albums have done to me. This is a more optimistic album than most but it still is true to the NIN style of releasing a complete album where you have to listen to it as whole to get the full picture.The only thing that I am truly disappointed about from this album is the lack of any purely instrumental tracks. Trent is a great musician and some of his best work has been his purely or mostly instrumental songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 13 year olds review","review":"this album is WONDERFUL!!. How do ppl expect these albums to come out has,perfect. So what ... if it isnt better than the fragile, or the downward spiral... it is still NIN, and its diffrent, yet freshand thats why i like it. I have been a nin fan since i was 10, some ppl i think i am too young to listen to nine inch nails, but i think screw them, because it's an expresion of music i think is great, and interesting to listen to. great cd... dont know what ppl are complaining about, i dont really favor the beggining beat to some songs, but overall those songs are good( only, to be more specific) i congratulate nin, and i think u should do the same thing, cause of great thought put into this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAYBE IN TIME IT'LL BE BETTER","review":"i'M JUST NOT FEELING THIS CD!

Its not dark like the fragile or broken. Has a lot of 80's retro feel to it which isn't really a bad thing. Overall I like it, but its not his best album by far and I was a little disappointed not hearing any real good \\"Angry\\" music. But I still love Trent and NIN and I'm looking forward for some remixes of this album!!!Ok well now that I've had some time to fully get used to this album and 1 live NIN concert/tour later. I appreciate this album much better more now. Yes it is different then his other albums but whats wrong with a little change? I think Trent knows his roots and he will get back to them in his next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Reznors Mona Lisa, but still great!","review":"Downward Spiral is and always will be my favorite NIN album, maybe for reasons of nostalgia or maybe because nothing can top it.

Overall, a great effort!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy The Downward Spiral Deluxe Edition Instead","review":"After one listen, this cd was HIGHLY disappointing! I regret buying the album and after a few more listens would probably have purchased 3 or 4 songs online (The Collector - best song, You know what you are? - typical yell anthem, Only - great dance, disco song, Right where it belongs - piano ballad, good but not \\"Hurt\\"). The album is incredibly disjointed and doesn't really flow well. Trent is obviously out of things to write about, you'll hear this when he uses lyrics from past albums like \\"Nothing can stop me now\\" and \\"a tiny dot caught my eye\\". Plus, there's the brilliant \\"Flip, Flop, Flip\\" lyrics in \\"Getting Smaller\\". Fortunately, I bought the Downward Spiral Deluxe Edition and took a trip down memory lane where the lyrics were fresh and full of feeling. One of the biggest fans of Trent Reznor who thought he was a genius is now eating her words."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Every Day is Exactly the Same?\\"...","review":"No, every SONG is exactly the same! Not only is there no distinguishing between songs on this record, there is no distinguishing between these songs and any other song Trent Reznor ever wrote. Except for the single \\"Bite the Hand that Feeds\\" (which is catchy, but WAY too poppy sounding), this C.D. is soooo boring and monotonous. I'm VERY surprised this took Trent years to make this, but I'm not at all surprised every NIN fan loves it. Trent could get away with murder; he could release a rap metal album or a country album, and everybody would gush over it. Unless you're one of the biggest NIN fans in the world, don't buy this; just listen to \\"The Fragile\\" again."},{"rating":"1","title":"wretched, absolutely terrible","review":"i fear that i, along with most of trent's fanbase, are no longer 14. yet he still seems to be extracting lyrics from some 14 year old's diary. grow up trent. can't you write angsty songs about sex or drugs or something other than \\"poor me, nobody understands me\\". it's so tired. and the production is ridiculously pop. where are the layers? where is the noise? even \\"the fragile\\" had a few redeeming moments. this is just fluff. maybe somebody needs to pull some of trent's teeth out. then he'd have something to whine about. i can't believe i bought this the day it came out. my friends all made fun of me, but i had faith! i thought trent would come out on top: older, wiser, maybe with some better lyrics or some ferocious chip on his shoulder. but no. just some whiny s**t. and the ABSOLUTE WORST SINGLE OF THE YEAR (the hand that feeds)! a huge disappointment. seriously, avoid it. stick with broken and downward spiral, or even pretty hate machine (for the cheese factor.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"With(out) Teeth","review":"After years of waiting for some new music from Nine Inch Nails, With Teeth is eaily the least interesting Nine Inch Nails Album, and one of the worst big-name Rock albums released in the genre over the past few years.

It could have been made by NIN in 1995, or The The in 1985- the lyrics are even straight from Soul Mining.It sounds more like a band than a man in a studio, and this is good. Broken and some other cuts always sounded stagnant from the studio, whereas live versions or studio performances were better (a video Broken is the band in a one take, much better than the album track)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Trent? Why?","review":"I've loved every halo, single, soundtrack song etc that NIN has put out over the years. This on the other hand. No. I cannot force myself to digest this. All I can say is better luck next time. Basically Trent pulled a St. Anger on us. Yes I use that to describe really bad things these days. That should give you some idea of how bad I think this album is.An artist cannot always produce terrific albums every time, but this could have been better. Much better. The hype was so great but the music is so mediocre. I say buy something else that you don't already have from NIN. Like Still or Things Falling Apart. That way you can bypass the waves of dissapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Album, different, but still great.","review":"The much anticipated NIN album \\"With Teeth\\" has arrived, long time fans will most likely love this album, but the \\"fans\\" who have just heard a song here and there and just got the album for the catchy \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" will most likely be disappointed. It is slightly different than Trent's past work, but what artist doesn't change album after album? I see numerous people comparing it to \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\", that was awhile ago, he's obviously trying new things. Get over it. I also see others comparing it to The Fragile, The Fragile was a 23 song album, about 2 albums together. How can you try compare it to a 13 track album? It's a whole new album, accept it as so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is it still called Nine Inch Nails?","review":"All of the people that originally made up Trent Reznor's backup band have been replaced, and the style of music has gone from heavy industrial rock to emo-alternative with some keyboards. As nothing on this CD is similar enough to his previous work to call it the same band, why is it still Nine Inch Nails? To say that this album was a disappointment would be a severe understatement. In the months before it came out, everyone was saying it was their heaviest stuff ever. Then I heard \\"The hand that feeds,\\" and I was disappointed by how happy it sounded, but I just figured it was the softest song on the album and they were just putting it out as a single to get some publicity. But then it turns out it was the heaviest, and now I can't wear my Nine Inch Nails shirt anymore for fear that it's associated with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I liked \\"With Teeth\\" and I for one appreciated the profanity! I'm sick of these fake artist puppet type singers. Trent is honest and real, grant him that. This album is very good. NIN, Hole, and newcomer Corinna Fugate. Very good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be worse, could be much better","review":"Say goodbye to experimentation, to anything new or exciting, or to something else that would leave you wanting more by the end of the album. Trent Reznor is out of ideas. Or maybe inspiration. Half the songs on With Teeth are tired retreads of previous albums, but with LESS bite. Trent has lots of reason to be angry, who doesn't? But don't take it out on the listener, Trent. That's not to say this album is terrible. Fans of Reznor are like starving people at a buffet, they'll go for just about anything. It takes you years to come out with something, Trent, I guess I just expected better."},{"rating":"1","title":"At last....The weakest NIN album has landed","review":"I am a huge fan of NIN and always will be. I have to admit that i am very disappointed in this album, no matter what. They are all weak songs, nothing new. I can even say that there are no favourite tracks in this album. Most of them was constructed from the old materials. As i said i will always be NIN fan so i will look for the next album. I am sure they will come back in top form with the album more creative, more structure and hope that trent will co-produce with Flood again !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Nine Inch Nails album since \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\"","review":"First, I have been a fan of NIN since its debut album back in 1991 when I was in high school.

PHM is by far NIN's best, but this comes a second close. Whereas \\"The Fragile\\" and the \\"Downward Spiral\\" and even the EP \\"Broken\\" were an exhausting orgy of noise and aural chaos, this album is well crafted and tight; it's hardcore yet melodic.All the tracks are good, but the best are (in my opinion):1) All the love in the world3) The collector4) The hand that feeds5) Love is not enough6) Every day is exactly the same9) Getting smaller13) Right where it belongsEnjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"Unlike Trent's previous material, this is a bad album and it's not worth the money.

Trent Reznor has never dissapointed me and I believe the only way he could would be to stop making music. People complain that this cd took five years to make but i read in a interview that he almost has another one done and plans on releasing it soon, maybe next year. But I think Reznor has finally realized that he needs to come out of the dark and step into the light.

This review is just my nod of approval. 10 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the hell happend?","review":"I honestly wasnt expecting much from \\"with teeth\\" after hearing rumors and specualation, and quite frankly what could you really follow up a masterpeice like \\"the fragile\\" with? Well I didnt get much either. This album has some serious flaws glaring on its slick surface. The 3 and a half minute pop ditties on this record dont fit anywhere into the NIN we all know and love. Honestly its like Trent died and they got some look alike to make another album unbeknownst to his fans. I see a trend coming,...that being a bunch of bad albums from this once shining light in music. NIN fans will defend this album to the hilt but of course thats there right. If you like it for what it is fine but DO NOT expect anything approaching a masterpiece. Maybe Its time for TR to hang up the black clothing and computers and call it a day..........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toothless and gummy","review":"I have been a huge Reznor fan since he came on the scene back in the 80s. When he did a re-release of \\"The Fragile,\\" I didn't think he'd ever come out with a new album. \\"With Teeth\\" certainly is new, but it's not good. \\"Bite the Hand that Feeds\\" is the only \\"hit\\" that's going to come off of this CD or be played in the clubs. With Reznor, you can usually count on thought-provoking lyrics or at least some complex, thrashing tunes. \\"With Teeth\\" is without both of these. The music and lyrics are kind of light and lilty like those of, dare I say it, Elvis Costello or Billy Corigan. It says a lot, but it doesn't make a real point. Re-grouped groups like Velvet Revolver and Audioslave are at least staying closer to their indie-alt roots. If you want something to remind you of the good tunes from the late 80s, get Beck's new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not play in most cd players","review":"Please beware that the Amazon description does not make it clear that this Dualdisc album will not play in most cd players. It lacks a table of contents, and most intelligent cd players just won't read it. This includes PCs running both Windows and Linux, as well as many car cd players. (I've tried!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most of the stuff on the charts nowadays...","review":"I would describe this as NIN's most pared-down, minimalist album since \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\". Some of the tracks soar (\\"Hand that Feeds\\", \\"Only\\", \\"All the Love in the World\\" stand out to me), but overall it lacks the dense, endlessly-layered feel of albums like the \\"Downward Spiral\\", where songs almost seemed to blend into each other. Still a worthwile effort though, and nice to see that the first single (\\"Hand that Feeds\\") thumbs its nose at authority (\\"what if this whole crusade's a charade...\\")--even at 40 it's good to know Trent hasn't mellowed out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"spots","review":"sunspots is the type of song that makes you dance with the risk of imminent injury. 1 min in any dance major can feel trent in control as you spiral out...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing that fails","review":"Many people try to say that this album is comparable to Pretty Hate Machine, but I don't hear the similarities. There are a lot of great tracks. \\"Everyday is exactly the same\\", \\"Only\\", \\"Sunspots\\", \\"All the love in the world\\" and \\"The hand that feeds\\" are all solid tracks with good lyrics. I have never been big on distortion/headache noise especially to much of it. That would be the only thing that I dislike about some of the tracks on this album. I also really like the last two tracks on the album. I give it a stamp of approval."},{"rating":"2","title":"NIN is an awesome CD","review":"I recieved \\"With Teeth\\" in a two week time from purchase. It was brand new and was another birthday gift for my wife. Sadly they personalized message added to it did not arrive. Other than that I highly recommend this album for the ladies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible lyrics, same old sounds","review":"With one exception: \\"Know what you are?\\" is Trent at his best.As for the rest of the album: you've heard it already. The lyrics are woeful - you'd find better in a high school poetry class, with titles like \\"Death\\". \\"With teeth\\" looks like an attempt to rewrite \\"closer\\" but it backfires badly. Maybe he thought \\"She gets you hard\\" would be all sexy and shocking. Maybe it is to teen girls, I dunno.There's the trouble: the album's too juvenile in tone for older NIN fans who've been around since Spiral or before, and it's too retro in sound for the younger audience I assume he's attempting to market to.Not the worst music being released, but that's not necessarily saying much."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I eagerly awaited this album. I loved Pretty Hate Machine. I loved The Fragile. Even the half of The Downward Spiral that I hated, I still appreciated because of the inventiveness and general feeling of Trent pushing the envelope. I have tried and tried to like this new album, but it just bores me and Trent's lyrics are the worst of his career. I am curious if all the people that have given this album great reviews are still wild about the album now that it has been out for awhile. The only good thing that I can say is that most of the songs remind me of better NIN songs from the past. I've listened to the older songs again. They are much better. Trent has spent his career redefining himself right up until this album. I hope he goes back to his daring ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Pop, Even Worse Rock, and Terrible Industrial","review":"I thought Trent was better than this. Almost every track is boring emo garbage with little to no electronic work. I've never really liked his vocal work, but here it just deflates because he has few to no catchy melodies. The good tracks are \\"The Hand That Feeds,\\" \\"Only,\\" \\"Beside You In Time\\" (which is nice and experimental) and \\"Right Where It Belongs.\\"The Fragile was good for its length and fairly catchy melodies. The Downward Spiral was good for its lyrics, repeating melody, and storyline. Pretty Hate Machine was good for its vast sparseness and minimalism. Get those if you haven't.Don't be fooled; With Teeth has none of NIN's redeeming qualities or songs which will stick. Trent seems to have sold out just about completely now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"I thought the CD was a pretty big disapointment. There was really only one good song on the CD ( The Hand That Feeds ). The cd just didnt have any edge to it. Mabey it should have a name like \\"Without Teeth\\". The CD just seems to need a lot more work. It could have been a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tree Trunk Arms and Cereal Box Philosophy","review":"Have mercy!!

Extremely dissapointed.","review":"I am one of the very few honest people who is NOT afraid to tell it like it is. Pretty Hate Machine was great, Broken was amazing, the Downward Spiral was amazing, the Fragile was decent, and this album is terrible. Going through each track, I found myself hopelessly tuning out due to sheer boredom. Most of the tracks are slow to mid tempo and sound like a 400 pound fat man trying to walk through quick sand. It really falls short. Melodies? Some people think it has a ton of great ones, but personally I think that A-ha has them beat, and a million other bands. I wouldn't be as harsh, but after 6 goddamn years of not releasing anything for NIN, I feel entitled to bitch and am SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO glad I didn't kill myself buying tickets to the sold out shows. For everyone else, your a sucker."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment","review":"Not worth the 6 year wait.

It feels like the songs are more like demos from the band, not fully finished tracks. Another main problem with the cd is the way some of the tracks seem to be using a formula now. The cd didn't come with any liner notes, but if you've heard 2 or more of their cd's, you won't need any. You'll probably be able to just guess what he's gonna say next. It feels like he sold out on some songs. But it isn't all bad. All the love in the world, You know what you are, Hand that feeds, Only, Everyday is exactly the same, and right where it belongs are good, (and the bonus Home), but that's less than half of the songs, and the album is too short...It just doesn't feel like enough for a six year wait..."},{"rating":"2","title":"magic","review":"i simply love this cd, because it contains so many styles, jazz,funk, fusion,latin-american. it all goes together in complete harmony! i think it is very difficult to make a cd,with only saxophones,this guys did it! my favorites:itchy feet and lace curtain, i hope there wil be other cd's by this group, they are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duds","review":"Not sure what the problem is, but the adhesive strips in this package won't stick to anything for more then 6 minutes (no joke, I timed it).We have command hooks in almost every room of our house and garage, they have been purchased from an actual store.

It's a great product.But the hooks are just hideous, clunky and ungainly ...so unstylish. They look like something you'd find yellowing on the wall of your grandfather's garage in 1975. The form is old-school and ugly; a different design era - and not in the good way These are hooks you'd put some place that you can close the door on (a cabinet), so you don't have to look at them.Come on 3M, this is the age of the iPod, not the 8-track. You'd sell so many more of these if they weren't so naff.

They're great for smaller skillets, strainers, and other lightweight kitchen products. They keep the medium-sized things ready at hand for use.

Absolutely a must for any apartment situation where you need to keep organized!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for small to medium sized items","review":"I used these hooks to organize my closet to hang up my belts. I can see these being a must-have for college dorm rooms, tenants, or someone who doesn't want to mess up their walls.I went to a local hardware store to purchase because it is difficult to imagine the actual size of items that it would hold by viewing online.The hooks are on the smaller side and it says they have a 3lb capacity. I'm not sure how much a belt weighs, but they haven't budged or come loose at all. I'm impressed for such a small strip of sticky glue that it works as well as it does. (it's also super easy to install)It does seem kind of pricey when you compare to the standard screw in hooks, but it looks as though you can reuse them which is a nice perk. I was surprised to see there were extra strips included in the package for future use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent hooks - have never let me down!","review":"I love these hooks! I set them up throughout my dorm apartment, and they have never once failed me. I can hang a bath towel (pretty heavy, I would say!) and hand towel onto one hook, and they will remain on it perfectly. I also use them to hang purses and totes, winter coats, belts, and a dry erase board. They have -never- \\"sunk\\" or loosened - all the hooks remain firmly in the position I set them up in (which, by the way, was a breeze!). I highly recommend these hooks and can't see why others didn't like them - maybe they messed up on adhering them to the wall? Or maybe they just tried to hang too much - every product does have its limit, after all. But, with proper use, these hooks sure have been a valuable addition to my apartment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality hooks!","review":"These things are rated at three pounds but it seems like they can hold a little more.

However, it arrived with a chip in the handle, near the edge of the pot.I've never had a pressure cooker before and have what is perhaps a irrational fear of pressure cooker explosions, so any sort of defect in the cooker only worsens my fear. This defect may or may not have had any effect on the safe operation of the cooker but I'm not taking any chances.The chip was deep enough to have removed the paint and taken a small chunk out of the metal/plastic or whatever the handle is made of, so even if it had nothing to do with the seal, I assume that over time it would reduce the structural integrity of the cooker.Plus, I'm wary of any brand new item that is already damaged. It doesn't make me feel confident about the overall quality of the item.So, unfortunately, I've returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Bang for Buck.....Deceiving Do Not Purchase this!!!","review":"Liked previous reviews, that's why we bought it; however, this Pressure cooker has an inherent problem, the lid just does not open up easily it at all. It's a challenge to open this lid especially when the contents & the cooker is very hot; &, when it opens up , it will not simply go back in place & lock. It's a struggle to open & close. I will not recommend this to anyone. The photograph is deceiving & misleading, there is NO Handle-Ear on the other side of the cooker that can help in picking it up. Also when we got it, it was not new. We paid for new, but we got a used one with scratches everywhere & a very bad finish. Do not Go by the photographs.PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME & MONEY & DO NOT PURCHASE THIS.But I must say that Amazon Return policy is excellent, they really helped me out in taking this back immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Futura pressure cooker","review":"Very good performance, the design was great, the pressure pushes the cover against the lid that help prevent escape of pressure"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great steam cooker","review":"This is a good product for all of us single or skinny people who prepare small amounts of food [on a busy schedule]. The lid should be easier to assemble like the Mexican pressure cookers Ecko. However, once you learned it well it becomes easier.Note: a slight tilt in closing the lid will cause steam to leak. Thus, you'll cook your food without the pressure characteristics. OK for veggies since they cook in 1 to 3 minutes.In summary: I am happy with it. Cheap. Reliable. Safe. Good steam valve rhythm that you'll love. Food in 2 to 10 minutes.

It is difficult to work with at 1st instant but gradually u ll discover its better than other ones. When I used it 1st time I felt its very difficult but then I found a easy way to deal with, it doesnt whistles like other pressure cooker so U ll never know whats the right time to remove from heat but it definitely sizzles..which indicates that pressure is built and steam starts coming out from lil nozzle..so its ready and u need to be alert and remove is just as u would with other whistling cookers.The lid locking is not difficult, u only have to keep it at right angles while inserting in body and then keep it parallel and apply some pressure to lock it. That is all. No difficulties as I read in reviews and was scared. Its similar to the prestige non stick handi if somebody used it.Body and make over is adorable simply.. u ll luv it beyond doubts.. and once u r used to u ll hate other brands..:) as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"mrs","review":"this products are the best cooker, I used every day for diferent situacion my family is large and I purchase 3 pressure cooker, and I go to buy another for give to my friend. thank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Cooker!","review":"I wanted to get back into pressure cooking after giving up on them years ago. I wanted more of a \\"pressure sauce pan\\" than a full sized cooker, since I only cook for my husband and myself.The little Hawkins 1.5 liter cooked up a batch of beef stew with carrots in about fifteen minutes. It should have gone a bit longer - as the meat was a wee bit tough. The FLAVOR blew me away.One of the advantages of pressure cooking I never thought about years ago is how energy saving they are. I was able to cook a stew in about fifteen minutes. I used way less energy than cooking a stew in a slow cooker or in a cast iron pot in the oven.Oh, and a great cookbook of Indian recipes comes with the cooker. I just might get a bigger cooker just to experiment with those tasty recipes from all over India.If you gave up on pressure cooking years ago, now is the time to get back into it.

I have a small family and mostly wanted a pressure cooker for daily bean cooking, brown rice, etc, and don't have much room in my kitchen. The pot was more compact than I feared it would be so it doesn't feel like overkill to use for one meal-sized amounts of food. But then yesterday, I was able to make 8 cups of chicken stock with a whole leftover chicken and tons of veggies! How great it was to make chicken stock in under an hour without the whole house smelling of chicken soup for days!! I love that this pot is silent while in operation mode. Once you master the technique of rotating the lid while inserting it, you can easily avoid touching the food with the lid.

The cooker is still in GREAT shape. We have replaced the gasket once and that is it.

Works great WITHOUT having to soften up beans for making soup. Luxurious dark brown/bronze finish is sooo smooth & cool to touch and look at.

I purchased the 9 liter for soup making and was a smart size choice. Hard anodized aluminum construction is very thick to maintain integrity, long lasting finish and heats up super fast to save on gas utility bill. Would heartily recommend.

As a result there is a large body of literature that misrepresents the facts. This book is just a rehash of these allegations done uncritically.

It is about 18\\" long by 12\\" wide, which is really big! So, it would probably be most appropriate for a medium or large dog. I wish they had a smaller version of this for cats and small dogs. One of the bowls has three small trenches near the top. This is the water bowl. If it rains or you over-fill it, the excess water will overflow into the moat, instead of into the food bowl.

His technical dexterity is obvious throughout the album. But that is not what attracts me to Sanchez's music. His improvisations are simply red-hot, full blaze. They're full of Latin flavor, but true to post-bop articulation and phrasing. His sound is so big and, at times, somewhat on the raw side. Throughout the album, he and Perez work very well together.

Kiernan clearly intends on creating a style for herself as well. As a Gen-Xer myself, I have been intrigued by the gothic scene, and this book transcends the niche very acurately. Other reviews usually state that Kiernan uses metaphors that are detached from reality in some way, and they do not necessarily follow through, sort of like a ramble. I must say that the rambles, to me, add much more texture and character to the story. The reading process is very similar to a human thought pattern, detached, rapid, the mind has trouble focusing on one particular word or vehicle for the emotion. This is a key that Caitlin Kiernan has forged for herself, and with it she could very well open the Gates of her mind and unleash Hell upon us (hopefully she will!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"I read this book as part of a group read...and we were all confused.

But after spending so much time developing her characters, setting mood, Kiernan falters into fantasy, garbled action, and typical horror schlock. She systematically does away with her characters in typical ten-little indians style, never fully exploring the threads she sows earlier-- the war of the angels and the effects of childhood abuse. Rather than a psychological exploration, it simply becomes another in a growing list of bodiless, rootless horror. She's capable of much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious, anyone?","review":"The horrible looking cover should have warned me with the dream catcher - but I still thought this would be a great book, I'm a big fan of Poppy Z Brite and everyone said this author would be along the same vein. Well, this book was pretty bad; she can write somewhat, but she tried to jam too many references to random bands and such in. the premise was a little tired, too, why have the goth-y stereotype of spiders? Why not something decidedly un-gothy, like a rabid gerbil? Anyway, besides lack of creativity, clichéd drug use, and pretentious references (PJ Harvey? I'm enlightened, but most people would probably not realize what a complete goddess she is), it's got *some* promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a novel, just a big pile of sentences.","review":"I will keep this short, as short as Silk should have been. Kiernan's verbose novel is tolerable only to those who have little or no interest in story, who wish to spend (waste) their time swimming in the superficial, faux-Gothic,pretentious crud known as \\"Goth.\\" This bastardized version of Gothicism will not appeal to people who enjoy the work of true Gothic writers, such as Poe and Shelley, for more than just the \\"spooky\\" descriptions. Kiernan's Silk is all about the make-up, people. The most Gothic thing about this novel is the mysterious lack of plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOODY, DARK NOVEL WITH THE FINAL HOPE OF REDEMPTION","review":"A winner. I hate to make comparisons, but it's on par with Poppy Brite's best (another one of my fave writers). Surreal yet strong plot line, characters so real they hurt... check this novel out (and check out Caitlin's THE DREAMING Vertigo comics, and her short stories, too)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing...","review":"Very disappointing read, and don't get me wrong, I like gothic literature and knew what I was in for. The problem with this particular gothic novel is that it's really only a short story strung out over hundreds of pages. Very slow, but I kept hoping it was going to build into a real crescendo. Unfortunately, even the ending is slow and a let-down. I love Caitlin's writing and the ins and outs of the characters like Spyder and Robin kept me going till the end, but then when it was finished, I was like, what was the point? No monsters...not even a villain to speak of! It's just words on a page. It's like my brother jumping out of a closet saying boo! Not really scary, just kind of there. I give it two stars for writing style, but if you're looking for plot, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a high schooler's spiral notebook","review":"This book held promise, and then left it at the door. What is left is the musings of a high schooler who felt the need to include every cleverly turned phrase ever jotted down in the spiral notebook between classes. They all turn up here, and even one of the main characters pays hommage to the source by carrying a notebook of her own. If only she had lost hers like the rest of us do. Goths have taken quite a hit lately, and it's a shame that many will see this book and think it's a summary of the subculture. Not every Goth is bound by the need to be pretentious and sullen. Not every Goth writer will disappoint quite this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and tedious","review":"I bought the book on a whim. I love horror fiction and thought, \\"cool, goth and horror.\\" Sounded like a good combination.Kiernan is a fine writer. She has an intense, lyrical style. But I just couldn't get into the characters. They sounded so self-absorbed and stupid. I was pretty stupid and self-destructive in my late teens and early 20's but, man, these characters are purely implausible and I got really bored with them fast.The only reason I finished the book was because I was driving from Chicago to Denver with nothing else to read. So it was better than watching TV in motel rooms. I quickly donated the book to the local used book store. Maybe there's a teenager or two that will pick up the book for $.50 and think the book is really fabulous and intense. Yay for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Dark & Creepy; Poetically Written.","review":"Caitlin Kiernan has a beautiful voice and it resonates throughout this dark novel. Kiernan's descriptions of the South, rock music, and the young outsiders that largely make up her cast of characters are all beautifully fleshed out, and her wonderfully disturbing tale will crawl into your mind and twitch until (and even after) you finish her book.Speaking of the mind, one of the themes present throughout this novel (and many of her other works) is the question of whether the inexplicable is in one's mind or is based in reality. She eloquently teases the reader with this theme throughout this work.This book was one of the first works that I ever read of Ms. Kiernan's, but it was not the last. I highly recommend all of her novels (as well as her works of short fiction). The sequel to this novel is \\"Murder of Angels\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"Even though I don't usually read horror, I thought this was a really brilliant novel. It deserves a much wider audience, in my opinion, than the people who are likely to be lured to it by the cover blurbs from Clive Barker and Peter Straub. Caitlin Kiernan's writing is almost word perfect, and I give this book two thumbs (and both big toes!) up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best MTV movie ever","review":"I rented this DVD and I laughed my ass off watching it, it starts off when the whole cast is on a wagon and suddenly things fly at them and they run into something and fly off of it.This is like the show but longer and more better.Its worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"See here, Jackass ...","review":"A TRUE 100% pure Jackass is someone who blows money and 2 hours on Friday night to see something they know they won't like, along side hundreds of misfits they know they won't like.Yo, Sweetheart, Sleepless in Seattle II is playing in the other theatre.I have just one question for you sophisticated movie goer types who rate this movie a one-star.

I am a kind of person who does not believe in political correctness of anykind and will always come to the aid of someone that doesn't believe in it either but this movie is the most demeaning film that Hollywood could ever produce. Doing your own thing is great but when it comes to stupid stunts that can kill you is another. We have to remember that the youth of today are not the most well educated (especially in America) and having them see this film is like holding a piece of red meat to a lion.This movie is in very bad taste (no pun intended).

I saw it with 6 of my buddies and we laughed so hard our stomachs were hurting the next day. I cannot remember the last time I laughed that hard at a movie. If you like practical jokes, slap-stick, or pranks, you will love this. It is entertaining. THIS is the exact same stuff I did when I was a kid, and it's hilarious to see it taped for all to see.

Have some fun watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dumb but not Dumber","review":"\\"Jackass The Movie\\" is a sometimes hilarious movie made up of a bunch of stunts performed by a group of pranksters lead by Johnny Knoxville. I had never seen the MTV Show on which this movie is based so I didn't know to what extent these guys would go in order to inflict pain on themselves or others.The funniest bits for me were those perpetrated on Bam Margera's mother and father. Dam setting off fireworks in his sleeping parents bedroom makes me laugh out loud as I type this.Also, Steve-O's snorting wasabi (japanese horseradish) is a classic.\\"Jackass the Movie\\" will never win any Oscars but it is at times ridiculously funny.

Just enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Do You Think THey Call It \\"Jackass\\" Anyhow??","review":"KNowing what to expect coming in, \\"Jackass\\" fullfilled all my expectations and also surpassed them. For those who don't know, they film is a string of short stunts by a group of very brave/foolish skaters who are constantly testing the bounds of their own destruction and torquing unsuspecting bystanders in the process. Imagine the old \\"Candid Camera\\" show on PCP. Yeah, way cool!The first scene made me fall in love with the concept when Johnny Knoxville with a straight face tries to return a trashed rental car he's just used for demo derby and ask earnestly for his deposit to be returned.Other highlights are \\"mobile roller disco\\", the human mouse trap and some of the stupidest(but funniest)destructive and dangerous concepts you will be glad someone else is doing.Editing is great, the director transitions from stunt to stunt without trepidation or hesitation. I could have watched another hour of this without tiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coming from a Bam fan....","review":"Although I do love Bam Margera, I have to say that this movie was not all that.

I think it was just a scam to get more money since they knew they made it off the show. I don't see how so many people are like, \\"LyKe OmG, tHiS mOvIe WaS lykE tHe GrEaTeSt MoViE eVeR!!!!!!\\" because there was hardly anything humorous about it.I guess if you have that sense of humor, then you'll like it. But I personally do not find sand vaginas and the constant hitting of the testicles funny at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be afraid to laugh","review":"I would give this movie a one star rating but I have to admit I laughed a whole bunch of the time. Why do I laugh? Because these morons decide to do the stupidest things to get themselves into a whole bunch of crap. But they'll do anything.

Yes the film was a box office hit, so expect sequels. Even though it's all in bad taste, for some reason it will attract movie goers. In Jack@ss 2, I'm hoping for a hot tub party full of bubbling sewer, and maybe they will dig up a corpse and make out with it.

A show about people hurting themselves for money. Then this vile disgrace of American culture came out 'Jackass the movie'. Be stunned : As a man eats a urine snowball.

The rest of the stunts were, in my opinion, not that outrageous.

It's just a 90 minute version of the TV show, and it's brilliant. No effort is made to connect the stunts with some lame story, and I think that's the best way to make a film like this. Can you imagine if they tried to tie in a love story or something lame like that? Ack! My favorite stunt is the golf course airhorn. Being a very crappy golfer myself, the few times I have ventured on a golf course, I was met with derision and contempt by my fellow golfers. I slice terribly, usually into other fairways, pissing off the other golfers. It's so much fun annoying golfers. Golfers are such pricks! Screw them! They're all like Ted Knight's character from Caddyshack. I thought Johnny and the boys were too nice to them! The rest of the film is great, too, but I adore the golf course scene.

IT'S FUNNY! Frankly, when Charlie Chaplin, The Marx Brothers, and the Three Stooges were making their movies, they weren't trying to make high art, they were trying to make some money and make people laugh! And so are the folks at Jackass. Yes, it's dumb, but damn, it's funny. It always makes me laugh out loud, especially because I grew up with guys who would do stupid things like that to themselves.

However if you like things such as that.. I'm sure you'd love this movie.The only part in the movie I found to be hilarious, was when two people dressed up as burglars and fell through a building's ceiling into a group of working people.

Like when party boy and steve-o humped a whale shark with shrimp in their pants or when Jonny rents a car and totals it in crash derby then reuturns it with 2 blow-up dolls in the back and runs off or oh well I could go on for days but i just like to thank the good people at jackass for helping me laugh.If you havent seen this you have never laughed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jackass: love it or hate it.","review":"With the series cancelled because of moronic senators, brainless parents, who find it easier to blame others than themselves for their kids lighting themselves on fire (seriously is it that hard to teach little billy that lighting yourself on fire is a bad idea) they decided to take it to the large screen with stunts even funnier and more outragious than the show. Jackass the movie is really a split down the middle. You either love it or hate it. I found the movie was as funny if not funnier than the show, (although the cky video's are even funnier). With stunts like the rent-a-car smash up derbie, and the golf carts, it made me laugh and repulsed others. Even the urine snow cone had it's charm, (even though it still haunts me)there is also a lot of stuff that is so outragious that you will not believe how crazy those guys are. Anyway I highly reccomend Jackass the Movie, and you should also check out the cky video's."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest film of all time","review":"This is a great movie. A movie that shows you everything you wanted to see in a comedy. Dick and Fart jokes rule! See this film because it rocks. Give it a chance and you'll love it. Trust me:) lol"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic movie of just dumb humor, and ouch.","review":"This movie is wall to wall laughs, definately not for the faint of heart or kids. This hooked me right out of the gate with rental car crash up derby. That has to be one of my favorite bits, along with the waking bam's parents up intermissions, and the Visit to the Radiologist sketch. These guys do the things that others just talk of, so that no one else really should do it. Check this out, it is funny. Of note, this version is the same as the Collectors DVD release, except the deleted scenes on are not edited back into the movie as in the unrated collectors edition, and there is no preview for Jackass two. So check this out, you will be happy with either version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why should I review this movie?","review":"A star rating would be inaccurate on so many levels to describe this \\"movie\\", so here is what I have to offer.See it if you enjoy the television show. It offers a few poop jokes, four vomiting scenes, crude stunts, male nudity, cringe-inducing golf-cart wrecks, concussions, and a guy trampoline-ing into a spinning ceiling fan, and other antics ranging from the daring to the raunchy, and more than once the skits just feel self-serving and bloated and unfunny, which is a killer for this movie.Avoid it if you would find these things offensive or disgusting to the point of dry heaving.And as for myself? I laughed...more than once,..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic love triangle amid wartorn London","review":"The title of this movie is deceptive advertising, the war is a backdrop to a very predictable love triangle. There is about 15 minutes of decent action which recreates (but does not credit)the Point du Hoc battle. Robert Tayor is sincere but 10 years to old to be a Captain leading troops in 1946. Dana Wynter is pretty enough to inspire two manly suitors but oddly doesn't seem to have any real passionate feelings for either. The brit commando third of this triangle is likable but out of the picture for all but a few minutes at the beginning and at the end. In short, a chic flic spun with a not very compelling tried and true wartime love triangle. Solid actors try but fail with mediocre material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is This a War Movie or A Love Story??!","review":"Disapointing. I was looking forward to a good action movie, but most of the movie is a love story, and the movie only gets to D-Day at the very end. The title is misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Michael Bay must have studied this film before he made his own execrable \\"Pearl Harbor.\\" In both cases, the filmmakers cynically titled their product after a famous WWII battle although they were really more interested in developing a dull, cliched love triangle than honestly confronting and exploring the meaning, experience, and drama of a significant historical event. At least, Bay relieved the tedium with some action. \\"D-Day\\" director Henry Koster doesn't address the actual invasion until the final ten minutes or so of this overlong film, and by then it is far too little far too late. Robert Taylor, Dana Wynter, and Richard Todd deliver their performances with all the animation of store-front mannequins. Taylor is far too old for this role, but Wynter, at least, is very nice to look at."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a war movie","review":"This movie is 1 hour and 46 minutes long. There is about 15 minutes of war footage related to D-Day. The other 1 hour and 30 minutes consist of 2 flashbacks by 2 soldiers. The flashbacks have to do with the woman they love. Each man is in love with the same woman, and the two men know each other.I wouldn't call this a war movie. I would call it a drama/love story with a war theme on the side.When I read the movie description, I was uncertain about it. Since there was no way to tell how much \\"love story\\" there was, or how much war footage there would be, I decided to give it a chance. Instead of sitting through the love story, I fast forwarded through it, and I'm really glad I did. It saved a bunch of time, which I was able to use for other stuff.Try renting it before buying it, unless you like 85% drama/love story and only 15% war footage, which I don't.To see some of my favorite military/war DVDs, click on my name, then click on \\"Listmania!

I had hoped for a better ending, but that was the way things happened back then."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOAP OPERA","review":"I purchased this thinking that it might be a mediocre war movie. It does not even rise to that level. It is merely a well acted soap opera. Good actors for that but no war film"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"Yes, the title \\"D-Day the Sixth of June\\" is irritatingly misleading. This movie spends most of its time chronicling the tawdry tale of a married U.S. military officer who has an affair with a British USO-type woman who is engaged to be married to a courageous British officer. The battle scenes are sporadic, and the story creaks along slowly. The handsome Robert Taylor and the beautiful Dana Wynter are basically wasted because their roles are so unsympathetic. The characters that they portray have few qualms about cheating on their loved ones.The movie also is not helped by a repetitious, sappy musical score that includes the sentimental song \\"You'll Never Know (How Much I Love You)\\" which accompanies the illicit lovers as they unapologetically indulge in their affair.\\"D-Day the Sixth of June\\" is strictly for diehard fans of Taylor or Wynter. And perhaps not even those fans will be able to swallow this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three handkerchief weepie","review":"You've got to feel a little sad for Dana in this one. Her American lover went home to his wife; her English lover trod on a bomb; and her father shot himself. Well, that's life I guess. There is some interest, but not a lot, in trying to figure out along the way how the story is going to get wrapped up. On the marginally plus side, it seems a fairly accurate depiction of how the war panned out for some women in Britain; and it captures something of the atmosphere on the home front. Not much about the action on the other front. I suppose most of the audience were pleased it hadn't happened to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Zombies, No Massacre, No Stars!","review":"Exploitation fodder with a deceptive title, \\"Zombie Island Massacre\\" (1984) only succeeds in killing your time. Bad acting galore but no Caribbean zombies - let alone massacre - in this dreary slasher flick. Not even recommended for Rita Jenrette fans (if any exist)."},{"rating":"1","title":"An excellent theatre biography","review":"This summer I have been in an acting workshop. Two of the scenes I worked on were from Three Tall Women and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Working on Martha was an extremely difficult and challenging exercise, but fascinating. I became interested in Albee's background and read Mel Gussow's \\"Edward Albee: A Singular Journey.\\" The book provides an excellent examination of Albee's life and the influences that informed his work. Reading this book helped me to better understand the character of Martha and the underlying themes of his plays. This book is not only a good read but also helps to reveal the playwright's motives, his drive and his creative sensibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"sadly he mirrors his work","review":"for a lenghty bio no new revelations.it just becomes clearer that he is as removed and vague as the characters he creates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Error on Page 379","review":"In discussing Elaine Stritch he says she lost the Tony to Carol Burnett.

Albee's various flaws and ups and downs are all neutralized in the name of friendship. A disappointing bore of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the inner circle","review":"Indeed this kow-towing book seems to have been written merely to please Albee's friends in the Hamptons, his family (what there is of it), and Albee himself. I sure hope Mr. Gussow got a party out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointing work","review":"I have to agree with the first reader that this so-called biography lets theater-lovers down. Albeem surely a fascinating and complex man, is presented here as a sort of middle-of-the-road human being, content in his golden years the way gray-haired folks are in Geritol commercials. Truly an insult not only to the reader, but to Albee himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"One foot in the grave","review":"This stilted recreation of a volatile and rich life is at odds with itself from the get-go. Albee, one of our greatest theatrical talents, deserves better. This attempt won't create interest in him for future generations. This is the sort of book that kills off spontaneity and learning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious Reading & the Cover Art was Wonderful too!","review":"Envisioning the cover stud as Reynold in the story made me cheer that he chose not to make the church his vocation in the end. It would have been such a waste! Reynold's honor, and struggle to do what was right really touched a chord in me.There was one too many gratuitous \\"almost-rape\\" scenes but the clever way Reynold had of saving Katherine from the first villain was inspired writing.The mystery, betrayal, distrust and struggle to maintain vows to church and to her betrothed all wove together to make a compelling novel. The historical elements were good too. I have re-read this many times and highly recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN !! WONDERFUL READ!!","review":"The DARKEST KNIGHT is a great read with a heroine who overcomes a lousy childhood and learns to trust herself and her man. In the end, there's nothing she won't do to save Reynold. The thing I liked best was that she WAS A WOMAN OF HER TIME, who learned to be strong.Gayle Callen is a rising star in the romance genre. Her style is lyrical and flowing and she truly captured the Medieval period.

Christian schools also don't teach their children growing up that killing jews and muslims will send them to heaven.He also suggests that America call for a truce with the Muslim countries.
