The only problem we've experienced was the band came apart but she runs marathons and the constant soaking with sweat finally got to the threads holding the leather together. No big deal, would happen to any leather band. Since she can tear up an anvil with a rubber hammer, the fact that the watch runs at all speaks volumes about its durability.

I had no idea what it was but just look at the photo. Resistance was futile.Space Disco. This is not my phrase. Another reviewer used it and it describes Atmosphere Strut to a virtual Techniques 5100. This music is assuredly 1970s disco, but replaces the foot down thump with an airy melodic texture. There are few lead vocals, but over the lightly popping bass there is a silky chorus of backup vocalists.This is not jazz. But listening, it does invoke a more danceable version 1970s funk jazz such as Donald Byrd'sBlackbyrdor Bobbie Humphrey'sSatin Doll. The difference lies in the emphasis here on pulse, and though this music has a more subtle boom then most of the era's mirror ball fare, there is more than enough beat here to land your shoe on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Just brilliant!

Wilma's and Lois' mother do not like the new car and was very upset. And also 2) for a black man to go to the south with a new shiny perfect car police think he stole it. The theme is both preparations because the dad knew of this of the warnings and trust because the family had to trust the Father on knowing what he was doing. Wilma's and Lois' Father get pulled over by a police officer and he has to spend the night in jail.

It has an older vintage look that is very stylish. The see through caseback is a nice touch even if the movement is not specifically decorated. Adjusting the watch is just a bit cumbersome in that to adjust the hour-digit the minutes hand must be rotated a full rotation. The seconds hand is not stopped when the crown is pulled out to adjust the time which can make getting the \\"exact\\" time a little tricky. Since it is meant to be of the vintage vein I'll put up with these annoyances, since it's great looking and less than a c-note. This is a Real Deal for a stylish automatic watch. The manual I received with the watch didn't really discuss this specific model, but there is only two positions (in/out) for the crown so one hardly needs a manual.

I think, \\"Time Travelling Blues\\" is even better than the debut. The songwriting is more mature, varied, the ideas are freshier and more attractive. The improved vocals and guitar work make this CD one of the best stoner rock releases. The highlights of the albuminclude the mighty \\"The Man Who Invented Time\\" and \\"Solarisphere\\".

The sound has most certainly come from the depths of a Netherworld that entered our time and space via Tony Iommi's left hand, Geezer Butler's thundering bass and Bill Ward's War Hammering. It forms a blade as true and sure as any Valyrian Steel used to play a game of thrones. This is assuredly Old World Heavy Metal at it's finest, nothing modern or flashy designed to sound like something but the real genuine article. \\"Solarisphere\\" and \\"The Man Who Invented Time/Diesel (Phunt)\\" are some of the best examples of the genre I've encountered since Side 2 of The Mob Rules\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"It'll grow on you.","review":"It's an odd mix of trance, blues, and heavy metal that form a really unique sound.

This is a phenomenal book. Blood Horses is partly an experiment in narrative technique. Like most literary experiments, it has its less-than successful moments. There are places where the author's allusions to and quotations from other texts get overwhelming. But the book also contains some of the most amazing pages of flat-out writing I've come across in a long time--about horses, about pain, and about beauty. Given its ambitious scope the structure holds together surprisingly well, and pieces of it are wickedly funny. If you come to it looking for Seabiscuit II, you might find it frustrating and a little disjointed. I came to it looking for a new writer who was trying something different, and I was blown away. This book is destined to become a classic and Sullivan an author to follow. I say discover him before everyone else does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful Van Briggle Collector's Resource","review":"Though dated 2002, this guide provides interesting, historical company information and is very helpful in authenticating and dating pieces.

I think Marillion has finer musicianship than the players that Fish works with. This release has a few good songs, especially \\"Goldfish And Clowns\\" and \\"Jungle Ride\\" but is not really that essential. His songs have become overly wordy(not unlike solo Roger Waters), with a politically correct preachiness that I find urksome, especially the long (just plain long 8:37 ) and musically uninteresting \\"The Perception Of Johnny Punter\\",yuck; at least it's the first song and you can just start your CD player on track two easily enough. To me his best solo work was \\"Vigil In A Wilderness Of Mirrors\\". Now on the other hand there's this fellow named Steve Hogarth who's done some fine work with Marillion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A much \\"hipper\\" Fish.","review":"After the horribly disappointing \\"Suits\\", it took me quite awhile before I could summon up the nerve to purchase this CD. Based on the strength of some of the songs I heard when I caught Fish live in the US, I decided to take a chance. I was glad I did. \\"Sunsets On Empire\\" is really a very good album that finds Fish taking on a new style of music and succeeding wonderfully. Gone are the overdone orchestral arrangements of his first solo album \\"Vigil In A Wilderness Of Mirrors\\" (a fine solo debut, but lately it's sounding very dated). This is a harder-edged guitar-oriented Fish, and--dare I speak the word--a much hipper Fish. Even though the old man's voice is noticeably weakening with time, he plays to his strengths and the overall vocal delivery comes off well. His follow-up release \\"Raingods With Zippos\\", while not quite as solid an album, is also worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What kind of plant is this?","review":"Decent enough plant, nice small pot.

It was also very high and pushed my head upward which actually put more strain on my neck. Furthermore this pillow is very very heavy.

SFP along with Little Brother are definitely letting the world know that the south still has lyricists that can spit it raw and enlighten the listeners!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book!","review":"You'll spend hours to make the figures offered.This big book is a must for all string figures's lovers.This book have about 110 string games and 10 tricks.The explanations and illustrations are clears.The book is for intermediates and advanced.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a zippo.","review":"My roommate was out at the mall and picked this up on a whim for me.

There is still too much reliance on the sale of one's home as a source of retirement assets--we all know how well that worked out in the last few years!

So many of the magazine articles and books I read about retirement these days seem to spit out the same old stuff, again and again. But this book is a surprise. From the moment I opened it, I was delighted to find that someone has finally brought some fresh eyes to the subject of retirement. I'm probably like many other people in believing the same myths about retirement that this book debunks. Most of the time it seems that the so-called experts enjoy just making us afraid of what we won't have when we retire. I'm happy to say this book shows us what we can have and just how we can get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Retirement 101","review":"This is a great beginners book for people looking to begin there plans for retirement. It is very basic advice with the biggest angle it uses is if you own a large house in a metropolitin area then sell that house and by a small one in a place with a lower cost of living. A retiree could sell their large house in the state of New York and move to Okalahoma City and live like a king off the equity that was in it. The main point of this book is that you do not need 70% of your current income in retirement to be comfortable. You should be able to dramatically reduce your expenses when you no longer work, like eating out,clothing and gas. You should also have all your debt paid off like your cars, and even your house by retirement time. To learn about this in great detail buy this book, if this sounds like common sense move on.I think any book by Dave Ramsey is all that is ever needed on personal finance, he covers everything. From budgeting to retirement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brock's opinions might lead to your penury","review":"If you followed Brock's advice on cutting unnecessary expenses then you probably shouldn't buy this book ($15). Mostly NY times op-ed filler with a few helpful web links. An example is the chapter on obtaining health insurance which is 90% a call to arms for nationalized health insurance and 10% practical advice. You can indeed consider retiring on less than you think if you believe the current government safety nets will be in place (and relatively unchanged) for the next 30 years and you are willing to live at a level that the government deems appropriate. I give the book one star for the included web links."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political NOT practical","review":"If you can get past the author's jaded political views on the Canadian healthcare system and his rose colored view of Social Security's viability, you'll find not much more than a simple worksheet by which to calculate your post-retirement needs.The practical suggestions (there are some) are limited and at times obvious.....ie: Ignore Wall Street's rules of thumb on how much you'll need to live on. The rest is NY Times op-ed filler. What a shame.....he had the right idea...just didn't follow through."},{"rating":"1","title":"10% Valuable Information, 90% Propaganda","review":"There are two helpful ideas in this book. Number 1, calculate your retirement needs yourself and don't rely on the \\"experts\\" that say you will need 80% of your pre-retirement income. Number 2, if you retire before 65 you will need health insurance, so shop for that wisely.Beyond that, the book is mostly a political rant. I'll spare you the details but a book like this is not the place for political campaigning.\\"Get a Life - You Don't Need a Million to Retire Well\\" by Ralph Warner is a much better choice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"The only advise I can give you if you follow the author's absurd advise is to make sure you keep a tin can handy so you can panhandle for you meals when you hit your seventies.

This is repeated throughout the sections of the book. If you already live in one of the less-expensive areas and do not have a large house to sell,this advice is little help to you. The author advises things like buying a used car and driving it for many years; haven't most people figured this out on their own? There is a lot of filler in the form of stories about people who illustrate the author's view, many of whom are \\"indulging their passion for bicycling\\" in retirement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing . . . pass this one up.","review":"This isn't a coherent book for overcoming your fears of retiring without enough money. Its a hasty and crude assemblage of Brock's \\"Seniority\\" columns from the New York Times. Indeed, the copyright is in the name of the newspaper instead of the author's.Look at the book's cover. It pushes the image that we're all timid little sparrows nervously watching eggs in our nests. If I read \\"nestegg\\" and \\"golden years\\" one more time, I'll need to excuse myself to retch in the hedges.I believe healthcare is a mess and \\"private accounts\\" won't solve Social Security's future troubles. But like other readers, I object to material that supports one side of these issues in a general book on retirement planning.For all that, the book's premise is absolutely correct: You don't really need 70 to 80 percent of preretirement income investments advisors say you do. Keep looking; there must be a better book than this out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"pedantic","review":"Elaine Kalisher is about the only thing that dredges this movie up from a 1 star as you're really pulling/hoping for her.

The writing is insipid, and the story shallow and predictable.Irritatingly, Salvatore does not spend much time on detail- suggestive of a rush job -and as a result, action is glossed over and realism is compromised. This is one of the worst books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passage to Dawn (Forgotten Realms: The Legend Of Drizzt","review":"The story flowed nicely. Full of action and personal glimpses of the characters struggles. Ending I hoped for more. Look forward to the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Author","review":"As always, R.A. Salvatore continues his great series going deeper into the Dark Elf city with lots of action writing. With just enough detail to spark your imagination in the way every fight spans out it makes you want to read every novel Salvatore has ever written. I HIGHLY suggest this series of books to anyone with even a slight interest in Science Fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 years too late","review":"I feel I am ten years too late for this review. As of 2007, I have just read this book. And let me tell you, it is WONDEROUS! It is filled with the classic adventure and fun that all fantasy books should be full of. THANK YOU Mr. Salvatore! You have delivered a book that I will cherish forever! As for the \\"resurrection\\" I personally LOVE it! Thank you so much for bringing this character back into the fold. Mr. Salvatore, I owe you a debt of gratitude for giving me a piece of history to cherish forever. What a book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Salvatore thinking?","review":"I followed the Drizzt saga avidly until this book. This book, however, annoyed me to no end.Note to Salvatore: FORGONE CONCLUSIONS ARE NOT ENTERTAINING! You can't help but get the feeling throughout this entire book that Drizzt is a godlike figure, completely untouchable, and that therefore any attempt to oppose him is an exercise in futility. It doesn't help that his primary opponent in this book is a figure he soundly crushed years before. When you find yourself cheering on the villains and hoping they teach Drizzt a lesson, something just isn't right.After this book, I came to the conclusion that Drizzt was too powerful to be interesting. Weaknesses are what round out an interesting character; Drizzt has none I can see. He's quite simply untouchable in combat, and a complete saint outside of combat. Read the other Drizzt novels and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly what I expected","review":"I am an avid fan of everything that has to do with Drizzt Do'Urden, and I was looking forward to this one more than you can know. However, I was rather disappointed when it actually came out. Starless Night was my favorite, and the books had, in general, been getting better each time. However, this Passage to Dawn does not continue this trend. The characters seem to have less depth, and the plot certainly does. It is predictable and rather destructive to the masterful stories Salvatore has told in the past. He always had two strong points: interesting, well-developed characters, and cool fight scenes. Unfortunately, neither of these shows up very well in this book. The great characters, other than Drizzt, are gone (Jarlaxle and Entreri) or poorly portrayed (Cattie-Brie, Regis). Even Drizzt doesn't seem to \\"think\\" as much as he used to. I think Salvatore got tired of writing the series, and he should have stopped at the last book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wulfgar resurrection ruins series","review":"I loved the previous books, although the later ones were stretching the story on a bit much... but as soon as I read Passage to Dawn, I was quite disgusted. Way to ruin a good series... guess the money per book thing is clouding his vision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is the true Drizzt dead forever?","review":"If it wasn't for Drizzt this book would get zero stars. This is by far Salvatore's worst to date. The plot is lousy and predictable, and the ending is a horrible letdown.Problem number just supposed to turn into vapor with the reappearance of the lump o' lard barbarian? Sorry Salvatore, but you'll have to do better than that.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invincible characters and absurd resurrection ruins book","review":"I would have rated this book higher for sheer readability, but as longtime a Drizzt fan some things just bothered me too much. These super-characters are no longer believable. I will probably read the next Drizzt novel as well, but the summary already worries me. Artemis will be back again. Get some new characters, Salvatore! The Artemis/Drizzt rivalry should have been over when Drizzt finally defeated him (in the Legacy I believe). I thought bringing Artemis back in Starless Night was really pushing it, let alone having Artemis pop up again for yet another round with Drizzt. Drizzt is a great character, but future novels are desperately in need of some new material"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zak's dead, melted in acid.","review":"Alright hosers, first of all, Zak could never be brought back, at least not in his body, it was melted to poop. Secondly, you can see how Wulfgar could be brought back due to the fact that the spider queen's hand maiden had killed him and this allowed the queen to have his spirit. You should all know that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The weakest of the lot.","review":"Ok, Drizzt's getting a bit tedious now. when's he gonna shut up and stop whining? heh. Anyway, I love the whole series, mostly. There are one or two things I dont like, most of them in this book. Why does anyone want Wulfgar back? He's the weakest of the characters. I think most people would have preferred it was Zaknafien. I knew, deep down inside that it was Wulfgar, but I never stopped hoping that it was good ol Zak instead. Ah well, cant win em all. Other than that, where's the plot?? The only thing I trully liked about this book was the fact that Cadderly was in it and I got to find out what happened to him after the Cleric Quintet. If your a die hard Drizzt fan, read it. If your not, and if your getting a little tired of the whole Drizzt thing, dont bother, it's not worth the disapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I finished it and think it to be one of his best books!","review":"I read the reviews say this to be boring and one of the poorest writings but bought the book anyway. Well those poor reviews didn't prepare me for the great reading I found instead! As with most all of Salvatore's books in the Forgotten Realms series I found I was dreading the upcoming scene in fear and other parts had me laughing out loud! I can't say enough except that you need to read this book! Now on to the Silent Blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drizzt and his friends are still Salvatore's best creations.","review":"Passage to Dawn continues the The Adventures of Drizzt, Catti-brie, and their friends to the next level. Of all of Salvatore's novels, only the ones featuring Drizzt and his friends show any signs of greatness, and Passage to Dawn proves this. We can only hope that Passage to Dawn is NOT the last Drizzt novel that R.A, Salvatore does. My only criticisms are that it was a bit predictable at times and that the opponents didn't seem worthy nor capable of ever winning. Of course they didn't, this is the last Drizzt novel.(I hope I am wrong!) Homeland still remain's the best of Salvatore's work, and I recommend it to anyone that hasn't read a Salvatore novel before"},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite the critics it's still a great book","review":"Like always the battlescenes are excellent and the way Errtu builds up the tension in the book is great. I loved the expansion of the characters of Harkle Harpell and Robillard. I would really like to see Robilliard in a more in depth view in a later novel. The meeting of Drizzt and Cadderly was superb even though I didn't know anything about the Cleric Quintet. Also thankfully there were no more damn drow or Entreri to annoy the heros again. The final battle was superbly done even at least one of the heros should of died. Such as maybe Wulfgar again. I also would of liked to of seen Catti-Brie and Drizzt just do it already. I mean everyone is expecting them to anyways. But still overall a excellent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"Oh, I'm sorry, I was still asleep after reading this snoozer. Definately not vintage Salvatore. But that's OK, Drizzt's getting a bit tired out anyway. I'm sure that by now Salvatore has to strap himself to the chair and force himself to write about him. Salvatore has what many fantasy writers of today lack - a real eye for simple story telling. I'll still take his worst offering (as this most surely is) over more prolific authors', such as Goodkind and Jordan, who in their contest for the most comparisons to Tolkein, create overloaded lands and well, lets face it, boring characters and plot. Salvatore is still one of the best, despite this relative setback. If you don't believe me, just pick up a copy of THE DEMON AWAKES."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can we say Hammer Man?","review":"Sure we all saw that it was Wulfgar coming back, but I don't get the people out there who didn't want him back? Come on! For one thing he gives you an awesome conflict as an author (Catti-brie's choice). For the reader though, it has to be the Hammer. Aegis-Fang kicks some serious butt and in the hands of a man like Wulfgar, one can see some serious critter stomping. Sure Zak would have been cool, but who's to say he won't be back later? The main thing with Zak though is that he has been granted a peaceful rest. Drizzt has put him behind. The situation with Wulfgar and Catti-brie will make life so much more interesting. Where is the conflict if it is Zak? Then you just have two supreme drow warriors tearing it up on the surface. Where's the fun in that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"Although it started out slow, it ended great. Between a surprise reunion, new charachters, and great interactions between the charachters of this novel, it was a great read. A worthy ending to a fabulous series. Fantastic job Mr. Salvatore! Keep up the great work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful work but a few let downs","review":"I really ejoyed this book as I did with all of the Drizzt books however there were quite a few things that anoyed me in this book. Also I hate the, \\"I'm so powerful\\", aspect of Drizzt. I liked the end fight with Errtu but still the running after the Yeti thing and hacking it to peices was kinda lame.

In fact, it's been a while since I've been so impressed with a sitcom's debut season. I kept waiting for the show to run out of laughs, but it never did - just about every episode was a winner.I have to admit that I worry the show could run out of ideas and grow stale - and I did think \\"Earl\\" lost its charm pretty quickly - but I hope it continues to deliver for another year or two.

The knight was a tower strength and courage yet the book brought to focus his fears and his selfishness.I'm sure there are deeper levels of analysis for this book - good books often do.- johnny -"},{"rating":"2","title":"Draws on Celtic myth for a dramatic, moving tale.","review":"This exciting, powerful myth combines the best of the old Celtic belief in the sanctity of a solemn promise and the Christian ethic of forgiveness.

Very solid notation, a complete treatment of impedance/admittance matching topics, a great chapter on Smith chart fundamentals. Lots of worked examples and practice problems. The only drawback is that the chapter on methods for calculating R,L,G,C is outdated, having been replaced by modern numerical computational methods. It's a shame this little book has gone out of print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest myth: This book has a conservative slant","review":"I don't understand some of the reviews. Conservative slant?

His history is fairy correct but he leans towards the left of most political situations and people, never quite obtaining a balance from both or more sides. I would hate to find this book in the school library under best history etc. or a 'must' read by some history teacher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent layman's book","review":"This may not be a \\"scholarly\\" tome, that just makes it readable. In the various chapters he relates on what is commonly believed is false. The Jefferson/Hemmings controversy will never being agreed upon by all. Some reviewers have claimed there was a right-wing biased, but if he was right-winged biased, then why did he defend Elanor Roosevelt from charges of infidelity. If he was so conservative, then how come he did not write so fondly of Joseph McCarthy as Ann Coulter has done?Written by a Emiritus Professor of History, you can rest assured of this book's accuracy. I highly recommend. Even as a professional historian, I find this a delightful break from harsh \\"scholarly\\" tomes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little clarification on Jefferson","review":"I am writing this just to clarify what was revealed by the DNA evidence with Thomas Jefferson. It was concluded that beyond a doubt a Jefferson impregnated Sally Hemmings. It could have been Thomas, or any of his brothers, cousins, sons, father, etc. With all the Jeffersons who surely visited Monticelo, it is impossible to say with any degree of certainty that T. Jefferson was indeed the father of Sally Hemmings's child. Although (insert opinion here) does it really matter? I think one of the most beautiful things about Thomas Jefferson was that he realized his wrongs and understood them as well as anyone else. He claimed that slavery was a trap for not only the slaves, but the slave holders! For him, slavery was an addiction that he could not and did not ever overcome. Read his writings some time and you will find this is true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed for Life","review":"I realized after reading Maynard Rolston's book, \\"Time Management is an Oxymoron\\", that I was very much like that frog in the boiling water; I just never noticed how out of control I was. Despite the mounds of paper on my desk, an overflowing inbox, meetings on meetings, and always struggling to keep up with deadlines, I felt fine about my overall effectiveness as an Information Technology Director. But, after reading Maynard's book and applying his system to my situation, I've come to understand just how disorganized I'd been and what impact this had on my effectiveness and my team's productivity. This book can - and does - provide the techniques that will bring positive change to the increasingly hectic business environment. Thanks Maynard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real World Help","review":"Mr. Rolston's ideas not only are very helpful, but they are also very achievable. They are proof positive that real world experience makes for the best advice. His book, written in a novel/story like style makes for easy and enjoyable reading. His examples make you think of people you know and work with and even about yourself. This is a must have book for people that want a solution to being more productive in their work, not just more work in trying to be productive."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time management book I've read cover to cover!","review":"Written from a new slant, this book is interesting and entertaining enough to get you through the steps it takes to truly get organized and make more time for yourself and your family!

I never thought I would find it so interesting and spellbinding. I was doubtful when first beginning the book that the author would be able to maintain his observer status, but he did so remarkably well, raising the turkeys to be real wild turkeys. As I read the final line in the book, I felt I was closing a chapter in my life in which I had personally been involved with the turkeys and the author. I was impressed with Mr. Hutto's dedication to these remarkable birds, his keen observations, and also with his obvious \\"connection\\" to them. I hope he will write again in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply inspiring and heartfelt.","review":"Beautifully written and truly amazing feat accomplished by Mr. Hutto. Many can raise wild turkeys in their own world, however, it took a man with great conviction and love for the bird and it's environment to reverse the process and let the poults raise him. I couldn't put this book down and fell in love with the characters. In closing, I truly admire Mr. Hutto for his dedication and am thankful I don't hunt anywhere near TurkeyBoy's range as I don't believe I could pull the trigger on a bird that has survived the perils he has faced throughout his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illumination In the Flatwoods","review":"Although I could not afford to purchase this book, I was delighted to get a copy from my library. I love the animal/human relationship, esp. when taken to its magical realm; the doors that open when entrusted by an animal. The sketches are sweet, simple and relay so much feeling; they are art. For a human to reach for this level of relationship is remarkable and to have it returned by animals is magical. Esp. the last par.: \\"...by some language that we both understand but cannot speak, and I could say: 'I know you, old friend. I recognize you by your iridescence, your incandescence, your illumination - I recognize you by your loneliness-you must be my brother.'\\" This book is a sort of recollection of who we are - our purpose. I love the double meaning of illuminated."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book","review":"I watched the PBS version on TV and enjoyed learning about the relationship Hutto formed with wild turkeys and wanted to learn more so I put the book on my Wish List and received it as a gift.It's tender, touching, informative, poetic and lovely.I bond with animals of all kinds, including domestic chickens and can appreciate the experiences of cross-species bonding as outlined in this book.Love it, love it, love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, fascinating, page turner","review":"Joe Hutto is a wonderful writer. This book is a fascinating, hard to put down, page turner. Who would have thought that a book about turkeys would be so hard to put down? In this book, Joe Hutto raises a clutch of wild turkeys in northern Florida with all the joys and angst of any parent. Even people who do not read natural history books, would find this book an interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite a delicious gift.","review":"I actually met Michael Mangia not so long ago, and through this meeting I came across this work of his. Quite surprised I was when I put it in.

From the beautifully mellow \\"Silent 45\\" to the more complex \\"Blueberry Boy.\\" The lyrics are strong, and such reminders of the work of Tori Amos, or even Fiona Apple are not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best-Seller Great","review":"\\"Sisters Forever\\" by Sharon D. Martin should be on the Best-Seller list. From page one my interest was captured and the action that followed held me captive to the very end. Martin proves to readers everywhere with \\"Sisters Forever\\" that she is the ultimate storyteller. Woven through out the narrative is the premise that love can overcome the troubles that life tosses our way. Martin's use of dialogue and action to move the story forward enables readers to feel they are living the story with her characters.

Not what I am used to from Sandra Brown, because it was hard to really believe that Dak was in love with Gayla and vice versa, due to so many conflicts and obstacles. I agree with the reader from Philadelphia that it takes talent to write an entirely different type of story each time--but this story was the furthest from her previous work that I have ever read. I can't wait to read her next book--not based on this one, but in hopes that it will be similar to The Color of Love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sandra Kitt is an excellent writer. I'm returning the book!","review":"I've read many of Kitt's books. This was an uninteresting story that left too many unanswered questions. Questions that continued to scream in my head. It became so upseting that I began scanning the book. Then finally, I gave up. This took all of about two hours. I hope I can find my receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"i expected better of ms. kitt","review":"The book could definitely have been better. I expected better of the author. I have read several of her other books and all of them were excellent. Color of Love was fantastic!

Her latest effort was a disappointment but I'm sure her next one won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sandra Kitt's Best Work","review":"I've read other books by Sandra Kitt and have always liked her. This book doesn't even come close being as good as the other books Sandra Kitt has written (especially She's the One and The Color of Love). I felt that the story took way to long to unfold. The first half of the book seems to be devoted totally to not letting the story unfold. When things do finally start to happen it's toward the last third of the book. Once the story finally begins to move things seem to happen pretty quickly and events that should be devestating are wrapped up in just a few pages. I guess that is due to the characters in this book being amazingly resiliant and forgiving. Normally I would heartily recommend Sandra Kitt, but in the case of this book I say only read it if you are a devoted fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Not the style of writinig i'm used to from her.

Also, if you play it for more than an hour the questions repeat themselves so basically if you play it once there is no reason to play it again. It's a huge waste of money. For 30.00 they could have at least put a larger database of questions on the DVD or have more than one DVD included in the game.This is a BIG disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get the DVD version","review":"The DVD version of this game is terrible. Syncing up the buzzer remotes to the DVD player is a lengthy process. If successful, once synced the buzzers seem to be effective only half the time during game play. However, the biggest problem with the game is that if you play the game more than once, several of the questions repeat which makes repeat playing of the game unfun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only works sporadically","review":"This was a very disappointing Christmas gift for my daughter. We were able to return it, so we're happy with Amazon - but it's a bummer of a toy. The problem is that the controllers work so poorly - when you try to use them, you have to keep pressing the buttons over and over and over again to get the signal to register on the DVD player. A very frustrating experience. Not sure if something was wrong with our particular controllers, or if they all work that way.Another bad feature is that if your child wants to take the game to a friend's house - they have to spend 10 - 15 minutes reprogramming the controllers all over again to work on the friend's particular DVD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not mad about Mad Gab but mad at Mad Gab.","review":"Our family has game night and we change who hosts the party.

Not many movies exist that show the positive roles we can aspire to be as Latinos in this world. Among all of the stereotypes portrayed in the movie, we see aspiring Doctors and people working hard to make a better life for themselves. The actors may not be well known, but I guarentee by the end of the movie the message will be loud and clear. I especially recommend this movie for leadership retreats and cultural organizations looking to show how one can truely uplift themselves despite the impossible odds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indepth character development","review":"In a refreshing story, the crew of the USS Excalibur is examined more in depth. Though there is an overall peril storyline, it is shadowed by the day to day issues/interactions of the crewmates aboard.When it is not the topic of romance, we see many of the second string characters develop as well. Its nice to see that the inhabitants of the 24th century have the same day to day dealings we do, and that everybody on the ship has an important role in one way or another.Think of it as Melrose Place in space. There a quite a few romantic plotlines with numerous twists that are highly entertaining and funny. There is great chapter in which the female Vulcan, Soleta plays an unwilling ships counseler a la Deanna Troi. Crew members want to ask her for advice on the topic of love, and being Vulcan.., well you can imagine the dry logic she expresses and finally subcumbs to frustration. Very funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex Instead of a Story","review":"It looks like I'm not in the majority here, but I'll say it anyway. Both the newest \\"New Frontier\\" books-- Fire on High and Martyr-- are written more like Peyton Place (or Party of Five for younger folks) than a good Star Trek novel.If you like sex scenes and want to know who's sleeping with who or carrying who's baby (believe me it gets confusing in Fire on High), then by all means read this book. But these scenes took over the book in my opinion and any sort of Star Trek story or message was added, it seemed, as an after thought.These latest efforts in the New Frontier series do not deepen and expand the understanding of the Star Trek universe, they merely move it into pulp fiction. Where are we exposed to new scientific theories? Where is the interesting plot with twists and turns? There is no depth to any background explanations of the new species encountered here.Sorry, but I don't like this new direction.David Hess"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lose the Mugato with the English accent","review":"The first four books of this series were great. Then Burgoyne humped everyone and a Mugato with an English accent saved the day. What started with promise has become disgusting.

This would make an excellent tv series if kept in line with the first six books, or several good movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"An improvement over the dismal New Frontier novel: &#65533;Martyr'","review":"This book is certainly better than \`Martyr' the sexed up quasi religious mess that it was. I liked the Morgan Lefler character, she had a certain grit and earthy charm. The emotional strain between her and her estranged and embittered daughter Lt Robin Lefler was palpable.The ultimate super-weapon angle spoiled it. Especially when it's in the hands of an emaciated, deranged former travelling companion of Morgan Lefler. Who destroyed all life on the now barren planet she resides on..It had all the ingredients of typical \`Trek' A god like race; the Prometheans who give \`loaded guns to children' an immortal being, a strange energy creature endangering the Star-ship , a mysterious woman inexpliquably bonded to a superweapon, and a serious contravention of the Prime Directive. The trouble is Peter David over spices the mix and the result is not a palatable as it could have been, nonetheless a good effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Cervone's book","review":"The author used this book in addition to his notes to teach his Unix Performance course at the UCalif at Santa Cruz Extention(which is next to San Jose Airport). Maybe the two day course was too short, but there were not enough coverage to be useful. While there are detailed account for raw performance comparisons between different hardware platforms, and hardware resource usage topics, there are no sections on performance tuning which is what you want out of this course. Yeah may be that topic is in the referenced books. Afterwards I went back to get the Cervone book(old but good) and discovered what I was missing. So know what you need before you buy. I didn't have a choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS FOGGER IS A PIECE OF JUNK! DO NOT BUY","review":"I'll get right to the point. The trigger assembly gets stuck in the handle assembly, and makes the fogger virtually unusable, except for the occasional stick free squeeze (about 1 out of 20). Getting the trigger to pop back out of the handle is nearly impossible, and actually mine is completely stuck now and will not come out. It is quite annoying, and like I said makes it virtually unusable.

Trust me, it's junk, do not buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overpopulation is more about attitude","review":"Rushdoony does it again. He explains that overpopulation is thousands of years old; our hunter & gatherer ancestors didn't have it easy at all - the game, more often than not, got away. Most of the book's some 60-pages details how socialism leads to food shortages because socialism robs the farmer (and other hard-workers) while rewarding the slacker, then blames the resulting economic problems (no money for food) on overpopulation.He offers a different perspective on plagues - they tend to happen in societies who have allowed themselves to become self-centered.Great book, but that's typical Rousas J. Rushdoony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful information on St. John's wort & depression","review":"While trying to decide whether and how to use St. John's wort, I read three books on it and flipped through some others, and I liked this book the best. I appreciated that, although Dr. Cass seems to lean toward \\"alternative\\" treatments for depression--including St. John's wort and large doses of vitamins and minerals--she is not ideologically opposed to \\"conventional\\" antidepressants, which she also uses in her clinical practice, and so she is able to offer some helpful comments on the relative merits and appropriate roles of St. John's wort and synthetic antidepressants. The book includes chapters on what depression is, what St. John's wort is, how to use St. John's wort, the evidence for its efficacy, synthetic antidepressants, nutrition, and other elements of a \\"depression-free lifestyle.\\"(Two other recommendations on depression: Richard O'Connor's \\"Undoing Depression\\" and John and Andrea Nelson's \\"Sacred Sorrows.\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-written,user-friendly, practical guidebook!","review":"This book provides excellent coverage of a potentially confusing topic.

In short, there's dust under the glass, inside the scanner where it's unreachable, that I can see with the visible eye, and that is magnified in scanned images. Image quality would be excellent except there's dust specks all over the place on the images. Since consumers have complained of a similar dust problem with previous Epson scanners, I thought the company would fix it with this new model, but they didn't. In fact, quality control doesn't seem to have improved--there's even a fingerprint on the underside of the glass. I'm returning this one and getting a Cannon or HP instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value; great performance!","review":"Contrary to the experience of another reviewer, dust was not at all a noteworthy problem in my unit. The vast majority of the dust specks I have scanned were above the glass and on the pictures scanned. Users must be careful to clear these areas of dust prior to scanning. I found a dust-removal (anti-static) spray helpful in this regard. The extremely few specks of dust under the glass were no more numerous than in a more expensive ScanJet I have used many times at my workplace.The image quality in the scans is tremendous compared to other scanners I have seen. The texture of the photographic paper is clearly visible in higher resolutions, for example. The colors are also more true to the original image than in the other scanners I have experienced recently. The film-scanning attachment is a great deal at this price-point. I have used this unit quite a bit to scan photos and slides at resolutions up to 1200dpi, and I have been very pleased with the results."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Scanner is SOOOO BAD!","review":"I've always been an epson fan, so when one of my friend told me that his epson scanner gives him problem, I thought it was just his scanner (one of those rare occasion). Unfortunately when I got this epson scanner (which is a little higer model than his), it had the exact same problems! At first this scanner seems great but only a couple months later, it tends to scan in wierd channel (like bright neon green, etc). The problem eventually goes away and pop back up again every once in a while. I have the scanner for over a year now (and trust me I don't use it THAT much). Suddenly, it scanned BLACK. The whole screen goes back. I know my connection is good, and it's the scanner. TECH SUPPORTS CHARGES YOU ...IN ADDITION TO THE PHONE BILL BECAUSE IT'S NOT A 1-800 NUMBER.

The slide scanner attachment worked well, but the flat bed scanner produces dark color bars over about one third of the scanned page and I can't figure how to get rid of them. The part of the page not effected by the color bars looked very nice, but I need a full page scanner not a two thirds page scanner. I'm going to return this unit and request another, if that doesn't work I'll go with a different brand. I'm surprised, I've always had good luck with Epson products.

As stated in other reviews, most of the teas in this set are extremely weak in flavor. What I even found more troublesome was that different packets of the same flavor of tea steeped different and were not consistent. Most of the time the tea tastes like hot water.

So the selection is not really idea, when you consider how many interesting teas are in a Twinnings assortment (and EG is my favorite). Had I paid $36 I'd be giving it one star.

In actuality it is 12 X 10 X 2.5 and comes in a CHEAP (do not even know if it IS wood) box AND it weighs 1.14 pounds on my postal scale. However, to be fair, I have not taken the plastic wrapper off because it is a gift so it could be very, VERY thin wood. In addition, the container opens like a box rather than a chest.

I think that this novel is one of the best, if not the very best, of this long-running series. While cleaning her father's attic after his death, she finds papers which document that she was adopted by the McCones. She decides to look for her birth parents and her investigation takes her from Montana to Boise, Idaho to Modoc County in northern California. Someone doesn't want her to find out the truth, and Sharon finds her life is in danger as she gets closer to the truth. This novel is fast-paced and the mystery of her birth parents keeps the reader turning the pages. This novel by this wonderful author is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast moving and thought provoking","review":"this book centers around tragedy,the discovery of Sharon's adoption and her quest to locate her birth parents. An unbelievable journey, both spiritually and geographically, with all the emotion and surprising greed.A fast paced, totally involved experience, bringing to life her complexand enjoyable characters. I heartily recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mass Production","review":"Marcia Muller writes like somebody who has just accomplished a 3 week seminar on how to become a \\"bestselling author\\". This book is based on three ideas: The adopted child's search for its biological parents, a bit of Indian culture & history (esp. Shoshons) and, finally, the truth in the unspoken. Muller adds to this meat some ketchup (e.g. an unrealistically friendly friend Hy) and cheese. Sharon McCone, the protagonist, seems to know in advance what people try to hide from her. At the end of the 342 pages, what a surprise, she knows everything. Muller's prose is completely uninspired and uninspiring. Compared to the contemporary witty and intellectually rich European crime fiction (Henning Mankell, Maj Sjöwall, Per Wahlöö, Wolf Haas) this book is just boring mass production. My conclusion: No more Marcia Muller!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new life for Sharon McCone","review":"Sharon always knew that she was part Shoshone, growing up. She took a funny pride in realizing how much she looked like her Shoshone great-grandmother rather than the rest of the siblings in the McCone clan. That pride is seen in a whole new light when her father's death raises questions about her birth. Her exploration of the mystery takes her into the past, looking for the secrets of her heritage.Yet another well-written renewal for the Sharon McCone series. Muller is perhaps better than any other writer at letting her character really evolve. I look forward to the books that will follow the material here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book - South-East Asia on a Shoestring","review":"i have been using lonely planet books for many years. a real bargain for info received. can easily save the cost of the book in one day using their recommendations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corky and Quirky","review":"I wrote this book because I was an American living in Ireland, and saw a way of life dying in front of me. And nobody was doing anything about it. So I interviewed about 40 or 50 older people about their lives, their dreams, their sorrows, and weaved some history around it to bind it into a book. But basically it's a collection of different voices adding to a portrait of an Ireland that's now gone. It's a colorful collection, I think, and fairly easy to read. But I also wanted it to be very human and touching. It has been some time now since I've read it, but I picked it up the other day, and read a few pages. I think it's a good book, not a great book.

Just about everything that Z had to say aboutthe Moon, the Goddesses and Women's issues resonated with me.How delightful to see the celebration of women, volumptuouswomen, strong women, earthy women, women comfortablewith their bodies and sexuality; the celebration of Goddessesin print.And this book, more than any other I have found, capturesthe pure energy of the moon's magic. The gentle femininemystery unfolds more and more with each chapter. Z softlytakes her readers by the hand and allows them to feel thepowerful yet peaceful energy of Grandmother Moon.It is wonderful to read how Z transforms many patriarchal words, like 'Queendom'! I have embraced her terms with hearty pleasure.I bought this book over fifteen years ago and thoroughly enjoyed dipping into its luscious pages. A true Goddess send!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Take what this book has to say with a grain of salt.","review":"The spiritual comments are marvellous, but the factual content is dodgy. Z. seems to think that a woman will always get her period at the same phase of the moon. But the typical 28-day menstrual cycle is *shorter* than the moon's cycle of 29 1/2 days, so it won't stay in step. (Besides, many women's cycles are a few days shorter or longer than the average.) Z. also says the Earth and Sun are getting closer together at the Northern Hemisphere's summer solstice; that's actually close to aphelion. (It's the tilt of the Earth's axis that causes the seasons, not our distance from the Sun.) And as for astrological birth control, and garlic juice as a cure for cancer...! An inspiring book - but take it with a grain of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever","review":"I bought this book when I was in my \\"Discover the Goddess within yourself\\" stage in life. However, Ms. Budapest does little to further the possibility of a female deity with her moonlore. Mostly post-hippy new age remakes of stuff that has no credence in this world, but helps the old getting older feel better about turning away from Christianity and into something a little daring....like the old pagan gods. Hey, how about that God of Lightning!? Yeah, he really does something for me! Must be nice to create your own \\"moonworld\\" and market it in paperback form.

She just thinks the kid likes the nanny better, and the kid does.This movie is a cross between \\"The Guardian\\" and \\"The Hand That Rocks The Cradle,\\" both superior movies in the horror/suspense catorgory.The scariest thing in this so called horror movie is a picture of the devil embracing a woman. That's it. There aren't even spooky sounds in the night.However, I gave it two stars because it was soooooooooo funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"A special combination of satanism and retardation","review":"This movie sucked so bad that my hair hurts. The little girl who is going to be married to satan is so ugly. I hope that she isn't expecting to marry anyone better than satan due to her ugliness. The mother is completly insane, like Olivia D'abo would want to have sex with her pock faced monster husband. All the mother does is have paranoid flashes from the movie, but the gay thing is that the flashes are from parts of the movie that haven't happened yet and aren't relevent to anything. This movie is just trying to tell women, \\"Hey don't go out and get a job because when you're gone, your beautiful nanny will boff your husband and marry off your daughter to satan.\\" but then again we can't turn on the nightly news anymore without hearing about somekind of scenario like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty lame","review":"Who were the actors in this? I'd never heard of any of them, and they were pretty bad anyways. I didn't get anything out of this movie at all. I tried to find some sort of story or message but there's just nothing to be found. It seems to be about some everyday mother who gets some European girl to come over and look after her daughter, but the girl has some kind of relationship with the devil or something crazy like that. I feel asleep about 30 minutes from the end, so I didnt see it all but from what I saw, the girl didn't really do anything wrong. Just because the girl took her daughter to some carnival, the mother goes crazy and gets all upset and I just didn't much of a point after that or even before that. It seems the mother believes she owns her daughter like a slave or something. This is nothing but a jealous mother.

The Trojan War and what led to it, and Anaxandra's own life. She is around the same age as me, and although I could not excatly connect with her with her problems, I really enjoyed viewing this timeperiod through her eyes.

Cooney's work, and/or fans of Greek mythology/history.While the novel ends well, and could very well conclude Anaxandra's story, there are possibilities that Ms. Cooney could continue writing about; does Anaxandra ever see her parents again?

This is not a book for the novice econ reader and I'm not sure they would find it useful but if you have a grand desire to really know the subject, you must learn who the major contributors are to this field.

Through the trek across what seems to be half the world, Henry recalls the many important events in his life incuding all three of his failed marriages, his wild days as a married bachelor, and his constant search for his purpose in life.This book is an adventerous, hysterical, and sad make-shift diary told from the point of view of many people like Henry Lightcap -A Fool."},{"rating":"2","title":"The simple truth about the human condition","review":"Fools Progress is a special book. It made me laugh and cry out loud. It forced me to evaluate all of those things in my life that I felt were important. The book certainly changed my paradigm. This is the essence of the human condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"i really liked it","review":"My boyfriend introduced me to Edward Abbey. He likes to live vicariously through him and wanted me to read him so I could see what a womanizer and a hard living guy really is like!!!!!!!. Ha! He was right. It is heartbreaking and funny. I could not put it down. I am look9ing forward to reading many more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Against the flow...","review":"I'm sorry but I have to disagree with the majority of the reviews here. I disliked this novel so much I couldn't even finish it...and that's a rare thing for me. I suppose if I wanted to give someone an education on sex from a man's point of view it'd be a great book to recommend. Otherwise I would tell people to skip it. I didn't find Henry's ideas enlightening, and I failed to see how the journey he took was progressive. Maybe I missed the point entirely, but I just wasn't able to appreciate good ol' Henry Lightcap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abbey's Defining Novel","review":"This is a masterpiece. A deeply personal work of fiction. I sense that the mood and experiences the author portrayed could just as easily have been what Abbey's life could have been. This is a book of sadness, joy, disappointment and ultimately relief. I believe this is Abbey's longest book, but it reads so quickly that you'll wish it were twice as long. Read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Strap","review":"I do like this strap a lot. Its broad, sturdy, and long enough to use during yoga sessions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Duty, Great Length, but metal d-rings?","review":"My old yoga strap was just too short for some poses so I went shopping for a longer one. This one is the perfect length for me (and probably everyone else in my yoga classes). The strap is very heavy duty so it has taken a few months for the material to loosen-up and get very flexible. The only con is the metal d-rings. I understand ensuring a tight clasp when buckled but these things seem to always be clanging against each other or the floor. Not a deal-breaker but someone has to have plastic d-rings that are just as strong and functional - without the clanging!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga strap","review":"Really like this strap more than ones with the plastic clasp. The width is pretty good for a heavier type strap."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Legend","review":"This is the greatest book ever on the classic American submachine gun. Every model, prototype, variation, etc. and everything you always wanted to know about the Thompson submachine gun is here. Hundreds of photos, articles by a dozen or so leading authorities on the tommy gun and its development (too late to see service as a World War I \\"trench broom\\" as creator Gen. John T. Thompson envisioned it) colorful history in peace and war, use and misuse on both sides of the law (Tracie Hill's original title was \\"On the Side of Law and Order\\"; this was also Thompson's original motto--to market the weapon to law enforcement and also offset the gun control nuts--we even had 'em back then!) and revamped resurrection as the classic GI machine gun of World War II. It's all here: the Thompson and its technical, social, political, cops & robbers, military and even movie history. Thompson collectibles. Plus about the best ever account of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Friendship by Mildred Taylor","review":"This book by Mildred Taylor was very good.I liked it a whole bunch.It was about 4 kids and Mr.Tom Bee.He was in The Well also.In this book he calls Mr.jJohn Wallace by his first name and isn't allowed to.Mr.Tom saved him when they were little kids and John promised that he could always call him by his first name.That promise doesn't last for long though.When Tom went to John's store he called him by his first name and got mad ,so when Mr.Tom was leaving he was shot by someone but who?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for classroom reading","review":"I read several of the Logan books to my 4th graders in Mississippi. It was a good learning tool for our history class. The students really enjoyed Taylor's series. It tells of the struggles of the Logan family druing the early years. The same characters appear all through the series, you really get to know them all. Great reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the friendship","review":"I did not realy like this book. It was an example of how whites treated blacks. It was kind of short and did not realy go into details to let you know the story. It just gave you enough to know what they were talking about. It would be best for ages about 8. It does not have bad language but it is not good for younger kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Friendship","review":"I guess it was a pretty good book, but other kids will have to read it themselves. this book was about 3 boys and 1 girl, they have this friendship but at the end of the book this guy named john shot Mr. Tom Bee, and that's how I rate this book, a 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book I didn't care for.","review":"The critique is the main thing of the story. I rate the story on a scale from one through ten it would be a six. I really did not like the story at all. I thought it was boring. It was too old for me. I would compare this to Harry Potter. I hate Harry Potter and this one. It is not fun or cool at all. It is flat out not good enough! I'll tell you that all the good parts are in the beginning and the end. I think that you might like this book better me. It was pretty easy to read. The kids are out of school for spring break. Then they go fishing at the lake near Mississippi. It was kind of hard to understand. The reason the why I rate it a six is because it was not well put together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Kids","review":"My 10 year old daughter has enjoyed the entire series.I think that it teaches kids about the world around them and can help them to avoid making the mistakes of others."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Liked This Story","review":"This story is about hard times for colored people right after slavery times.It is suspenceful and makes you want to read on and on.

The writing is unadjustably too small and the penmanship style is questionable. sorry I Brought this one ~ Can't read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear Instructions!","review":"The \\"Pretty Patterns in Plastic Canvas\\" leaflet is very well done. Besides being clearly written, it is even color-coded for those of us who find written instructions challenging. Very easy to follow with beautiful results."},{"rating":"2","title":"plate weights","review":"These weights are fine weights. I laugh at those who say the paint chips or flakes off. Maybe it does and they are not the most pretty weights, but weights are made to be heavy, not pretty. These are just fine. 10 lbs is 10 lbs pretty or ugly. Ugly weights look better in my opinion anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for weights? Get these!!!!","review":"I mean come on if you really need a review for some weights then you obviously aren't serious about working out! I needed some flat plates for my dumbells and these are definately worth the cash. They fit perfectly! I picked up 4 of them and the shipping was only about $7. Stop wasting time looking for anything cheaper and order some of these today you will definately be more than satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice weights. As advertised.","review":"10 lbs each with the right sized hole. Oh yea, the holes are in the center of the plate. Perfect!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright Days, Dark Nights with Charles Spurgeon","review":"Charles Spurgeon is one of the greatest thinkers and scholars the world has been blessed to enjoy. Hard to believe he suffered with depression all his life and died too young maybe from the stress of conflict and depression even then. He so wonderfully shared his experiences and that is so valuable to me because so many people don't even understand depression and are not even able to talk about it. The author here is very thorough in writing about Spurgeon and his comments and this is a book which is a definite keeper. I am grateful to her for her research and sharing about this blessed man. Aloha."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, must read book, especially for pastors","review":"This book can really help anyone who struggles with depression. I never knew Spurgeon was so wise, but you better believe I'll be reading more of him. Last saturday I got so fired up about this book that I bought every used or new copy on Amazon that netted out under 10$ (I'm on a budget, afterall) to give away to friends.This book will help you if you struggle personally with depression, and it will help you if you care for people who do."},{"rating":"2","title":"An emotional Roller Coaster ride!","review":"Great film! I never read the web comic, but I've heard of it.The animation style unique and very comic like. The story is quite depressing, but it also has very funny moments. I highly recommend this to web comic fans. I give this a four rather the five star rating because it was sorta left open-ended, but I'm pretty sure it continues on in the web comic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cartoon depiction of real life drama","review":"I had not seen a real good animated movie in a long time. This fit the bill even in its black an white form. This story of a Muslim woman living through a revolution and culture shock would be of great interest to a progressive open minded woman. It has many laughs as well. A perfect movie for the times. I don't think religious traditionalists would approve but a piece of work worth the scrutiny and dollar."},{"rating":"2","title":"99.8% Awe inspiring","review":"Okay, I just got this movie for Christmas and I just finished watching it. I watched this movie before, but it has practically constructed me into a Marjane Satrapi fan(Don't take that literally).So, the movie is about a girl who matures from a 9 year old to an adult, living through the Islamic Revolution and a number of wars in Tehran, soon moving to Vienna and France.I understand the movie is supposed to be mostly serious, but it periodically had it's comedy, such as people having fangs when angry.So, to conclude this review, it was a great movie to watch and whoever reads this review I recommend the movie to."},{"rating":"2","title":"....and life's struggle continues","review":"The genius of this movie is that it's animated; there is no way to capture all the feelings and emotions with real actors.This is the story of every society when one dictator falls to be replaced by worse dictators. It is the story of young souls watching their dreams of freedom and justice fall apart. It is the story of being stranger in your home land and everywhere else, and it is the story of how religion is used to manipulate and control people.Watch the story of little Marjane, her little bread swans, her story with God and life and don't fight your tears. The realism of the story, the sadness of Marjane, the portrayal of societies' helplessness and political/religious manipulations make this movie a real treasure. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Realistic","review":"My husband grew up in Iran in the same time period as the author and producer of this great film. While we watched the film he commented several times about how authentic and accurate the story was.The story reflects a personal tale and speaks to the universal human experience of growing up.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Work of Art","review":"In an age of much censorship by the ruling Islamic Republic and danger of persecution, Marjane has done a fantastic job of relaying her message in a great language of art of animation.Michael Navabi"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just.... Bad","review":"I tried to watch this movie at the recommendation of a friend, who never steers me wrong. I'm sorry, but this movie is just crap. The socio-political events of the time are really just a backdrop against which a whiny feminist tells her tales of rejected love and the challenges of adult relationships. If you are looking for a story that focuses on the tumultuous events the author lived through, this isn't it. This movie is almost entirely focused on her love life. The movie always makes it very evident that while the author wants to be seen as a rebel, She is really just craving attention and acceptance. Please don't waste your time on this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"cultural consciousness meets historical fate","review":"Persian culture boasts a glorious history that stretches back three thousand years, but the last thirty years have not been kind. This award-winning animated film is partly a historical review of the political revolution that overthrew the secular-minded Shah in 1978-1979, the eight-year war with neighboring Iraq that followed about a year later and slaughtered a million people (1980-1988), and the religious extremism that filled the power vacuum along the way. In particular, the film follows the plight of a precocious and independent-minded little girl named Marjane and her extended family, and how all this upheaval impacted them. At this level Persepolis is a powerful story about personal identity, cultural consciousness, difficult choices, and historical fate. The film was written and directed by Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud, and based on the two best-selling graphic novels by Satrapi. In French with English subtitles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must buy","review":"If you don't like subtitles than the English Dubbing is not bad. Brilliant imagery, great story, the only fallback is the film's ending. Buy it or trade for it, once you get it, you won't want to let it go. Funny, touching, beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERSEPOLIS: Where has the glory gone?","review":"PERSEPOLIS is an Iranian animated feature available from Amazon. This is a poignant animation which captures all the pathos and disruption which the Iranian revolution brought about for many people as observed by a child who tries to come to terms with the disillusioning effects she sees taking place in the lives of those around her. As she grows up and has to deal with loss and the disaffection resulting from the stultifying effect of living in a police state where everyone is under constant surveillance, she perseveres to find meaning in her existence and comfort from her culture. The choice of \\"Persepolis\\", as its title, suggests that the glorious period of the Archaemenid Empire (550-330 BCE) can still be an inspiration to Iranians today. The remarkable cultural achievements of that empire and its cultivation of the first internationalism may well challenge the mediocrity and bland face of Persia today.Persepolis"},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder show was canceled","review":"I have been a fan of Jeff Dunham for a long time and usually caught his shows on television. I decided to order a couple of his DVD's of shows I had not seen. The Jeff Dunham Show DVD is very disappointing to say the least. For Dunham's characters to interact with actual people in the shows was a mistake. Dunham and his puppets are great when he is on stage with them. After watching The Jeff Dunham Show DVD I can see why the show was canceled."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a huge fan of Jeff Dunham","review":"That being said, this show sucked. It was beyond belief how bad it actually was. I remember watching the first 3 episodes when they aired and I was stunned that a talented person like Dunham would come up with crap like this.

Just stick to comedy and leave all of that stuff out of it & it would be much better.

My children's ultimate insult is 'You just don't get it' and this is exactly the problem I have with Jeff Dunham's humor - I don't get it. I don't find it funny, just universally insulting. If there's a race or ethnic group he fails to degrade and not in a funny way.Best of luck - there's an audience for everything but it won't include me."},{"rating":"1","title":"??? Do you really want to buy this????","review":"As I say in my title do you really want to buy this? I really love the heck out of Jeff Dunham but unfortunately his new TV show just doesn't have it and actually the second season has been canceled, but in by another review from CNN I heard that Comedy Central is going to keep Jeff Dunham because they have multilevel agreements with him but the TV show is gone. There are a few funny moments in the seven episodes of his first season but I purchased it because I don't watch TV I watch DVDs. But in less you are a dedicated fan of his work I would not buy this DVD, I would purchase his former DVDs which are hilarious and will keep laughing over and over again when you watch them. Even though this was only $10 at Amazon I am going to keep it because I am an avid fan of Jeff Dunham. I hope my review helped you in any way.

But this \\"Jeff Dunham Show\\" really is a shocker. I had high hopes of being entertained but was left wondering \\"what happened?\\" Granted there are a few funny skits, but a lot of Jeff's material has gotten crude and inappropriate: lots of racism, sexism, and stereotyping to the point where he crosses the line at times. I'm disappointed in Jeff for resulting to this type of humor. Achmed enlisting in the US Army: funny. Brooke Hogan going on a date with Peanut and he has an allergic reaction to the food: snore (plus there is OBVIOUS promotion for her CD.)

When we went to his concert last year, we were so disappointed with not only this but the amazing array of fat jokes which embarrassed and clearly humiliated the obese lady next sitting next to me as she not only did not laugh but was visibly hurt when she lay her head on the shoulder of her husband. Sitting in the middle of the seat row, she could not leave in the dark auditorium but did so at intermissions.Jeff Dunham seems like a super nice and super talented man.

If you are a fan of skiing and sex its like ur greatest fantasy. Shannon Tweed is totally hot in this flick doin what she does best(if you've seen some of her other stuff you know what I'm talkin about)And the action is also pretty tight. There are two reasons I gave it a 4. 1 is because I think it should have had one or two more party scenes is it, and a few less skiiing scenes. The other reason is the sport of choice. I love winter sports, boarding, mobiling,..... but not so hot about skiing. Sorry guys but a real athlete works without poles.

It's a great cd for a casual fan to pick up. Big time Harris fans will want to pick it up for the excellent new track \\"The Connection\\" which is simply stunning. It's nice to have a collection like this, where nearly every album is represented.

Great quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first collection to cover nearly every album","review":"This is a great collection, although there are many \\"hits\\" or other type of collections out there for Emmylou, this is the first one that pulls at least one track from just about every one of her solo albums starting with her duet with Gram Parsons up thru her most recent album from 2003. She is also the one who picked the songs for this set. You do get the hits, but you also get songs that Emmylou says are just ones she likes. If you're new to the music of Emmylou Harris this album is a great place to start. You will probably find that you'll want to get all of her other albums as well. As great as these songs and this album is this is only the tip of the iceberg. Nonetheless, this is a great collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Very Best of Emmylou Harris: Heartaches and Highways","review":"For anyone who loves and appreciates Emmylou, this is the greatest for sure!If you are a fan of Allison Krause, try Emmy out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What's not to like?

She hasn't changed much, but she started off nearly perfect, even at the age of 15. I keep hoping to hear a recording of \\"The Pineywood Hills\\", which did to near perfection back then. As for the music on this album, what a prime selection. It may be classified by some know-it-alls as \\"country\\", but it pretty well leaps beyond the limitations of even contemporary country, whatever that might be. It sure isn't Bluegrass, and there aren't a lot of trucking tunes to worry about. A very nice easy-listening album, if you can get over the fact that sometimes you might hear a Hiwaiian steel guitar moaning in the background. Although I have the original LPs upon which most of these songs were released, I won't hesitate to acquire this one as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Voice, all the Best","review":"A collection of Emmy-Lou's most haunting melodies combined with some of her most successful collaborations.

It is suppose to appear too large for the tire and you should have to force it in . I have put these in before so I know how to do it.

Another reviewer (below) indicates \\"Bashmet is no Primrose,\\" and I was surprised to read that, because I have the Primrose recording of the Walton, and I think Bashmet's is much better. I am a violist, and the Primrose recording of the Walton Concerto is my least favorite; his sound is harsh and ugly to me, and-- in my opinion-- not at all congenial to the flowing, sumptuous style of the piece. All of that aside, I think the best recording of the Walton Viola Concerto is Lars Anders Tomter's, on the budget label Naxos."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's nothing like the REAL THING! :o(","review":"I LOVE Bruch's viola works. And I was curious as to how the double concert would sound with a violin (and I play both violin and viola), and it should NOT be this way. The tempo is too fast, and I feel like it's glitzy. If you love the Double Concerto like I do, I recommend you listen to:Max Bruch: Works For Clarinet And Viola [IMPORT]Max Bruch (Composer), Kent Nagano (Conductor), Lyon Opera Orchestra (Orchestra), Gerard Causse (Performer), Paul Meyer (Performer), Francois-Rene Duchable (Performer).The viola and clarinet are perfect matches, the VIOLIN and viola are great with MOZART. Not Bruch. Such a shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Say it Ain't So!!","review":"Let me say, the Bruch Double Concerto was written for viola and CLARINET, not violin.

I guess i should perhaps have known better as $5.99 for 12 discs does look too good to be true in hindsight. Besides there was no descrptive text with the item. Low and behold when it arrived it was indeed only one disc. So we are returning it hoping that amazon will agree that that it should have been described a little better.

I put my Yamaha P80 keyboard in it. The first time I picked it up, the case ripped where the shoulder strap attaches. Although the shoulder straps are reinforced, the fabric making up the outside of the case ripped because the sideways pressure where the shoulder strap attaches was too much.The Yamaha P80 weighs about 37 pounds, which is not particularly heavy for a good keyboard. Do not buy this case unless your keyboard is a featherweight. For less than twice the money, you can get a much better case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very easily came undone with shoulder straps!","review":"I used the bag about 4 times to carry my rather light Yamaha P-95 keyboard to band practice (only 26 pounds).

I'm assuming it's the drive mechanism or the motor since it no longer makes a spin up sound or vibration.Other than that this was an okay CD player. The volume was a little lower than other CD players I've had, making it hard to hear on the noisier parts of my daily train ride. I also thought the MP3 display / controls were a little difficult to use, but I've been spoiled by my computer's MP3 player I suppose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your $, unless you are really poor","review":"The only good thing about this cd player is that it is really cheap. But otherwise, it is not BAD in particular, it is just not good. It takes a long time to read the cds, it uses up batteries quickly, there is a quiet hissing in the background when it plays, it won't hold your spot in a cd if you stop it, etc. Also, I have a tape adapter for my car stereo, and my old Sony player worked great with it; however, this thing sounds really weird in the car. Basically, this is a cheap cd player that gets the basic job done, but your money will definitely be more well-spent on a Sony or another leading brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy a Memorex","review":"This product was great when i first got it. It barey ever skipped and the search function was excellent. I am only rating it 2 stars becasue after a few months the thing just started going through battery's.

The MP3 sound quality is very good, but the standard CD sound lacks. There is some audible clipping.

The reviews on the purple version were actually pretty good that is why I decided to buy it! I am very disappointed in this product. The first one I had simply stopped working after a few weeks. Amazon was great and replaced it for me. Now a few months later, the replacement is not working properly. The anti-skip protection is very poor...it simply stops playing at the slightest bump and either jumps to another song, stops completely or resumes where it left off a few seconds later. It eats batteries very quickly and now, again, stops playing for no apparent reason. I don't think it's going to last much longer...what a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have known better","review":"After learning many opinions on this player, several of which were negative, I decided that I would go ahead and give this product a chance anyway.

Generally speaking, I like Memorex products. However, this one could be used only as little more than an overpriced jewel case. Even my off-brand cheap one is more reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly designed, not worth your money","review":"As noted in other reviews, this product has *very* limited battery life. It didn't come with an AC power source. It also has no hold button, which means I have to take out the batteries when I'm not listening. also, it often can't pause, fast forward or reverse on cd's I've burned myself. Its lid closes so poorly it only plays cd's if I can hold it flat or press the lid down -- definitely not for working out. Overall, a purchase I regret making."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!

They didn't even give a whole lot of clues either. I liked it and thought that it was okay. It just wans't very scary. Half the book is explaining a lot of science fiction about the future.

My first graders have giggled their way through all of the the \\"Black Lagoon\\" series. The premise is that the boy has a very vivid imagination, and finds out in the end that his fears were for not. This is NOT a critique of school lunch, rather the opposite. The little boy fears school lunch will be awful...and finds out it's so good he wants to go back and have seconds! This series, however fun, is not for the humor-challenged among us. It's all just for fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool for kids","review":"Wanda Belch is the new cafeteria lady at school. Rumor has it that kids found shoes in her food at her old job and that she now drives a garbage truck. But the kids at her new job soon find out that lunch and their new cafeteria lady aren't as scary as they thought.This is a great book that not only teaches kids how untrue rumors can be and how silly some fears can be, but also that appearances are deceiving. It does NOT, as a previous person mentioned, deride or make a mockery of the food service industry. It actually shows kids that their cafeteria workers are not evil, but honest and hard-working people.

No wonder these actors never worked again.I saw another reviewer compliment the musical scores in this movie which I thought was a joke since this movie force fed us with every awfull 80's rock ballad and new wave trash. This movie also makes me feel thankfull that the 80's are over since im spared of seeing the badly mismatched color clothing, the awfull hair spray hair styles, and the uncoordinated pogo stick dancing (damn thats awfull).

I've watched this movie at best a hundred times! And it makes me feel good every time I watch it.

I struggled through the third book but had hopes the fourth book would be more about the triumph of good based on it's title \\"The Return of the Guardian-King\\".

Not to read about (SPOILER COMING) rape and the murder of an infant. If I wanted to read about that, I would read the newspaper. I was shocked to find this in a Christian novel.

Now add in two guys and 4 hrs of labor apiece. That's 8 man hours, at say, $30 an hour (less than what I would make working on the weekend, but hey), that's $240.

It gets the job done and cooks well. I like the fact that it's easy to move with the wheels. The propane tank fits neatly under so it's easy to reach but hidden from view. The burners do have a tendency to rust out after a few years and you will usually find you need to replace the ignition switch as well every few years. While it's not the best grill out there, it's a good grill for the money. I would suggest buying a cover for the grill and using it as much as possible. It will help keep the grill out of the elements and should improve longevity. My next grill will be a bigger and better unit, but I have been happy with this grill and I've gotten my money's worth.

The only drawback is that the instructions are not real clear where some things are concerned... for instance it is not clear that bolts and nuts used to attach one piece are then needed to be loosened and removed so that later in the process an additional item or bracket can be attached at the same place. Basically don't tighten anything real tight until you are sure nothing else needs to be added also.The aluminum heat shield is a joke. I know why it is included but it is worthless. A cover for the side burner would be a nice addition.I like the \\"condiment\\" holder on the front and the area that holds the tank is a good and easy thing. It heats up fast and gives me an even heat. I like the product now that it is together and use it almost daily.

P>I was happy for the first song, but there are 2 other songs which are close copies of it. Yes, the other tracks are techno/mood music, but mostly really quiet, calm stuff.This CD is missing what is in my mind the most important, most energtic, and most upbeat tune from the movie: the song playing at the end as the camera panned up the city and throughout the credits! Yes, it's neat having some tiny pics from the movie and production in the booklet, but I have to brush up on my Japanese to understand anything in there.I guess I have to go back to looping through the last track on my DVD and hopefully I can rip that music from it in the near future!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound track","review":"This is a tantalizing collection that accompanies one of the most interesting movies I have ever seen. Kawai's hypnotic tempo is the perfect accompaniment for Ghost in The Shell.

It is, in my opinion, the best anime soundtrack I've ever heard. It combines the haunting rhythms of folk drums with computer synth sounds and choral chants to produce a truly haunting sound. The first time I saw the film, I was captivated by the musical interlude (which I later learned was \\"Floating Museum\\").But it is definitely pricey considering the length, and some of the tracks don't stand well on their own. To me, it is worth owning the soundtrack because it helps to evoke the mood of the film, a mood that I find conducive to work. If you haven't seen the film, I recommend you first watch the film and then decide if the music moves you. To me, the soundtrack and the film go hand in hand. Kenji Kawai and Mamoru Oshii are perfectly in synch in this collaboration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very melodic","review":"Mostly sparse, textural, and repetitive in the sense that some of the tracks sound like the same track in varying states of completion. It's just BARELY ambient, actually, creating unmarked atmosphere - not really contributing to any particular kind of feeling.For me, the three most outstanding tracks were:1. M01 I - Making of Cyborg (the creepy, minimalist Japanese chant that opens the movie- still melodic)4. M04 Virtual Crime (My favorite - I even heard Garth Trinidad spin it on Chocolate City one night [KCRW L.A.])11. See You Everyday (A hypermelodic, upbeat Chinese pop song sung in Chinese by Fang Ka Wing)I would not recommend paying full price for this. Consider that I bought it at a Japanese bookstore downtown in 1998 for f1ft5en b*cks. Having ripped Virtual Crime to mp3 and buried this CD long ago, I only looked it up again for See You Everyday because to this day, the melody has stayed with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD - God's Little Acre","review":"I received my order quickly and in excellent condition.

Note, though, if you're on the fence about picking up Geneon's bare-bones 2005 release, that Amazon's reporting of a 1.33:1 framing is inaccurate; the print appears to be the same in terms of picture quality (from the UCLA Film and Television Archive), running time (118 mins.) and aspect ratio (1.85:1) as Image's 2001 version (also currently out of print but much pricier). 4 stars each for content and presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"I ordered this stool and the first day I got it, the stool broke.

Although I typically read few romance novels, I found Rosa and the Prince to be a pleasant experience and a worthy escape. The setting, Austria in the 1880's, is intriguing, and the characters truly come to life from the beginning. The book reads quickly and easily without being shallow, and the language at times is very sensual. The plot, though slightly predictable, is well developed.

I do advise getting some more heavy duty stakes than the ones included and staking out the fly is a good idea if you foresee any storms. This is perfect for two people and was easy to set up. I also advise a practice run before you head out as this lessens the inevitable debates that occur between couples during tent construction. I look forward to many more uses.

I wasn't expecting great sound from a small [money]radio, but this was much worse than I though it would be. Even with the bass boost engaged there is no bass to speak of. Music played through it sounds unnatural. I put in a favorite R&B; album and couldn't even make out a bass line on any of the songs. The drums sounded weak and tappy, too.I don't usually return things I buy unless they are way below expectation, but this device warrants it.

The pans are great, they stack so nicely. We often just take the large pan, the small, the lid and the frying pan. The problem is the handle. As one reviewer noted, to put it on you have to turn it at a 90 degree angle to the pot. You also have to pull back on a spring latch. We don't have to deal with a campfire as we use a gas cooking stove but just maneuvering is a problem. Overlooking that (which is not easy), when the handle is attached, if you try to pur something out of the pot, it swings in the direction of the handle so you have to be incredibly careful of someone had a lap full of hot food. The swing is only about 30 degrees but it an issue every time you need to pour out of a pan with the handle. I have searched for a different style handle and used my primus one but it is too small. I don't want to have to replace these but I also am tired to fussing with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORKS GREAT","review":"Only used on one camping trip but these pots worked great.

For that purpose, they are great. I, like other reviewers, wish that they came with one more handle. There was another set that did come with 2 handles, but it was quite a bit more expensive. This is just for camping, so I can deal with that. The handle is....interesting. I don't have a problem putting in on or taking it off, nor did I have a problem with it coming off while I was using it. That being said, you won't be able to put it on or take it off if your pan is hot. It is definitely a two handed job. Things do stick to these pans more than my good pan's at home, but I did pay less for these, so there it is.

The cracked and chipped handle and the chipped knob on the disgustingly lightweight lid left a lot to be desired, however.

However, some of the dialogue is unrealistic (say, when Keira Knightley says to her former lover after two minutes, \\"Tell me something that counts\\"), and the film as a whole doesn't have enough substance to fill 95 minutes. I'd think of it as a short story trying to masquerade as a novel. The overall effect is something akin to a tease: Will they be unfaithful, or won't they? The question is fine, but by the end, you don't care that much because the film hasn't revealed any fine nuances beyond what you get in the first 10-15 minutes.

The driver allows adjustment of nearly every facet of the medium being scanned. Photoshop Elements (...) is bundled with the scanner's software, but if you are planning on doing any advanced photo editing, I would suggest purchasing the full version of Photoshop. However, for simple projects and web use, what it comes with is sufficient (you cannot save photos in CMYK with Elements).Software included: Epson TWAIN driver, Epson Smart Panel, ArcSoft PhotoImpression, Epson Software Film Factory Lite (I only installed the driver- the rest can be considered fluff if you don't want to create photo albums or something), plus a separate CD with Photoshop Elements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I'm a graphic designer, and I did a lot of research, including \\"professional\\" sources such as photography mags & websites, before choosing the Epson 1650. I've found this scanner disappointing -- it consistently clips the shadows and highlights so that very dark areas scan to muddy gray while the brightest areas come out about 25% darker. Tweaking the Twain settings to expand the range pulls more black into the shadows but still misses the c,m & y and vice versa on highlights. So on color scans, there is a lack of richness at both ends. I also use the scanner for OCR, and the bundled OCR software is horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good scanner, but may be TOO GOOD!","review":"This is a very good scanner, with some bad support. First off, the software that comes with it does not work with Windows XP. The support for the software is from some third party company, not Epson, and they seemed to be mentally challenged! The actual driver for the scanner, which is from Epson, works fine. So, I had to use one of my picture viewing programs to get the scanner to work. Once I did, and you may find this hard to believe, I found the scanner scans TOO GOOD! It picks up DUST! That being said, the quality of the scans are incredible! I am sure if you do have Windows XP, you will rate this scanner 5 Stars. If you have Windows XP, be prepared for a headache.

Lo and behold, I found this costume on Amazon and ordered it and it was a big hit. The only problem was the flower material was just made of felt and wasn't reinforced with anything so it was flopping all over her face while we were outside and the wind was blowing. The wind was blowing pretty hard that night though, so under normal usage or indoor usage it may not be a problem. If I had ordered it and received it sooner, I would have just take some wire and reinforced the petals to help them stand up, but I ordered it too late and just got it right before Halloween so I didn't have time to mess with it.

Fox. Agreeing to be cast as a cokehead at a time that he was one of the biggest comedic stars in Hollywood takes balls. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't fire on all cylinders. It could be that movie-making has matured in the past two decades. For a movie called \\"Bright Lights,\\" the movie's cinematography is oddly muted. The pace is also dated, but...\\"Bright Lights Big City\\" is painfully s-l-o-w.Fox snorts coke for an hour and a half, talks about writing a novel, and pines for his estranged wife.

The rest of the album is filled with a variety of styles, most of them a bit different from the big heavy rock sound we are used to from Sammy. Some of the tracks are downright moody sounding with (for Sammy) understated vocals. With songs such as the pretty ballad \\"Who Has The Right?\\" and the rocking anthem \\"The Yogi's So High (I'm Stoned)\\", Sammy proved he still had the touch. For sure, his two solo efforts after this one brought him more back into a rocking mode. Still, this one is good to listen to now and then to hear something different.

I purchased Ms. Orth's book from the remainder table at a flea market book stall. Usually, I give more attention to the content promised in my book purchases, but I was taken by the author's name and title. Too late I realized that this was a re-hash of previously published articles, and provided little insight into the phenomena of fame, itself.I felt that The Importance of Being Famous was somehow gossipy and boring at the same time, telling me what had been said many times before. Of course, it is my fault that the book was not what I had hoped for, but it is the author's fault that it was dry as the bones she picked over.I would not recommend this book to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"What I expected was an inside look at the making and maintenance of fame.

Then the hit piece on Margaret Thatcher makes sense, though Margaret Trudeau would have been a better choice. Or Bill Clinton. But Carlos Menem? Putin? If there was anything new or insightful, the swipes at Fox News reporters and Reagan might have gotten a pass.

This is a rather contrived story that puts a Yalie in an Illinois regiment in a sort of weird coming of age narrative ... and then tries, I think in vain, to set it in a \\"realistic\\" context. The result is rather contrived, rife with modern assumptions about human behavior that would not be apparent to nineteenth-century inhabitants, and an astute critic would hihghlight some of the problematic claims inherent in the treatment of the historical context. I have checked to see that there was a 7th Illinois Cavalry that was part of this campaign, but other claims don't stack up. Deprived of historical realism, the slimmed-down narrative is devoid of redeeming merit as fiction.I will note that at least one review I saw up here has been removed. It was a critical review.

Patton would do things like pee into Gen Allen's slit trench in front of Allen's men, effectively calling him a coward in not so many words.

It's difficult for me to pick any favorites from the album as it is so solid that I highly recommend listening to the whole thing several times through. \\"Bedroom Eyes\\" stands out for it's gorgeous lyric. \\"Cannon Fodder\\", the oddity on the album, is a catchy pop/rock tune about the stupidity of violence. \\"Tom Skookum Road\\" is a solid instrumental. \\"Tiger Tattoos\\" is a nearly perfect in lyric and music. \\"Devil's Hootenanny\\" is one incredible folk song performed here with gusto!

It bothers me when people complain about the Wii's graphics, go play PS3 or XBOX 360 stare at the graphics and play sitting on your rear end. The Wii is meant to be enjoyed for the different elements it brings to the table and that is exactly what this game does.

When I want to swing a golf club, IO do it in the real world wit a golf club. When I play video games, I prefer to use my thumbs sitting on the couch.

The result is Strauss et al in an interpretive strait jacket that didn't connect to me when watching the concert b'cast the day of and which seems even more misguided on further hearings.I say the above as one who enjoys Harnoncourt in other rep, like the Beethoven Symphonies, for example.Harnoncourt was the VPO's invited conductor again for the concert of 1/1/2003...and hasn't been back since.Perhaps that now-10-year hiatus tells us something about how the orchestra felt about his two appearances."},{"rating":"1","title":"HK goes downmarket","review":"It does strange things sometimes, and the latest dissappointment comes when I am playing a DVD, and pressing PAUSE or REWIND causes the amp to reset it's audio mode to 5 CHANNEL STEREO instead of Dolby Digital for no apparent reason. There are many quirky problems like this for me and my HK. It's a shame I'm stuck with it till I can get a new one, which will bear a name rhyming with PONY. I think HK used to be a staunch competitor, but now it seems they just don't put any thought into how users will interact with thier products. This amp is downright confusing, not user friendly, and DEFIANT to my commands. I'm familiar with tech toys, and this is my white whale, elusive.

I have never used a camcorder before, and this took me just a few minutes to learn. I have had no problems with it to date. The sound quality is wonderful when you play it back on the TV.

It's great to have it 2nd-hand... It is easy to use, stable, small enough to carry with convenience. I have focussed on the mid-noon sun with maximum exposure and everything turned dark after that but after a few hours of rest, it could work properly like before. One thing I don't like is that you need a tripod when in closest zoom-in because you can never have steady hands to keep the picture not shaking. It does not have an LCD so you have to keep your eye on the color viewfinder. However, it's worth what it is. With [the money spent], I can't expect to get any greater camera. So it's a good job for less and I am happy with it.

Just make sure you know what your buying. Anyway, I bought these speakers as a temporary setup until I can afford some heavy-duty Cerwin Vegas. Overall, the audio output is great and the surround sound is excellent, but the subwoofer is just about dead. I thought it might of had to do with the CD format not being enhanced enough until I stumbled upon other people complaining about the same problem. When it comes to the bass, the speakers on my little RCA five-disc stereo blow these out of the water.

The graphics are unbeliveable and i havent even found 1 glitch. I personaly do not like first person shooters well guess what? You switch from third to first person and vice versa. Though the dialouge in this game is just ok. The accents are amazing. The only reason i rated this game 4.5 is because for some people like me it is very freaky and odd but for most people this game is a 5! The enemies are really funny. They may look tough but when you hide in bushes and see what their saying you wont think their as tough. When the enemies cant see you their usually complaining about their jobs,cursing or warning about the bounty hunter(you)that may come.

I had all the beta Moxes and collected the sets. I stopped playing after Ice Age when they started reprinted the \\"good\\" cards. I've monitored MTGs evolution since but have not played.Although there is nothing like sitting across from a cocky Magic player who thinks his deck is the ultimate thing, and devouring his life before his very eyes, MTG:Battlegrounds is a great way to visit days passed now that I have a family and no time to visit the tourneys. It has great spells and I look forward to its expansion sets in the electronic area.If you like MTG, Battlegrounds is for you, especially if you've moved on in life and don't have the time or money to play the actual card game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock/Scissors/Paper on Speed","review":"If you're looking for something MTG flavored, you should quite frankly look somewhere else. This is a poorly-executed attempt at changing a deep strategy game into a fast-paced game of counters and tactics. It fails. Miserably so.Tactics in this game roughly amount to whether you send your MTG-equivalent of rock, scissors or paper against your opponent's selection. There's no more depth to it than that. To make things even more frustrating, the game requires you mash buttons as quickly and almost indiscriminately as possible in order to match up with the computer's spellcaster. Thus your choice of rock or scissors is largely decided by luck rather than any true strategy. And once you figure out what an opposing spellcaster's bag of tricks contains, there's nothing more to beating him than always countering his attack and attacking his weakness- for every opponent you face is a one trick pony.Nothing to see here folks, move along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"This game is for role playing enthustists. Real time warfare is great in this game. You really have to think ahead of your next move. One draw back is when playing arcade mode, all opponents use the same exact stratagy which after a while you can figure out.

You'll waste hours fighting the same battle over and over again, trying to beat it with the badly designed deck they force you to play, only to finally win and then clear the next 10 battles in fifteen minutes.

Non Hi-Def still looks OK. the other one is slightly out of convergence on outer portions of the picture. I expected more reliability out of Samsung. the Auto-Focus feature does not appear to have any positive impact on the issues. Apparently, there is a way to get the TV into service mode using the remote control. Supposedly, in service mode a manual convergence is possible, but I read where other users have problems in this area as well. It seems as if Samsung either poorly designed critical components or simply opted for lower cost/quality parts in their manufacturing.

There are some interesting concepts, but unfortunately these are too widely dispersed amidst the off-putting Christianity-slanted musings of the authors. It took too long to get to the nut and bolts of the book, and by then the authors had lost much of their credibility for me. I don't want to bag it too much, as I'm sure the authors have nothing but helpful intention. And hey, my opinion is just that - only mine.

I always thought that my Mother hated me and was intentionally tearing me apart (She didn't think I was much of a treat either). Now I realize that it all boils down to personality and how we look at the world. Differences in the way we perceive the world around us and the different types of things that drive our emotions and goals in life. Each example set off light bulbs, now I finally have the direction I've needed to try to get our relationship to be less volatile.

The only thing that's worth reading in it are the historic section and the maps. The rest is far too badly descriptional, without any kind of recommendation. The accomodation index describes the hotels in less than two lines, if so. The cities are described in cold tones, without any good reason if you should even go to them. As for an example, take Andorra, that is included in this guide, and despite it's quite close do Barcelona - about 2 and a half hours by bus - It really destroyed my mood to going there. When we travel, mainly those who work and to do that put a lot of effort and investing, want concise and critical description of the places they want to go, so we cant take good advantage of our lack of time. This is not valued in this book. After reading it, you feel you could do better sitting in your room, watching TV, and even then you would be more excited. That's a crime for a travel planner!

And it says that Obi-wan was gay and that George Lucas actually stole the idea for Star Wars from extraterrestrial radio waves.

Her voice reminds me of Sheryl Crow (secular). The lyrics are fresh and real and the music is contemporary. Kelly really has a way of connecting with people as a writer, singer, and song-writer.

(Who, as it turns out hadn't actually read \\"A Breast Cancer Journal.\\") I read it with hope, hoping to find a kindred spirit. What I found was a self-indulgent, egocentric account that paints the author as virtually the only woman who has had to struggle with this terrible disease. That Wittman is a technically clever and adroit writer, there can be no doubt. Like a good Hallmark card, she knows what buttons to push. But reading between the lines one finds a woman engaged not so much with how her disease might leave those she could possibly leave behind, or those committed to helping her or who love her, but a woman for whom the disease has provided an outlet for what I am sure is a considerable ego. There were moments in reading it that I almost felt sicker than during some of the worst moments of my illness. Read at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"a tough read","review":"This pretentious, ponderous expose on her struggle with breast cancer is nothing more than a self absorbed, shamelessly unprovocative attempt at exploiting the disease to feed her obviously large ego.

Petsmart took it back, and I decided to give it another shot, as I have tried several boxes, and desite its flaws, I still thought this one was pretty good. The second one has also lasted a few months, but now the arm/scoop falls off because its locking mechanism doesn't work. I am ready to try something different....

With two cats, for the first four months, it was at least tolerable, and less likely to jam than the Littermaid boxes. However, the waste receptacle is ludicrously small, and fills up in just a couple of days; and the expensive plastic bags are not a good system for dealing with the waste, unless you like sending lots and lots of them to the landfill.Then abruptly the mechanism which rotates the rake while sweeping toward the litter receptacle failed, rendering the unit inoperative. I understand that this problem is very common in this unit and its lower-priced version, the Litter Round-Up. Many users report failure in two mmonths or less, so I guess I did a bit better than they; but too bad. I may have to send the whole unit to the landfill and start over, and I think I am entitled to better reliability than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the money","review":"got the cover after a mixup with the order. worth the wait. heavy duty and should last a long time. comes with adjustable straps. material is thick and insulated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desperate third set","review":"Burning Brides is one of those garage sounding type of bands.

Hang Love seems a bit like they took some of the more popular songs off the last CD and copied all their songs to sound like them. It's not a bad CD at all, but to me, most of the songs sound alike.

Or, there are several scenes with the actors just standing around,NOT saying anything at all! Even an A/V student in high school knows to move the camera for different views. And one of the biggest problems of the script is that ghosts do not exist! Period. This will be a bit of a spoiler but there aren't any ghosts or scares in this film.

It had potential - as most ghost stories do - but it wasn't scary at all and the storyline was only so-so.*SPOILER* The gas leak explanation for everyone's halucinations undermined the whole premise of a ghost story and left the viewer confused. The bracelet and pendant got us back on track but by then it was too late. I already felt cheated because the movie was pretty much over. I guess that was intended to leave us questioning whether it really was all about the gas leak. For me, it seemed like a clumsy way of tying up an already weak storyline.It's a good movie for small budget, I guess, as long as your expectations are realistic.

Even to those who have never heard of the world of Might&Magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"READS TOO MUCH LIKE A GAME!","review":"I usually love Mel Odom's novels but this one - though promising - was just set too much like a game more than a well written novel. There were quite a few interesting characters but the plot was just not there and the background feel was like a game. Now I know its based on a game - but does it have to read like one! Mel Odom writes at his best in the OUTLANDERS novels he writes on occasion, that seems to be his medium and genre and when he is at his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent service","review":"My son was searching for this obscure book, which I located through Amazon.

I bought his solo albums for the sake of completing my collection rather then enjoyment. I do like one song 'waiting' very much and 'Still feel your love' is prety good, but everything else is not my cup of tea. It should please the JY styx fans though."},{"rating":"2","title":"J.Y.'s only ballad Still Feel Your Love belongs on any Styx cd","review":"This is actually probably J.Y.'s most consistent solo album and it's actually pretty good. Of course, one has to take into account the era in which it was made. This was the 80's and guitar hard rock and metal were the norm. While J.Y.s two heavy songs on his Raised By Wolves cd are probably his best heavy songs (and compare really well with his Styx material), songs on the City Slicker album like Wild Dogs in the Night and Still Feel Your Love are standouts among other good songs. In fact, his only sung ballad in his history with or without Styx, \\"Still Feel Your Love\\" fits really well on any Styx iPod collection and is a great song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty awful","review":"I'm a Styx fan, and I enjoyed Jan Hammer's work with Neil Schon too; so I had high hopes for this one.

I keep them both at hand, and when my passion flags, I pick one of them up and read it, and they refuel my flame.This is really a collection of essays, mostly from introductions to other books. However, don't let that detract from their message. To write you must, simply, write. Write until it hurts, and don't stop just because you feel insecure.Bradbury's style won't work for everyone. He uses free-association to begin his stories. He simply types a word and goes from there. Not all of us can do that, but his passion and love for his work comes through the pages. He also encourages writers to find their own voice through practice, and to write until grammar and story structure become unconscious.This is a relatively quick read and one that will remain with you long after you finish it.\\"Now, go, and do likewise.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappier than syrup","review":"What else can I say? This book was nearly unbearable. Seriously. From beginning to end, the author spends page after page so immersed in poetic metaphors to show how gifted he is (sorry, that's the impression I got) and how glorious his life as a writer has been that there's hardly any space left for the useful information I was hoping to find in this book. I felt him pushing, forcing his readers to be inspired rather than inspiring his readers. Yes, I was inspired at first, for a moment, but that soon faded. The constant bragging about his ASTONISHING talent and dedication (though I think that what he sees as dedication, such as writing 1000 words a day since the age of 22, is more of a compulsion) got old by the time I was done with the first of a dozen essays. There are some nuggets of wisdom here and there, but the syrup-soaked rhetoric the readers must endure to find these tiny treasures isn't worth reading the book, if you ask me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Zen of Ray Bradbury","review":"I thought I had read every book Bradbury ever wrote.

She is especially good with background details, which often contain little jokes and subtle references - these help her books stand up to multiple rereadings. The story of FLORA'S BLANKET may not be the right book for parents struggling to wean their toddlers from dependency on a favorite toy or item of clothing, but it will amuse others who have witnessed and/or survived such tantrums (one of my favorite spreads in the book is the part where Flora's older siblings try to offer her their own blankets, to no avail). It also makes a good gift for reader who are keen on bunnies, as Flora and her family are rabbits (one detail that made me smile was the carrot pattern on *the* blanket when it's finally found)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but could have been better!","review":"As a huge \\"Friends\\" fan,I own both books and all possible memorabilia related to the show.I prefer the official guide rather than this unofficial guide because this book contains info that most \\"Friends\\" fans like myself already know.But this book should be of interest to those who do not know much about the show and those who have only begun liking the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, fun book that captures the spirit of \\"Friends.\\"","review":"Wow, what can I say?

The book begins with some poor overviews of what we mean by ROI and what we mean by Software Process Improvement. It then goes on to give very detailed descriptions of how the author chooses to measure ROI for several major SPI approaches. He then goes on to cite cost and benefit numbers coming out of his calculations. Based on these numbers, he makes some pretty strong conclusions about the relatively high cost and relatively low benefits of most of the major SPI approaches in use today. His overall agenda seems to be to convince people that most SPI efforts are too expensive and not worthwhile (which is in stark contrast to the claims made for the book in the foreword by Roger Pressman, where he says the book will help you justify continued funding for SPI). His final conclusion is that we should minimize the costs of SPI and maximize the benefits -- not something I needed a $50 book to help figure out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and not terribly helpful","review":"I was hoping that this book would help me justify the cost of a software quality improvement initiative.

The author did not even mention the uphill grade on gap road, which was quite challenging for us given it was on miles 55057 and rose from 340 to 740 feet.Personally I doubt whether the author even did this route in a car, let alone a bicycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of good roads missed","review":"This guide, like all the Falcon ride guides, does a nice job of describing a series of pretty good rides, but inexplicably ignores lots of great ones.

I read this book as a high school student and still thought it was breathtaking. For me, I didn't really understand that there was any underlying literary theory behind it - what I liked about it was that, like Moby-Dick, it seems like several times it starts meandering and turning in on itself and you begin to question its relevance and quality, and then in the last few pages it comes together and hits you in the face with exactly how much it means. There's so much there to understand and uncover.If I gave any advice to someone reading this book for the first time, it's to stick it out.

Perec, along with Queneau and Calvino, prove that Oulipo isn't just a gimmick but a viable workshop in which great art can be produced that is both equally humorous and emotionally moving. Perec's prose is rich. There's more than enough humor and pathos in the book for anyone who's willing to carefully read a book that's not just rushing to tell a story, but to occupy it with some beautiful philosophy.

The excellent 'Fuego' is on the Jazzier side of smooth. 'Indian Summer', with it's retro sounding keyboard & smooth vocals, is one for those chilled out moments. Another excellent track with slightly retro sounding keyboard is On 'The Strip'. Keyboards have been used to great effect through out this CD and they have complimented Marc Guitar playing well.

When the trimmer was in the handle, it had no power at all, the voltage drop in the handle was so big that the trimmer hardly operated. I rewired the handle with heavier wire but it did not help much. Without the extension handle the trimmer worked for approximately 20 minutes, then needed to be recharged. The charger was not equipped with any indicating lights, no light to indicate charging or power; really a bad design.I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't know","review":"Can't say one way or another cause I haven't had to replace the blades that came with the unit.Footnote: had to throw away blades cause the unit they go to sucked so bad I threw it away so then had no use or blades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Filter","review":"I was told these were the best filters money can buy...

Unfortunatly it then just leaves you feeling bored and unfulfilled.....maybe this was the Authors intention....to leave you with the same feeling her Submissive Lawyer was always left with......waiting and wanting more but instead to just be left there in that state of wanting. This book left me cold and unfilled.....I went and found my Sleeping Beauty Trilogy set and will read those again.So far the Sleeping Beauty Trilogy is one on my favorites for BDSM erotica stories if you're looking for some real one handed reading read them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper-thin Characters and No Boundaries","review":"Nearly stream-of-conciousness narration doesn't provide any early insight into the female protagonist. The reader therefore has to quickly decide whether the story is worth waiting for the author to dispense any details explaining the pathology of the female protagonist. I for one chose not to keep on after the first quarter of the book. I speculate that the author is merely looking to tear down any perceived boundary in sexual relations; why else the almost-immediate inclusion of ATM in the first scene?The author may have talent, but given the subject matter and the lack of details about the female protagonist and her inner struggles it is impossible to form a reasoned opinion. Skip this book unless you have the heartiest constitution and agree with the author's determination that \\"anything goes\\" in the sexual arena."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed.","review":"This book started out steamy, but did not deliver for the rest of the book. This book was unrealistic. The main character is a respected lawyer in Paris, but when this man beats and sodomizes this woman and refuses to have sex with her, she still comes back for more abuse because she claims, \\"I belong to him.\\" How could a sub belong to a dom who does not claim his prize. All he did the entire book was sodomize and beat her. There was no climax or resolution to the book. The main character just allowed herself to be used, abused, and defeated. Their relationship was more like the doormat housewife who is abused by her husband but won't leave him because \\"she loves him\\" than a bdsm novel. I would not recommend this to anyone, there is better erotic fiction out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON\\"T DO IT!!!!","review":"I should have read the warning : \\"this is the authors first book.\\" It was SOOOO bad... IT was written poorly... the plot was very unexplained, and the author kept repeating the same thing over... and over...Don't waste your time reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fascinating","review":"There can be no better introduction to Blade Runner.There is a wealth of material here available nowhere else - from interviews with Philip K Dick to anecdotes about the shooting of the film.My favourite chapters were the ones dealing with the writing of the screenplay; and the one dealing with the rediscovery and release of the Workprint, and the subsequent Director's Cut. You cannot find this information anywhere else.Mr Sammon's writing is somewhat overenthusiastic, reading like a fan's website. But the sheer quanitity and interesting nasture of the material makes up for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Secrets of Blade Runner","review":"I fell in love with the film some years back, and with every fresh viewing find it ever more intriguing. This book answered some of the questions I had concerning the film and Dick's book Androids, and also opened my eyes to a few little-known facts and unused ideas concerning the film. I loved the photos and sketches and easy style the book was written in. A must for any true Blade Runner or PK Dick fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exhaustive and essential for any film student.","review":"If you love the movie Blade Runner you should be reading this book. It is indispensable. The author shares many insights and personnal experiences on the set of the film as well as never-filmed story lines (some of which would have been incredible) and never before published photo stills. A thorough review of the film in ALL of it's formats and versions comes included-it's a bit dizzying. The book is packed with detail and interviews with cast and crew members. The author is a bona-fide BLADE RUNNER nut.NOTE: Wired Magazine recently named 'Blade Runner' the BEST science-fiction film EVER ('Star Wars' was tenth).A must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for fans of Blade Runner or Electric Sheep","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. It provided tremendous insights into the movie and, to some degree, the book upon which it was based. (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?) My only complaint was that the author never really explained what \\"Future Noir\\" means! Not being a student of the arts, it would have been nice to have had the term \\"film noir\\" defined at the beginning of the book. (By the way, it refers to a type of film portraying a dark, realistic view of the world. Apparently this generally includes Post-WW II detective movies.)One thing the author did which I appreciated was to divide the book up into several key sections. In this way, one can quickly flip to a specific area of interest, such as the making of the soundtrack or special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tabloid Trash","review":"At best, this book should be looked at if you're interested in the facts behind the production of the film and you're able to look past Sammon's masturbative narrative.While the book is informative on what happened and the difficulties behind the making of the film, the author's writing ability is about the same as someone standing next to you with a bullhorn. Self-aware and bordering on narcistsic, Sammon's dirt-basic writing ability has a constant feel of \\"Hey! I was here to see all this!\\" attitude that really undermines his attempt at objective writing.Frustrating and amatuerish, \\"Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner\\" is an unworthy footnote and a worthwhile coffee coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"couldn't-put-it-down\\" book!","review":"I loved it!

With all due respect to the great Domingo, I think the most impressive performance was Julia Migenes as Aldonza/Dulcinea. She has a beautiful voice, but she can also growl and snarl when the music calls for it, and can give her voice an expressive range from earthy to soaring. Mandy Patinkin can sing beautifully, but here he decided not to, and gave Sancho a raspy, high-pitched voice that I think works pretty well for the comic character. Sancho is a comic sidekick, not a profound or complex role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Domingo is no Quixote","review":"Geez, what a waste of money.

Trust me, it's good.The rest of the Rachmaninoff and the Prokofiev isn't bad either - very good, in fact. It's just that the third movement of the Rachmaninoff is something truly spectacular.Yo-Yo Ma and Emanuel Ax are wonderful alone - and together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing performance of a first-rate work","review":"Rachmaninoff wrote this sonata (opus 19) and the Second Concerto (opus 18) at about the same time, and they are indeed quite similar, overflowing with haunting melodies, lush harmony, and dramatic climaxes. The difficult piano part is featured as much as the cello.Ax and Ma give a perfunctory and superficial performance, as if they're sight reading or have just learned the work for the recording session. They ignore climaxes and give little shape to the beautiful themes. There's much more to this music than Ax and Ma manage to capture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacement chain","review":"This is just a replacement chain for a certain chain saw, and is top quality.

If your hips, things and buttocks are the problem, this is the right video for you. Do it 3 times a week, alternated with some cardio, and you'll be amazed with the results. The exercise in this video really targets those trouble areas, and you'll feel it!The reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the video takes place in the 80s, so it's full of people with puffy hair and cheesy workout attires, and the music... but the routine itself is way too good to worry about how the people in the video are dressed - look at their legs and hips instead!

For me it was a challenge but I have an overwhelming gratitude. Eric Butterworth is remarkable in his understanding of God and is willing to put it all out there.

However, I was quite shocked by what I saw in the last edition (the 8th). I am sure most of those who have bought this Atlas or had a chance to look at it by now, have noticed the formation of a new gulf that never existed before, Arabian Gulf! It's sad how money can replace names even in the map (Arabian Gulf instead of Persian Gulf!) What National Geographic hasn't noticed yet is how its credibility has dropped among the intellectual crowd and many others are enraged by this act. I never thought history can be distorted, but with what I saw from National Geographic, which has lost it's credibility among those that understand the impact of this change, I am not so sure any more. It's unfortunate and humiliating what money can do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Persian Gulf instead of Arabian Gulf","review":"It seems like Arabs money have been able to buy even these people from national Geographic.

Unwilling partners, they respond to situations ranging from bizarre to comical to deadly. One criticism I would have is that sometimes the reader can becomes lost in the details, jargon, and large number of minor characters, also, some of the violence is very graphic.

There's really not much I have to say about the book; it's overlong (though from what I have been able to gather it's only the first two sections of a larger, as yet unfinished, work), close to unintelligible in places, full of parallel text branching off the main piece with no stage direction as to how a reader is supposed to read said parallel text, and drops out of what poetic mode it has in places and becomes didactic (\\"Deixis\\" is the most blatant example of this). All of this leads to a simple \\"didn't like it much.\\" Nothing else to be said, I guess. **"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst solo spice effort.","review":"Mel,s Hot should be called luke warm its pathetic. Her voice can get a little annoying. Mel has to be the worst singer in the group. Some critics bashed Geri Halliwell's singing ability but at least she,s pulling out number 1 hits. And after listening to Geri,s new single ride it I must say her singing lessons paid off, she sounds better than ever. But back to this album the songs are effortless and it makes Victoria,s debut look like gold. It seems to me that she,s giving up on her solo career.We can only hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way Better Then Credited","review":"Although I wasn't a big fan of the Spice Girls, I liked the single Holla so I decided to give there solo projects a listen. This by far to me was the best of them, although there are spots on the album that are too pop for me, there are tracks that really show case this rather limited singer in a new light. On the track Pack Your S***, she hits notes you wouldn't think she could hit, nowhere near a Whitney Houston, or a Monica, but impressive for her range. The track Step Inside is a sexier, more raspy side to her voice, while Hotter, ABC 123, and I Want You Back, showcase the Melanie B. that we've all known from the Spice Girls. The other stand out track is Tell Me, the rest where boring, bad, forgettable, or too pop to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great Cd!","review":"This is a great cd. Actually one of the best i have heard to date. Especially coming from one of the spice girls. Her voice has changed she sounds great looks great. She deserves a lot of credit for this cd.

Along with a well paced investigative novel, the reader receives a better understanding of the status of Hong Kong as it's returned to mainland China after 100 years as a British colony.

But one fisherman, having found packages of Oreo cookies on board gave us more than enough to to tide us over.

Geshe Sonam's comments are simple and discreete, and the translator has formal english.So is it Aryadeva's, Gyel-tsap's, Geshe Sonam Rinchen's or the translator's fault? None, I think.

This book recommends that you memorize all kinds of formulae, even the quadratic equasion(!), whereas the test will give you complicated formulae--your task is to perform operations. A look at the English grammar section was equally, if not more, intimidating to me, and I am a grammarian! I also found more than a few typos in the math section--one wonders how many more there are throughout. The CBEST tests basic proficiency, not expertise.

It's so rare that you find an easy to read thriller that has pace and style and balances a clever plotline with interesting characters.David Braun is an investigator, bored by his job, who gets involved in an unusual case. He seeks the help of Susan, an expert from the London School of Antiquities, to help him answer some of the puzzling questions. The interplay between these two characters and their developing romance is a perfect foil to the unravelling of the mystery. I won't give too much away about the story because it's truly original and it would be a shame to spoil it at all. However, I particularly liked the balanced way the story and characters developed around each other, with both of the main characters coming to understand that they couldn't control everything in life. A really rewarding, clever, imaginative and thrilling discovery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read.","review":"The book is a mixture of mystery with some occult thrown in--sorta along an illuminatus conspiracy line.

Who was the villain and what was his agenda? (We only know his name and that he needs to \\"renew\\" his immortality). How are MI5 involved? Maybe later books would have answered them.The finale makes use of a \\"deus ex machina\\" where another adept turns up out of the blue and kills the villain.

However, if someone thought this would be something a user would want, why isn't the default to both charge and power? It's really annoying - especially when I forget to push the button, have it plugged in for a while and then realize the battery is still low.It's also very big and heavy and not the most practical for travel.

It does not contain any secret information and does not guarantee that you will grow taller. All that is suggested for growing taller is a proper diet and excercise, which is basically common sense.

All of which could translate into an inch or 2 of apparent height.Proper hydration could result in an apparent increase in height. When we wake up in the morning we are actually a little shorter than when we laid down because the water in the spinal cord is no longer there.Very diminutive height is caused largely in part by genetics and life style, or sometimes as a result of HGH deficiencies, I recommend you consult your doctor and leave the hair-brained books on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Any Men or Women took the road no one did?","review":"Hey guys, I've read the book.

I'd rather spend that time for my body then.However, I do believe in reasonable time like 1 year to see result. So i wonder if anyone could please email me at mdsanguyen@gmail.com and lemme know if there is any man or woman out there, who has gone the road no one is willing to go before and got some result?

Hoffman digs deeply into the minds of his characters and, whether or not you agree with their actions or not, they're still interesting. You don't always have to agree with the actions of the protagonist(s) to enjoy a book. These characters are not stereotypical, they are purely three dimensional, unusual, and fascinating.The suspense really isn't that strong, it's not THAT type of thriller. Everything's intriguing though, there's lots of action going down, and the subject matter hasn't been touched upon in this way that much.

Mr. Hoffman made her out to be a very intelligent woman, but when the clues stood out like a sore thumb (in the end - whom the Killer was actually going to kill) she missed it by a couple million miles.

So glad that despite not recognizing the author and it being an advanced readers copy, I bought it. This book was surprisingly good. The protagonist is complex and your opinion of him can change with every chapter. This book is well written, and I must agree with the other reviewer in that the moving around in the timeline actually has a very good effect on the development of the plot and the reader's understanding of the motives and background. This author reminds me a little of Gene Wolfe, you must accept that you will wonder and have questions, and they may be beautifully answered later or never at all.

You pay for it, you should be able to use it - even if that means waiving support. Hopefully, newer products are limited only by the terms of their end-user licensing agreements.On the other hand, the bundled MIDI cable alone, if it works with other software, will have justified the low price I paid. :-) An identical cable at the local music store would have cost me a lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Buy This!

It's a fairly simple and straightforward book, but it absolutely skewers every half-cocked objection you've ever heard to Darwin's work. Like Gould's Wonderful Life, the strength of the book is its remarkable ability to notice the little details, and use them as a foundation for a powerful statement on the history of life, and our place on this little rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Galapagos Primer","review":"I am going to the Galapagos Islands in February, and The Beak of the Finch was on our suggested reading list. I was not familiar with the book, but I found it to be a fascinating study of evolution as a whole and Darwin's finches on Galapagos in particular. The book won a Pulitzer, so it clearly is well written and covers an important subject. The descriptions of the work done over many years by Peter and Rosemary Grant from Princeton are amazing. The details that must be tracked in trying to follow generations of finches on Daphne Major in the Glalapagos are just overwhelming, even though I have to admit that I found I was actually learning more about the little birds than I wanted to know. I highly recomment the book especially if you have plans to travel to the Galapagos Islands.

The story starts out as an adventure with the Grant's in the Galapagos Islands. The impression was that it was to be a novel which tells a story, while in reality it was full of boring information about the finch. I give the book two stars for the experiments and evolution theories, but as a story it was not flowing. Overall, I did not enjoy the novel due to the falsehood of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Informative Story of the Forces Behind Life","review":"The Beak of the Finch by Jonathan Weiner is a very mind-expanding, scientific, yet descriptive and intriguing book. It presents evidence behind the theory of evolution in an easy-to-understand format. It summarizes a twenty-year study of Darwin's finches on the Galapagos Islands. It also incorperates Darwin's life and research into the finch study by Rosemary and Peter Grant. The descriptions and diverse experiments explained make this Pulitzer Prize-winning book very enjoyable to read. However, there are parts where there is too much repetition of ideas. There are also parts in which Weiner unneccessarily delves into religious beliefs and dismisses them, though they often have nothing to do with evolution, the topic of his book. Overall, the book is well-written, informative, and interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positively Brilliant","review":"Weiner's The Beak of the Finch is a positively brilliant work on the topic of evolution. A great introduction for the student of evolutionary biology, or the layman. Weiner's book destroys two of the greatest myths about evolution. 1. It's slow. 2. It can't be observed. The study of the Galapagos Finches not only proves the importance of evolution as a contemporary subject but as one that can be observed RIGHT NOW in the world around us. It's almost astonishing to see how simple evolution truly is, how it occurs in quantifiable baby steps that we can see, if we only take the time to carefully observe. Weiner not only demystifies evolution, but makes it as a topic, thoroughly accessible to the interested layman. His prose is neither dry nor technical and in fact, makes for quite an enjoyable read. I wholeheartedly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"'Beak of the Finch' is a great read, and not only for its entertainment value. It really lends more of a concrete feel to the surprisingly elusive nature of evolution.Darwin's Galapagos finches provide this concrete example; they also happen to serve as a perfect example of evolution occuring under extremely selective conditions. Weiner's very skillful description of these unique conditions and the exact nature of the process of selection under these conditions serves to reveal the nature of the process of evolution in a unique and exciting way."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD MISTAKE","review":"EPIL-STO IS A BAD PRODUCT, NOT WRTH THE MONEY, IT SMELLS, IT LEAVES YOU WITH RASHES AND OVER ALL, WILL NOT EVER RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANY ONE, VERY BAD, NEED TO COME UP WITH A BETTER PRODUCT THAT WORKS.

Rather reminds me of a wonderful book I read years ago about the lost continent of Mu.... Maybe everything in the book is true -- but I am not sure who Mr. Callahan is? Is he just writing opinions, or is he a scholar in the field?? I couldn't tell... Absolutely zero credentials were listed. For all I know, he is a street cleaner (no shame there) with interesting opinions, but no training in judging legitimacy of sources. All of that would be OK, but since the book is put out by the Skeptic Soc, I believe that it is reasonable to be a little skeptical. Right?? No matter, however..it is a fun book, even if rather unoriginal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellen read","review":"This book is great if you have questions about the orgins of the bible and how it was put together.

He felt Nanty's hands cradling his head, and he felt how tender they were. \\"How can a thing like a head be held within a lady's fingers?\\" she whispered. \\"Here's dreams and memories and ancient tales that's being told and told. Here's stars that shine a billion miles away and deep dark caves and forests and Helmouth and teachers and mothers and horns of unicorns and the stripes of tigers.

In my book they all lived in Helmouth which was a boring town that nobody or anything ever came to this town except for one when a circus came. The circus was right behind his house so Joe saw it as soon as he got up.When he was walking to school he met a girl in the circus who did the balance beam.

Zootles is a bimonthly publication and is a great magazine focusing on wildlife. The magazine is ad-free which is a great bonus in my opinion. Each publication features a particular animal, for example pandas, and the entire magazine (for those two months) has interesting facts about the pandas, covering their habitat, the panda babies, how they play, their diet, and a short story featuring the panda. The magazine also has a 'fun pages' feature which comprises fun activities like coloring, drawing, and other learning activities.There are plenty of full-color photographs about the featured animal as well as beautiful illustrations. Highly recommended for ages 3-6."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great little subscription for older toddlers","review":"This subscription focuses on animal science concepts, mainly physical features, subspecies, and interesting fact. Very limited on th phonics, and number focus, but maybe that is why it is a science subscription, lol. Some facts were even new for me. Example, you can easily tell the various monkys from apes because monkeys have tails, apes (gorillas, chimpes, orangutans, bonobos) do NOT. How cool is that. The photos are outstanding in this magazine, the poems are sweet and emphasize rhyming. The section in the middle for extension ideas is super and can take it to that 6 ending range or keeps it simple for the 2s. Lots of sensory activities which is great for the little ones. I will renew. Only thing that would make this a 5 star would be a few more letter/number activites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor research?","review":"I wonder how accurate the rest of the book is when the author, Mr. Kershaw, did not care to notice that Dawson City, the Klondike, and surrounding region are not in Alaska but well inside Canada.

I got a lot of compliments on my scents from friends, and I occasionally gave the colognes as gifts. People really liked them. I am so happy to find them still available.Pikake means peacock in Hawaii's language. A little princess loved peacocks and jasmine flowers.

What we get here is a book that covers every base and carries the reader with it. Patel also pulls in expert tips form the pros - names like Pat Arbor and Phil Flynn - but what makes this one different is that he's also enlisted the help of the trading community in chat rooms and trading site to chip in with their experiences and trading lessons.

From a literary perspective it is extraordinary. A book to read many times over."},{"rating":"1","title":"the son of laughter","review":"I'd advise not to read this book. Certainly don't spend money on it. Buechner's sole strength seems to be imagination. But so is a 7 year-old's. At times his writing seems pedantic. Other times like he's trying too hard to be poetic (using \\"moors\\" for hills near their tents - in Palestine!). I feel he goes beyond proper liberty-taking for even historical fiction (why make the three visitors to Abraham and Sarah into birds, of all things? Why make Isaac out to be someone suffering from PTSD?) Maybe worst of all is a juvenile 'potty' infatuation: three potty allusions in the first three chapters - a bladder incontinence by A. at the near-sacrifice of Isaac, 'droppings' by one of the bird-angels at Sarah's laughter, and the considered beard-pissing at the Esau-stew-birthright scene. Give us a break. My copy goes in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"an ultimate collection","review":"There is a group of Shadows tracks that is continually recycled in compilation albums, and one gets tired of seeing them.

It came with 4 *small* tubes of glitter glue, not enough in my daughters' opinions. Luckily we had some more at home to finish the decorating. Some of the butterflies are strung upside down, as the prettier side faces the ceiling. The real problem with this toy though is that the strings get all tangled and it is pretty annoying to untangle - in retrospect I should have untied them and then restrung them. It is also difficult to get the mobile to balance properly - the strings slide on the metal bars making it lopsided. Another pointer if you do this craft - we laid ours out on newspaper and the glue goes right through the sheer fabric, so the butterflies ended up sticking to the newspaper. Not a great craft, but my daughters think the mobiles are pretty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Single!","review":"This Maxi CD single by Robin S. is great for any dance party!

Brodkey contradicts herself at every turn. This book includes silly essays like \\"Modernism and the Scene(s) of Writing,\\" which reveals that the essence of how the writers write is somehow key to the way we read books. In this essay, Brodkey claims that \\"very few people [she knows] are positioned as well as [she is] to recognize the extent to which their lives are organized by writing.\\" This is just a small example of the condescending attitude she maintains, while trying to manage to get students to think on their own about how certain unquestioned \\"truths\\" come to light.

They will make you think you are crazy and change you $7000 to go to some intervention BS. BE AWARE everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money","review":"The socalled real love described in this book is a sham. The author spends the entire book reworking his own past failures by blaming others for not giving him unconditional love--by which he means that he should have been loved and adored by those around him even as he acted out his own shortcomings and failures in often selfish and extremely hurtful ways. This book is not about real unconditional love, it is about one person's pathological need for enablers and co-dependents.If you are having difficulties in your relationship, find a reputable, licensed counselor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swinging from conjecture to lunacy.","review":"One of the worst books I've ever read. The book is full of erroneous logic, speculation, conjecture, and, at times, borderline lunacy!One star's too much of a rating.Granted, there were a few good points made in the book, but they could've been all summarized on one page... out of 200+.Giant waste of your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lacks depth but still worthwhile.","review":"Even though this is 'pop psychology' and oversimplifies the issues, I still found Baer's ideas were a kind of 'grand unification theory' of my relationship issues. Having been raised in a dysfunctional family, I only knew conditional love and it was a real revelation to find out that unconditional love exists. I do wish that there were more information for readers who are new to the concept about how to create such a relationship. If you have had or are in an unsatisfying relationship, I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing","review":"This book has dramatically changed and healed my life. It is unlike any other \\"self-help\\" book out there. It has taught me how to be responsible for my own behavior and judgements. It has helped me understand, not excuse, myself and taught me HOW to find love and lasting happiness. My past and current relationships have become wonderful and I have much more love and compassion for the people around me. I recommend this book to anyone truly looking for happiness - take what you already know and Real Love will add the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my life!","review":"I've read a lot of books about how to be happy and have good relationships, but this one spoke to me more powerfully than any other. Not only did it teach great principles for living fully and happily, it provided concrete steps about how to do all that, even when the people closest to you are not doing it! And going to the book's website gives more resources to help you when you decide to change your life for the better. Powerful and life changing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously? Really?","review":"Seriously? People are buying this? If that's the case, then I have several pieces of land in the desert that I'd like to sell you. In fact, Greg Baer is doing his best to sell his own \\"crazy real estate\\" to you in selling these books. Real Love is full of \\"New Age\\" philosophy and Baer's own personal philosophy.....none of which has any hard science or psychological worth behind any of it. Several questions: Was this author EVER a licensed therapist? Has he ever been through any training of any sort other than \\"life's school of hard knocks\\" due to his own drug addiction and failed relationships? Umkay....I didn't think so. A retired opthamologist? Uh, yeah. I think he'd write a better treatise on eye disease? Maybe?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oversimplistic","review":"While this book is very nice. I think it just oversimplifies human behavior. He essentially tells everyone to \\"make nice\\" and love one another. I don't think anyone should tell others that their emotions are \\"wrong\\" and he essentially says that anger is always wrong. I am glad that I bought it though. There were some real pearls of wisdom and a lot of \\"Don't sweat the small stuff\\" which I think is very helpful in any relationship. Pick your battles so to speak. Think before you speak. Be honest about who you are. All of that is good advice. He just makes it sound way too easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading!","review":"I originally purchased this as an assignment from my counselor, then learned so much that I have purchased many copies for friends and families since. It has taught me how to love and how to accept being loved, unconditionally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing","review":"This book changed my life. I had been unhappy and lying and cheating and wallowing in getting and protecting behaviors. Searching desparately for Immitation Love in drugs, alcohol, spending money, etc!! Guess what, it doesn't work. Happiness is yours with REAL LOVE!! It's a work in progress, but Greg Baer and his books and website and workshops are helping me find true peace and happiness.....finally."},{"rating":"1","title":"ICK!!!! Worst book ever!","review":"This is the worst book I have ever laid my eyes on. It has nothing to do with anything \\"real.\\" In fact, it was all about not taking responsibility for anything you do, and not expecting anything from anyone. I shudder to think that this actually got published. My dog could write something better than this rubbish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ask him about his first wife","review":"I read this psycho-junk and that is exactly what it is.

Unfortunately, this product contains Soduium Laureth Sulfate so I will be returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"All flash and no real learning!","review":"I bought 2 CDROMs from this company, piano for my kid and guitar for myself. Neither does a very good job of teaching. This one is by far the worse of the two. My biggest problem is the lessons are very scattered. You are expected to go from point A to point D, skipping B and C. The playback on the songs isn't very flattering, as it is MIDI with no real guitar sounds. The instructor is straight out of the eighties with his big hair, so if anything I got a good laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got this for my kids & not happy","review":"I got this for my kids and am really disappointed. Frankly I hate it and feel ripped off. I can teach my kids more useable hands on guitar than this ever will and the kids immediately lost interst with it. Kids learn from songs they already know - and this thing has only three made up mediocre tunes to learn with. I saw a cd that had about 100 known songs on it for the kids to pick and learn - this wasnt the one! Wish I had wrote down the program so I didnt make the mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"It's an excellent handbook for those are forming their own music studio. It contains many insights and hints. I recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good.","review":"Bought the book. Haven't read it all yet. Very informative. I learnt a couple of tricks from it.If you have any other books by Owsinsky, you know what to expect. 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting read, but out of date and not very helpful","review":"This book does not outline the steps involved in the mastering process. It is just some interviews with different mastering engineers. Instead of talking about how they go about mastering a project or what they listen for, they brag about their cool customized gear and how little signal processing goes between the source and the final output. Yet at the same time saying how much they are improving the sound.You get the history of mastering.You get how they schedule their day.I was hoping for more of a real \\"handbook\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a complete waste of space!","review":"What a complete waste of text! Want to learn mastering? Don't actually expect to learn ANYTHING from this book. You'll learn though on how mastering engineers complain and whine about the state of the industry.... and that's about it! Reading these other reviews makes me wonder if these people even read this book at ALL! The first review says the book is great, and that it tells you nothing! Wow, just what I wanted to spend my money on, nothing at all. No, one book will NOT teach you everything you need to know about mastering, but this book teaches you NOTHING about mastering, except 'less is more' philosophy. Ok, there you go, you just learned everything you needed from this book from me. In short, dont' waste your time or money on this book. Would you want to read a book on car mechanics saying that 'hey, forget about being a mechanic, it's too tough!' and then continue on for several hundred pages? This is what this book is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It should be called mastering for dummies","review":"what a bunch of ..., The first thing you read is \\"I am not a mastering engineer\\" WHAT?? All the book talks about is what gear to use and not any thing about how to do things. If you want to learn how to master this is not the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total disappointment","review":"This toy flat out doesn't work.

No rough treatment just simply stopped working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun toy for the money","review":"My son really wanted this shadow toy after playing with it at a friend's house. We saw it in a toy store for about $10 more. It probably wouldn't have been worth that, but it is worth the $16 that Amazon charges. Both my children, ages 9 and 11, have had loads of fun with it. They have shadow copied everything from simple shapes to one of the family cats. Just hang it over a door in a closet or bathroom and have fun! I have one worry, which is that the green screen will rip, but my children say it's really sturdy."},{"rating":"2","title":"really cool album","review":"The quality of the album was excellent and it didn't take long to get it in through the mail."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Valuable Tool","review":"This book (encyclopedia) rates and describes nearly every quality jazz album available. It provides essays about the different jazz genres from traditional, to bop; thirdstream, to fusion, and all in between. Music maps chart the prominent players of each genre and instrument throughout jazz history.The discographies of these musicians are amazing.I use this book constantly. It may make a jazz student out of you too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect, essential for every beginner.","review":"When I first began listening to jazz years ago I was overwhelmed by the amount of stuff out there. I didn't have a lot of money so I didn't want to buy albums that I wouldn't like. I wanted to get the best. This book was a god-send. Of the 100 or so jazz albums I own, I have only returned two that were recommended by this book. Most of the jazz I own was purchased after studying this book. The info is great, the reviews are usually on target and easy to read (what is so hard about the stars?). If you are just getting into jazz, or need info on an artist that you don't know anything about, get this book. ESSENTIAL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"While the information in the book is pretty good, it's presented with a very stuffy, holier-than-thou attitude. Why do some jazz writers have to be so stuck up? I much prefer the MusicHound Jazz book. It's written so people can actually *understand* it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good idea ......................","review":"Ruby is an OK singer, but this is a suicidal project. She recorded ten of the greatest Motown tunes in 1988, and every one of them sounds like a pale shade of the original.Aretha Franklin might be able to pull this off with inspired arrangements.

The exec who greenlighted this must have had an unusual agenda, or no idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally A Book","review":"You have heard of \\"The Perfect Storm\\" well I believe this to be \\"The Perfect Plausible Purposeful Book\\"I have searched though books all my life and finally found a way to understand the meaning of life as we know it. This book by Robert Adams puts the puzzle of life together in a unique way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very, repetitive","review":"\\"Dancing With Tears In My Eyes\\" starts out great... but then gets horribly repetitive. The song should have been a little more creative. The lyrics are really, really short.This song could kick it up a notch with the proper remixes. Novaspace has a lot of work to do. They remixed Inoj's \\"Time After Time\\" and that wasn't much better than the original version. Hopefully, good things will come from them in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"This book was exceptionally helpful for the Beginner and Intermediate Spanish speakers both for the pronunciation guidelins and the Phrases in the back. Certainly the expansive list of words is not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply Psychological","review":"Caroline B. Cooney never ceases to pull off writing a great book. The Snow is the second book of The Fog, The Snow, and The Fire trilogy. I think it is the best of the three. It's a really psychological trilogy. It deals with those difficult times when you're telling the truth and no one will listen or believe you. We can all relate. I'm sure our stories are not as life/death as Christina's (the main character). I highly recommend this book if you can relate to not being listened too when you really need to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evil Cackles","review":"Christina is still fighting against the evil of the Shevvingtons, still trapped inside their formiddable home.A home which now comes with something extra...A laughing lunatic who hides in the attic.How will Christina ever prove the true nature of the hideous Shevvington couple?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Empower Your Patients With Help From This Book","review":"We often think our patients understand us fully when we provide them with information regarding their diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment plan. In fact studies show that over half of the adult population has trouble processing and acting on this information correctly. Poor compliance often leads to poor outcomes. We need to ensure that our patients get \\"the whole picture\\".Health Literacy from A to Z is a wonderful resource for all health professionals. It touches on all aspects of patient care and provides simple, easily implemented strategies to enhance understanding for your patients.This is a tool I will use over and over again. I keep it easily accessible so I can refer to it as needed. I suggest you do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, wonderful book!!","review":"I just loved this book because it made me both laugh and cry. The sparkling chemistry between Grace and Jack was fabulous, so clever and funny I couldn't wait to see what they were going to say and do next. And the other characters were just as great. And the end just wrenched my heart. This book just shot up to the top of my favorite romances in the past five years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Italy at Home","review":"Great Taste, great foam, easy preparation. Compares favorably with the cafes in Rome. The taste of Italy without TSA. What's not to love?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay attention to the ACTUAL servings and cost!!!!","review":"Just because there are 16 pieces in the package does NOT mean it's $.74/count!!! It takes a coffee disk and a creamer disk in order to actually make the cappucino. This means that each package makes EIGHT drinks. While I don't profess to be a math whiz or anything close to one, that means the actual cost PER DRINK is $1.47875, or right at $1.48.I'm sorry if this comes off as nasty, but I am so disgusted with this type of sneakiness. It's not bad enough that it becomes more and more difficult to even find Tassimo disks at decent prices, but if you're trying to buy and move on to something else, you end up spending way too much time trying to figure out what's up. Stop wasting customers' time and TELL THE TRUTH.By the way, I LOVE my Braun Tassimo."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Change","review":"I have had this DVD for a few weeks now and it has become my \\"go to\\" exercise DVD because not only is it a great workout, but I actually find myself enjoying it! Level 1 introduces some new types of exercise styles for me(such as Brazilian and Jiu-Jitsu) and I will admit I was a little lost in places the first time or two but they were a nice change from the typical workout moves. Once I did it a few times I enjoyed the moves even more and look forward to that circuit. Level 2 is no joke, it will kick your bootie. It is easier to follow then Level 1 was (coordination wise) but it makes me wonder if I will ever be able to do both workouts back to back. Love Jillians DVD's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what it says","review":"i wanted a longer work out and bought this for the two 45 minute work outs. But this is two 30 minute work outs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite at all","review":"Eh. I'm not a fan of this one. I like \\"old\\" Jillian DVDs much better. I'm in decent shape and this one just seemed to hurt my body. And not in that \\"good kind of sore\\" way, more in the \\"I'm actually in pain\\" kind of way. I stopped doing this DVD about 3 weeks after I started and haven't picked it back up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure butt kicker","review":"This is a great workout and will make you sore the next day.

They don't flow smoothly. I can do without the Capoiera as well on this.STOP COPYING JILLIAN AND MAKE AN ORIGINAL DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"does not play","review":"Jillian Michaels Extreme Shed & ShredI received the package in 30 days, and do not play the on the dvd player and computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anthing but jillian - PLEASE !","review":"This self absorbed fitness guru workouts are frenetic and not fun .... my workout partner and I used to joke about if she could wear herworkout pants any lower..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Trouble with No More Trouble Zones","review":"I got this video because is was listed as among the more popular. Well her celebrity makes her popular to a lot of Biggest Loser fans. Yes, this is a very hard and intensive workout that will get you a toned body. I do not think all of the exercises are adequate but they were add to counter the harder ones. The problem I have with this video is that it is so-o commercial that she will even hawk electric toothbrushes as part of your \\"health regiment.\\" I am finding that the greatest annoyance of all is her nonstop patter. A lot of videos have the star trainer demonstrate along with their crew members, Jillian will make any excuse to stop and point out what you should be doing so that she wouldn't have to do it herself and then she will laugh about the fact that she didn't have to do it! Luckily, they do offer a no-talk version with music only, of course you have to stare at the screen the whole time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian Fan Here!","review":"I own nearly all of Jillian's DVDs and this one is definitely a favorite of mine. She really branches out in this DVD and incorporates a lot of new exercises from different areas of fitness. For example, you will see some go-to moves like burpees, but she also brings in some yoga and Brazilian jiu-jitsu (sp?) moves. It is refreshing to see so many new moves!*I would not consider myself a beginner athlete, I work out 5-6 days/week running, lifting weights, swimming, and kick-boxing. I still find this workout challenging. I would not recommend this DVD for beginners, but, as always, Jillian offers modified moves to try. This is definitely not Jillian's hardest DVD on the market (BFBM and NMTZ are the most difficult in my opinion), but I am still drenched when I finish this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty cool","review":"Pretty cool. I like that she puts in a lot of different kinds of exercises but it isn't all that challenging. I still use it about twice a month. It is about 40-50 minutes depending on the level. I like that I can fit it in in the morning. I just wish it was a little bit harder. I would still recommend because it is still a great DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"I love her workout videos! I am glad I stopped going to the gym and wasting my money becuase I get a better workout with Jillian Michaels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Work Out - Even for the Hard Core Fitness Level","review":"I am in shape and exercise regularly. Jillian is by far my favorite trainer to work out with at home. I have about 5 of her other dvd's and this one (especially if doing the work outs back to back - 60 mins total) is definitely one of the tougher ones. It's funny because as you're doing the work out it doesn't appear to be that hard (level 1 more so), but after completing both levels, I was so sore the next day. Totally worth it though as it gets results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummed! Disappointed! Looking for more.....","review":"I have to say that the title and the business going on in the video do not go hand in hand. When I saw EXTREME and Shed and Shred I was excited. I thought I was going to get my butt kicked. I was seriously let down. Don't get me wrong I did a little bit of sweating......but only a little and I did a little bit of hard breathing......but only a little. I'll say it again, I wanted my butt kicked and the video didn't deliver.Jillian has incorporated some kind of funky, dance, karatee kind of movements in there that I could have done without. Yeah, they burned a little but my heart rate wasn't going and I was seriously bored.I would love to have a video that when I'm done I'm laying on the floor afraid to move and I was hoping this was the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"false advertising","review":"This video is not what it says it is. It is advertised at being two 45 minute workouts and it is only two 30 minute workouts. I have only done level one and it left much to be desired, I could have definitely kept going, but due to time constraints I did not continue with level 2. She also puts both workouts together into one. If I knew they were only 30 minutes, I would not have bought this dvd. I was expecting a much better workout from her. If you want real effective workouts, look at Bob Harper's dvds. Those are absolutely insane, but awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"True Jilliam fashion it's a real calorie burner.

I have tried several of her videos and have three more on order, can't wait to try them. She always gives an extreme workout, you feel the burn for days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I am working hard to get back in shape. I have done almost all of jillian, bobs, jackie warner, beachbodys workouts. What I like about this workout is that it is a full hour so you can get real results. Also when you get done with most dvds you feel like you need to do more either cardio or strength. This is a great mix to hit all of you body parts and make you very sore plus cardio. You can add weights which will raise your heart rate and add muscle. Muscle is a girls fat burner! This is a great dvd! Very well rounded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great video from Jillian with new moves","review":"I own all of Jillian's videos and I do them religiously. This one seems to have a different tone to it, and tons of new moves. She's using kung fu, kickboxing, yoga, and many other different types of moves. I recommend it. It adds spice to your workout if you're looking to mix things up."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to Traditional Jillian Moves?","review":"Let me start this off by saying that I LOVE Jillian Michael's workout videos. I have 5 of them that I absolutely LOVE. This one- I HATE. I didn't even make it through the first circuit. She doesn't explain the moves, they go through them really fast, and she's started to incorporate moves that require way to much thinking, so that means I don't get as good of a workout because I'm so focused on what I'm suppose to be doing. I'm all for incorporating new moves but I'd rather do squats, curls and jumping jacks instead of bouncing around and running around in circles."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a WORKOUT!","review":"I must admit, I wasn't expecting this workout to be as challenging as it was. I work out at home and have been using DVDs by other trainers and they have been somewhat challenging, but easy to get used to. This workout was awesome! It was hard to keep up and I felt like giving up at times becasue my legs were BURNING but I didn't. I stuck it out and felt great! I almost tapped out during the burpees, yes burpees, but I hung in there and if you do you will be extremely satisfied with your workout. I actually felt like \\"when is this gonna be over!\\" instead of \\"oh, its over already!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Ouch - in a good way!","review":"I did level 1 alone two days ago, and I was sore within a few hours - that good-feeling sore. I didn't do a workout yesterday, but today I did levels 1 and most of level 2. I can tell I'm going to be wicked sore tomorrow. I liked the workouts and Jillian's motivation. Now, I need to be motivated to eat properly. Jillian made an excellent point: 2 pieces of pizza will wipe out the entire workout for most women - yikes. I'll update again in a few weeks after I've been using this; I plan to rotate with Killer Buns & Thighs and Six Week Six Pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"This is my first Jillian Michaels video and I got it to replace some work outs on days if I don't have as much time to put in a full p90x work out(I'm not a huge fan of the p90x cardio disk which is only 45 minutes). So far I really like it. I like that it can be a quick 30 minutes-ish workout that will get you working. I'm not a huge fan of the end where we lay down and listen to her rant. So I normally skip that. But other than that, I still give this 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Yoga....Disappointing Workout for Cardio Fans","review":"I have loved previous JM workouts such as 30 day Shred, Banish Fat/Boost Metabolism, No More Trouble Zones and AB workout. I was looking forward to this one, but I was disappointed. Not nearly enough cardio to suit me and way too much yoga. Not being a yoga fan and therefore not used to the moves, made this workout difficult and frustrating. The kettle bell type moves are also ones I avoid due low back issues. I did Level 1 and Level 2 back to back and still feel like I need to work out. Not much sweat or cardio involved at all. Her earlier ones were more suited to what I like to do...I'm going back to Shaun T and Insanity tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love me some Jillian","review":"Always love me some Jillian only did the work out one since this was my first week of working out again in a long time but as always the workouts are hard and really keep you moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best workout","review":"Now, I love me some Jillian Michaels. Plain and simple, because she kicks butt and it is effective! This DVD, not so much. The outside says two 45 minute workouts, but the first one was around 30 WITH warm up and cool down. I have done some of her other 20-30 minute workouts and felt like I was going to die before they finished! After just completeing this one, i am very disappointed. I don't really feel like i challenged myself at all today. I have at least five of her DVDs, but this is the first one that will be going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love JM!","review":"As always Jillian delivers! I have almost all her DVDs and this is a great addition to my workout rotation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meal Plan Included???","review":"I have one other Jillian DVD and this one sounds similar, but I bought it specifically for the \\"included\\" meal plan. What a joke! There is no free meal plan included, just a link to her website where you have to pay $4 a week for her program! So if you want a great workout, go ahead and get the DVD, but if you're tempted to get this DVD hoping to also get her meal plan as advertised on the cover, skip this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense","review":"I got this because Jillian is good at mixing cardio with weights etc. It is a nice change up from the treadmill and keeps your heart rate up the whole time. Wasn't expecting to get so intense so quick. I'm about 20 lbs overweight and in pretty good shape and one of the first exercises is burpees which are difficult for me. Going to try the video again and see if I can even complete level 1 yet because it is really intense on the body even for someone in ok shape. But will be good once I'm back into working out like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok","review":"I like Jillian's workouts and loved the 30 day shred. This video was harder to keep up with, but I'm not sure Jillian would think that was a bad thing. You could always skip around the workout to piece together something different than as is formatted- in order to mix up the workout from day to day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Awesome","review":"Another great workout session by Jillian.She kicks butt and motivates you along the way.I feel like the best version of myself after doing this program."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's my girl!","review":"With Jillian's workout, you know you've been worked hard!

I've lost 14 pounds, thank you God!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Also disappointed =(","review":"I agree with another reviewer (Gary Lian). This is my least favorite dvd of Jillian's (I love her style and most of her other videos). The style of moves are all over the place and they don't flow together in any way, shape or form.I thought I was getting 45 minute versions of workouts in the 30 Day Shred/Ripped in 30 style, wish I had read the reviews first.I gave it 2 stars because I did like some of the new moves, I just wish it was more congruent with the aforementioned videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"I'm a big fan of Jillian.I love 30 day shred as well as Ripped in 30 but I was very disappoited with this video. The moves are difficult and she doesn't go over the correct form like she does in 30 day or ripped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good...","review":"I bought this CD when it just came out last year (so I ain't got the bonus tracks) and happened to listen again to it recently so thought of posting a review. This CD is not as good as their previous 'All Rise' partly because of the high expectations that fans and listeners alike have put on their second CD. The first few tracks on this CD is neither greater nor stronger compared to the songs on 'All Rise' (they're about the same) but it gets too weak and unbearable to listen after 'Don't Treat Me Like A Fool'. I liked 'All Rise' too much to be able to listen to this too much.

The boys tried a couple of new sounds as well as sticking to their trademark RnB. Well, some failed but some was quite marvellous. One very unique track is Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word. This track, with Elton John as the featuring artist, was captivating. Other tracks such as U make me wanna, one love, riders, piracy and she told me are pretty good as well. This album is also a must get, although it is not as good as their debut and their thrid album. Another disappointing this is that they actually recorded a mandarin version of u make me wanna with taiwan artist elvia hsiao but it did not appear on this album, which is kind of sad. Still however, it is a good album to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Group and Cd in the world","review":"I bought this cd when it came out in cananda i think its great its true that its not a strong as all rise but it still good i think people that say that is bad just have different taste or honestly they just stupid ne wayz my point is that either way its a great cd cuz its BLUE cant wait till the new cd comes."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring!","review":"It's not as good as their first album 'All Rise'.The only track that stands out are 'one love' which is not up to standard as 'All Rise' and 'Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word'.If you have enough money to buy one cd,make sure you don't buy this cd!It's a complete waste of money.You will regret buying this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"same old same old","review":"Boy bands come and boy bands go, they look the same, they sound the same, and this is no exception.

Waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read for young and old alike","review":"The setting is New York City. A big race (in-line skating) is about to be held. A big crime is about to be committed. Naturally, Zeke Armstrong is involved in both. Hale and LaBrot do a wonderful job with this book: the plot is solid and fast-paced, the characters engaging, the scenes convincingly drawn. Although written for a younger audience, Green Streak never talks down to the reader; adults as well as adolescents will enjoy the mix of mystery solving and athletic endeavor. Red Card, The first installment in the Zeke Armstrong series, won the Agatha Award (deservedly so), and this is a better book. Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gullible's Travels","review":"Gullible's Travels is a thoroughly enjoyable perusal of life lived to its fullest. John T. Dybvig writes with a refreshingly open and irreverent style, always maintaining that crucial conversational tone with his reader. He is at his best describing the vast differences between life in California and New Zealand. Far from being arrogant, his observations remain both poignant and humorous. He moves from topic to topic with aplethora of anecdotal descriptions, all laced with a full-steam-ahead attitude. Dybvig is unashamed, unembarrassed, and totally honest.The book is not constructed for heavy analysis or critique. It's a joyous romp through a vast array of experiences ranging from high school basketball to professional drama and everything in between. All this laced with Dybvig's often salty, yet frequently hilarious brand of unabashed written monologue.Enjoy the read. John Dybvig entertains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, but could be better for non-MIDI users","review":"This is a great product from what I have seen so far.

I was able to keep-up but took piano years ago.Slightly dated program.The material taught (songs) are very bland. I wish they would included more modern tunes.The games included are worthless.Conclusion: If you already have some piano experience, this program could be interesting.

After so many years, I wanted to get that song and I realized this album -her first- was the only way to get it. I went to Spain for Christmas and found it. I was not very sure about buying it, but when I saw that Kiko Veneno and Raimundo Amador were some of the staff that collaborated with Martirio, I quickly made up my mind and bought it. What a mistake! This album is not good at all. Sevillanas de los bloques is the only song that I like (a lot!), but the rest is not worth the price. I do not recommend this album to anyone. You may want to try other albums by Martirio, but this her first one is pointless and a waste of your time and money.

The voice on it is LOUD, but clear. It only works when it feels like it, the walker just kinda sits there and wiggles a little like its stuck, but the floor is clean and flat (laminate flooring) and it STILL wont move! The rattle and cup and brush never did anything for us. In the end, I ended up taking the batteries back out and putting them in another toy. Donated this one, hopefully the kid who gets it wont mind how crummy it is.

She isn't good at working the accessories yet, but the ribbon clip is pretty good for her little fingers. It comes with three smaller clips which are very difficult for younger fingers to work. There is a magic wand or sceptre - but no crown which I was surprised about given they are all supposed to be princesses now. A lovely treasure chest with a pretty hardy hinge on it and a reasonably solid catch to close it. The string of pearls is a bit tacky, but nothing easy to choke on there. My only complaint is while the pony hair is just Beautiful - it tangles incredibly easy and is almost impossible to unknot. Overall this was my only complaint.

When you first play this CD one expects some really cool and exotic down-tempo kind of Jazzy lounge beats, but instead I got popy-bass lines that were totally of character for this kind of CD Title and music theme!! Please be smart and listen to more of the tracks on this CD on Amazon's music clips that they have before you buy this CD, because if you don't, you will be left with the feeling of getting screwed!!

The old layout of team info, with each team starting at the top of a page, has been junked, and the results are not pretty. Furthermore, this is now just a record book; the old \\"facts\\" sections, including a review of the preceding season and a preview of the new season, have disappeared.

D. Dun's Unity and Diversity in the New Testament. The chapter on Pauline Christianity and the Matthean Community is significantly important, for Sim argues that Matthew is anti-Pauline, thus Paul's Torah-free Christianity is anathema to the Matthean Community. Furthermore, Matthew's Gospel has a number of anti-Gentile statements, which Sim concludes is a result of the Matthean Community being surrounded by a hostel Gentile environment. Gentiles wanting to join the Matthean Community first had to convert to Judaism and then undergo Nazarene indoctrination and ritualism. In short, Sim argues that the Matthean Community is totally committed to Judaism as interpreted by Jesus from Nazareth.

Within the book a myriad of topics are touched on in a head-on thought provoking rush; love, anger, societal and family values towards women, wealth and privilege, motherhood, depression, redemption, despair. You are allowed fully into this character's life and are engaged completely. I was literally unable to put this book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"Some of this \\"sparse and elegant prose\\" was downright melodramatic at times. Lots of telling. Not much showing. I have to say though, I saw it through to the end because a momentum definitely built throughout - I knew \\"something\\" was going to happen so that kept me reading.

Backed up by bad support.It comes in the box with the Turtlebeach AudioTron (which is a GREAT product) and I've tried using it in each of four different incarnations. The latest version adds a bunch of flashy things, but the basic problem remains the same.The reason I give only 1 start is that the product crashes while playing songs and makes a LOUD screaching noise repetitively until you manage to kill the program. It does this on every machine I have tried it on (about 10 different types of hardware). Other programs, and the AudioTron, play the songs fine.It has done this in each and every PAID upgrade I have tried. Customer support has either told me it is my hardware or they ignore me completely.If they would fix it and give updates to their current customers I would re-consider my rating.

Preventing the recurrence of such a monster is paramount and is not served by examining what was not so monstrous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Richard Peck Winner!","review":"I am pretty much at the place where I just do not think this man is capable of writing a dud for young adults. This one is fascinating, not only because each story stands on its own as a small gem, but because of the invaluable insights he gives to the young person who wants to write. His accounts of how his stories and novels came to be, of how hard work and persistence paid off, just ring so true, and he has a voice that somehow makes a young adult want to listen--as attested by my own three children.He just keeps getting better all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but could have been better","review":"I've been a long-time fan of Miyazaki Hayao's movies, and also of Joe Hisaishi's accompanying music. All in all, the CD is great. My main critique is that the tracks are too short. The CD itself is only 40 minutes long. I had hoped that the music presented in the movie would be developed and expanded upon in the CD, but it was not. The CD is more like a collection of musical ideas. As good as the ideas were, I wish there was more of an effort to develop them fully. I suppose this problem is common with soundtracks, though. The one exception is the voice/pop arrangement of the main theme (track 14), which is the best track in the CD. Many of the ideas presented in the CD is blended in before settling on the main theme, and the singer has a clear voice that complements the hopeful innocence of the lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has a beginning and an ending ...","review":"Maybe it's because I am a fan of the more passionate novels than the \\"romantic\\" ones (or maybe I just like Medieval romances than Elizabethan romances), but this novel did not seem that at all interesting. Roselyn seemed too meek around the time she came face to face with the fiance she jilted (thirty years later!), and the fact that Spencer Thorton came to the wedding drunk made me lose interest in the hero. There didn't seem to be enough suspense or surprises. I am not knocking the book all together, but it just did not seem to capture much interest for me while something a little more, ahem, sensual like Samantha James' \\"Truest Heart\\" (where a ship crashes and the washed-ashore hero ends up being nursed back to health by the heroine).

The motives ascribed are amazingly bad, the murder itself makes no sense. Several plot threads dealing with the victim are completely ignored. The person who commits the murder may be the last person you suspect -- not because of any brilliant plotting but because the resolution makes so little sense.As a mystery, this book fails utterly. Characterization of the lead character and her boyfriend is OK, everyone else gets almost no characterization.

Everything seemed strange to me: the songs, that repeated electronics beating, doing all the songs seem like, and even the Gladys' voice (compressed, insecure...?). Then, I've heard it over and over again. Now I already can tell about my preferences on the CD: \\"Do you really want to know\\", \\"I said you lied\\"(where Gladys recalls \\"Neither One Of Us\\" in a musical phrase), \\"Love Hurts\\", \\"I wanna be loved\\"(where Jamie Foxx seems to shrink, frightend, before the goddess presence!), \\"Please help me I'm falling\\". The re-edited version of the powerful \\"End of the road medley, live\\" was unnecessary: who likes Gladys Knight has the obligation to have the amazing whole track at home and who that don't know her, won't feel the emotion provoked only for the entire track... But,at last, it's Gladys Knight! Let's hear and have fun! (But she is so different...!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"At Last: An Album Worth Listening To","review":"Ms. Knight has definitely satisfied my soul with her latest release. Being a young person at the age of 19, there is so much pressure to indulge in music that most youth listen to. This CD is awesome b/c it speaks about love in a true sense; its joys, pains, ups & downs. With this album, Ms. Knight proves that a true legend never fades; she just reinvents herself along the way to stay atop her game. I think the young girl groups out there now should take tips from greats like Ms. Knight b/c they definitely need some lessons about true class. Gladys has a great cover of \\"Grandma's Hands\\", and the duet w/ Jaime Foxx is incredible. The background vocalists accent her voice beautifully; this is just a great album. Buy it and you won't be let down. If you listen to the CD on CD-ROM, there's a special surprise :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"At Last, an album every woman can relate too!!","review":"At last, Gladys Knight has touched us with an album full of topics every woman can relate too. When I first listened to this album I couldn't get enough of it. My personal favorites are #2-#7 on the album; If I were your woman II,(modern sequel to her big hit w/ the pips created by Exec producer Lamont Brown & written by Gary Brown), I said you lied, Grandma's hands, Love hurts (great song written by Babyface), and I wanna be loved (duet with Jamie Foxx).

As a group, they never missed. As a solo artist, Gladys seems to have trouble finding decent material to record. Most of the songs on this CD, with the exception of \\"If I Were Your Woman Pt. 2\\", are pretty boring and Gladys' performance is very lackluster on most of the cuts. No wonder it took 7 years for MCA to release an album on her. I'm sorry. Gladys just doesn't have \\"it\\" anymore. Maybe it's time to retire?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great multi-purpose sounds!","review":"I love this CD. It is a cross between new age and techno.

But nothing could prepare her for this unforgiving, unpredictable land, filled with dangerous Grizzlies, earthquakes, and brutal winters. Don's brusque prospecting partner (Graham Greene) claims it's a place for hunting gold - not for raising a family; and Martha doubts that she can rebuild her life in such a harsh, unrefined land. But when Don and Lloyd disappear in an accident, a pregnant and injured Martha is forced to find new strength to face seemingly insurmountable challenges - including delivering her own baby alone in the wilderness - if she is to survive and be reunited with her family.

It's not about how you use it, it's about on who it's used. If I use it on my younger daughter (age 5), it's fairly accurate; measuring mostly 98.6. If I use it on myself (age not divulged), it's always at least a degree too cool (97.4). If I use it on my older daughter (age 7), it's almost always about a degree too high (99.4). These results are almost without fail, and can be expected if I take all our temperatures one after another, in varying orders or at different times of the day.

Contrary to what another reviewer believes, we are capable in every other aspect of our lives; we do not have \\"an IQ of 60\\", so I believe the thermometer is what's lacking here, not our intelligence.I hate the thought of sticking a thermometer in my poor baby's mouth, ear, or anywhere else, so I was excited when someone gave me this as a shower gift.

We were so happy with it that we threw away our other thermometers, and bought it as gifts for other friends with kids. But it was inconsistent when we needed it - when my daughter had a fever.Apparently it becomes inconsistent with the slightest forehead moisture which of course happens with a fever. It did not register the correct temperature making it difficult to know what was happening with my daughter's fever.

Not really ideal.2) it can be hard to do the forehead swiping if your child has a lot of hair, if your child is at all squirmy or resistant, or if you're even the slightest bit uncoordinated, because you have to hold it flat against the skin and press a button the whole time. Often we get error readings and have to try again, which the squiry child hates even more.3) There's no backlight, so doing it in the dark is awkward.4) it beeps, with no option to turn it off, so if you're checking a sleeping child, better hope s/he is a deep sleeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Children Ill - I have enough to worry about","review":"Okay, so I am sleep-deprived, my one-year-old just got shots yesterday and my 6-year-old has a cold.

Consistently afterwards, we'd scan our child's forehead (who was old enough to not be squirmish), and a good percentage of the time, it would not give a reading (except \\"error\\") at all. We would have to scan over and over again, and then have no idea how valid the number was. We'd also try scanning behind the ear (which it said was another use) but that was always a completely different reading (usually 1.5 degrees difference or more) no matter how many times we scanned.I ended up returning mine and I'm going to invest in an ear thermometer... or just go back to the good old-fashioned thermometer that had been giving me accurate readings before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was hoping I'd love it","review":"Since there were great reviews and this thermometer was so pricey I figured it'd be great.

Fastest, most comfortable, and most accurate!","review":"I have four children ranging from age 4 to 10. If your child is ill, they often cannot breathe from their nose as it is congested.

If your child isn't feeling well, and/or has an ear ache, the last thing they want is something stuck in their ear. Not to mention that my son has ear canals that are like bottomless chasms. The ear ones have never worked in him. This one is by far the most accurate of any thermometer I have ever used. If I repeat it, the temperature reading is within a tenth of a degree. I do hold the button down, start at the center of the child's forehead and, still holding the button, drag it along the side of the child's face, behind the ear and let go of the button at the hairline behind the ear. This is just how the nurses at the doctors do it and I found this method works the best!

Does not give consistent temps. Basically worthless. A shame, I had high hopes for this thing... Turns out you're better off sticking a glass vial filled with poisonous mercury up your kids pooper, as I feared."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk...","review":"I'm pretty annoyed because I didn't realize it wasn't working right until now and I've had it a couple years. Thankfully, my family hasn't had any high fevers, so it really hasn't been needed. I most recently tried using it to chart my bbt, since it reads in .1 increments. I can't even get it to give the same reading twice. It's ridiculous. Do not buy, unless you like throwing your money away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate, waste of money","review":"7 out of 10 scans say \\"error\\" and the scans that do get a reading differ each time. 99.4, 98.6, 99.7... I've read the instructions a dozen times and know it's not a user error. Also a selling point for me was that it could be used while our baby is sleeping. It leaves red marks on his forehead and plastic is too hard and requires just enough pressure to wake him. So it can't be used while he is asleep. I thought we just had a lemon but my sister has the same one and has the same problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh it's ok..","review":"It works, randomly. I usually get a different reading every time and also the back never stays on. Would look into other ones before purchasing this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate - useless.","review":"Great concept, but it's not accurate. My daughter clearly has a fever. She is burning up, flushed cheeks, clammy. The thermometer first said 94.6. Then it said 100.3. Then it said 95.2. Then it said 97.3. And then it said 96.5. That's a huge range of temps. I cannot rely on this thermometer and would urge you to find another brand. This is useless and has since been returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"This product works exactly as it is supposed to. It takes about one second to register temperature. My wife works as a medical assistant and they use this exact product for their clients. I purchased this product mainly for use for our newborn and personal use. I would highly reccomend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent product","review":"Excelent product, this is my second Thermometer, I recomend it!. The first one got damaged because it fall tothe floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very accurate and easy to use","review":"We purchased this product in anticipation of our newborn and wanting to have an accurate way to measure temperature non-invasively. This product is quite accurate, as another review mentioned it is important to read the instructions and follow them. While its not \\"rocket science\\" it does take some technique to accurately establish the true temperature. This consists of starting with the device pressed against the forehead, depressing the button and sweeping towards the temple. release the button at the temple and check the temp. Do this 3 times and take the highest temp as this will be the most accurate one. The variation is not an indication of accuracy of the device but of the anatomy scanned. This is a great device, easy to use and great for peace of mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well","review":"I really like this thermometer. It works great and is easy to use. I follow the recommendation of taking a temp 2-3 times to average out the readings. They are never too far off...maybe .1 or .2 off. I don't have anything bad to say about it. I wish it didn't beep until it was done with the reading or something, but it doesn't bother me and doesn't make me wish I didn't buy it. It is far easier than using the ear or mouth thermometers. My Drs office uses thermometers like this (more advanced model) so if it is good enough for them, it is good enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practice pays","review":"As other reviewers have noted:1) take the cap off the tip of the sensor2) Read the instructions - the swipe across the forehead is very specific and requires practice3) Depress the button only when you are swiping otherwise you'll average in readings of room temperatureThis is the only thermometer that has measured my body temperature close to 98.6 degrees. The other home thermometers were always off by at least one degree.And for the finale,depress the button in the air and it works really well as a spare room thermometer too : )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to use but found it not to be accurate","review":"I read and followed the directions on using this thermometer and even though my son very clearly has a fever, it is still reading normal! The thermometer is easy to use and he tolerates it with no problem. I would do a swipe across his (unmoist) forehead and repeat several separate times and I always would get a different reading and none are accurate so I followed teh directions to use it behind his ear and still nothing. I went back to taking it rectally until I find something reliable. I don't understand! I am obviously in minority here bc it got great reviews from a lot of people... it just doesn't work right for him/us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thermometer yet","review":"When the kids were infants, we had the in-ear thermometer. Great at the time, but after several years of use it finally died. Kids were older and I didn't want to invest in another in-ear thermometer, so I went with a cheap digital readout oral thermometer. I went through about four of them, each one a bigger piece of junk than the next. I decided to suck it up and get another good one. After a little research, I took a chance on this one. Wow, am I happy I did! It is the easiest, most reliable thermometer I've ever owned, including the in-ear. So easy (after a few practice runs) that my kids can take their own temps now. Don't be worried by the reviewers who can't figure it out...it's very simple to use. Read the directions and practice it a few times. It's amazing!It's also ten dollars cheaper at amazon compared to my local Walgreens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than thermometer","review":"We found this to be a great product, it is better than a mouth thermometer in our opinion. Easy to use, quick. It would be nice if it beeped louder, but hey, the hearing is going with everything else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exergen temporal thermometer from Amazon","review":"We are using the Exergen temporal thermometers in our church children's ministries. Since we have over 700 children each Sunday, we need a thermometer that is quick, efficient, and safe to use in case of a flu pandemic. At this time, we use them (we purchased two)to check the temps of little ones we suspect of being ill. In the case of a pandemic, we would check the temp of each child entering our programming to help insure the safety of others. Because we can disinfect these thermometers quickly and don't have to buy extra parts (as in as ear thermometers), we are very pleased. They are accurate enough for our needs. These thermometers are a good value and delivery was timely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally INACCURATE","review":"Showed a temp 98.6 as per this thermometer.. Went to the doctor and it was 102. Not reliable. I followed all steps/tips etc etc..This has happened several times. This is out of our lives now!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This item is GARBAGE!","review":"This is the worst item we have ever bought for our children. It doesn't ever want to take the temperture of the children like its suppose to. In fact 98% of the time it will come up with an error reading and if you are lucky enough to actually get a temperture out of the stinking product...you might what to check it again. Why you ask? Because it always gives a different reading a second time around. Your child's temp could be 100.2 the first time and 104.2 a second later. Always, always, always take the temp. twice because we found out the hard way and my son's severe asthma problems adds to the importance of getting an accurate temp. reading. Normally the higher the temp. the worse his asthma gets that's why he always has to been seen by the doctor right away at the first signs of a cold. I would NEVER buy or recommend this product to anyone....NOT even my worst enemy...lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!!! AWFUL!!!!","review":"Avoid this thing like the plague. As many others have said, the readings are all over the place, and can't be trusted. Thre readings will go from 97.1 to 100.2 in a flash. The margin of error is completely unacceptable. Your child could have a fever of 100.2, and you won't even know it because this thermometer is a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"We got this thermometer at our baby shower and I was excited, because I read it was the absolute best. Uninvasive. Quick. Accurate. Perfect, right? WRONG!!!! This thing is Terrible! Every time I check my own temperature it tells me I have a fever--when I verify it with a normal--under the tongue--thermometer I'm always 98.6 on the nose. I'm not sick. My baby's not sick. But to this thing we're always running a temp. It's unreliable and unsafe--causing you to think your baby is feverish when in actuality he is perfectly fine. So you end up thinking your baby has a temp and you give him unneeded medicine!!! That's just wrong, this thing should be taken off the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't turn on. Seems cheaply made.","review":"I just got this in the mail today. I put the battery in, correctly. Nothing happens. No LCD display, no light, nada.

Yes.Is it a good/cool idea?.... Yes.Is is worth anything?.... No.And here's why: the thermometer is absolutely and completely inconsistent. My wife and I purchased a unit, and then sat down on our couch, after carefully reading the instructions AND all of the anecdotal internet advise, could not get reliable readings from this instrument. At our most careful, we could only get readings at +/- 2 degrees, and most of the time we would receive +/- 5 degrees. We weren't testing the product on squirrely children or complaining infants: we were testing it on ourselves and on eachother. In the end, we returned the product for a refund.My advice is to stay far far away from this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this","review":"I bought this and I am telling you it is a waste of money, do not buy it. It does not give an accurate reading. I took my daughter to the doctor along with this and asked them about it, they told me, it's useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Joke!","review":"I bought this thinking it would be less-invasive to take temperature with. It is however the accuracy is nothing short of a joke. In fact, one would have better luck going to an amusement park and having people guess their temperature, from 98 to 102, to win a stuffed animal then this piece of junk.Appaarently, the \\"inventor\\" of this garbage went to Harvard so I'm sure he compensated one of his friends there to give him a testimonial to put on the box. Even if one looks at the box it looks like something one would buy on an informerical or something that says \\"As seen on TV.\\"I took my temperature three different times with it within a one minute period and each time the temperature was different--mind you the temperature was taken in exactly the same area on my head each time. Frankly, this thing is about as stable as the leaning tower of Pisa. Either get an oral thermometer or a Braun, but don't waste your money on this piece of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work and gives inaccurate readings.","review":"Okay, I bought it thinking it's easy to measure, especially for infants. My baby was sick and we measured temperature using this at multiple times during the course of 1-2 days and it never showed above 98-99 degrees (i.e. normal body temperature for babies). The following day baby was really sick and we took her to a hospital nearby and baby had really high fever (over 102). Even on that day this thermometer showed around 98-99. The doctor and nurse there said the readings on these things (scanners) are never accurate. They recommended the in-ear thermometer and ended up getting one from CVS. It's a pain to take readings using those but so far we've found them reliable.Reading other reviews here shows that this deviation can be either way, higher or lower.

Recently he had a seizure and we checked his temperature using this thermometer and it showed to be normal. I panicked because my child doesn't have these seizures without a fever involved. I double checked with a rectal thermometer and it showed to be a WHOPPING 5 degrees higher confirming that my son did indeed have a fever. His body was burning up and I am so shocked that this thermometer didn't show his true temperature. I was always suspicious because it always seemed to vary and now I know my suspicions were correct.

Very easy to use and accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very frustrating - highly inconsistent results","review":"I wish there was an easy way to consistently and accurately measure a repeatable body temperature, but the old methods seem best. This one is fantastic to play with, a joy to use and read... until you do it more than once in a row and find you could do better by just guessing. Everyone in our family measures between 96.8 and 97.8 degrees when not ill, but if you take 3 or 4 readings in a row, you'll find at least one 96.<low> outlier in there - so *mine* always reads about a degree low, and has a +/-1 degree swing for any single measurement. I've read all the instructions, cleaned it, replaced batteries, even invented new techniques to try to minimize the inconsistencies but nothing really works. I'm just talking about measuring the temp when not sick, not sweating, just to get a baseline. I can never trust it and usually wind up measuring about 20 times and mentally guessing the average to report to the doc when calling in. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never an accurate reading","review":"I thought this would be a really easy thermometer. But boy was I wrong.

No. Not buying it. The inconsistencies have only gotten worse as I've used the unit, despite hours of rereading the manual and looking up online what I'm doing wrong. At one point, it said my infant daughter's temperature was 103 and I rushed her to the doctor to find that her temperature (without medication) was really only 100.Don't waste your money on this one, but if you find one that's better than this ... please let me know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Right On Target","review":"This replaced my Braum Ear ThermoScan.

She does not object to this thermometer at all; it doesn't appear to be sensitive to the room temperature (the Moby ear and forehead thermometer needs to be in a room for 20 mins to become accustomed to the surrounding temperature before you can use it); it isn't pokey or otherwise unsafe around a little kid.

I can see that happening, and I understand that it would be hard to get a job with a baby to support and no H.S. degree, but what I am trying to figure out, is how all of these people found out that Lacey had never been married. I personally don't know anyone these days that thinks (if they do, they keep it to theirselves) much about a child born with out a father.

On the other hand, the plot mechanism of the pregnant teen in two generations was interesting and rather unusual (perhaps because it is no longer considered such a shame??). I liked the secondary romance of the heroine's daughter better than the mother's...and the boyfriend was more sympathetic than the hero.

His discourse on this subject awakened in the minds of the reader the reason for black stagnation.

This book's great if you want to impress your assimilating friends or right wing wannabes.Also in the C-Span interview I noticed Mr.McWorther's negative comments about his parents showed the lack self esteem which happens to be reflected in his writings.

Too often, criticism in the black community falls into two categories: high brow intellectual scepticism that looks down with shame on anyone who is not \\"deep\\" (read: cynical) or \\"keeping it real\\" attitudes which are sceptical of individualism.My onnly criticism would be some doubts I have on your understanding of economics.

Transfers are lightning fast over USB2 and I can sync well over 500MB of data in less than 30 seconds. Good enough for me.I have *not* used the software provided on the disk since it doesn't work on a Mac, but the one time I attached it to a PC Windows offered to start up the included application that (as I understand it) allows you to generate a portable profile for use on any PC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality.","review":"I have come to expect quite a bit more in terms of quality from Lexar. The concept is very cool, no cap to lose and the metal is highly resilient, the motion was good, etc... However, within 6 months of day to day use the connector failed and I was unable to transfer data without holding the unit in a very precarious position. Luckily i was able to get all my important data off before it finally gave up the ghost.I have since purchased a new drive, which will hopefully hold up better. Be forewarned this item works out of the box and is solid, but based on my experience I wouldn't trust it with anything important, because mine failed in less than 6 months of moderate use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avoiding Legal Issues through Creative Work","review":"Book provides a good visual representation of what makes a powerful logo and exhibits the areas of importance to keep in mind when designing your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great everyday earring!","review":"I am always loosing earrings, so I have decided to only buy Lever Back earrings from now on.

Whether she knows it or not, Ms. Carswell has attained spiritual greatness, although the book does not seem to be written to that end. The love she has for her mother and the empathy she holds for the orphans are the true essence of its beauty.Reminiscent of the style in which Harper Lee wrote To Kill a Mockingbird, the author so poignantly captures the voice of a child trying to make sense of the sadness which is her backyard; while at the same time she interjects bouts of comic relief that can only come from pure childhood innocence. As she ages in the book her voice does also. It is brilliantly done.I highly recommend this book. You will cry. You will laugh out loud. And, because Ms. Carswell reveals her heart so openly, you will love."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless, don't waste your money","review":"There's nothing in this book that you can't get off the internet.

All the feelings we have for our daughter, all the turmoil and work it took to get her home, a flood of emotions came over each of us as we shared that special first reading with her, snuggled in our arms. We knew she was finally where she was meant to be...home. This book perfectly put into words all the things we did not know how to tell her.When we read it now the emotional flood still comes forth, but the tidewaters are not as strong. The memories of how she came into our lives come back into view and we once again realize how truly blessed we are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somnolentic stuff","review":"I tried to read this to my brother's son, but both of us soon became bored and fell asleep.

The book is so calming and life-affirming, I had to buy it for a friend whose son was turning 3. The rhyme is smooth and rhythmic, and the message is solid. This book shares the kind of message that, as a father, I want my children to hear, and it also reminds me of the kind of father I strive to become.I recommend this book for those who want to fill their child's heart with a message of love and affirmation, and for those who want a good picture of what it means to enjoy your child.It doesn't hurt that this book communicates a message of love and acceptance that really reminds me of God as a loving Father."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book","review":"This is such a beautiful book.

I feel that many children's stories are too banal and simplistically written. This book is endearing, moving, thought-provoking, and explores interesting concepts of English (simile and rhyming.) But most importantly, it is a wonderfully loving and humorous book that is so true to life. It is certainly not \\"corny\\" and I am willing to bet that it will become a classic children's story despite the off-the-mark review. This is one book that I feel is well worth every penny and I am sure will be enjoyed in my house frequently."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sweetest!","review":"The first time I read this book I cried in the middle of the book store.

Such a wonderful way to put our thoughts into children's language in a unique and innocent manner.

It's a movie you can watch again and again and love it just as much the third time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasing, funny love comedy","review":"Steel Magnolias was the first one that I saw among Sally Field's movies, and I tend to backtrack her from there. It was interesting to see totally different her in Surrender, but her fundemental characters and actings are still there. One night, I turned on TV and I saw her. Since I rarely watch TV, I could have turned off after a moment if I hadn't seen her. And I kept watching. And I kept watching even though I was tired, and despite all the long commercials. It was not because of Sally Field. It was because the story line was pretty good. Not only it was charming, funny, and pleasing, but also it made me curious of what's going to happen. I ended up watching till the end and slept at 3:00 am, enduring all the commercials. This rarely happened in my life. As a Sally Field fan, I would like to give 5 stars, but to be fair, I would give 4 stars for this movie. Any love commedy fans should like this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow shipping","review":"This item took almost a month to get to me, and just to charge my credit card, they took longer then they should, and I got charged NSF fees, for a few $'s and slow shipping.Very unhappy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mis-leading","review":"This was a disappointment to hear.

I remember being enthralled by it as a teenager; as an adult, I enjoyed re-reading it, but I wouldn't say I was quite as enthralled the second time around.As history books go, Flying Forts is the equivalent of a good beach read, and that's not a bad thing. It's a fun, easy read (with its share of pot-boiler prose, I have to say). You'll need to look elsewhere for a strategic analysis of the Allied bombing campaigns and their effectiveness.

N. Elrod delivers a very well-crafted sequel to the already classic I, Strahd that doesn't take the story out of Strahd's hand but just lends it a little to his foe Azalin. Both characters are round and well developed. I enjoyed the book very much, waiting was worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A captivating tale of the animosity between two undead Lords","review":"This was only my third Ravenloft novel, and it was far and away the best. Strahd and his mortal enemy Azalin are both terrific characters. Perhaps the most captivating part of PN Elrod's latest effort is the exploration of the mysterious new lands. I recomend this to anyone in the mood for an interesting, quick read(But read I, Strahd part 1 first). Let me also say that I've never participated in any Dungeons and Dragons game either, and I still found I, Strahd: The War Against Azalin very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Azalin IS more powerful then in the book","review":"After reading 'the Lord of Necropolis', where Azalin was presented as 'virtualy omnipotent', I am a bit disappointed with this one. At the beginning of the book he is superior to Strahd and can deal with everything in Barovia; after he teaches Strahd scraps of his magic it seems that not Strahd becomes more powerful, but Azalin loses his power: a band of goblyns can chase him like he was a rabbit, and he actually runs! There are more examples, he doesn't know a simple travel spell and must ride a horse, and so on. The author seems to put too much of her affection to Strahd, and I put mine to Azalin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome but not enough and too much","review":"Great book. Azailin and Strahd booth are excellent characters especially in the same book but the title of the book disapinted me. The war didnt' really happen untill the last 50 pgs of the book.

I'm an environmentalist and will recycle it all for years to come.Also, I hadn't realized that I was purchasing the 1 ounce bottle for the price. I thought it was the next larger size up. I felt cheated. My husband paid $27 online for the larger size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious...","review":"Rush is not a fragrance for the weak of heart.. It's deep, sultry, really sensual.. VERY sexy. Besides the gorgeous scent, the packaging is a little different, but very smart.. I can't tell you how many times I've dropped perfumes to have them shatter.. It's a pain to clean up the glass AND the smell.. yikes. Rush's plasic box is very efficient, and a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devine fragrance ;-)","review":"This is one of the most beautiful perfumes around. It's so unique and unusual but yet devine and sensual. It's a good fragrance for any season so it won't go horrible in excessive hot weather. The packaging is cute and simple. It's a red rectangular plastic bottle and it's a good size and shape for handbags.Even now that it's been around for 5 or so years, I still get comments on it. It's a good fragrance that isn't too strong but does last. It's hard to describe, but the closest way is sort of a soft musky fruity smell. If I put it on in the morning, I can still smell it later in the day and for me that is the strongest selling point. It's beautiful and classy and you should check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gucci Rush","review":"This is one of the best perfumes that has ever been made.It is undeniably sexy.

And what's important once you apply it, it will last all day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy.","review":"I have been using Gucci Rush 2 for over 11 years now, it is my Spring/Summer scent.

The sheer energy of the author as well as his main protagonist are remarkable. It made me at least chuckle out loud all the way through.This book also contains a healthy dose of prejudices.

You easily imagine Barger substituting for the protagonist in any of the scenes described.Don't expect intricate plot lines, twists, literary allusions, or gratuitous love scenes. It's straight-at-you action from start to finish.You don't like motorcycles? Don't understand the 1%'er view of brotherhood? Don't bother.Barger has written a very enjoyable and predictable novel. Given the fact that a movie is being made, as we read, the book often seems to be a screen play.None of this should take away from the fact that I found the characters well developed enough to want to read a sequel.But then I've been a biker for 45 years.Respects, Jenkx"},{"rating":"2","title":"Action packed front start to finish","review":"To sum up this book, I found it spellbinding.

It involves every half-baked idea presented in the biker movies from the 1960s and 1970s and ties them into this dumb book.

It seemed as though the author herself did not like any of the characters. Readers never get to know any of them fully nor have reason to \\"root for\\" any one of them. Likable characters become more despicable as the story progresses and previously contemptible characters fade from the story (with one notable exception).

And that ruined my goal of finishing every book I started. What a bummer because it made me hesitant to try new books in case I couldn't finish them like this one. Then what really made me mad is that I read that this writer had received several awards!! I just can't understand this at all.

The first chapter - about the disappearance of the baby - was quite good, but thereafter it just dragged on without moving forward. I stuck with it thinking it would get better but it just didn't. It was told from different viewpoints, and the side from the cops was completely a waste of time.

I had read another Lippman book that I thought was good, so was expecting more from this one. It was painstakingly long. She seems to want to give absurdly long back stories, side stories, adjacent stories, before ever moving the plot along. I read on a Kindle so I can't say what page I was on, but it was not until the last 5% of the book that things finally started moving along. I would say about at least 3/4 of the book wasn't needed. She attempted to try to lead you down one path so you would be shocked when she revealed the \\"true\\" perpetrator. And I guess I sort of was, but then everything she said to trick you seemed pointless. She attempts to wrap that up in a scene at a cemetery, but it just left me thinking \\"What? That's it? What was the point of that?\\". I wouldn't recommend this book. It's not worth the time you could be spending reading something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could see it coming","review":"I could see something wrong with the setup from the start of the novel so maybe that soured it a bit for me. There were a few twists with the Mom, but Alice was too good. Some good twists at the end, but the storyline wasn't that interesting to me with the racist thing going on, in your face, spelling out who's this color, who's that color, who's mixed, defining everyone rich, poor, shoving them into a socioeconomic class as if that makes the book more interesting. For me, it didn't. I was so disappointed because this author's mysteries were highly recommended. If I hadn't been in the emergency room waiting for someone and with nothing to do but read, I am not certain I'd have finished EVERY SECRET THING at all. But I am glad I did, just not delighted with the journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warped childhood","review":"This is the second book I've read of Lippmann's that has children as primary protagonists. She is brilliant at getting inside the head of young people and still making the story revolve around very adult issues. there is a suspense that doesn't rely on constant action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Secret Thing","review":"I found Every Secret Thing to be pretty fascinating. It was one of those novels that I found myself hurrying through daily tasks to read. The topic is dark, so I was a little concerned it would be too much for me to handle. Laura Lippmann, however, handled it deftly and with tact. The only real complaint I have is that I felt the ending was a bit rushed. I would have liked Ronnie and Alice's relationship to have been delved into deeper. I walked away with several questions, but that's not always a bad thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Secret Thing","review":"Didn't really go deep enough for me.There were also several instances where you thought the story was going to go one way, but it took a different direction ... for the worse.However, it was entertaining enough in its own way - its fault is that it could have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Lippman fan","review":"I usually love Lippman's books but have to say that I was disappointed Every Secret Thing.

I wanted high quality for driving, these Serengeti's fit the bill. They are polarized, so no hot reflections, top up or down. The fit is perfect. They were shipped right away, and came with a hard carrying case so they'll stay in terrific shape. I would shop and buy again from this partner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"I have read other works by Graham Masterton, and I found him to be a very good horror writer. In his latest work, The House That Jack Built, it starts out a bit slow at first, but picks up the pace. The setting in New Orleans is what really made me pick up this book since I have read other horror stories by Anne Rice and Poppy Z. Brite that took place in the same area. It was a good ghost story and I found myself finishing it in what seemed to be a day and half. It isn't the greatest book of horror that I have read so far, but it was enjoyable and I think it was worth my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's only a matter of time","review":"Masterton, is one of the great storytellers of horror. He writes America better than Americans. In fact I found my self confused by the Brittish syntax of the text. Anyhow, the finer points of this novel are origin of the haunting and atmosphere. I found the house especially scary in that it was in disrepair and not quite livable. If you've ever been dragged to the country to a house supposedly haunted, it was likely in this state. The emptiness and openness of it without the comforts of home make the people that much more vulnerable. The origin of the hauntings I'll let you read for yourself. The only thing I'll say is that it has to do with the overlapping of time. Great read all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his best","review":"Masterton has written a *lot* of books, of which I've read a few. Of those, I'd have to place this one somewhere in the middle.It starts out great, builds on some interesting ideas about the flexibility of time, if you use the right kind of architecture, and keeps your attention and continues to be creepy for about 3/4 of the way. Then it seems like Masterton gets lazy and relies on some horror cliches that will make anyone who has seen a few horror films groan. One of the characters even thinks to himself that the situation he's in is like the film \\"Don't Look Now\\". The characters do things like walk around a spooky house separately when they know it's dangerous. That's like a joke out of the first \\"Scream\\" movie! And there are scenes that will remind readers too much of \\"The Shining\\".Because this book started out so well, I can rate it higher than Masterton's \\"Basilisk\\", but it comes nowhere near the level of \\"The Hell Candidate\\" and \\"House of Bones\\", both of which I recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too unpleasant","review":"I enjoy a good ghost story, and there are so few around. I hoped this would satisfy but I didn't even finish it. It's needlessly gory and filled with unpleasant images (starting right off with the hammer and testicle bit) that don't really seem necessary. Someone said Masterson is as good as the best Stephen King, which to me is not a good thing. I still have bad memories of the \\"puppy-in-the-refrigerator\\" episode from \\"It,\\" which was just for shock value and turned me off King for good. Won't bother with Masterson's books any more, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"an unusually different horror story","review":"Not your typical haunted house novel. A story I found hard to put down.

This album is mixed from a few different composers. Giacchino is better known, but I don't think the Fringe pilot score he did is particularly impressive, and it took a while after the pilot for the show to find its voice, musically and otherwise. There are a lot of really atonal action tracks on this disc, and I don't much enjoy listening to it (and haven't in a while). There has been some beautiful thematic music written for Fringe, but I'd check out the later seasons first, which have more focused and better music.

The book it self is the best evidence for the lack of a scientific - and hence ethical - basis for this kind of work, and it's obvious after reading this book that most of the authors just stubbornly clung to the idea that their education, credentials and clinical intuition give them priviliged access to the minds and motivations of others. This book should be - critically - read by every lawyer and judge dealing with custody cases to prevent more havock these \\"emperors without clothes\\" are wrecking in the lives of thousands of lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 2 days","review":"Not sure what went wrong but just stopped working after 2 days.

The only differences are a fake scope, a second handle and a trigger mechanism so you don't have to keep the string held back when waiting for a target.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice tale - just little science","review":"As there already are quite a number of reviews, I will be brief. From my vantage point (as a philosopher of science), Bloom spins an entertaining socio-biological yarn, and 'backs it up' with evidence that could just as well provide a basis to justify a wide array of other hypotheses. There is little in his framework that provides for falsifiability, a hallmark of serious scientific inquiry. Furthermore, the large amount of factual mistakes, false similes and sometimes mind-boggling use of pop-culture (as already pointed out in another review) do not help to enhance the author's credibility on the points that matter. In my personal opinion, a poor contribution to science."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"This describes itself as \\"How the Science of Child Development Explains What Makes Us Human\\" and there are a few cute little anecdotes about child development. But these are interspersed among long rambling philosophical discussions about what art critics and artists think is art and what philosophers, rabbis and the bible think is morality. It is like a little, anecdotal scientific information filled out with whatever else he can think of that is vaguely related. Read Stephen Pinker or Robert Wright instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philosophic Leanings","review":"Although the author does discuss Descartes, and the author is brilliant, I have to say that, again, as with most books on philosophic studies and opinions, this presentation lacks the structural detail that a student might use to an advantage.

Just, eh, brillant man, but who cares when Descartes is so limited in personal and creative consciousness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the real thing","review":"This book is not based on too many facts.

The keyboard is very light with a very small footprint. The keys have a decent feel and there is a full numeric keypad too. To be honest I don't see the point of the 3 power buttons being available on the keyboard - just how much effort is it to use the on-screen power options? Nevertheless they worked well enough when attached to my laptop running Win7.Overall a good buy as a cost-effective USB keyboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious design flaw","review":"Working on this keyboard was unbelievably annoying - they actually put a shutdown key just below the \\"delete\\" button.

Still, the lack of quality control is frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Design Flaw: Power Button by the Arrow Keys","review":"The keyboard is cheap--I bought it to be my abuse keyboard so I don't mess up my nice one when I get angry or play button-mashing video games. Everything is about what you would expect from a cheap keyboard, but someone at GE had the brilliant idea of putting power, suspend, and sleep right above the arrow keys. If your fingers slip or are misplaced, the results can have consequences. Essentially, these three extra buttons have caused me more trouble than the keyboard was worth. It's seldom that you find a product ruined by an added feature, but that's exactly what this is. If it weren't for those stupid keys and all games they're ruined and unsaved documents I've lost, this keyboard would be a worthwhile way to spend ten bucks.

This was my first book by Linda Francis Lee, I have a habit of looking at a book and deciding if I want to read it or if I will wait until the next time I usually end up waiting, then kick myself for waiting so long, it happen to me with this book, I loved it so much I did not want it to end, I loved all the characters. I loved Vivi she is trying to prove that she is not this spoil princess that everyone think she is, she even wants to prove it to Max. I just feel in love with Max and his little sister Lila, Nicki, was another story all she wanted was her brothers love and attention and when she didn't get it she would act out and Vivi had to be the to patch things up with Max and the rest of his sister that part I loved, this book was so funny and then it had you feeling sad for them, I caught myself cheering for this family to have a happy ending, this book is another keeper for me :)Happy Reading Lisa"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wedding Diaries","review":"I really thought this was a dumb book. The plot wasn't too bad and the characters were well defined. I like romance and sex as well as anyone, butI really got tired of it and the whole absurd idea that they had every kind of sex imaginable, except for penetration. The sex scenes took over the book and became boring. This book reads like a Harlequin Romance and is about as interesting.

I thought it would help to put their minds at ease a little. Instead, we found that there was NEVER an alert (even through last year's hurricanes). Since the manual was a little tricky, I decided to e-mail the wonderful folks at Oregon Scientific to ask for assistance. Apparently they can't be bothered to respond to customers once they have money in pocket. Now, I realize that customer service is not what it once was, but I found this to be deplorable. I do not recommend this product to ANYONE, and more importantly, I will NEVER buy anything from Oregon Scientific again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after first power outage","review":"Not intuitive, have to use the book to figure out how to set it. It worked for the weekly test fine for several months and then stopped working.

It's supposed to have a feature called \\"non-volatile memmory back up.\\" When the first storm that came through after purchase, I was excited to see it work. It got the NWS alert signal, turned itself on, and broadcast the alert. OK its working just fine, I thought. Then came the first nearby lightning strike. Instantly the radio lost all power and memory, including the NOAA channel and county codes. No other appliances in my home were affected. I called Oregon Scientific; customer service said that it was defective and should be replaced.Amazon did a great job handling the return and providing service. I received a replacement a few days later. I programmed the new one and used if for ten minutes. In the first ten minutes the Oregon Scientific radio lost all memory three times.

I bought this for a trip that I never took, but now that I have this fine product, I don't think I'd be without it. I recommend this as a reliable and necessary warning device in those areas subject to severe weather.Others have complained that the manual is hard to understand, and it is a bit. A slight bit of effort will get you through it, and you only have to set your local county once. If you can set a digital watch, you can do this. Additionally, when it was unplugged for a few seconds by mistake, it held the time and county information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work!","review":"I have never had this radio operate as stated.

OR, if they're not dead, just replace one at a time, as the power interruption is only a few seconds - not enough to clear the memory. Easy.It would be nice if it had three things -1) power plug would recharge the batteries2) a flat bottom so it'd stand on it's own when not in the stand3) ability to turn off or mute lower alarms.But all in all, it's a good little radio and a great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"worth a 0 star rating.

Not to mention that when they got down to the mystery, which had some definate possibilities in the beginning, it suddenly turned mid stream and suddenly I was lost.

The Song of Roland exists as one of the dominant and most influential pieces of the period, and should not be neglected by any student of the era. Plus, you have to love a hero that is such a beast in battle that his death is not a result of any fighting wounds, but rather just a mighty blast of his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much information","review":"A reviewer lauded the fact that this book let you get to know Susan McElroy better. Why would one want to? She is spiritually and professionally connected to animals, yet eats them and gives them away when they become inconvenient details in her search for whatever it is that she is searching for. She moves from places she loves to find some more comforting, but elusive home ground. She gently dumps her husband and vows to remain a solitary womanspirit, only to have a new lover within three months. And who wants to read all their \\"soul mate\\" emails during their typically giddy courtship period.

Also, it's never made clear what awakened awareness is and how it differs from unawakened awareness, or how we go about getting awakened awareness. Clarity on this point should have been a minimum requirement, I would've thought! Also, why are there 7 qualities of awakened awareness? Why not 8, 9 or 10? The designation 7 seems to be purely arbitrary.

Ayler and Co. hold nothing back, playing as if their very lives depended on it. The presence of only three musicians provide for ample amount of space, so while it's most definitely an intense recording, it isn't as suffocating as Coltrane's \\"Ascention\\". But don't let that fool you for a second. If you're not familiar with free or avant-garde-or whatever the hell you want to call it-jazz, you will loathe this with every last fiber of your being. But if you're a curious soul cutting your teeth on Ornette Coleman and Eric Dolphy and you're willing to take the plunge, go for it. You may never look back.Also recommended:Interstellar Space~John ColtraneRepent~Charles Gayle"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book but Could have been written Better...............","review":"-Ok.

I cant say you will become Psychic in a Day or Week. After all Psychic powers are god given gift.

Anna Reid would be explaining something about the particular tribe and the next thing I know she's describing what was happening to her at the moment.I am an avid reader of Russian history and knew about the places and events she described but I know now after reading the book no more about Shaman than before I read her treatise.Her travels were so interesting and the places and people she wrote about are so unique that the book is entralling however, she did not focus on Shaman. She did not focus on the culture of the indigenous peoples nor her reaction to them. I felt sad at the end of the book for leaving that part of the world with very little more knowledge than I had before reading about these obscure peoples living in Siberia."},{"rating":"2","title":"This flavor I LOVE best -of them all!!! :)","review":"I've tasted all the flavors they have, but the strawberry was my fav for sure! :) I like to mix it with soy milk in the mornings, but water suits me best for lunch or dinner.

I say attempting because I was not able to finish it. After chapter 6, I was already bored with it and I found myself doing what I usually do when I have lost interest in a book and that is I started skimming it. I was disgusted with the constant bickering and juvenile behavior of the sisters, Uncle Thomas' speech patterns, the constant crying and the general lack of plot development. It was clearly one of the worst books ever. I didn't care about any of the characters and had no interest in the ending. How can a person leave that much money to that many people?

Even though I never lost anyone that close to me, it made me feel that this is what people really go through when they lose a love one, especially one they hold a torch for.I took a star off for Ms. Parry's reference to people acting like they were raised in the projects. Which way is that, I would like to know? I was raised in the projects and was raised very well.

I tend to work out of Jazz/Bop books (Art of Bop, Jazz Mesages, Beyond Bob, etc.), Technique books, Funk Books (Code of Funk, Funk Drumming by Mike Clark), or work on latin/world grooves- I find this book covers everything I love about practicing from each of those types of books (if that makes sense).

Fortunately, they don't pretend to be beginner's books, as this mess did.Overall, a pretty poor book, really messed-up packaging/marketing. Turned me off of Sams' books for a while, at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"After reading the book Ihave found several great uses for it","review":"1. As a doorstop.2. Great for scrap paper3.

It went in and was up and running with little or no problems. Just got done watching my first full-length film on it (Training Day) as a tester, and no glitches.The Picture is clean and the sound is incredible. I plan on making this my dvd player for my home theater once I plug the s-video cable into my 31\\" tv. I am happily surprised that it works this well for what I paid for it.The installation instructions can throw you a bit if you're not familiar with installing cd-rom drives (like I was). If this is a secondary drive, make sure you set the jumper on your original drive to \\"master\\", and the jumper on this dvd drive to \\"slave\\". I did it this way just because my original cd-rw drive came with my computer and just kept it the primary drive.Other than that, it's a good all around DVD player. For the price..you can't go wrong.

But not that good. It takes good pictures some of the time, but alot of the time you have to go back and take pictures over because the quality isnt what you would expect. Not enough zoom. Eats up batteries like you wouldnt believe!! I would suggest adding a little bit of money and getting a better camera. Fujifilm is not the best brand to go with. I have this camera and are currently trying to sell it. The very thin 5MP sony cybershot camera is what I am aiming to buy. It's has amazing quality pictures, but it is not cheap. It is by far better than the Fujifilm!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value for money","review":"For less than $170 (July '02) this camera is a solid performer at a sensible price. Normal resolution is more than adequate for the web and e-mail. Fine resolution results in quality good enough for at least 4*6\\" prints at your local Kits Cameras or similar.The non-audio 20 seconds of video is a bonus IMO.With WindowsXP (Home or Pro) on your PC you'll find this camera very easy to use, it is very straightforward to publish pictures to the web or automatically shrink and e-mail them instead.Only 2 downsides that I've found;1. The appears to be a tendency for dust to creep into the LCD disply area. Cosmetic only.2. Battery life w/ LCD use is relatively low. So, don't use the LCD for every photo or get the latest rechargeable AA batteries.I strongly recommend this camera for those seeking excellent value for money."},{"rating":"1","title":"EATS UP YOUR BATTERIES","review":"While the quality of the pictures and the features of this camera are great, as other reviewers have mentioned, it eats up batteries like nothing I've ever seen before. I take about 6 pictures using the display and I have no battery left! Then, the moment you hook it up to your computer, it uses up the entire the battery. I called FUJI and they said \\"Sorry, that's just how it is.\\" (Also, the software included is very poorly designed.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little point and shoot","review":"I have enjoyed this camera even though it goes through batteries the way a film camera goes through film!!!(if not worse). I really like the webcam ability. It is a great camera for those everyday point and shoot scenarios. The resolution is perfect for web and online sharing of photos. Recommend that you buy the largest storage card you can afford. This makes those long trips easier since you don't have to clear off the memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice enough starter digital camera","review":"This was the first digital camera I got, and it is a great starter camera for someone switching over from analog film cameras to digital, especially considering the price. It is simple, easy to use, and takes reasonably good pictures, again, considering the low price. For basic needs it is pretty good. Don't look for advanced features and the resolution quality of the pictures is only so-so, especially as technology improves the quality of digital cameras. Still, for a novice or beginner, this is a great camera!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice starter camera, skip the accessories","review":"I bought this camera for my girlfriend - she's never used a digital camera before and she had no probs with it at all. I've used many different models and the A101 is one of the most intuitive to use, and the photos look good. Perhaps not the best camera available, but it's damn good value for the money.We haven't tried the Fuji software (we've got photoshop, iMovie, etc. so we're not interested in the Fuji stuff) but with the USB connection it just plugs into our Mac and mounts on the desktop as a disc - easy as pie - just copy the images to the computer and that's it. Words of warning - don't try to trash the files on the camera through your computer - crash!On the downside, it eats batteries like mad (it only uses two, not the typical four) and the optional digital camera accesory kit is not worth the money and in my case the rechargable batteries and charger were faulty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera for the Price","review":"On it's own, this camera is strictly average. Add the price into the equation, and this is a GREAT camera. If you are strictly into standard photos, I really don't think you can beat this camera. It even has a lot of extra features that I frankly don't need. The AC Adapter is a MUST. Like all digital cameras, it eats batteries with a ravenous appetite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mint Julep Body Lotion","review":"I was not a fan of this lotion. A few years ago I had purchased a Savannah Bee Company lotion in an airport and absolutely loved it. It wasn't greasy and smelled heavenly.

I have read all of his Guadalcanal works, they are all excellent. This book covers the ground war for Guadalcanal, so if you think you have it bad, read it and place yourself in the place of these Marines. It was a bizarre, almost backhanded campaign for the island, poorly supported and a sideshow to the ETO. Excellent read, well written and fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy great mugs","review":"I wanted a really good coffee mug, heavy, the kind found in diners. This mug absolutely fits the bill. It's thick walled, sturdily made, goes through the dishwasher beautifully. The mouth rim is rather thick so I always have coffee dribbled down the side, but I do at diners also.The mug also fits perfectly under the keurig and keeps the coffee warm longer, probably the thicker wall design in the cup.I shopped around and didn't end up buying these from Amazon, but it's the same diner mug. You just can't go wrong with the simple and sturdy design of these mugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT IS A 12 OUNCE CUP, NOT A 10 OUNCE CUP","review":"I gave it 4 stars, instead of 5, just for the wrong advertisement. At least if you fill it to the absolute brim, you get 12 ounces, not 10. Apparently 12 ounces is a standard American coffee mug.It is really thick ceramic. I like it a lot for its design; but I wanted a smaller cup. I have not yet found anyone selling a ceramic white coffee mug of 11 ounces or less. I would like one of 8 ounces (a legal cup), that is, except for expresso cups which are really small -- there is an expresso cup on Amazon that holds almost 5 ounces, a little more than half a legal cup, but you won't feel like it is half a cup of coffee when you use it.But IMHO these cups are nice. They shud keep the coffee hot with the extra thick wall. And I like the shape. I note that apparently these same cups are sold by a mug company that advertises at the bottom of Amazon (a link). That company has them in other colors (also) & will put a logo or words on them for a price."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Riedel made a coffee mug, this would be it","review":"Way back in the pre-Starbucks era, there were diners and donut shops. There was no wifi; water came from the tap. They served one kind of coffee: hot and fresh. There were two add-on options: cream and sugar. And this is the mug you drank it from. Ergonomic, thermodynamic, sturdy, simple.But seriously, if you love a cup of hot black coffee (whether you drink instant, sawdust in the can, or grind your own beans) - this mug will make it even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but... returns","review":"The cups are okay, but not exactly what I was expecting. They are larger than the old diner cups by about 2 ounces or more. I elected to return the items (I bought four) and to my dismay I learned that the return policy is, well..., Not much of a return policy! Yeah, you can return items in original packaging and within a certain period, but you will pay for shipping. Now I find that shipping to NH is within pennies of the cost of the product itself. Still debating whether or not to return them. My fault for not looking up the return policy before buying. However in this day and age of Amazon and internet shopping it seems to me that sellers need to provide free shipping for returns. At a minimum Amazon should make it very, very clear when the seller's return policy does not include shipping. Not a very good way to do business over the internet in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"diner coffee mug","review":"nice weight, and reminds me of the old diner's coffee, Just what I wanted for a great start to the morning"},{"rating":"2","title":"Embroidery Book","review":"The book is so colorful and fun.

I like this one as it details his life and music in distinctly separate parts. Part One is about the man, broken down into chapter by place of residence and period. The author makes extensive use of Mozart's correspondence to various family members, especially his father, which gives great first-person insight into the man without too much conjecture on the part of the writer.Part Two handles his music, beautifully, I might add, categorized into chapter by genre and type. Much detail is provided here that gives insight into the respective piece, why is exists, and what about it may be significant. Numerous appendices are included as well, including a complete Koechel listing of all his works.There are certainly more scholarly works available to choose from, but this is a great, intermediate level treatise which will satisfy most any reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"movie raring","review":"this is a great movie and sound track.

I love this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book starts off pretty well,","review":"but it doesn't take very long to realize you're reading not just a fairy tale, but a hard-to-believe-at-any-level fairy tale. The characters are just too extreme, and seem to change their minds, positions and attitudes every six seconds, but in a completely predictable and noninteresting way. First off, in any normal situation, Serena would've found herself facing assault charges. Second, the whole romance thing is just too pat; it happens in seconds, but then you're asked to jump from one side to the other with the characters, and keep the whole thing in perspective. Serena's reasoning is just too flawed, and anyone who's ever read a novel before can see what's coming 400 miles ahead. I can definitely beleve Kayla Perrin has written so many novels; much like Barbara Cartland did, she cranks them out like link sausages, with little regard to plot, believeability, or, for that matter, good writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its nice","review":"I do like the fixture, the only negative things I have to say are that the cover underneath looks a little cheap when you're looking up at it.

Buzzati is existential, but he's a much better storyteller than anyone else burdened with the \\"existential\\" label. Restless Nights is a great collection of short stories that should have won awards for its publisher. There are touches of the surreal here, but his style is too clear and concise to fit in with Breton et al. There are many sci-fi and Twilight Zone effects as well, yet with a more profound and, yes, existential, theme. Think of this as Kafka with a good sense of plot, as if Franz were forced to write half-hour tv scripts. I consider this one a classic.

You will say to yourself \\"why did I waste my time watching those crazy cable news (really entertainment) shows that are so uninformative?\\" If most Americans get their news from the TV as I am told they do, then we have dark days ahead.

I have posted several times there - and was quietly censored each time. My posts were critical of the drug companies and medical establishment, but were not offensive, attacking, etc. THe NYT gets advertising dollars from drug/medical interests. Recently, the NYT admitted the comments were \\"moderated,\\" when it became public knowledge what they were doing.So my objection to the NYT is they don't believe in freedom of speech, a serious transgression indeed for a journalist enterprise. They have turned from serious journalists to government-industrial hacks. As such they are part of the problem and have little legitimacy and trust-worthiness as guardians of the truth, and yes, the peoples' interests."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Art of War","review":"What more could you ask for, Machiavelli and how he describes the best way to win a war.

He shows how this pattern of love is transposed and embodied within history through families, both our natural families and the family of God, the Church. He begins with a solid, winsome interpretation of the Scriptures. Then, in a way similar to the early Church fathers, he extends the biblical material through typology and imagery.By grounding his teaching in solid biblical theology, Dr. Hahn not only helps his Catholic readers understand these profound realities (Church, Sacraments, the Blessed Virgin Mary), but also offers an exceptionally helpful avenue for non-Catholics to understand and explore these areas of difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"INSPIRING","review":"This is Mr Hahn's best book so far. It is written in a style which is indicative of a man who is very comfortable and happy in his faith and family.

At least the shipping was free with my Prime membership.Update - July 2012 - Shortly after writing the above review, the plastic part of the magnet completely fell off my dishwasher, leaving the little round magnet behind. We have tried to put it back together multiple times and it continues to fall apart when left on the warm dishwasher. The only solution is to remove it from the door when it's in use.

The acting was quite good, and the men were certainly attractive, but neither was enough to make me want to sit through more than a half-hour of this film before I removed the DVD and, quite frankly, trashed it. I guess I was expecting a love story along the lines of Beautiful Thing, or Big Eden, or Latter Days...at least with those films, I could follow along and empathize with the characters. Private Romeo was slow and difficult to follow, and I found it impossible to relate to any of the characters because they never seem to be developed beyond their ability to emulate the original characters of the play.

This could have been a better movie if they had brought it fully into the 21st century with regular everyday language, instead of mucking it up with Shakespearian dialogue.

This year I bought it and no more monthly forecasts in the back, sign by sign. This to me was the most significant part of the book. The rest is good and helpful, but often feels a bit recycled year to year. It was the forecasts that made each year's edition truly unique. Why these are gone is a mystery, but, unless these return, this will sadly be the last copy I purchase.

Principally, Harry Percy-the confidant of kings and eventual maker and breaker of kings, and his defiant love for the beautifual Margaret Neville. A virtual page-turner of the highest quality! Highly recommended, don't miss this trilogy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This shelf pin jig is relatively inexpensive, however, in my experience with the tool, it was impossible to create co-planer holes in the front and back of the case. After ruining several pieces I discovered that the holes were not evenly spaced! There was a variance of at least 3/32\\" between three holes at one end of the tool. After drilling holes on the front edge of the case and the tool is flipped to drill corresponding holes on the back edge, the holes from front to back are way off giving you wobbly crooked shelves. Stay away.As a general rule, it is better to use a jig that employs a guide bit or that relies on a router with a guide bushing. It will give you more accurate results (assuming the jig is milled correctly) and save wear and tear on the jig itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shop Fox H3291 Shelf Support Boring Jig","review":"Shelf Support Boring Jig is a very handy tool to help with shelving on any size project.

If you are interested in the American Revolution and have some general background, you'll love this book. Golway takes you on a virtual tour of the life of this great American. He offers the reader a chance to not only follow General Greene through the day to day events of the war, but gives you a ample opportunities to consider the thinking behind his actions.Golway is careful not to elevate Nathaniel Greene to hero status as some authors have done. General Greene certainly had his share of faults and failures. But, his ability to persevere and ultimately succeed are the characteristics that make this such a great story. I recommend it to anyone who has read enough to know who Nathaniel Greene is. If you haven't read much on the Revolution, I suggest \\"A History of the American Revoultion\\" by Alden. This is not the most recent book on the subject, but it remains one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"If not for Greene, we'd still be British","review":"Nathaniel Greene is one of the little-known but critical figures in American history. Without Greene's being the right man at the right place at the right time, in the Carolinas, the outcome of the Revolution could have been very different. The author does a nice job of describing Greene as a professional and as a man. One only regrets that the author did not provide more information about Greene's fascinating wife after the early death of her husband. She probably merits a biography on her own. Had Greene lived longer, he might have eventually become President. A well-written book about a key contributor to our nation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"Great explanation of early European-American conflicts, it sources and its eventual end.

Not a happy customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOURSELF","review":"I should have known better than to think that Laurie Anna Gibson aka Ms. Conceited, would be able to pull off a good dance instruction dvd. First of all, she dances her way through the dvd only going over the dance moves once- but reminds us that we can always replay the section. I found it very tedious and annoying to replay a section just because she didn't take the time to go over it properly. Another thing that bothered me was the fact that it was expected for you to learn the moves without her mirror image on the televison instead of including the angle of her back facing you. This is confusing because you have to remind yourself that her right is your left and vice versa. Anyhow, I thought that she would have at least used some familiar songs to dance with but they just used that generic \\"hip hop\\" soundtrack that didn't resemble real hip hop music at all. She would have kept me interested if she had used songs and routines that she has choreographed in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"Wasn't impressed. When I buy an exercise video or dance video I feel the purpose is to teach you. The fact that she doesn't mirror the moves makes it difficult to learn. Laurie does relie on the fact that you can rewind. The warm up was horrible, a few head rolls and hip movements. I didn't get past the begginers part for a while because it was confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instructor","review":"This video would have been much better if Laurie ann Gibson wasn't so full of herself. I can't bear to use the dvd any more because other than the dancing all she does is talk about herself and how great she is or other people are talking about how great she is.All I care about is the dancing!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"The videos were of good quality so there's no issue with that.But the storyline was horrible. The timeline was too soon for Tabitha to be grown up. While Lisa Hartman was credible as Tabitha, everyone else was boring. Robert Urich has no comic ability but was nice to look at. Also Adam refers to Tabitha as his kid sister? He also lacks powers. OK fine the story changes.The real problem was the lack of purpose. There was no reason for Tabitha NOT to want to use her magic. Samantha had a reason to not use it. She married Darrin who thought she was a mortal. The whole point of \\"Betwitched\\" that made it so charming is that Samantha COULD have anything, but chose Darrin and the hum-drum suburban life. Why? Because LOVE is better than having the world at your fingertips or in Samantha's case a twitch.Without that reason, there was no reason for Tabitha not to want to use her powers and no charm. Also the special effects were poor. They were even worse at times than the original show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tabitha DVD","review":"I enjoyed this for what it really is. This a 70's type version of Tabitha, Samantha's daughter in Bewitched. Tabitha is totally hot.The story lines are kind of schlocky, and a more updated versionof the original. Tabitha's aunt is interfering, but much nicerthan the original Endora (Samantha's mother). Adam, Tabitha's brother is dorkish, but a predicatably over protective mortal without any warlock powers. It's a fun DVD as long as viewers don't take it too seriously.It's 70's TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"After all the negitive reviews, I was very skeptical to buy this. But I said WTH why not! I must say I really enjoyed it. I absoulutly adore Lisa Hartman as Tabitha. She does a very good job. I found it humorous and enjoyful. I guess everyone has thier own opions. Its a real shame that it didnt last longer. it would have been really nice to have more episodes to enjoy, IMO!Now, a lot of people have been saying how better of the series would have benn if it followed the unaired pilot. I have to disagree. I found the alternate pilot kinda boring. I liked Ms.Williams as Tabatha, but the thing I didnt like, in this pilot and the one that aired, is adam. In the unaired pilot I found him annoying and in the series I found him even more annoying LOL. Although I do think the series would have been more interesting had Adam been a warlock, JMO.I hope this review helps you out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Retro fun in Remastered High Definition.","review":"Watching it now it is still an enjoyable 70's series that reminds me of a nicer time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Bewitched","review":"It doesn't share the same feelings like Bewitched even though they tried. I think the issue is they tried to mimic Bewitched too hard and yet they couldn't capture the original magic. As what their title song sung, \\"it could be magic!\\" Lisa Hartman was too \\"trying\\" hard to act exactly like Elizabeth Montgomery instead of building her own personality. By doing that, it made the character worst. They could make it a better series if they built on Bewitched but gave the characters different personalities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lisa Hartman's Old Nose!","review":"Lisa had her nose done after this series; she is more beautiful now at age 50 than she ever was then.

This author has a VERY bad habit of leaving major issues unresolved. He did it in Monster of Minnesota, and he did it in this one as well. At the end, we aren't even told what happened with the 19 year old girl who is dying! And what about the mayor? He walks in the building during the climax and we never hear from him again! His character pretty much disappears from the story shortly after he appears--and he's not a minor character! The denouement was rushed and left the reader feeling like the author simply lost interest in the story.

Many of the book's chapters focus on the history of Detroit and the history of many Detriot rock bands... those bands of course have interviews and a full length detailed bios on them.Again, as a lover of the Stripes, I love reading about them.

Well written, organized in a logical presentation, and more even handed than the usual fair from both extremes, i.e. Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh or Michael Moore, Al Franken.One mystery that isn't explained however is, why is it called the \\"Commitee to re-elect the President\\" when he wasn't \\"elected\\" yet.If much of what is discussed by James Moore is weighted more to the truth, then a win for Bush in 2004 will be a bigger disaster than the re-election of Nixon in 1972.If read with a truly open mind, Moore's book is at least an eye opener and a cause for much needed debate before we go to the polls in Novemeber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Reading","review":"This book should be on the reading list of anyone who wants to make an informed voting decision in November. The author reveals startling information about the mishandling of the Iraqi situation, and provides telling insight into the decision making processes of the Bush administration.

The only extra was the radio show, but that's fine. I bought this because I love the show, not because I love extras. If they came with everything, there would be no reason to call them extras.

I agree, Universal Studios is manufacturing a terrible after market TV product and needs to be told.

I mean really people, any ani fan can at least appreciate it greatly. The only thing that bothered me mainly about the book was how the author made such a seperation between two \\"kinds\\" of ani fans. It was a blanket statement and being a 15 year old fan it bothered me a little bit. Some people seem to think that all teenagers are irrational in their tastes. I don't \\"worship\\" anyone and I don't think that's a good way to label a fan. Yes, I am deeply deeply moved by ani's music and respect very very much her righteous deeds and words.

Most everything righteous about Ani Difranco becomes apparent in the 224 pages of \\"Ani Difranco: Righteous Babe\\". The author, Raffaele Quirino, covers the intrigue that Ani also brings to her music. The book diplays Ani's ability to combine politics with poetry, while shedding light on the personal. After all, her ability to make politics personal is what has drawn millions of fans. Though about a musician rather than a comedian, the book is similar in some ways to books by and about entertainers like Whoopi Goldberg, Ellen Degeneres and Sandra Bernhard, yet is much more personal than Goldberg's and Degeneres's and dives much deeper into the righteous entertainer's political and social views and experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't even deserve 1 star","review":"The way that the author is trying to capitalize on Ani's name is disgusting.

However, when Ani expresses her disapproval and makes it extremely apparent that she does not want this book written, one should pick up one's dignity and stop right there. Instead, Raffaele Quirino went on to collect information from websites, interviews, and Ani's own songs - something we could all do ourselves. Fans of Ani: you are all intelligent and interesting people who could find out all this junk by yourself, and, although song interpretations are often fascinating to discuss, these particular ones are shallow and unrelated.

But what made me even more angry was the reveiw by \\"Righteous babe\\" (December 2004), located on this page. She too gets the lyrics and story wrong. Anyone who owns a cd and calls themselves a fan should know the lyrics. Especially if your badmouthing someone else for not doing their research. Her quoted lyrics are from \\"Shameless\\". Anyone who has \\"Dilate\\" can go and read the correct lyrics for themselves to see that she actually sings \\"I gotta cover my butt, cuz I covet another mans wife.\\" So her whole review is just as useless as the book. I guess \\"righteous babe\\" isn't so right. Back to the book though, I am glad I bought it at a used book store. It is not a window into Ani's life. I think her music is the story of her life, and will not ever be found in the pages of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An absolutely terrible book..","review":"As an Ani fan for the past God-knows-how-long, I was curious to see what this book was all about. Needless to say, it is very poorly written with even worse proof-read job. Ani fans will pretty much be insulted by this \\"collection of opinions\\" from a misinformed author. Don't waste your money! Most of the citations for this book come from web sites that you've all probably been to already--and we all know how accurate web sites are. I imagine that if Ani gets her hands on this book, she'll wonder how it got published, which was also my first reaction upon completion."},{"rating":"1","title":"An attempt, but hardly a good one","review":"I was very disappointed when I read this book. Yes, I understand that the author did not intend this piece to be an official window into Ani's life... He states that he spent 3 months listening to ani's recordings, in an attempt to completely deconstruct them to get inside her head... I have spent nearly 7 years (I am, afterall, only 17) listening to Ani's music. And for one person to try to tell me just what Ani is \\"all about,\\" is so infuriating. Ani's music touches each one of us differently, in my opinion, as we find our own experiences mirrored through her work, whether or not that's what she intended... I must... point out there are so many inaccuracies that this book should be kept farther away from the beginners than from anyone else. And more importantly, the only true way (in my opinion) to experience Ani is through her words, thoughts, and emotions."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"Take a pass on this one, Ladies.

The Show itself is a pleasant enough kid friendly account about the fastest and tallest coasters at the time but it rarely goes in depth about anything especially the 3d.The Pulfrich system of grey and clear lenses makes anything that moves from left to right 3d to a degree so save the glasses for sports shows and what not untill your bored with them but the coaster film to be shot in true 3D has yet to be made.Dukey"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good coasters, bad actors, bad writing","review":"This video brings you fourteen Roller Coasters from all over the United States.

The commentary by the presenters before the coaster ride was irritatingly long. The 3D effects were minimal and sometimes not noticeable at all. I put the glasses on my mother, and she couldn't see any difference between 2D and what was supposed to be 3D. There were some wildlife shots which proved to be more effective in 3D. If one is to compare this 3D movie with something like IMAX, then don't. I tried the CD on a wide flatscreen 32\\" TV and also on my computer monitor. Neither gave the 3D effect I was expecting.

With the special glasses provided, you see depth of the images. A nice effect. But the best 3D images come from the computor generated graphics showing the titles & construction of the roller coasters. They appear to \\"pop out\\" of your TV screen, a pretty cool effect thanks to computor immaging. Also, if you choose not to wear the special polarized glasses, it just appears to be a normal movie.

The good qualities: excellent car-mounted picture quality of the front row of most of the coasters, wide range of coasters shown, and interesting narrative. The bad qualities: Why anyone would want to film an indoor Roller Coaster (in the dark) is beyond me (if you want to see the exact same coaster, but outside, see the third video in this series), two of the coasters had post-production movement shadows added, which really [messed] up the entire trip, Mantis never really had the front-car view, and the ?3-D? features are non-existent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mild Amusement","review":"World's Greatest Rollercoaster Thrills was a letdown. Perhaps because I saw America's Greatest Rollercoaster Thrills: The Ultimate Scream Machines prior to this. Anyway, the footage on some of the coasters is good. For example, Big Dipper. It was a nice pov and edited wide shots. However, I found some of the shots to be fuzzy, such as on The Dragon. I was very excited to find that Dragon Khan was on this video, but I found the footage to be less than prime. They barely showed anything of the Corkscrew at Sea World Australia, no front-seat shot AT ALL. That disappointed me. Sometimes, they would show shot of the camera sideways looking out of the coaster and that became incredibly nauseating. The 3-D effect was not noticeable. However, for content, it was a good DVD. I just wouldn't recommend it. Purchase America's Greatest Rollercoaster Thrills: The Ultimate Scream Machines instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Video and sound reproduction are very poor. All the shots are done with 8mm video and it is all hand-held. I would have liked it more if they had shown more cockpit shots instead of filling it up with mostly shots from the ground.

It didn't even show some of the rides clearly but instead put some editing trick on the footage to make it totally unviewable. Also, the producers (or whoever) put cheesy music on during every single ride. I found this highly irritating.Obviously, I cannot recommend this video.

Not alot from the last several albums, though...Also, not including the introduction to the song 'Tooth and Nail' was an odd thing to me, since it's so short and soooo good; Decent/Good/Great production, depending on the year of the song...It's the best thing out there until they remaster all the CD's, by which point we'll all be 65.

They are an independent family struggling to hold their ideas and opinions together. I love how everything fits together oddly but perfect, like Link and James's relationship, how they can disagree on many topics but are as close as brothers.This is a great young adult book because it addresses many issues we have today, like sexuality and relationships.

The mother is very comfortable with her son being gay, which is not realistic. One of the boys knows he's gay but then turns straight just like that. The author sets up the relationship with the two boys, then sets up one with the girl and a boy and then lets the whole thing drop at the end. The sex scene seemed like it was tagged on as an afterthought.

I had always been interested in ancient history and thanks to the Peabody series I have gotten to enjoy the golden age of Egyptology and the men and women who helped to uncover Egypt's ancient past almost as if I were a part of it. For Ms. Peters to publish the Compendium as Amelia's just seems so right. I look forward to all the future Peabody books and any others that Ms. Peters writes - under whichever of her many names that she might use."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good reference for the Peabody series","review":"If you love Amelia, you'll enjoy this reference text about Egypt. This an excellent reference from the historical side--I understand more about Amelia's comments regarding Gordon now as well as understanding Amelia better--the way she treated Ramses when he was young, etc. Peters really did have Amelia reflect the changing views in England over time about women, children, Egypt, etc. The book also has a thumbnail but good summary of Islam as a religion.The only quibble I have with the book is that if the reader is not a complete Amelia fanatic who has read every book, they may get confused between fiction and historical fact. For example, in some paragraphs, a completely factual discussion about anthropology in Egypt suddenly has a one-sentence fictitious reference--only an avid reader might pick up the sudden difference.

She has a strong voice that comes from the depths of her vicera. And please let's not compare her to Joss Stone. The songs are so danceable and really easy to listen to, you can tell she has colaborated with many well known and talented musicians. There's a protest song called, \\"Music\\" a bit of a backlash against rough lyrics in rap/hip hop and its tendency to promote sexism specially in music videos, I think this is refreshing. \\"Ghetto\\" shows you example of the playful and clever lyricism in this CD \\"trying to be a lady, but you keep pushing me.\\" But I kept playing \\"Don't Speak\\" what a passionate, soulful cover of this song.

It also portrays the sounds of the old school greats; such as, Al Green, Marvin Gay, Teddy Pendegrass (however spelled) enhanced with a splash of more contemporary, but yet still old school soulful artists like Anthony Hamilton. This CD is authentic R&B soul filled with true emotion. I absolutely love it. I am a huge music lover and have an appreciation for mostly all genres of music. I definitely recommend this CD.

On her CD she sings some very impressive self-penned songs of her own.When I saw Leela James on \\"Soul Train\\" she was singing \\"Music\\" and I was captivated by her and her song. \\"Music\\" is the first song on the CD and lead single. In it she laments the death of soul. She reminisces about Aretha, Gladys, Tina, and Chaka, and asks, \\"Can we just put the thongs away?\\" What a great line. From the urgent \\"Music\\" to the bass-heavy \\"Rain\\" and the sultry \\"Mistreating Me,\\" this is contemporary R&B; for people who think they don't like contemporary R&B.;If I was the kind of reviewer who gave out numerical ratings, I'd have to give this one the maximum value.

I was expecting something along Firewalk's greatness and then I got a junior book trying to sound more adult. It didn't work.

As a sequel I would say it was disapointing but I never liked the first one, Gaurdians Key. It's more like Daggers Point or Water Dance (other excellent sequels) where the main character must undertake a journey to find out who she is and where she belongs. The writing is rich and descriptive allowing you to feel like your there. Also to those who have read other Logston books there are tie-ins which make her world so much more complete. I liked Ash. He was a stronger (yet still caring) character than most of Logstons leading males. The romance, again like her other books, isn't hot and heavy. It's more like a mutual caring for each other which keeps the book light and enjoyable. I'd recommend this book to anyone who loves Logston - and even to those who don't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"classic C3","review":"I am a professional cabinetmaker, and have used several biscuit joiners.most give fairly good results. but the C3 gives professional results.

Internet use is far more common and widespread in Russia than the UK - because the UK has rotting 1940s phone lines and massively overpriced phone billing. In Moscow, trains run on time. In London, trains occasionally run on time. Unlike the UK, Russia has a democratically elected Head of State. Russia may be behind the UK in the world of Fast Food, Punk Rock and Football Hooligans, but it is far ahead in other areas."},{"rating":"1","title":"stinks","review":"This book was lacklustre.

Ms. Richey's other CDs--and especially Rise--are some of the most played in my household. However, after a couple of airings of Chinese Boxes, I put the CD up for sale on Amazon. None of the songs here has the intensity, natural lyricism, and/or emotional intensity of her earlier work. Also gone is the inventiveness--that is oblivious to categorization in any genre of music--that made Rise seem so interesting. Instead, the CD sounds all too much like the typical anemic pop played on easy listening stations. Big Disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a lovely set of songs","review":"I do not write that many reviews, but after playing this last night I felt compelled. It is such a lovely record and every single song is terrific. Kim has a way with phrasing that makes the little hooks and nuances so wonderful. As an audiophile with a very good system (Thiel, Rowland, etc.), I find this recording to be well done with lots of dynamics and clarity without being bright. Good job on all counts and HIGHLY recommended. If you have not done so, please check out the works of Richard Thompson, another phenomenal singer songwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd","review":"Kim Richey is an excellent artist.

Chinese Boxes is a terrible disappointment: bland stuff, blandly produced. Only one track is halfway decent.I cannot understand why it has been given 5 stars, unless all the previous reviews are by the production team. I see that the producer is Giles Martin.

The narrative by Varina Davis, mostly about Davis' first wife Sally Taylor, just begins without any introduction. Other scenes appear with no connection or transition. The scene of the announcement of Davis' election to the Confederate presidency, while attempting to portrey the circumstance, fails miserably. The actor representing Davis doesn't look even a little like JFD. Then the next scene with the apparent JFD impersonator, who looks like the man and evidently had done this before, bears no connection or resemblence to the other scenes. Too bad this guy didn't play JFD for the entire \\"film.\\" I stopped watching at this point because I couldn't take this high school skit night acting, purporting to be \\"the only feature length film on the life of Jefferson Davis.\\" Having read a number of biographies and related works, this was quite the dissappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great summary of different phases of President Davis' philosophy and spirit.","review":"I like the use of specific writings of Jefferson Davis and those close to him to form a glimpse of what the man behind the title of Confederate States of America was actually about.

Everyone Worth Knowing is the story of how she becomes an accidental success in the surreal world of celebrity public relations, and finds romance--real and fictional--along the way.Maybe it's just me, but Bette seems to have problems many people would love to \\"suffer\\" through. Although told a lot of things about her, I never got the feeling I could really picture Bette or understand what she wanted, even in the end. Her story feels underdeveloped and many of the events predictable or random. Still, if you liked The Devil Wears Prada and enjoy modern formulaic romances, you will probably enjoy Everyone Worth Knowing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"I'd have to concur with some of the other reviewers. After Devil Wears Prada, I was expecting a lot more from this book and author. The story was basically the same as the first book, quite tedious and unimaginative throughout, and frankly, not very well written. It was hard to get through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are these people giving the book 5 stars?","review":"I'm getting the impression that the people giving this book 5 stars are Lauren Weisberger's friends, or some interns from her publishing company.I read the book on a plane. I wasn't ever expecting great literature - after all, I did buy a \\"chick lit\\" book. However, this is just \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" but in the PR business. I didn't relate to the main character (Bette), and the book was very predictable. Within the first few pages, you'll figure out how the book ends. A bit more creativity would have been good.It's an ok book to kill time with at an airport terminal, but if you want to read this book, better you borrow it from a friend than spend money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Formula as The Devil Wears Prada","review":"I am so glad I borrowed this book from the library rather than waste my dollars on it.Again I am with the crowd who LOVED The Devil Wears Prada, reading it twice which is unheard of for me and a book. But this one, although I was excited to finally get my hands on it, was the SAME formula.Main character lives in New York, lands a fancy, supposedly glamourous job, hates fancy job, ends up hurting those around her by working insane hours etc etc, gets caught up in a world that is seedy, falls in love/lust with play boy type, quits job, lounges around depressed with best friend ordering food blah blah blah.The author just seemed to change the industry, change the characters names, hair color, make her new boss a little less demonic and voila, another book.I know that I won't be on the waiting list if a third book comes out. We can already predict the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine to read while I was in the plane","review":"I completely agree with the reviewer who said \\"A complete \\"Prada\\" rip-off\\". I didn't like The Devil Wears Prada but I decided to give this one a shot basically because I had to fly from NYC to San Francisco and I prefered a book to a magazine. This book was boring and not interesting at all. At least in Prada you could hate the boss and think about what you would do to change the situation. In Everyone Worth Knowing there's a great lack of imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"I realy enjoyed this book. It was very entertaining and exciting to read how Bette's love life and career took a 180 degree turn to the wild and crazy. I can't wait to read the next book by Lauren!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read","review":"While many make a good argument that the plot was predictable, I still really liked the book and there was something about it that kept me up at night reading yet another chapter. I think everyone has a little part of them that is intrigued by the socialite lifestyle and wishes they could spend a day in Bette's shoes. I could definitely see this turning into a successful movie, just like The Devil Wears Prada did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep trying","review":"This book has a lot of problems. The plot is very thin. The main characters aren't particularly likeable or deep. You find yourself not caring what happens to the heroine. There are too many stereotypical characters: the gay best friend (uncle), the hunky tough guy who turns out to be sensitive and intelligent (he's a chef - who knew!). The villains are even boring.On the plus side, I enjoyed the author's first book, and would try another book if she writes one. After a big seller your first time out, it must be really hard to come up with something equally good, and at least she tried. Reading about 20-somethings in NYC is getting boring, though. They all sound so desperate.Last good thing: this author suggests Marjorie Morningstar as a book to read, and it's terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorority girl reads redo of the Devil Wears Prada","review":"While Weisberger's story is entertaining enough, it's not much different from The Devil Wears Prada.This particular version of it, the Abridged Audio Book, does not help the material. The reader has the slightly raspy voice of a sorority girl and reads without intelligence. Within the first CD, I already noticed several errors, such as reading \\"compromised\\" instead of \\"comprised\\" in a context where the former made absolutely not sense, and occasionally leaving out a word, which made me \\"stumble\\" over the sentence. Avoid this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGG!","review":"UG! Great story premise and liked the main character but the book was painful to read. Very badly written.

Same plot - arrogant girl out of her element, a chef, a jilted best friend, a few town cars, a couple of fabulous (if narrow) gay characters, bake at 350 for an hour (or just micorwave for 10 minutes) and you get this book.

I actually liked it better than the Devil Wears Prada. Everyone else needs to chill out and not take everything so seriously. People need to stop trying to be book critics and just enjoy the book instead of looking too hard into it. If you like chick lit, you'll like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete \\"Prada\\" rip-off","review":"\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" isn't exactly the novel of the century, but I thought it was mildly entertaining and so I gave Lauren Weisberger's second book a shot. That was a big mistake on my part. \\"Everyone Worth Knowing\\" pretty much has the exact same plot and story arc as \\"Prada\\": a girl scores a job with big trendy company in New York City. The job quickly consumes the girl's life and she ends up being negatively influenced by her snooty coworkers, getting involved with a creepy guy, ignoring her family and friends, etc. Eventually the girl realizes that her job is dictating her life, so she leaves it in the dust and lives happily ever after. The end.Although \\"Prada\\" was mediocre at best, at least it was original. Why couldn't Weisberger come up with something new? I highly suggest that you skip this book...if you're looking for a quick \\"chick lit\\" fix, pick up a book by Emily Giffin...she's the only author I've come across who does the genre any justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it!","review":"I thought it was great. You need to accept that it's a chick lit book, but saying that, this and \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" are far above the rest of those type. This one took a little while to pick up in the beginning but once it did I couldn't put it down - you get sucked into Bette's life and want everything to work out for her to combat the way the gossip pages ruin her life. Write another book, Lauren Weisberger!! Her books make me literally laugh out loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Nice Boss Wears Prada\\"","review":"This is \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" only with a nice, perky boss instead of the other kind. Only the nice boss pimps the main character, Bette, out for publicity, so I'm not completely certain how nice she is. But then again, Bette lets her get away with it, so...Anyway, in this book, you get Turkey instead of France and nightclubs instead of fashion shows and it's all the biggest, widest yawn you could possibly imagine.The only characters in the whole book who interested me were the parents, but there wasn't a whole lot of depth to them. Everyone else, including Bette, was pretty much a stock player from Characters \\"R\\" Us. The plot was completely predictable because it was lifted straight from \\"Prada\\" with a few minor scene changes.It was a really disappointing book. Ghastly dull. I drug myself through to the end, but that's only because my parents taught me not to be a quitter."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE: Double Du-oh","review":"I decided to give the author another chance by reading her second book. This time I was smarter and borrowed my friend's copy. I am sad to say that it's more of the same. I was only able to get through one chapter and that was it. It's written in the same shallow, whining path that \\"The Devil wears Prada\\" was written. Again I'm wishing Amazon had Garbage ratings because this is where this book will end up in. Even my friend can't finish her book and I did not tell her my opinion of it. She came to the same conclusion all on her own."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucky","review":"Do you like brainless literature? Then this is the book for you! I read Ms. Weisberger would like her epitaph to say she was brilliant and drop-dead gorgeous. Humble. And vomitous.

If you are just DYING to know what shallow B-list celebs do in their off-time, if this is of extreme importance to you, and if teenage textmessage-level writing doesn't deter you, then this is the book for you!I'm so glad I didn't pay any money for my advance copy. Thank you local bookstore! I have lost two hours of my life in tedious, distasteful skimming, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat","review":"Boring.

Really?!","review":"I made the mistake of making this one of the five books I took with me for my four month trip to Japan in 2008, where a paperback book in English costs $20. After finally being forced to read this or reread something I had just read, I finally read this. While it was slightly entertaining, it was mostly snotty, tedious, and seemingly written by a twelve year old girl who wants to one day be like Paris Hilton. It's stuck on my brain to this day because it's such a marked difference from the enjoyable Devil Wears Prada. I hated the characters and by the end was rooting for someone to smack them. Read this if you like chick lit with annoying characters, but otherwise steer clear.Also, I left this in Japan as English practice for one of my friends. It was written in a level where even an intermediate student of English could easily understand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Devil Wears BlackBerry","review":"I have a feeling there was a conversation that went something like this:Editor: We want another 'Devil Wears Prada.'Lauren Weisberger: I don't want to write the same book again, that's boring.Editor: We'll pay you.Lauren Weisberger: I don't know. How much?Editor: A lot.Laruen Weisberger: Such as...?Editor: A million dollars.Lauren Weisberger: Know what? Funny you should bring this up, but I actually have this idea that's pretty much The Devil Wears Prada, but in the PR industry..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book diappointed me. It had the same, predictable plot as The Devil Wears Prada, and the same poor-me-I've-got-a-terrible-boss theme. It gets old very, very quickly.Bettina (or \\"Bette\\") Robinson is a young twenty-something living in New York. She grew up in Pughkeepsie with liberal, hippie parents and attended Emory before moving to New York to pursue a career in investment banking. She walks out on the job; and through her uncle Will, manages to find a job working as a party planner.Throw in a handsome, debonair man-about-town who everyone thinks Bette is dating; some co-workers who I think were meant to be funny but just end up looking pathetic; and a love interest, and you've basically got the gist of this poorly-written, over-advertised novel. This is definitely one \\"not worth knowing.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk Food","review":"I thought this would be sort of a fun distraction, but instead I was just disappointed.

However, Weisberger's newest effort, \\"Everyone Worth Knowing,\\" is bland. Top that off with bad writing, characters the reader doesn't care about, and a set-up and ending seen in the very first chapter, makes this book a definite pass.Weisberger has potential as a writer. Unfortunately, she's nowhere near delivering the goods in this book. Get another book instead, or if you must read this one, get it from the library. It's not worth paying money for... and it's not really worth investing the time into reading, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"Let me say, I tried to read The Devil Wears Prada when that came out and couldn't get into it. I thought, give this author another try. So I did. I got about half way through the book and decided to drop it.

I just dont get it...... this can't be the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance, not chick lit","review":"The key to understanding this book is when the main character - Bette - tells readers that she secretly loves romance novels and wants to write one. It's lucrative, it's easy, and, well, it's luctrative. Lauren Weisberger must have thought so, too. That's why she wrote this silly book. I read it because I liked the storyline in The Devil Wears Prada. But there's nothing here - storyline, writing, or otherwise - that makes this book worth reading.

The main character in the novel, Bette seemed like a well rounded character was at times not as convincing as she should have been. Overall, another summer read that is better enjoyed when you don't have another to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This was a really dull book with such a pointless, meandering plotline. I absolutely loved The Devil Wears Prada and would probably put it in my top ten chick lit books of all time, maybe even my top five. So I was completely prepared to love this book as well and found it horribly, horribly disappointing. Go find another fun book instead of reading this schlock. I'm considering cancelling my pre-order of Weisberger's new book because I really did not enjoy this one -- maybe she was just a one-hit wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZzzzZZzzz","review":"I read the first few pages and it was enough for me to give the book away. I admit I judged the book by the cover and thought it was going to be a good airplane ride book, but reading the first chapter and skimming the rest of the chapters made it obvious that the book had no depth nor excitement to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start..... predictable and repetitive","review":"I was so excited to read this book as I loved, loved, loved Devil Wears Prada. At first, I was really into it. Then less than halfway through, I figured out all the \\"twists\\" at the end. It was highly repetitive and predictable. I would have given it 1 star, but it did have some funny sections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a little too simple and shallow for my taste...","review":"The title for this review says it all. Ms. Weisberger's character's lack depth. She had too many sub-plots that she tried to make important (who cares that Bette's uncle's column is losing popularity? does it really matter that Bette has a weird and slightly sickening infatuation with bad romance novels?) and then failed miserably at doing so. I will admit that I was a bit interested in seeing how things panned out, and therefore quickly finished with it, but then the ending was also completely superficial and predictable, and that solidified my opinion that this book was all fluff and no substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute, but . .","review":"Almost an exact re-write of The Devil wears Prada. Cute girl, bad job (minus the terrible boss) climb the job ladder at the expense of your friends, quit said job in the middle of the most important party of the year. Save your funds and borrow it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead On!","review":"Weisburger did her PR research! She thanks bigshot PR pro Peggy Siegel in the back of the book so I wonder if she did the research there? If so, it was the right way to go. After working in PR for 6 months, I can say that this book mirrored my experiences at a PR agency in Manhattan. Compared to the Devil Wears Prada there was much more romance involved, both to the advantage (ultimately) and disadvantage of the book (Philip Weston story was WAYYYY stretched out and too involved). Some of it was a tad predictable (it was SO obvious who Ellie Insider was... I mean come ON!) and the story line pretty much fits Prada. But I still liked it. There's a lightness to her writing that makes it so appealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"I recently finished reading this book and thoroughly enjoyed it. Weisberger outs the celebrity PR machine in entertaining fashion, much as she did the fashion magazine world in The Devil Wears Prada.I feel that I actually learned a little bit about how the industry works as a result of reading this book. Not something I expected from a chick lit novel!I read some of the other reviews and I'm having a hard time understanding why those reviewers disliked the book so much. As someone pointed out, it's meant to be a fun read, not world-changing literature.The only gripe I have about the plot of this book is Bette's love of romance novels. I kept asking myself what it had to do with what was happening in the story and kept coming up with the same answer, \\"Nothing!\\" Other than that, I enjoyed the book. I'll probably read Weisberger's next book as well. I'm looking forward to seeing which industry she lampoons next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I read this book while on vacation and couldn't put it down. It is a fun read, and I am looking forward to reading other books by this author. I was really shocked to read the harsh reviews. I highly reccomend this book, especially to the 20-30 something crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lauren Weisberger is a truly a modernday MESSIAH!","review":"People who have thrown their lot in with Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, atheism and so on ought to have second thoughts about their choices after they've read Weisberger's latest testiment.She has performed the miracle of transforming paper into crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"367 pages of...?","review":"Yes, it was a fast read, but it lagged on.. and on. The ending to the book was entirely too predictable, leaving you feeling bored and unsatisfied. The main character, Bette, has very little depth. First she's sad and fat, then thin and fabulous, etc. etc. It is not a book I would recommend if you are generally a person who enjoys books that make you think. If you're looking for mindless entertainment, however, then go for it. I enjoy fun, easy-going books every now-and-then, but I feel like this book had very little substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"If you read \\"The Devil wears Prada\\" , you have basically read this book. Exact same story line, just different characters. I was very dissapointed. I couldnt even finish this book from utter boredom. It's awful! I loved \\"Prada\\", I thought this would be equally as good but it's just not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I too, thought that this book would develop a sense of connection with the characers, plot and humor that I found in her previous book TDWP. Not here...the jokes are weak, the situations predictable, and with only a minute amount of difference the same outcome, and story, as her previous book...What Happened Weisberger? If you were writing to the people that you depict in your books, then you might have found an audience, BUT to be successful you have to do a far reach into the lives of everyone, worth knowing or not. Maybe your next book will again be fresh, funny and revealing that you have talent. Write a Crime Novel! There, I think that you could. Good Luck on your next one...this one did not hit the mark that YOU set."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is good for getting out of reality for awhile","review":"I am not much of a reader. I must say I enjoyed the book. It is good for people in their 20s and single. I am not single, but I enjoyed it. It made me feel like I had experienced it with Bette. I live in a not so exciting place and it made me enjoy reading so much that I started a book club with some people at work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-I-N-G","review":"I am an avid reader who usually gives every book a chance, but I could not finish this book. What a snorefest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader on the AUDIO Book was AWFUL!!","review":"I am a big fan of Chick-Lit. This book was great!! I am an even bigger fan of Audio Books. The person who read this book was AWFUL!! The worst ever. She would fake an accent and continue to use it in the description not the just dialog parts. Then she would correct herself half way through. Her voice inflection was like sitting through auditions for a Junior High play. I just kept thinking WOW! This is the first time I really wished I had READ the book rather than listen to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone Worth Knowing","review":"I thought the storyline of this book was very juvenile. Even though the main character was in her 30's, it read more like a teenage romance. Very cheesy. I was disappointed. It wasn't anything close to The Devil Wears Prada. I find it hard to believe those 2 books were penned by the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of an afternoon on the beach ...","review":"I loved The Devil Wears Prada and was so looking forward to reading her sophomore effort. However, I was so disappointed. As others mentioned, this is a formulaic attempt at chick-lit, and a poor attempt at that.If a book is going to be interesting to me, I have to care about the characters and be able to even slightly relate to the situations they find themselves in. At no point do I care even slighlty about Bette or her predicaments. Characters appear and disappear, or they find themselves useful for only a chapter and then are gone. It truly seemed that the author had all of these great ideas, but she wasn't sure how to pull them all together, so she just threw together the pages of the manuscript and then wrote a paragraph to transition between chapters.If you really feel that you must read this book then borrow it from the library. It's not worth seven or eight bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible to the Last Word","review":"I don't usually review items on Amazon because I haven't loved or hated anything enough. But this book--it was so terrible, I couldn't not write a review. Thank goodness I bought it from a used book store and paid half of the list price, but nonetheless, not worth it. I don't understand how one book could have housed so many cliches and so many useless celebrity mentions. Was it really necessary to highlight that Ashlee and Jessica Simpson were VIPs at a fictional PR event? Was there even a climax to this book? Absolutely, ridiculously terrible. I think I lost brain cells reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book Not Worth Knowing","review":"When I heard that Weisberger was coming out with a new novel, I was so extremely excited. I had loved Devil Wears Prada and I assumed her to once again produce something witty, insightful, and fluffy to read on the weekend. I was horribly, horribly WRONG.Not only does this book lack characters about who you actually care, but its plot is so insanely hard to believe. Sure Weisberger had to do smething to make Everyone Worth Knowing different from all the other- naive 20 something girl tries cut-throat profession stories, but please....This book was painful and I ended up skipping chapters because I really didn't care what happened in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down","review":"To get away from intense college reading, I enjoy light, fluffy books that are easy to read. I liked Devil Wears Prada and was excited to read her second book. I was disappointed. It might be an ok read if it was her first novel, but Everyone Worth Knowing is definitely a sophomore slump."},{"rating":"1","title":"What planet is Lauren Weisberger from?","review":"To be pitied are the people who find the characters of Lauren Weisberger's novels interesting - or worse -- want to immulate them. Her characters claim to have depth and individuality but are more shallow than not and they easily fall in with the mooing herd.Lauren Weisberger seems to be attempting to belittle the world she apparently inhabits. Instead, she pays it homage in a twisted way.Whatever she intends with this book, it isn't worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This Light Read...","review":"I'm so disappointed. I'm forcing myself to finish EWK. Although I thoroughly enjoyed The Devil Wears Prada, the author's second book is tedious, tiresome and devoid of likeable characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"one word: badif you could arrest books for all around sucking, this one would be the first to go in handcuffs."},{"rating":"1","title":"American Psycho...without the irony.","review":"Or the social satire.Save your money - and buy a new pair of Prada shoes - at your local outlet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The dialog was trite, the writing and grammar poor, the plot non-existent, the main character spoiled and self-indulgent. For some reason this author's characters always walk out on jobs when the going gets rough. Bette, the main character in this book does it twice. It is a boring book. Not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame!","review":"Lauren Weisberger is a poor -- a very poor -- writer. This book is lame, predictable, poorly written, and BORING. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Worth Reading","review":"I couldn't wait to buy this book after getting SUCH a kick out of The Devil Wears Prada. Surprisingly, I was drawn into the world of high fashion. This book is a GREAT disappointment and I had no interest in non-stop references to NYC nightlife and the shallow world of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I absolutley loved this book. When I got to the very last page the only reason I was dissapointed was because it was ending. I def recommend it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just reread the Devil Wears Prada","review":"If you've read the Devil Wears Prada, then you've read this book as well. The only thing that changes is the characters' names and jobs. It was a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable & RACIST","review":"After reading Devil Wears Prada, this book was a let down. It was too predictable and the main character Bette was just plain silly and had no personality.I also wanted to complain about the RACIST stereotypical remarks about Vietnamese cooking dog, black people being nannies (perpetuates African Americans being servants and inferior), exploiting Mexicans for cheap labor, the country of Turkey being uncivilized, etc. It was VERY INAPPROPRIATE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor me protagonist - again!","review":"Everyone Worth Knowing is basically a rewrite of The Devil Wears Prada set in a PR scene. Decadence, extreme wealth, party-hopping, and the glamour crowds have never seemed so shallow, so unattractive. This is not to say the book is not somewhat entertaining, and readable; it is. It delivers what it sets out to deliver. I just wish Weisberger would take on a topic that is more interesting to those of us in the real world. Also, Weisberger's protagonists never have enough backbone to suit me. Let's see a strong woman in the next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good sophomore effort","review":"After reading and seeing The Devil Wears Prada, I picked this book up for a vacation read and was pleasantly surprised by it. I had seen such lukewarm reviews for it last year and had thought the author might be a one trick pony, but that is certainly not the case. While the book is undoubtedly light in tone and the characters aren't as gleefully evil or fleshed out as in the author's first book, this is a fun and fast look at the glamorous, and unglamorous, scene that is the city and its neverending PR machine.This is a safe choice for a light summer read."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've Read This","review":"I enjoyed The Devil Wears Prada and also was on a 'big city chick lit' kick so I decided to pick this one up. UGH. Not good. The concepts were so similar to other books in this genre and to TDWP book that I repeatedly wondered why the publisher put this one out. A few of the concepts were overdone - women not eating, the gal being overworked and ignored, etc.The author has writing talent, I just think she needs some new material. Such a shame that the publisher put this one out. It's getting blasted and I don't think it is the author's fault. I guess this is what happens when you push a deadline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful","review":"I occasionally appreciate light, fluffy novels, but there is no excuse for meandering plots, unsympathetic characters with inconsistent personalities, and all around bad writing. And this is the edited, published version. Stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored, Quit Reading It","review":"I quit reading this after chapter 5. The storyline didn't capture my attention at all. I didn't care about Bette, the main character, and up to that point, the other characters didn't have any character. They seemed like stereotpypes of 27 year olds. Disappointing after The Devil Wears Prada."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"This is not the Devil Wears Prada, it is simply a poor copy of the same book. Do not waste your money. I agree if you must read it get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!","review":"It took me 2 weeks and a bit to read this book. Do you know why? Because it was SO BORING! Nothing really happens and just when you thought something was going to, it doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed. Don't waste your time!","review":"This book was an immense disappointment. I was about half-way done with the book when I felt that it wasn't even worth continuing. This book is a major let-down and a total snooze-fest. It almost felt like torture trying to get through this one, and that's highly unusual for me considering my intense love for all things \\"chick lit\\". Don't bother with this garbage. \\"The Devil wears Prada\\" was a fantastic read though! I don't know what happened..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny but Name-dropping annoying","review":"I really liked this book. I'm working as a receptionist part-time this summer and I read this book yesterday. It was funny and light, and I could visualize everything like it was on the movie screen. It is predictable but the tone makes it enjoyable. Although it entertained, I don't like the low moral standards of just about every character in the book but that is par for the course with chick-lit. I got sick of the constant name-dropping, I understand some was necessary but come-on already. I love her style and while I agree with those saying Devil Wears Prada is bascially the exact same format as this, it is still a fun read and just don't read the two back-to-back. The relationship between Bette & Penelope was spot-on and more real than usual for this genre. I could relate to them, but Micheal seemed excess...but more than likely that was intended. Great beach read or for making work enjoyable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"The main character \\"Bette\\" was actually pretty likeable to me and not some annoying whiny character. It also ended with all the loose ends tied up. It was entertaining and fun to read about the life of a party planner even though the book is fiction. I do recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun read but keep expectations low","review":"I read the Devil Wears Prada and didn't get the hype. I just wasn't impressed with the plot, characters or writing. Thought I'd give this one a try as the plot sounded more interesting. It was. It's a fun voyeuristic look at NYC club life, but it's pretty predictable. Figured out by the second mention who Ellie Insider really is; Phillip Weston character got old fast; romantic interest plot was a little cheesy and elements seemed thrown together to see that side of story through - especially towards the end. That said, I'd read it again as a guilty pleasure. If you are looking for an easy no-thinking-necessary read, this one fits the bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was.... how should I say it?...an okay book....","review":"I read this book when my sister let me borrow it after reading Devil Wears Prada by the same author. And... well... it's not really all it's hyped up to be. It followed the same kind of plotline as Devil Wears Prada, but like the other reviewers said, it lacked the memorable Miranda. Instead it substituted with some celebrity names, droppings of crack and bulimia and some wild parties that were monotonously narrated word for word. It got to be sort of the same thing over and over again. Don't get me wrong, after the slow beginning it got going and became \\"worth reading\\" once her love interest kicked in. But then it fell sort of flat and became a chore to read. Bottom line is, its a great book for a lazy do-nothing weekend but if you want something with substance to write home about- I'd suggest either Devil Wears Prada or another book in the ChickLit genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Devil Wears Prada Part Two","review":"Same pathetic main character with no back-bone. I only read up until the part where she has to leave her best friends going-away party to attend some \\"Crucial-must be there\\" meeting for her boss-on a Saturday. I closed the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored thirty pages in","review":"I guess that kind of says it all. I read 80 pages waiting for the book to get interesting but it never did. I found myself skimming to page 100 which is the kiss of death for a book. The people are shallow but not interesting. One good thing though, my copy is a library book, didn't cost me anything and I can just give it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not again","review":"Another tedious addition to the genre of 'poor me, look at the horrid / crazy people I work for' books. DWP was a rather interesting insight into the fashion mag world but I really don't see what the point of this book is. The plot is fantastic (in the old fashioned sense of the word) and alienatingly ludicrous. Guilty pleasure it is not.Please don't waste your life reading this. I did, and I shall never stop regretting it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycling is good - just not for plots","review":"I never read The Devil Wears Prada, though I did see the movie. And from what I can tell this is just the same story wearing different Jimmy Choos. It's the same formula retold with slightly less believable characters. It was okay, but nothing new or exciting - definitely predictable, and not in a good way. I can only hope she breaks out of this mold if she writes another book, because it's getting old fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining enough but leaves much to be desired","review":"I was excited to read this book because I loved Devil Wears Prada. Unfortunately Everyone Worth Knowing lacks sufficient character development and follows along the predictable path of her first novel. The cast of characters are predictable and cliche. The main character failed to have much charm or relatability. Overall, the book was very flat without any real connection with the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable enthralling novel.","review":"Forget those comparisions to Garcia-Marquez, Mr. Mestre's achievement is his and his alone.

I am not a fan of fiction, but when i started reading Toby-Potter's the Average Human I was completely enthralled by her mastery of language, and character development. It is a rich, dark novel with so many twists, you may feel as if yo uwill lose yourself, but everything comes back full circle. Everything ties itself back together beautifully and one is left with the imagery, the beauty and the tragedy of the town of Loomis. It's incredible that it is only her first novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"This novel should be made into a movie","review":"I read this book cover-to-cover in 2 days - I couldn't put it down. Toby-Potter's characters have the kind of quirkiness about them that one finds in an Anne Tyler novel. Her character development is so graphic that I could visualize certain actors in a movie version of this story. (For one, I see Philip Seymour Hoffman cast as Frank.) Toby-Potter's writing is rich and bold throughout this unusual and compelling story. A remarkable first novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful Writing","review":"Hard to believe this is a first novel by Ms. Toby-Potter. The writing is masterful.

This was positively one of the worst books I have ever read in my life. My advice is to run, not walk, away from this one!! There was no development of characters and truthfully, we are probably better off for it! Additionally, the characters are so unsavory that you can't help despising everyone in the book. I was left counting the pages until it was over. This was a choice for our Book Club and was chosen based on all of the wonderful reviews it received.

To be honest, I wasn't that interested, but she persisted, did the research, and said this was the machine to get. Boy, was she right. I love this thing. I went from never working out to running 2 miles a day and lifting weights five to six days a week. This machine is solid, but amazingly compact for what it offers. The quality rivals what you see in gyms, and it has a lifetime guarantee. I'm in the best shape of my life now, and enjoy working out on this machine.

The shows first season, and maybe second, is on black and white and that is the way it should be. The colorizing is terrible.

In the controversy over B&W; verses color, I have to say...please, do yourself a favor and buy the COLOR version. I almost made the mistake of buying the B&W; until, fortunately, I read the reviews here and realized color was even available. I just received my color version in the mail and am thrilled at how stunning and realistic it is. The mid-sixties fashions are awsome in color! And here's the big secret: If you're feeling nostalgic and want to view the first season in puritan B&W;, simply turn off the color on your TV! How simple!!!Buy the color version, and have both!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Did The Colorising?

Of course, we were not among the few who had gotten color television sets when they first came out but I was glad that they did not colorize the Black and White episodes. I just ordered the last of the whole series and I can't wait to get it. Do yourself a favor, spend some time reading the customer reviews and only purchase from the studios that own the rights to the original prints of the shows. I got burned by purchasing another show from another site and it was horrible. I ended up giving it away. If you liked Bewitched, THE WHOLE SERIES IS A MUST HAVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising controversy","review":"I am a little surprised about the continuing discussion as to which version is better, the colour or black-and-white. To each his own, I suppose, but for me there is no choice--I'll watch the show as originally shot. I'm not even curious to see it in colour. A note, however, to those people who say that if you don't like the \\"enhanced\\" version, just to turn off the colour on your television set. Well, that doesn't work, really. When colour is added, the original image is altered--values of light and dark are changed, etc. So watching the colourized version on a black-and-white set will NOT give you the same effect as watching an original black-and-white print."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black and White is the Best","review":"I always liked Dick York better than Dick Sargent. He was the perfect foil for Endora, who found no end of pleasure in casting bad spells on him. But, this was Elizabeth Montgomery's show as the perky Samantha who could turn Darrin on with a twitch of her nose, even if he didn't marry her for her magic. The first season sets up the scenario which would be greatly elaborated on in years hence, with a slough of television celebrities doing guests spots. I always liked Bernard Fox as Dr. Bombay, who had to be called in to remedy some of the most vexing situations Endora cast Darrin into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best show EVER created.","review":"Bewitched has got to be the best show ever created.

That is totally part of it's charm. I wouldn't even consider for one moment buying the colorized versions of the black and white seasons. I liken it to colorizing the Twilight Zone episodes or Alfred Hitchcock. There are some things you don't mess with.These black and white episodes take us back to a time that was more simple and yet oh so comfortable. If you're a true Bewitched fan as I am, you will relish watching and re-watching these wonderful episodes in their original, fabulous black and white.And how beautiful was Elizabeth Montgomery is these episodes. To me, the Grace Kelly of the small screen. So elegent. A true beauty from any angle. Durwood was a lucky man. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was Bewitched by the color version","review":"I struggled with the decision to buy the DVD set in the original black & white or color. I have seen some earlier films that have been colorized and I did not like them but I am happy to report that \\"Bewitched\\" in color has surpassed my expectations. From the very first episode, I just couldn't believe my eyes at how rich the colors were and how natural it looked. I have a high definition upscaling DVD player and a 30\\" HDTV and if there were going to be any flaws in the colorized version, I am sure they would have shown up on my set. I was a huge fan of the show when I was a kid (born in 1964)and I have never seen any of season 1 or 2 in the original black and white. I am falling in love with Elizabeth Montgomery all over again.

There are so many pages that tell to you refer to another page that it really is impossible to leave the page you are on...go find the page he refers you too...and get back to where you left off.

That means I would drink 260 ounces or 33 8-ounce glasses or over two gallons a day. Has he never heard of hyponatremia?

Save yourself the trouble of reading a badly constructed book and read the \\"Candidate's Guide\\" by Smallwood--many of the same insights and you get to skip the wooden characters and bad dialogue. The basis of \\"Core Values\\" can be summed up in a sentance--the honor code can be used by a rival to destroy a fellow cadet, but things have gotten better and there are more safegaurds in place that can prevent that from occurring.

It truly is an edgy and innovative album, still it doesn\`t quite suceed at providing a cohesive and very solid final result. It has some intriguing moments and soundscapes, mostly those produced by Atari Teenage Riot\`s Alec Empire, who creates a couple of dark and hypnotic gems here, still overall it only makes for a different enough yet average listen. It\`s not easy on the ears at times, and a share of songs are really impenetrable.

However, this book was disappointing in that it took until page 32 to get to the meat of the matter. Long introductory chapters seemed endless and were repetitive, redundant and boring (such as the author's backstory).

Of course he didn't do this all the time, but still I found it annoying.However, on this CD his voice is the best I have ever heard it. I feel that it sounds more full and careful then some of the notes that almost made my throat ache in the way he sang them. I think he's finally found his own style and niche.My Favorites: Pray For The Love, The Alchemist, Amore e Musica, II Gladiator.The others are good too but these are my favorite tracks to listen too.

The first cut, Amore Musica, just makes you sing along with him. He takes you on a very emotional trip with his choice of songs, each one better than the one before. I read somewhere someone wrote \\"with this album, the BOY IS GONE AND HERE IS THE MAN. I walk with God and Magia Sara are very special and has a lot of meaning to Russell and his fans.

The only advantage of losing your hearing is if you have a nagging wife, ;) but even that is not good.It can be challenging to install the ear plugs because you have to roll them as small as possible and insert them before they expand, but with practice you become proficient and once you hearing is gone you can never get it back.Same brand that I use at work, so purchasing them was an easy choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Howard Leight MAX-30 Corded Foam Earplugs","review":"My huband requested these Howard Leight MAX-30 Corded Foam Earplugs and says that it is just what he was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I bought the ear plugs for studying, and they worked great.

I actually get used to them so much after about an hour that I forget they are in.The Cord is great if you have a tendency to lose your ear plugs or you need to take them in and out a lot, for while not in a noisy area they can hang on your neck.Best Earplugs for the price. Nice db rating drop as well and they work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes Wordy","review":"This is one of the better books for a course in international finance. It has cases in the text, which allows the student to get the real world intuition of the topics that are being covered. This is not a text that only extends capital budgeting to an international setting, it also includes some concepts borrowed from international economics (e.g. purchasing power parity, interest rate parity, covered interest arbitrage, etc.). It also looks into some risk management practices that are relevant for multinational corporations. However, I feel that some topics could have been cut short and the author just wanted to add a few (hundred) more pages to the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does not get any better than this","review":"This is a comprehensive and masterfully written book; all MBA students and anybody doing business in or curious about the global economy will benefit from reading this work. All the fundamental principles of the field are clearly described and extensive real-world examples and case studies are given in which principles are synthesized and analyzed to create a very understandable and thorough learning framework. The result is one of the best textbooks I have ever read. The complex subjects of exchange rates, international monetary system, currency forecasting, country risk, foreign exchange rates, currency futures and options, swaps and interest rate derivatives, translation and transaction exposure, measuring and managing economic exposure, corporate strategy and capital budgeting for the multinational corporation, and more are covered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Multinational Financial Management","review":"It is use full, but if I didn't have it for a class I would not purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful what you buy","review":"This is NOT a text. There are many reviews that this is a text. It is not. It is a very small book with about 40 pages of activities. It appears to go with some kind of text. This I am not sure of. I purchased this item based on reviews. I was disappointed, thinking I had found (based on reviews) a great text. So just want to warn future buyers. If you are however looking for a small paperback packet this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardrive failed after 13 months","review":"The warrenty is good for 12 months so I am out the cost of this unit minus my 13 months of use but I would expect this type of equipment to last much longer. It is a nice looking unit but it has no long term reliability in my experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke.....the yoke","review":"Broke after \\"over torquing\\"....frankly from the grain structure of the cast iron, this material is just not up to the job. Would not think of purchasing again...there are parrot vises out there made of steel...find one and use that. This vise was simply not acceptable for any cost. Two stars because Amazon took care of the return and made it easy....at least you can purchase from them with confidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Looking","review":"I purchased this vise for gunsmithing work. It is incapable of holding an item with any real force. The jaws have chipped and chunked since I have been using in over two years. When received the tension screw was off-centered and crudely made. I can't believe how poorly it was made compared to other vises. I would not recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vise","review":"Action screw is rough, feels like poor machining.

It's very good quality and versatile - just what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"pos","review":"I bought this vise On January 5 from Amazon. I used it a moderate amount of times with no complaints. The other day I was clamping a 1/4 in. rod and felt something give. The piece that secures the vise from rotating broke. On inspection the metal casting is of poor quality. I called shop fox and wouldn't you know there is no replacement part. I now have a vise that is totally useless. This vise is good for securing small items of plastic only. Don't waste your time or money. A real POS."},{"rating":"1","title":"The metal latch bangs into the door","review":"The swinging latch bangs into the door in the locked position, denting it. Had to stick a felt pad on it.

This is a great way to add a little extra security to your home or apartment."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for doors with moulding","review":"The quality of these items is indisputable; they are durable and hotel-grade door locks. However, I was extremely disappointed to find that these are NOT for doors with an elevated molding. My back door has a pretty thick (3/4ths of an inch) molding around it and this item will not properly fit doors as such. Both the door and the wall must be flat and at an even surface with each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice additional safety device for you main door","review":"Sturdy: 9/10Looks: 9/10Ease of use: 10/10LIke the fact that once it is activated, you can leave the door ajar and nobody can completely open the door from the outside. Unless they have pneumatic tools, of course :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Handsome, sturdy and well-made.","review":"What more can I say?
