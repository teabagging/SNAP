I understand Fitzgerald died while writing this book, and it is a shame because it had much potential, but as it stands it is incomplete and quite frankly, it reads like a rough draft. Still, a good edition for Fitzgerald scholars.

I had high hopes that I would enjoy the read because I like the author's style, but I found this book lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"A promising start, but not much substance to this novel","review":"I was disappointed there was not more substance to this novel. Fitzgerald was less than halfway finished when he died, and the seventeen \\"completed\\" episodes were in obvious need of re-editing. Judging from the author's notes, they would have been revised extensively anyway to fit his shifting vision of how the plot would evolve. There are moments of clever satire on the Hollywood Industry (and especially its writers) that would probably have made the finished product well worth reading, but Fitzgerald was still struggling to balance the satirical tone of his novel with the love story of its protagonists. The editor's notes were very helpful, though, inasmuch as they showed what direction Fitzgerald wanted to take and the alternate endings he had in mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete even though it is unfinished","review":"The funny thing about this book is that it was never, and will never be, finished.

As a novelist myself, I found this work-in-progress comforting, because it showed that even the greatest writers struggle with \\"The Process.\\" Fitzgerald's inherent talent shines through, despite the incomplete nature of the work. The notes and other addenda helped shape the story even further for me, leaving it perhaps more fascinating for the wonder of what Fitzgerald might have done had he not died so young. I have groused in the past about the release of several Hemingway books after his death, and none has come close to the feeling of this unfinished work, but I cannot dispute the value to the reader of seeing these words, these last words, of one of America's greatest novelists. I am happy I got the chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for travelers","review":"I purchased my first one of these a few years ago, but then couldn't find it when I was going on a cruise this past year.

Can't anyone think of something new?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable to say the least!!","review":"This movie is absolutely nothing. It left nothing to the imagination. Not only that, this movie isn't scary, nor is it horror, it is nothing more than a bland suspense thriller at best. A suspense thriller with very little thrills or chills, and certainly nothing that would leave you on the edge of your seat. Truthfully, they left a lot of holes in the story. I wished they would've explained to me why, or what motive, these men had for doing these things to these people. With that said, eveything else was just more of the same. In fact, anyone who has seen their fair share of suspense thrillers could've figured out the plot and about her cellmate early on in the film just as I did. My sypnosis is that you rent this movie if you have nothing else better to do for about an hour and a half, but please DON'T! buy this because you'll have wasted your money if you do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Film","review":"After reading all the other reviews and just finishing watching the movie myself, I would have to agree with the people who thought they wasted and hour and a half. This was by far one of the worst movies of the year. The actress was hot, but the plot sucked. Saw and Hostile were ten times better. This movie is pointless. Their is a common pattern within the movie that made me want to kill myself. Don't waste your money even renting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly edited, poorly written, pointless movie","review":"This movie is garbage. You can tell they did reshoots, presumably to improve the movie, because Elisha Cuthbert's hair randomly alternates between her hair and a really bad wig. The reshoots did not improve the movie, but leave me wondering how much worse was it before if this is better? Pruitt Taylor Vince is in it. If you don't know his name, he's the fat guy that jiggles his eyes in everything he's ever been in. I guess some casting director thinks that's a good thing for horror movies. It actually was effective the first time he did it, but come on, come up with something new. He does the eye jiggle in EVERYTHING. It was over used by the time he was cast in Constantine and I'm totally over it by the time he shows up in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captive to this movie for 85 minutes","review":"I'm not a big fan of torture cinema, especially if the audience are the ones being tortured. This movie was so terrible I had to fight to sit all the way through it. Ms Cuthbert is easy on the eyes, but her character was so shallow she was hard to identify with. And there wasn't really a whole lot done to her. When the male captive is first brought in its easy to see where things are going, and the big reveal is a letdown. A better movie, with better acting, is BROKEN."},{"rating":"2","title":"held captive... at least a little","review":"Captivity is both an overdone bloodfest, and a tastefully conceived dramatic psychoplay. If you hate the former, focus on the latter, because when you do, this movie plays out quite well. The feeling of Elisha's character being already held captive by an adoring public and ridiculous ideals set by an anorexically unhealthy modeling industry and public expectationsis well portrayed. The bond she forms with another captive prisoner is plausible and even understandable in this horrifying predicament. Unfortunately, the plot twists are forseen far, far before the director decides to alert us, and the bloody nasty array of torture and psychological bombardment by the captors is unnecessarily brutal. Still, these faults aside, Captivity is a worthy watch if just to see how it turns out. Like the accident on the side of the road, you dont want to look, but you just cant look away either... you're held in.... Captivity. 3.75 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same ............","review":"Here we go again...we know what will happen, these films are startingto all look alike...bad people killing their victims...lots of crying..blah blah blah.

Some have compared it to Hostel. It is no knockoff of that movie, and only has some loose elements of it. It is a bit gory at times, but I have seen worse. That having been said, without giving any spoilers, don't get too comfortable, with what you think is happening. The director has thrown some curves. I first saw Elisha Cuthbert in \\"The Girl Next Door\\" and she did a good job in this. This is a good watchable film, and will be enjoyed by most Horror fans in my opinion. Charlie S."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Its a sure sign that a film doesn't work for me when not once during this film was I scared. Sure during one of the torture scenes I wanted to look away, but that wasn't fear, more disgust at the nature of the events going on. Really I can't see much point to a film like this. You see it once, for the 'thrill', and then in my case I've vowed never to watch it again. In that respect its a bit like Hostel except not as good (and Hostel was not that good itself).The plot was fairly predictable, the acting ok and the music a rip-off of the Halloween theme. All rather pointless in my view. Furthermore to call it torture porn (whatever that means) is really over the top. Elisha Cuthbert is a great looking actress, but apart from one non-torture scene her dignity remains intact during the film.In summary I would say don't buy unless very cheap, because its not scary, and overall I would say it really isn't worth watching at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"This movie was't all that, It had some very creepy scences, but I just was to blah.

The knives are horrible, flimsy, and do not cut well. Knives are not weighted properly and therefore do not cut straight but always veer to one side or the other-big safety hazzard! The only knives that are really worth anything in this set are the steak knives and the bread knife. They actually work pretty well. I will probably chuck out most of the knives (hate to give them to charity as I don't want anyone getting hurt with them) and use the block to store my better knives.

They aren't quite as sharp as they used to be, though you can still cut (by tearing), since they're serrated.I didn't realize these were serrated - I just saw that they were Henckels and on sale. Next time, read the description carefully.Most of the people who have used these knives haven't been really impressed with them. Unlike unserrated knives, these require a slight sawing motion to cut; it makes a mess of slicing tomatoes. It's very difficult to sharpen serrated knives, so you'll have to get it done by a professional.If I'd known that these were serrated, I wouldn't have bought them so I could save my money for a real Henckels set.Also, the additional cheese knife doesn't fit into the block, so some knife has to go in a drawer."},{"rating":"2","title":"So sharp my husband cut off half his finger the first time!","review":"Really sharp.

Otherwise, I wouldn't suggest these knives. They are too flimsy, the handles are made of cheap plastic and they are serrated.

Sure I'd love to have a set of top-grade Henckels but given the price of something like that plus the fact that we don't use knives that often, I figured this second-tier set was worth a try. The knives are nice and sharp. The construction quality is decent and it suits our purposes fine - they look good, cut well and fit in the block like they are supposed to.

The knives are sharp and functional, you have to read the pamphlet and take care of them as instructed and they will last longer.I am the type of person that would spend the more money on quality items when given the opportunity, and agree that these knives are not top of the line but unless you are a professional chef or a serious hobbyist these will do just fine.These are great knives for the busy family on a tight budget.================================Five year update: we still have the knives, they are still sharp.

You are better of buying one nice chefs knife and one pairing knife. Try W��sthof, Global or Shun, you will not regret. A good well taken care of knife will last you a lifetime. Don't waste your money on a set with the quality you'd expect to find at a 99 cent store. The W��sthof Classic 2-Piece Knife Starter Set can be found around $99.

When I saw these, there were more included with the set & for a fraction of a fraction of the price! $29??? Are you kidding me? (or was it $39) Who cares!!!! I bought these right away. It's been 6+ months now & they are GREAT! Anyone shooting these down are nothing more than some kitchen utensil snobs who have nothing better to do with their money. I don't need $400 knives. If I buy these & they only last me 2-3 years... I STILL can't go wrong for the quality & price!I suggest you read the negative reviews on this product & notice how \\"stuck up\\" they sound.

I was excited when I first got them...with a name like Henkels and the ever sharp \\"everedge\\" blade, how could I go wrong? Believe me, you don't want the \\"everedge\\" blade unless you like ripping everything. That's pretty much what your doing with these knives, sawing everything instead of slicing or cutting. For delicate things (i.e. cutting sashimi) it just won't do!!! Serrated fine for some purposes (i.e. bread knife), you just don't want it on every knife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality knives","review":"Received the Henckel Everedge knives yesterday, and I will be returning them. They are Farberware quality at best. The fact that Amazon advertised these knives in their flyer included in the Sunday Globe, and that they claim the list price is $100, is a joke.

They were awful! I couldn't cut raw sweet potatoes with them. They have a tiny serrated edge (thus the claim to be \\"ever sharp\\"). If you are looking for a good set of knives, do yourself a favor and get the real thing. I use Chicago knives in my kitchen and just keep an edge on them -- I only have to sharpen them a few times a year. I've had them for decades. I also have Henkels, but prefer the Chicago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Crap, Even at This Price","review":"I bought these with the intention of gifting them. I wasn't looking for high end cutlery, just a cheap but well made set of knives. I would be embarrassed to present these to someone. You could pick up knives of comparable quality at the dollar store.These knives are shoddy, and shouldn't be sold for more than $[...]. The handles are made of cheap plastic, are uncomfortable, and poorly balanced. The blades are too thin, too flexible, and they are all serrated (fine if you want to tear rather than cut your food I guess).For the price you can do a lot better. I immediately returned this item when I saw the poor quality. Henckel should be ashamed to put their name on this garbage.I picked up a set of Cooks brand cutlery from J.C. Penny for about the same price with full tang riveted handles, fairly balanced, and smooth bladed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Everyday Knives","review":"My biggest complaint is that these knives feel very light in the hand. But, after three years of rigorous daily use, I can confirm that they're sturdy and still look like new. If you're an experienced cook or professional chef, you already know that a $35 set of knives won't cut it (pun intended). But, for the rest of us, they work fine. And you can impress your friends when they see the Henckels logo on the butcher block. Just don't let them pick up one of these featherweight knives or you'll be exposed as the wannabe you really are!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set","review":"3 years later this knives are still very sharp and look like the day I bought them.

Jeffs mothermoved out when he was seven an a half. His father which he called the\\"Professor didnt show him any kind of affection and was very impasive toward everyone. Jeffs dad was a professor at the university where they lived. Then he met this man by the name of Brother Thomas which was a cathlic minister. Brother Thomas showed him quite a bit of affection. Then when he was twelve he went and visted his mother and she showed him a lot of affection and loved him very dearly.She met this guy and kind of let their relationship get farther apart. I encourage you to read the book to see what happens next."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Poignant, touching, a joy forever\\"","review":"I loved the book, first I read On Fortune's Wheel and then I found a Solitary Blue. I love the book as it made me think more about things, life. It was poignant and touching, some parts made me want to cry. I really liked Jeff, he was so brave and so strong mentally. I also liked Dicey - those two matched well. I recommend to anyone to read this book. It pulls at your heart strings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Good read; very complex, but not as good as Dicey's Song, which was nearly a masterpiece.

When he meets Dicey Tillerman and her family, his problems seem to just melt away. This beautifully written book by Cynthia Voight has many meanings. It also can reach inside and pull out your emotions. Her books have a special meaning about love or unity. The imagery makes the reader a part of the story as a character. In the end, Dicey and Jeff grow closer together, and he feels like he is united with a real family."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great and entertaining book-i would reccommend to anyone.","review":"A solitary blue was a very touching, entertaining book. I definately enjoyed reading it. It was hard to put down.I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good book to read. Although the book was a little sad at times, it was definately a very humorous, modern time book. The story was about a boy who had to choose between his parents, and was often alone. He made friends with the Tillerman family, and pretty soon, he had his life on track. At the end of the story, he finally chooses that he wants to be with the parent that actually acted like a parent, and that he loved..... his father. At the end of the story, Jeff told his mom off, but also made peace with her, because all along he knew what she really wanted-- money, and a daughter. A solitary blue is definately worth buying, it keeps your attention, and is great for \\"a rainy day\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great companion to Dicey's Song","review":"Like Dicey's Song, A Solitary Blue deals with tough subjects many kids deal with in their lives, namely parents' separation and all the feelings that accompany it. Jeff discovers great qualities in himself and his father through a traumatic reunion with the mother who left him years ago.The characters in this series are people who feel like misfits. They all manage to learn to accept and like themselves and find friends without having to sacrifice who they are. My favorite aspect of this series is that reading this book, Dicey's Song, and Come a Stranger, the reader gets the impression that Voigt wrote them all simultaneously. All three contain different characters' experiences of some of the same events in varied degree of detail and fullness depending on the character's involvement in the events.I highly recommend this series for teens and young adults. The books do contain some meaty subject matter, but Voigt handles it sensitively."},{"rating":"1","title":"ATTENTION INSOMNIACS !! THIS BOOK WILL DO THE TRICK.","review":"Whne I was younger (3rd,4th,5th grade) my mother would read a chapter of a book to me every night before I went to bed. When we picked Solitary Blue and settled into or normal routine, we were horrified. This deathly boring book drew my mother and I into deep slumber. Both of us are avid and articulate readers who are usually appreciative of all styles, but this book was bad, and I mean BAD. Maybe I was too young to appreciate this moaning boy and Cynthia Voight's drawn out, meandering and POINTLESS plot. But years later after tryin again, I still couldn't get past the 3/4 mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was very interesting, but the ending could be better.","review":"I thought the book was great.

It was easy to read and did not require any deep thought. I found that it WAS quite predictable. You were able to guess exactly what was going to happen and you KNEW that there was going to be a happy ending no matter what.I think that a little more conflict or more to the plot would have made this book a bit more of a challenge and a little bit more entertaining. I enjoy books where the main characters have more spunk. However, it was a fairly decent book that managed to keep my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous plot line","review":"What a dissapointment. Too many characters and unbelievable plot lines. Not at all entertaining. You expect some fantasy but this was way out there with all the sisters having \\"unusual talents\\".

I ordered the blue-and-white D9525 product as shown, which includes a two-minute timer (as a reviewer on the Web page pointed out), but Unbeatable Sales sent me a D9013, which is pink and white and does not include a timer. I assumed that the product I'd received was an equivalent (it is also called a \\"Plak Control\\" toothbrush) until I opened the package and used it. The 9013 is not an equivalent to the one shown on the Amazon site (and which I've owned before) because it doesn't include a timer. The photo accompanying this product description should be changed to reflect the real toothbrush received, and the current customer review noting the timer should be edited to delete that information.

Would not stay sharp and kept returning them-finally had enough and went for the Twin Select. Best choice-the best knifes we have ever owned! Worth every penney we spent! They do an incredible job and feel perfect in your hand. The Henckel Company truly stands behind their product and only want their cutomers to be happy. It's such a pleasure to have good knifes that do a beautiful job - you will never be disappointed with this choice. From a very satisfied customer !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much to be believed","review":"I hate to rain on the parade of stars for this book, but I honestly thought it was totally unbelievable. I had read Sullivan's Island which was funny and convincing most of the time, so I was looking forward to reading this book next. I have to say that except for in a few chapters, the story is just too ridiculous. It has too many underdeveloped characters and plot ideas. Anna, the narrator, takes ONE walk on the beach and meets the perfect man. She buys a new house and starts her own business and has parties and on and on without the least problem. It is such a fantasy, it's hard to feel convinced. The author has talent, but she needs to slow down and think through her plot a little better. I'm getting tired of so many sterotypes in southern fiction. This had potential- it was just overdone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Isle of Palms......My favorite place on earth","review":"(Short and sweet review).

I enjoyed this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was confused at the end....","review":"This was my first time reading Frank and I do have to say I loved her conversational, breezy, style of writing.Have to agree with some other reviews here though...toward the end, the story seemed to drag and some of the dialogue wasn't realistic.BUT what really got me was, I got confused on the Epilogue...it was about a wedding for somebody named \\"Susan.\\" I had to stop and say, \\"Wait a sec! WHO is Susan?\\" I honestly do not remember this character in the story. Her best friend was Franni, neighbor was Lucy, etc. I just didn't understand why the author chose to tell us readers about a wedding with this Susan, when Susan played a very insignificant part in the entire novel. If it were Franni's wedding, I'd certainly have understood. So just call me confused.I will, however, get to the library to now read Sullivan's Island and then possibly more of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read - just don't get caught up in the details","review":"Not Dottie's best, but a fun read anyway. Not exactly believable circumstances or characters. Just read it for entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortuately, disappointing","review":"Having read Plantation, I was looking forward to this book, but I have to say I agree with the reader from Charlottesville. This story is largely unbelievable, mostly because the author didn't develop her characters enough. What was the point of Grandmother Violet even being in the book? She was supposed to be a real b----, but I only got the sense of a cardboard figure.And Lucy, who is portrayed as a real ditz, conveniently enough has sold a bundle of stock right before the market dropped (!). Huh?! And just loans a boodle to Anna, the narrator, so she can open up a salon. That just strained credulity for me.It's a rapid read, and I read the whole thing, but there is just too much deus ex machina. I liked the narrator, Anna Abbott; I just wish the characters were more developed and the plot less fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't put it down!","review":"I have read all of Dot's books and can't wait for the next one.......Her humor is fablous and her style of writing keeps you reading.......I always feel I am right there with the characters......BRAVO"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book by Ms. Frank","review":"After spending 15 years of my life in South Carolina (2 of which were in Mt.

Basically I didn't really care about the characters so I didn't give a toss what happened to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling Apart at the Seams","review":"After a slightly corny start, the novel proceeds to draw the reader in to an authentic world with vivid characters. (I have spent part of every summer on this island for the past 20 years.)I couldn't put it down...until about 3/4's of the way through, when it completely fell apart. It became tedious,boring,and predictable, as if the author herself had gotten tired of the project and wanted nothing more than to hasten its end. Certain themes were never resolved; others were rushed to an early,trite conclusion.It's sad, because she really had something good going for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paperback","review":"This is a very reputable seller.

As in his book \\"Nuclear Weapons\\" (ISBN 0965652076), the font is large and a portion of the book is given over to reproduction of other articles.All in all, not really worth even the small price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banal","review":"I am halfway through this book and can't seem to get past the insipid writing...this seems like something written by an 8th grade student."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much griping, ending too pat","review":"I wanted to like this book, but I found the main character, Charlotte, to be whiny and boring. Instead of taking control and trying to change the things she didn't like about her life, she just complained about them. Each chapter began with a long, drawn out memory of some awful experience related to the debut of one of her books. I found myself liking her sister, Emily, much better than I liked Charlotte, which was unfortunate for a book told in the first-person. Then, after I spent 90% of the book waiting for Charlotte to just get on with things, the author wrapped it all up in a nice, tidy little package - only slightly longer and with slightly more details than \\"and they all lived happily ever after.\\" It was a disappointing read - I'm glad I got it from the library and was just as happy to give it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"It's rare that a book really lifts your spirits, but this one does and then some. I was feeling really down in the dumps when I started this one, but by the end I was really motivated to take the first step towards achieving my goals.This is such a great book because it is both painfully realistic - the protaganist hasn't figured out what to do with her life, all her romantic prospects are distinctly unimpressive and she's losing the battle of the bulge - and at the same time it's also uplifting and inspirational (especially the ending, which is totally unexpected and utterly charming).I can't wait to read more by this author. If she isn't huge now she deserves to be. Sara Lewis is simply amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"sitcom tedium","review":"The best writing in this book appears at the beginning of each chapter, when Lewis depicts a crushing disappointment in the life of a writer. It's an effective narrative device. Otherwise, it's pure tedium. Most of the positive reviews seem to come from teachers, but for those of us who aren't teachers, the novel seems just a diary of sitcom situations in the classroom, most of which are entirely predictable and with repetition, become boring. Dialogue should move the plot forward, not simply function as an exchange. I read a lot of domestic reality/women's fiction, and almost never put a book down-- especially one I purchased, but this is one that went back on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"An easy read, but I would not recommend it...","review":"While this plot of book was charming in its own way, I'd have to admit that I was greatly disappointed by the story itself. The author made teaching in a public school seem like an undesirable profession and that in the end, anyone could do it (as long as they put on \\"frumpy\\" clothes and took on a Martha Stewart-type persona). It does not seem like the author has ever had any classroom experience because her portrayal of this profession was both unrealistic and stereotypical. I would not recommend this book to anyone in the field of education."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sara is Amazing","review":"Sara knows how to talk to all of us. She lets Charlotte do the talking this time. Frustration, hope, humor, it's all there. She makes you love her while you want to give her a little shake sometimes. If we could only see ourselves the way others see us. When you finish this book you will see the value in Sara, Charlotte and yes, the value in you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another favorite from my favorite author!","review":"Second Draft of my Life is another example of why Sara Lewis is my favorite author. When I finished this book I felt that I had found a new friend in Charlotte Dearborn. I love the way the book is written from Charlotte directly to me, as if she's letting me in on her most private thoughts. The characters are so real that we can see people we know in each one.Second Draft of my Life is a MUST read. It would be a shame to miss out on meeting such an interesting person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electric clock","review":"I was disappointed in this clock because I didn't realize that it can only be used with a recessed electrical receptacle.

I am NOT saying that this book is fatuous. I am NOT saying that it is poorly written. I am NOT saying that its author does not know his Theology. What I am saying is that I read it expecting to learn something new, approaching it as a left-brain dogmatic treatise of some sort, packed with History, Philosophy, Theology, Hermeneutics. To my disappointment, it was nothing of that sort. What I read instead, was a right-brain, artistic book, fluffy, lofty and sentimental. With all due respect to the author, this is not what I had expected when I picked it up. I am willing to concede, though, there is a time and a place to write theology books from an aesthetical perspective.

The description states \\"can be shipped in the United States only\\", then states no refunds and subscription can't be cancelled. I purchased a subscription of this magazine because I'm a big NHL fan in New York. I paid a preimum price for the subscription. Nowhere does it state in the magazine description that the MAGAZINE IS NOT PRINTED IN ENGLISH!!!! I'm not sure what language it is printed in. My best guess is that it's Dutch or German.

The story about the Arachnae (what a surprising name for a spider people) just doesn't make any sense, and the story about a scientist hating Vulcans is even worse. The way McCoy behaves in the story really made me doubt his qualifications as a doctor. The solution to the \\"I hate Vulcans\\" problem is as ridiculous as anything else in the book. The best part, not to say the only good part, is the introduction at the beginning, which is definitely wittier than anything that comes after it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, idiotic sexual fantasies.","review":"This book is the worst Star Trek novel that I have ever read.Kathleen Sky is obsessed with indulging in her adolescent sexualfantasies and subjecting the reader to her preoccupation with meaningless, imbecilic verbal exchanges between a very unprofessional Doctor McCoy and a childish Doctor Tremain. It is ridiculous that a woman who is supposed to be one of the great scientific brains of the galaxy exhibits the intelligence and maturity of a sorority girl who struggles to pass her sociology classes. Kathleen Sky should have written novels about teenage girls who spend their days trading gossip about the twerp actors and musicians covered in Tiger Beat magazine. \\"Vulcan!\\" is a joke and a waste of paper and ink. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"You Call This A Book !","review":"What the hell was Kathleen Sky thinking when she wrote this book. Does she not know about vulcan psychology. How do you mix human emotions with Mr. Spock? The plot was pretty decent I'll give her that, but she needs to seriously go back to the original episodes and try to absorb what makes Spock tick.Stoic, stoic, stoic.

And the fact this one was made by such a young cast and crew made it especially enjoyable to view on a Christmas break afternoon with my tween and teen daughters.No, it's not high cinema. But the story line, acting and production values are at least equal to shows playing on venues like Disney Channel or Nick.This film was directed by Emily Hagins, and we watched it after seeing \\"Zombie Girl: The Movie,\\" a documentary done in 2006 about Hagins, who was then an aspiring 12-year-old director making her first feature length movie.

Good series."},{"rating":"2","title":"magnificent debut","review":"Ah, the heady days of misogyny. Or was it really misanthropy? Rattus is already archetypal Stranglers within the first minute, punk-ish but obviously a band who knew how to play and keep a tune going amid the attitude. There are three undeniable classics here - the sweaty \\"Hanging Around\\", the sneering pseudo-reggae \\"Peaches\\", and the stomping \\"Grip\\" - but plenty more besides. \\"Sometimes\\" propels itself along Dave Greenfield's organ (as it were), \\"London Lady\\" audibly drips with contempt, and \\"Goodbye Toulouse\\" manages to be a thumping, melancholy ballad. \\"Down in the Sewer\\" is a wondrous marriage of punk and prog rock, with a bit of Hank Marvin thrown in. The lyrics throughout the album are probably offensive at times but then if you're the sort of person who listens to the Stranglers you can probably handle it. It's all a bit tame by today's standards anyway. \\"Ugly\\" is, however, rubbish."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO WHAT if it's over a thousand pages?

If you want to leave Wifey (or Hubby) back at the hotel and have an X-rated night in Hawaii, this book helps there, too. If you want to visit all the places that the locals know about but never mention to the tourists, then you definitely want this book. And if you read the first part of this book on the flight from the Mainland to the Islands, you'll know the basics about Hawaii, and you'll actually appreciate what the tour guide shows you and tells you."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"I'm almost half way through my pregnancy, and I received this as a gift and look at it frequently. It's fun to have something to look at every day. It leaves me wishing for something better, though.I wish there were pictures, or at the very least drawings, of the growing babe. The constant warnings about gaining too much weight are lame! It's more dangerous to gain too little than to much, but I feel like every other day, there it is again - don't gain too much! (I haven't even gained any yet, so I'm not being defensive about this.)I agree with others who've said it isn't really a journal. There's almost no room to write anything.I wish it went by the more standard 40 weeks (starting with lpm), rather than 38 weeks starting with conception. It's confusing. I'm not crazy about the way it counts down to the estimate due date, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining ... but Inaccurate!","review":"While the idea of having a book to turn to every day of my pregnancy has been fun, I cannot rely on it for factual information on development and pregnancy recommendations. It's been off by more than a month on certain milestones and my doctor (and other books) disagree with much of the \\"advice\\".The \\"childbirth in other cultures\\" feature is especially interesting. However, I'm not yet ready for the parenting suggestions -- they seem misplaced.Enjoy it, but don't take it too seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate and confusing - buy a different calendar!","review":"Two frustrations with this book - (1) blatant inaccuracies about fetal development and (2) uses date from conception instead of LMP (which is used by everyone else in the entire pregnancy universe). I have had fun with the book, but take everything with a grain of salt. The author needs to brush up on her science!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nonsensical ...","review":"Someone gave me this book, and I found it absolutely maddening. It uses two different systems for counting down to the due date - one based on 280 days from the end of the last period, and one based on 266 days from the date of conception. The author always fails to distinguish which system she is using, and the numbers in the journal relate to one system, whilst the numbers on the wheel (provided to \\"help\\" you follow your pregnancy) are based on the other. The authors logic is so crooked that it is almost impossible to match up the dates between the journal and the wheel. I would rate this book as not just bad, but potentially dangerous - it could confuse a woman into getting her due dates mixed up and thinking she was overdue when she wasn't. Don't buy - and if given this book, be careful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing dates!!!","review":"Even with all of the work in properly dating my own journal, the dates still didn't match (fetus age OR pregnancy age) with the dates of ultrasound and/or 10 computer program journals. Had I not written in it, I would have returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting information","review":"I received this book for my second pregnancy. I found it to be interesting, but the method of dating the pregnancy from conception was sort of a pain. Most other books use the first day of your last period, which is also the way most OBs and midwives count it, so I found it a little irritating to have to consider two different schedules. Most of the information it gives is standard info that is easily found on the internet and in other books. I can't offer a great substitute for this book. My hospital offered free books to all pregnant women and, honestly, I found that book the best for both of my pregnancies. It is a fun book to keep on your nightstand, though. We did enjoy reading the daily entries in the evenings. I just wouldn't have liked to use this as my pregnancy journal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have","review":"Just like the what to expect books, this journal is a must have when you're pregnant and want to know what's happening inside your belly every day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great way to record your pregnancy","review":"really really like this journal. i used it with my first 2 kids & have ordered another for my 3rd. it's a great way to record your pregnancy & has cute quotes & information to read for every day of your pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as useful as I thought it would be","review":"There is not anything really wrong with this item, but I did not find time to write in it, or to read it so it was not as great idea to buy it as I thought. The organized pregnancy books were much more useful. Also, some pages have very little space for notes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite right","review":"I bought this journal at a bookstore and ended up returning it. The reason I returned it was because the journal dating is based on the date of conception NOT on the first day of your last period. What this means is that when you look in your journal and are reading and writing for week 7, you will actually be(according to the dating your doctor will be using)in your 9th week. I didn't like the confusion and would rather be in sync with the dating system that my doctor is using. It's too bad, because other than this one thing that was not quite right, I thought the journal was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a journal...","review":"I bought this book before I knew that there were other journals out there, I looked at the first few pages which had questions about my pregnancy... which I liked I want to document my pregnancy the best I can. Before I started writing in it however, I didn't look through the rest of the book. There is more information in it day to day than there is space to write about your own pregnancy. I was at Barnes and Noble yesterday and I saw \\"The Belly Book\\" and I WISH I would've gotten that one, and I probably still will since this \\"journal\\" isn't really a journal. If you want the information and a journal I would just get \\"What to expect when you're expecting\\" and \\"The Belly Book\\". Then you get the best of both worlds. Hopefully that is helpful to some of you other preggo ladies out there, I just totally wouldn't recommend it unless you look through the book first and decide that's what you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Date Book.","review":"This is a beautiful book, has a nice index in the back to find most information within the book.Essentially this is a date book letting you know what is happening to you & your baby day by day.. which is very neat.. also has a little spot to enter some personal notes, info or thoughts.. it is very small but great to just to jote down something small. It is a nice book.. but...If you want the ultimate pregnancy organizer definately get \\"The What to Expect when you are Expecting, Pregnancy Organizer\\" I love it. that is the best book anywhere.\\"The Pregnancy Journal.

It was a little too \\"earthy\\". As a nurse, I needed something more clinical. The book layout is nice, a day by day account of your pregnancy. It mainly focuses on the changes occurring with your baby, but not self-care or symptom management tips. It doesn't offer any additional information that I don't already get from a free pregnancy app on my phone. At best, it could be used as a supplement to a more thorough pregnancy book.

Before we even got out of bed he would turn off the alarm and ask \\"What's the baby doing today?\\" I would open the journal and read to him about the development of our child. It was amazing to realize how early certain things develop and I appreciated the hints of what foods to especially avoid or eat extra of. Throughout the day if I became upset or stressed, I would just think of those tiny fingers or lungs developing and it really put things into perspective and helped me to relax. This is a wonderful book, no matter if it is your first or fifth child."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pregnancy Journal","review":"This is a must have for moms-to-be.

This book has very few places to write anything - I ended up just buying a journal and writing in it weekly about my pregnancy. I wasn't looking for a book that tells me about my pregnancy and how it is progressing (let alone day-by-day) - I already had tons of books on that topic! Anyway - there are much better pregnancy journals out there. I just wish I could suggest one but since I decided to keep my own I can't. Sorry!

I find this book annoying and somewhat guilt inducing. There is never a mention that maybe you aren't feeling great or that at this point you might be in \\"survival mode,\\" as my midwife put it. Instead, every day it is eat this or that---usually foods like broccoli and kale---things three months ago I would have happily consumed, but now turn my stomach just to consider! The baby info is interesting and nice to have daily, but the mother stuff I find just too preachy and unsympathetic.

It was so helpful and comforting, full of great information. I got pregnant again two years after that and used it for that pregnancy too!! So, now years later another friend of mine is having her first baby and I had to get this book for her. She loves it too. This book is full of all the information you want to know about how your baby develops, but is very personal because you enter your due date on the last journal page and go backwards to the first page and now you have a day by day account of your specific pregnancy. I would recommend this book anyone having a baby, especially if it is your first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied","review":"The book is too complicated. The dates never matched with my due date and timeline. Was not user friendly and too much text. If I want to buy a book about my pregnancy I would have.

It is not loaded with technical facts or solutions to problems, but it will involve you from the first page until that wonderful day when your baby is born. Here's a hint -- Women, this a great way to get the husband/partner involved in the developing little person. Every day I looked forward to finding out what was going on \\"in there.\\" If you're pregnant, or have a friend who is, buy this book. You will not be disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I am 33 weeks pregnant and received this book as a gift when I was barely two months.

While I wouldn't classify it as a journal, it is amazing to see the day-to-day changes going on in my body. Most other books only give a weekly glimpse, and this book is never patronizing or dictatorial in nature, like some other pregnancy books I've read. My husband and I thought it was so cool we got a copy for each of our parents so they can follow along with what's going on in my body day by day. I would definitely recommend this book to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a book I could relate to.","review":"This book was very informative without giving us information overload. Some of the other books told us What to Expect was going to be scary. This book did not.I used this book throughout both my pregnancies. At the end of each week, I would read the week that had past aloud to my husband. We never read forward. Each symptom the book said I was to have that week, I had had.The descriptions of the fetus' development throughout the pregnancy were written in a language that we could understand and relate to. I've bought this book for many pregnant friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating!","review":"I found this book so confusing.

It really is very sweet and simple. I didn't want to have yet another book that I felt guilty about not filling out every day. This book fit the bill. Some days it just has a factoid about pregnancy or quotations/sayings about children/parenting/childbirth and other days it will ask for your belly measurements or weight. It has plenty of room to write down whatever is on your mind but its not overwhelming like some pregnancy journals can be.The only part I found confusing is how the dates are laid out. It goes by lunar month or something. I just filled out the dates how I thought it should go. I even bought the follow up book by the same author detailing baby's first year.I'm pregnant with my second and already have bought the pregnancy journal again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Wife loved this","review":"My wife loved this book.I loved Breathe!

If you follow the directions the weeks don't match up. I then tried to put in the dates as I knew they were and it says I'll be delivering 3 weeks earlier than what my OB thinks!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a journal","review":"i bought this book from a local bookstore and it was wrapped in plastic, so i didn't get to see what i was buying until i got it home. it has good information, but i wanted something that would let me write (like a journal should) about my feelings and put in pictures of ultrasounds. i'm keeping this b/c like i said it's good info but the title is misleading - it should The Pregnancy Book, not Journal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you Involved Everyday","review":"Out of the several books we've read during my pregnancy, this one has meant the most to us. It was especially comforting in the early weeks when nothing noticeable (except tiredness and nausea) was happening. It told me what day the heart started beating, what day the arms and legs budded and what day movement started and so on. It made me feel like I was part of the growth going on in there even before I felt or saw it. Reading what is happening to the baby that day is an exciting way to make the miracle tangible even before you're showing and especially comforting when the symptoms are getting difficult. It's a MUST HAVE for all pregnant families."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think everyone should have this book.","review":"The day I found out I was pregnant I bought this book. Being just a few weeks along I found it incredibly informative for all of the new changes that were happening with me and the baby.It gives you a wonderful desciption of the day to day development of the new baby. My husband and I found it to be quite fascinating to follow along each day with all of the amazing changes that would happen overnight. Since so much of the development happens early on I don't know how interesting someone would find it if they are already months into their pregnancy. I had a fairly accurate idea about date of conception and found it to be almost exactly accurate as to the new changes I would find in my own body. I highly recommend this book to all pregnant women."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my FAVES","review":"So happy I found this book, so sad I only found it when I was 4 mo pregnant! Details on a day by day basis on what's going on with your baby and your body. So informative. Space to add notes, tidbits, memories. A must have! Also loved the Mayo Guide to pregnancy. I disliked the What to Expect book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, although could use more space for journaling and info for/about partners","review":"I bought this for my first pregnancy and have really liked it so far. Each day she provides a little bit of information on what is going on with your embryo/fetus and with you. I do wish that (a) there was more space to journal - I ended up writing in the margins and every white space on the page and (b) there was more devoted to and about partners. I realize that not every woman has an involved partner, but a lot of us do, and it would have been nice if things were included for your significant other who is also experiencing the pregnancy (albeit secondhand). My husband used two of the all-page journaling spaces to write to our son. I have put her first year book on my registry list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't think the dating is accurate","review":"I like what this book has to say, but the dating doesn't match up with everything else I have about how far along I am. For example, today I am 10 weeks 4 days pregnant, with 206 days to go. That's the dating that doctors use, which is from my last known menstrual period. In this book, 206 days to go is on 11 weeks 4 days since my last known menstrual period and is considered lunar week 9 day 4 in this book. I am incredibly frustrated trying to match up my pregnancy with this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this pregnancy journal!","review":"I love this journal - I bought it for myself, and a girlfriend of mine, since I loved it so much!

Most blades are replaced because they become dull and we lose the clean cut edge. This blade lost three teeth in each of two sections (six total) almost immediately upon starting it's cut. The product picture for this blade is also incorrect. The teeth are much smaller, nothing like the teeth in the example picture. The construction of the blade seems quite light-duty compared to the others we've used, including less expensive blades. I would give this blade a rating of \\"zero\\" stars if it was allowed. Do yourself a favor and buy the Oshlun blades. They are less expensive and cut until they dull out."},{"rating":"1","title":"This saw blade does not hold up.","review":"As a point of reference, I have used several 7-1/4\\" aluminum cutting blades before in building my 49' aluminum sailboat. They have all held up well, but eventually dulled (as expected). I only used this blade for cutting staight sections of 3/8\\" aluminum in a cutting fixture (previous blades had been used exactly the same way and often a lot harder). No side loads or free hand cutting at all. The first three cuts were very fine and clean. On the fourth cut the blade self destructed, losing several carbides and teeth. I would not recommend this blade for anyone cutting anything thicker than 1/8\\", if that."},{"rating":"2","title":"very diverse legends!","review":"Not only does this have a great resource for shapeshifter movies and books but lots of legends from all over the world! This book focuses on all kinds of shapeshifting legends not just werewolves.The creatures are described as good and evil depending on the legend unlike many werewolf books that paint them as evil or tragic.I have read tons of material on this subject and am very pleased with this book.Most books about werewolves tell the same legends over and over but this one gets into some that I have never come across.The language used is simple and effective. This is a solid book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equal Opportunity Collector","review":"\\"Half Human, Half Animal\\" is a wonderful treat for everyone who is tired of dead white men and Europe getting more than their fair share of everything. It has a whole chapter just for the hyena-men legends of Africa, a whole chapter just for that! And it is a good chapter, too. Wonderful stories of heroism, mystery and tragedy. Even on the werewolf chapter, it travels around the world, avoiding Europe as much as possible. Asia and South America are represented by large chapters covering people who turn into foxes or dolphins. If you like mythology, if you want to raise your household to respect all cultures and think multicultural, then this is a book that does the job. The legends are good, and it explains the beliefs and cultures behind the legends too. They weren't all bloodthirsty monsters. Some were sex symbols, shapeshifting gods, tricksters, or forces that protected nature from invasion."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT IMPRESSED","review":"I paid under twenty dollars for this item and I am not impressed.

It came in a box that was roughly 15\\" long and 8\\" deep. All this for a little tiny compass. There was one crumpled piece of brown paper in there and of course the compass wasn't inside the paper, it was at the bottom of the box. So, first observation, it was poorly packed.Second, one side of the compass pointer is red and the other white. It seems that if you are facing north or south, you need to look at the red side of the dial for an accurate reading. If you are facing east or west, you'd better read the white side of the dial to know what direction you are really facing. This thing is either defective or crazily designed. Considering how ridiculously it was packed, it's probably damaged.

The first page lulls one into a peacefulness with phrases like, \\"Roy lifts a child's bicycle from the dewy grass\\". The tone and story changes rapidly when \\"...a gunshot resonates\\". As my eyebrows shot up I realized I could not use Chesta's Way to lull myself to sleep.While the story of City Kids & Calves is remarkable, what makes it so compelling is the writers style. Mary took an important concept, America's own 4-H club and brought it to life. She reminds us...no she humbles us into remembering that our own, often insulated, quiet lifestyle is not the norm for many others. It is a wake up call for us to get off our duffs and participate. Indeed, it seems unconscionable for there not to be Chesta Wrights in all corners of our society, working to save our at-risk kids.Nice job Mary, thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK ROCKS","review":"I bought this book as sort of a joke, because it sounded so typically California sufer dude.

Unfortunately, the devil she once knew is not the same devil that Robert Johnson made a deal with, and many of the performances just aren't convincing, the heart is chilled instead of the spine.

And I still found the book essential in understanding those concepts and activities as well as the activities of people in the JKD world. Perhaps this is why Mr. Lee dissolved his organizations before he died. Still, i was troubled by Mr. Bishop's compartimentalization and fragmentation, if you will, of martial arts from martial arts philosophy. They are inextricable and essential to understanding the whole. Until one experinces the martial art he left to many of his students, it will be difficult to understand how martial arts is not pugilism."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of new Information!","review":"I was quite surprised by this book.

She has a down to earth writing style that makes this sometimes complex subject interesting and easy to understand.Of course, her premise is not a new one. I first remember reading a fine book on this subject back in 1976. Written by Merlin Stone, it was called \\"When God Was a Woman.\\" That book thouroughly detailed the historical facts leading from the original female deity worship to the present male deity worship.It was eye-opening reading, but the author's style was somewhat dry.Not so with Browne.

Information is scattered and patched together from many different sources and put together in a \\"hodge podge\\" way. The Feminine Divine is a huge topic that can't possibly be squeezed into a small book and be done well. What the book does offer is; Sylvia's entertaining style, an introduction to the history of the goddess in different cultures, websites for more information and Ms. Browne's \\"take\\" on the Mother God Anza.

His focus on what drives the band's passion - their music, their unquenchable drive for unique and meaningful musical and lyrical expression will serve any reader interested in Led Zeppelin well.The photos are excellent. The writing is vivid, honest, and diverse in scope.More than anything, \\"Led Zeppelin: 1968-1980\\" brings a historical, dignified, and well rounded representation of one of the greatest bands in the history of rock and roll to life.It's well worth the price & deserves 10 stars.Barbara Rose, author of If God Was Like Man and Stop Being the String Along"},{"rating":"1","title":"The guy doesn't like the band","review":"With all due respect to the late author, you get the sense that he wrote this book to settle some kind of score. He was in his 20s in the 1970s playing sax in a jazz-rock group you've never heard of, probably cursing Led Zeppelin's success. His constant belittling of the band's work comes off as petty, gratuitous, and bizarre. He really doesn't like the band at all. Why write such a thoroughly researched, seemingly definitive book on a band you disdain? Ultimately, the book's tone of dispassionate history belies a very condescending review, bordering on a cool hatchet job of the group's work that just isn't fitting of the band's standing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A trip with Led Zep.","review":"Amazing pics, rich and in deep text.

The book is drier than toast and doesn't reveal anything you didn't already know as a big Led Zeppelin fan.Also, why does he think we care about his opinions on the songs? Remain neutral and take yourself out of the book please! And nobody cares about you referecning some obscure bluesman who was \\"ripped off\\". We get it.

After a 15 page prologue, the author offers a 25 page introduction. Maybe both should have been skipped. The main idea: up until the 1990s radical Muslims focused on fighting their own governments (the near enemy) and in the mid 1990s a small fraction of them decided to fight the U.S. and Western countries (the far enemy). Interesting, but in the first 40 pages, the author made this point at least ten times. Not only ideas and arguments, even whole sentences are repeated from one page to the other.

The closest I can come to describing this book is that it must be the French equivalent of Cliffnotes!The book itself is only about a 130 pages long. The story contained in it is a pathetic paraphrasing of the actual novel, condensed and simplified to make an interesting study guide for the student. I'm not sure how the author hoped to accomplish this, though--the entire story is changed.This book might be of value to someone who only wanted to read something in French.

Fortunately, the Plantronics Voyager 510 was on sale right after I bought the HS815 and, having seen it's near perfect reviews, decided I'd get it for our other phone and compare. In short: there is no comparison. The Voyager seems of higher quality before you even turn it on. The sound is superior on my end (though the HS815 is satisfactory in this area), and unlike the HS815, those I am speaking with do not know I am using a headset.

When we tried to transfer it (after being attached only a couple of days), it left pieces of itself to the windshield and was very difficult to reattach to another windshield (though with difficulty and repeated tries, we have been able to move it).What this means is that you need a mount for each car you want to use this in.

Here is the best treatment yet of the Florida debacle, conceding that in all likelihood a majority of Floridians wanted Gore to be President, and that the greatest obstacle placed in their way to realizing that end, that muddle of a butterfly ballot, was placed there by unwitting Democrats. Shorn of the arm-chair second-guessing of judges' motives typical of the post-election talking heads, Posner focuses on the law, its precise language and reasonable interpretation, and the predictable consequences of varied courses of actions. That his treatment will not satisfy the partisan goes without saying; that it will likely prove the best, pragmatic explanation of what in fact happened, why, and what ought to be done about it seems certain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thorough, but tedious reading","review":"Unlike most of Posner's other writing (his judicial opinions included), this book lacks the verve and wit that marks his style.

Yes, the Democrats had a point -- Gore might have gotten more votes, had they all been counted. But yes, Harris was within her discretion to stop the vote-counting. And yes, the Supreme Court majority made the right decision to close the whole show.While his conclusions are interesting, the analysis makes for tedious reading as Posner drills down to the most mundane details of the vote-counting.

His main premise, tho, that the original FLSC decision violated Article II of the USCON, which gives election authority to the legislatures of the several States and Commonwealths, is laughably slain with one ugly fact: the FL legislature statutorily authorized the FL courts to resolve any legal issue which might arise as a result of a recount or contest of any election held in FL. Given this fact, Posner's book, in Truman Capote's words, isn't writing, it's typing.

Even if the process had been extended and eventually decided by Congress, the country would have survived quite easily. The Court's reasoning was poor (even Posner admits that).

Everything but the wood was in good shape and the wood although useable, needed replacing. After replacing the wood, I was thinking that the tires on this trailer have lasted over 20 years and well although they look good and seem fine, 20 years is 20 years. I decided I better get new tires.I looked on Amazon and saw these 6 ply tires and wheels and they are exactly what I have on my trailer now - they are just like the OEM wheels. They seem well made and although a bit spendy, if they last for even half as long as my original wheels have, it'll be quite a bargain.

I cried reading the book. It was as though the writer had entered Rosebud's mind and was writing as she might have.

Navigating an mp3 CD with just next/previous track and the +/- 10 tracks buttons is annoying. With a normal CD, it will remember where you left off and resume next time you turn the car on.

This book introduces the unique characteristics of families that produce the world's most successful men and women. Most instructive and interesting to me is the Chapter:PARENTS TO AVOID BEHAVIOUR THAT PRODUCES THE AUTOCRATIC PERSONALITY. Erikson found that Adolph Hitler and Mahatma Gadhi were almost mirror images of each other in a scientific sense. To avoid producing a child like Hitler, and to raise a child like Gandhi, Prof. Maxwell proposes a four-step Interpersonal Skills Training Strategy as the chid grows from 0 to 11-year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works!","review":"It's not a scam! It really works. Sound is more defined, the stage is more dimensional, it doesn't mess with the frequencies. It's kind of weird really. One word of caution, it makes everything louder, so some music might clip a little. When that happens, just bypass it. It also comes with decent patch cables.This improves all music and movies; it was was recorded well, it will sound better, if it was recorded horrible, it will sound better. If you are using it with Dolby Pro Logic IIX or DTS NEO 6 you will hear everything more defined, the surround and back channels become more active. Dialog becomes very clear. Nuances are restored.Yeah, it's weird. It requires no power so it's passive.

The author displays a deep misunderstanding of TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) philosophy by combining it with Western medicine and other alternative therapies. For instance, vaccinations and synthetic supplaments are completely at odds with TCM principles, and no true TCM practitioner will ever recommend them. The nutritional advice of diet consisting of more than 70% carbohydrate not only does not reflect the Chinese diet, but will certainly lead to obesity, diabetes and related illnesses. The Chinese prize pork and other animal fats, yet the author seems to pander to the fat-phobic public and advocates low fat in most of the dietary advice. Although there are good explanations of TCM principles at the start of the book, the author is yet another in the string of Western doctors showing lack of faith/knowledge in TCM by combining it with contradictory Western therapies.

So why are his last three books some of the most unreadable, bloated pieces of crap I have read in contemporary fiction? The IDEAS are good, and some of the sentences are passable, but take \\"Apex\\"--it feels like the equivalent of a morning literary bowel movement, filled with hot air and half-visible, half-felt-for characters.

Not all books have to have tension, but I got the feeling that this book was supposed to. The main character (whose name we never learn) is supposed to decide between two factions in a small town that have different ideas about how or whether to rename the town. The tension between these two opposing parties should be at the heart of this book, but I just couldn't bring myself to care (possibly because the alternative to the town's current name is just silly). The lack of tension is especially ironic when you consider the name of the town that the main character finally decides on, which I think is supposed to summarize the overall theme of the book: Struggle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for 6 months","review":"I bought one of these switches in November 2009.

It worked flawlessly. I just plugged everything in and it worked; I did not read the manual (on a CD) or have to configure everything. Everything has been up and running for a couple of weeks and I have not had a single problem.

Keep in mind I am using static IP's for all my network computers and peripherals. The printer got picked up immediately, but I have not been able to have a computer sitting behind the switch to share the internet. I am using this switch after a DLink router."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works exactly as advertised","review":"The switch is meant to be a low cost way to provide connectivity between computers. It has the ability to transfer at up to 1 Gbps. It also has the advantage of being \\"green\\" in that it can adjust power usage to the length of the cables and the activity of the LAN.Setup was literally as easy as plugging in the power and the cables and going. Out of the box it performed flawlessly at file transfers and allowing our computers to talk to each other. The manual was largely unnecessary.I cannot vouch for the green features as I do not have the equipment to measure them, but it appears to operate as advertised in that respect as well. D-Link is a reputable OEM, so i tend to accept their claims.The cost of the switch was very reasonable, and it delivers everything we want for performance. I do not see any limitations on using this in any application."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"The unit have hard time to work at gigabit speed.I was fully aware before the purchase that this switch won't work at gigabit speed if even one device connected to it doesn't support it. That's fine, since all my devices are (supposed to be) Gigabit ethernet.The truth is that it doesn't work at all. Even with all the devices at GbE the switch can't handle GbE speed.My data transfer between computers are exactly the same as my old 100Mbps switch..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Switch with Expansion options","review":"What I like about this router:1. I now have an open ethernet port and I don't have to keep swapping ethernet cables.2. Its Gigabit much faster at loading files compared to the old 10/100 switch this replaces.3. Low power - well not that I am going to save the planet with a single ethernet switch but every little bit helps.4. It fits neatly on my desktop and is only a couple inches bigger than the old switch.5. The old switch is now going with me as a travel switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, awful performance","review":"Performance was awful on this switch, much worse than my 10/100 switch. So bad that I ended up returning it. I think the performance had something to do with the energy saving features of the device and/or having mixed 100 and 1000 mbit adapters on the switch. Either way, it was slow and I had to send it back (and I rarely bother sending things back)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great in a mixed speed network","review":"I use a collection of Cisco enterprise switches and routers at work. You're not going to get the same performance using this switch; nor are you going to have all the configuration options that you get with a managed switch, but for a basic, unmanaged GigE switch this is perfect. And there is something refreshing knowing you don't have to configure the switch and remember how you have configured the VLANs etc.Do not listen to the person who said that the switch down-shunted all ports to the slowest possible speed. That's just plain wet. Just don't plug a 10/100 NIC into one of the ports and expect the switch to magically turn it into a GigE connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Compatible with all my equipment","review":"While this D link works fine with my Toshiba Laptop, I can't get it to function with my 802.11g HP C4385 All In One Printer/Copier, or my Ifit Module for my Nordic Track which all worked fine with my Netgear Router before. It won't accept the 64 digit Wap security code this machine puts out, and seems not to be able to find the B band which this should also be putting out according to the settings. Compounding the problem is in calling the help center, and not being able to understand the Indian Techs they are so fond of hiring. I spent 25 minutes frustrating both of us with every other word being pardon me, or excuse me I didn't understand what you just said.

However, a little Sprachgefuehl(feeling for the tongue) led me to the conclusion that the rules and categories are hocus pocus, i.e., they do NOT reflect the actual way we speak the language. This is a serious problem, becuase linguistics is descriptive in nature. If the rules proposed in the book do not adequately reflect reality, then they are useless. I doubt if the example senteces were really secured from native speakers.Non-native speakers might be dumbfounded by the apparent complexity of the book and think it is too scholarly. In fact, howver, they are only fooled into thinkning so because they are dealing with a subject they are not familiar with--Mandarin Chinese, in this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional source","review":"The book describes Mandarin grammar very well.

Sure, there are serious lessons here, but they come in a funny package.

It is a well written book that becomes very difficult to read as it progresses and the endless horrors and atrocities continue unabated. As it is narrated by such a powerful character who is presented from the first as evil (mixed with cowardice, a dealy combination) and without any moral compass, the novel does not develop the horrors slowly but simply presents them one after another after another leaving the reader numb. The author is skilled at this piling on of horrors and creates moments of surprise throughout although finding a meaning to all of this terror seems rather futile. This book never reaches the level of Lord of the Flies but is nastily effective, in its own right, at relentlessly showing man's baser nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"Finally someone has produced a unique and extremely helpful tool for skaters and skating coaches.

Why Disney feels that audiences want to be force-fed any more of this liberal clap trap is beyond me, but judging by the number of positive reviews in this forum, perhaps the studio is right: there's always a market for a trite, predicatble story in which the stuffed-shirt aristocracy gets its come-uppance from a working class underdog.Unfortunately, neither the rich nor the poor in this story are very are very likable, and it's hard to feel much empathy for any of them as they plod through life.

This is just an overview that deals with the politics of the sport as much or more than the game itself. A dim view of the British club members and their looking down their nose at others is shown.

I cannot call the main male character a hero, because he doesn't come even close. He is violent, cruel and downright mean.

I'll have all of the information in my head, but getting it out on paper (or on the computer screen) can be torturous. I've started using some of Bolker's ideas and have found I am getting more written. Her notion of free writing has been particularly helpful.I give the book only four stars because the Kindle version does not have a Table of Contents. Since some of the information does not apply to me (eg: I already have my dissertation committee organized), it would have been far more helpful if I could have just selected the chapters I wanted to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a gem","review":"This book is a gem. I like it because it takes a process approach to teach people how to write. The book suggests process measures and promises that if you make sure you meet these targets, they will lead you to achieve your performance measures - the piece of writing your desperately want to finish.My favorite quote is:\\"Writing in order to think rather than in order to write\\", pp. xviMy favorite measures are:- Using a \\"Model dissertation\\", pp. 12- Maxims, pp. 18- \\"Write first ...every day\\", pp. 38, 47-78- Set daily goals (# of pages - i.e. 3 - 6 per day), pp. 45- \\"Don't waste words\\" - write it down using a notebook, a pocket computer, ... etc, pp. 47- A tentative timetable (deadlines you set need to be very generous), pp. 74"},{"rating":"2","title":"one for the canon","review":"If you're just starting your doctoral work and are terrified, buy this book. If you're already writing your dissertation and are stalled, buy this book. If you're a thesis advisor seeking to add another work to the canon on dissertation writing, buy this book. Joan Bolker has a ton of experience working with students; she has seen it all. Her tone combines \\"C'mon don't be a wuss, you can DO this,\\" with the caring concern of any good mum. She gives the reader tips for working through all the worst possible moments of thesis writing and she covers a range of topics not specifically related to the writing but to all the other considerations: choosing your committee and then working with them; dealing with interruptions; life after the disseration, and more. I particularly like the chapter entitled \\"The Best Dissertation is a Done Dissertation.\\" I think this is a terrific book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Based on our students' reviews","review":"I give this book as a gift to each of my new PhD students because my experience is that the students simply don't understand the process.

Perhaps it would be a good book for procrastinators, but not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would NOT recommend.","review":"If you are interested in a personal novel this may be the choice for you. I found the content disorganized, the content not as useful as A Dissertation Journey/Roberts. My agenda was looking for help in organizing my ideas, my sources, my paper prep. I was also hoping for some guidance in how to use school resourses (people) for guidance in my thesis. This book, Writing Your Dissertation in Fifteen... was not for me.This is what I recommend (based on my agenda):The Dissertation Journey: A Practical and Comprehensive Guide to Planning, Writing, and Defending Your Dissertation"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling advice that is on-the-nose for procrastinators.","review":"Ms. Bolker knows every trick in the book that procrastinators use to put off the inevitable. She jumps in at the beginning to help the thesis student make the best decisions for winnowing a topic, choosing an advisor, setting up a daily writing schedule, to chuggging along on draft five, or heading toward defense. One of her pithy reminders is, \\"Always park on the downhill slope\\". By this, she means stop today with an easy to find starting point for tomorrow. Ms. Bolker is kind, understanding, and forgiving. Her advice goes beyond the post-modern \\"Just Do It\\". She gives you the plan, the tools, the prodding (even ideas for self-rewards) for getting it done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Little About the Actual Dissertation Process","review":"The title of this book is misleading. It should be titled: HOW TO GET OVER WRITER'S BLOCK.There is very little about what you can expect and what you need to do to earn your PhD. There is absolutely NOTHING about how to write your proposal, which is arguably the hardest part of the whole process. The author simply skips over this phase of the dissertation the way she does nearly all the others: by simply telling you ways to motivate yourself to write.This book is the Dr. Phil edition of dissertation writing books. Just sugary motivational nonsense that might make you feel better about yourself, but only until you realize that you learned nothing.If you're a grad student writing your dissertation, then you probably can't afford to waste money (or time). So my advice: SKIP THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointed PhD student","review":"Dissertation writers need a systematic approach of how to construct the dissertation and advice on how to do the critical writing not just writing tips that are designed for high school students. 15 minutes of writing is good for a student that has not been involved in writing at all. How could author expect a PhD student to write the dissertation in 15 minutes a day? Is it a joke? Dissertation needs structure as well as a systematic approach for doing literature review and critical thinking. It certainly cannot be messy as the author suggested. However, it will be messy if PhD student does not have the dissertation at the end of the term. As a new PhD student, I am extremely disappointed that this book had no original contribution and did not provide anything that I did not know about dissertation writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiot's guide to writing your dissertation","review":"That might have been a better title...

This book substitutes cliches and platitudes for scholarship. The piece of advice Ms. Bolker forgot to give was one from 1066 and All That, and I paraphrase to fit the occasion: don't try to start, revise, or finish your disseration by writing on both sides of the paper at once.Save your money and sanity; search elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not purchase this book, but listen to what I am saying!!!","review":"As someone who is almost complete with their dissertation all I can say the only way you can write a Doctoral Dissertation in 15 min a day is if you spend about 4 years trying to complete it! I have taken many days off of work just to have 8 hours at a time just so I can actually get some work done. This book is so far off from the truth, if you get anything to help you READ previous dissertations and read Chapter 5 for recommendations for further study, pick one of their recommendations and try and use the same methodology that they used. \\"I should write a book on that and save everyone all kinds of cash!!!!!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm...","review":"I could not pull together the \\"big picture\\" for all the details. Major concepts can be easily forgotten, especially by me: by the time I had read 3 pages containing a pleothra of details, I found myself making many wrong conclusions about how the major concepts fit together. On the other hand, I am a second year medical student, and I have found that Lippencott's Biochemistry paralleled my course rather freakishly as the concepts were introduced in lectures in the same order as in Lippencott's.

The chapters read like a bad and verbose novel. With the time constraints in medical school, you really need a book that gets to the point.

Like the title suggests, I sprinkle a little bit on scrambled eggs, and I also use it as a rub for roast chicken. Salt naturally seals moisture in and makes the skins nice and crunchy, but this smoked salt also fills the entire kitchen with a delicious smoky smell that automatically brings folks to the dining table. And the delectable flavor in the meat is nearly beyond words. Yum..... I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.Great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Songs, but Mind the Singer","review":"This is one of those discs where the listener has to balance the advantages of the program with the disadvantages of the performance. Bolcom is one of this country's most versatile and brilliant composers, and those qualities are demonstrated to great effect in the songs on this album. His piano playing is, as one would expect, also solid and expressive. The drawback here is Carole Farley. Although her diction and intonation are good, as far as tone-color goes, she seems to be a one-trick pony; and if you don't like that trick (opera singer trying to sound like what she thinks a musical theater singer sounds like), listening to her can get very tiring. So while I highly recommend the disc for its content, I suggest listening to excerpts first before buying just to make sure that the singer's voice doesn't drive you batty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational Vocal Album by Carole Farley and William Bolcom","review":"Carole Farley and William Bolcom have recorded this landmark CD, and I can easily understand why this CD received a GRAMMY nomination in the \\"Best Vocal Recording of the Year\\" and a 2nd GRAMMY nomination in the \\"Best Engineered Recording of the Year\\" category. It's indeed one of the best vocal albums of contemporary songs ever made. Carole Farley, who made her MET debut in the MET's first LULU production, seems to be just at home with Puccini, Poulenc, Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich and even Latin American popular songs (her Lecuona songs album is extremely beautiful).William Bolcom's accompaniment is brilliant, and the songs are a revelation.J.B.

Her book not only gives advice like so many others, but also provides ways to measure both parties in the relationship and the relationship itself.

The connectors are 3/8, rather than the much-more-common 1/4 size, so if you have any other hoses or accessories, they're unlikely to work with this device. I found the included connector for tire inflating hard to use (compared to most others) and because of the straight geometry, I can't use it for inflating the small tires (such as on a stroller or child's bicycle)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent compressor","review":"The MF-1052 works. I would give it 5 stars if it had standard fittings. I will need to replace the fittings. But it works. I filled my trailer tires (225/75/15) in just a couple minutes. I was worried because this is not the model that got such rave reviews on the 4WD sites but it looks exactly like the 1050 model and the performance must be pretty close. You cannot use this through the cigarette lighter, you must connect to battery with included clips. This is a good thing because it is more powerful than most small compressors.

Can it fill your car tires? Yes, if you can wait...and wait. It will not fill your car tires to 30 psi in just a few moments. It will get just over 20 psi and then it will bog down. It looks like a good grade electrical compressor, but it struggles at what it does. I have a 125-pound tank that I've attached these to and it never gets over 60 psi...and it takes a long time to get there. So don't expect miracles from this little guy.

The book takes concepts that might otherwise be hard to grasp in their complexity and simplifies them, making them more \\"kid friendly.\\" Learning from and with a cat, who is just as curious as they are, also helps make things less intimidating for children who are slightly math phobic. I will definitely be using this book in my own classroom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The gentle color illustrations add the perfect touch to this fable","review":"Tibetan medicine student Barbara Soros presents Tenzin's Deer, a children's picturebook grounded in traditional Tibetan culture. A young boy named Tenzin is born beneath a shining comet, and holds the collective wisdom of many generations within him. He is kind toward both people and animals; when he discovers a wounded musk deer, his compassion leads him to take it home and try to heal it. He names the deer Jampa, \\"loving kindness\\"; while he sleeps, a dream reveals to him how to help Jampa get better. As Jampa gradually recovers, Tenzin must learn his most important lesson of all: how to let go of what he loves. The gentle color illustrations add the perfect touch to this fable, which features fairly involved text and is ideal for young readers almost ready to make the transition to chapter books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing misleading","review":"I put this outfit on my daughter's gift list for Christmas.

Its not only dull, its totally inaccurate. Did the author ever watch the show? It looks like he read some bad fanfiction (the Calder books) and wrote his book from there. There is no excse for such poor research--and why the big price tag? It should be a nice coffee table book for that price. BTW, this book was totally unauthorized by the show's creator. I can see why!Spend your money on the Greenland book--its the best Bonanza book out there. More entertaining and much better researched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonanza","review":"The book was just what I wanted.

Sadly, this book isn't it. A scant eight pages --- eight pages!-- are given to the creation, writing and production of the show. The bulk of the book is a workman-like episode guide to the 14 seasons and brief synopses of the TV movies, hardly worth the price of purchase. The only thing interesting and worthwhile about the book are the appendices listing various BONANZA merchandise, books, comics, and records. However, I wish the effort the authors put into gathering so much pointless information -- like listing all the shows available on video featuring Tim Matheson -- had been focused instead on giving us the definitive history of the show. Consider this a lost opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"barely readable","review":"i love weddings, i love being a bridesmaid, i love chick lit. i should have loved this book, right?i hated this book.it felt forced - and it was not funny - i can't believe it was published."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Funny","review":"I laughed from the beginning of this book to the end.

I just went camping and one of the girls in our group passed this along to me because I had forgotten the book I meant to bring. Not only was it nearly impossible to put this book down, but I laughed from cover to cover. I found myself sneaking peeks with a flashlight at night and ignoring my boyfriend and friends for most of the trip. Everyone would ask me what was so funny and I would have to read lines out loud.

When you could not admit to anyone at the wedding that your dress was hideously expensive and uncomfortable, the bride was a self-centered, irrational witch, and you didn't want to be there at all, it's nice to read someone else's horror stories.None of this, however, makes up for the dully repetitive sentence structure, the painfully clumsy dialogue, and the lifeless characters.

This book did not make me laugh out loud and I had so many issues with the story that I had to constantly complain to my friends. The characters are not developed and behave like they just turned 21 in college. And since I live in San Diego and am about the age of the character I found the plot to be totally unbelieveable and actually wondered if the author had ever been to San Diego, been in a wedding for a person that was truly your friend, or researched being a kindergarten teacher. In addition, the excessive drinking truly bothered me and made me pity the main character more than root for her. If you have any standards I would recommend that you not read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"drinking, blacking out, and acting like a high schooler","review":"The fact that this was by a first-time author certainly shows. The main character Cate's habit of drinking, blacking out, and blaming the resulting consequences on booze and/or hangover is no more \\"fun\\" in a novel than it is in real life. Not once, not twice, not for the third time.I think attending AA instead of yet another snotty, self-centered \\"friend's\\" wedding would have made more sense.It's a bit silly for a kindergartden teacher to be \\"scared to death\\" of a kid's booger-- I'd say consider a career change if that's the case.The book's theme was drink lots, get drunk enough to pass out, attend weddings of horrible women, then act like idiot due to hangover or booze.

Do real people actually get drunk every time they have a social engagement? What a lot of wasted (pardon the pun) opportunities to really get to know each other, or to develop hobbies, learn something, or do good for the community. I prefer clever books that show how the main character uses her wits to overcome a situation. This main character seemed to live for a buzz, and had a serious lack of wisdom or wit.

The authors present a topic then discuss competing theories and then provide both experimental and field data that may support or refute the different theories.

However, the only speciation recognized in this book is variation that affects reproduction. A few mutations in a few genes increase variation within a species, and sometimes that variation affects reproduction.Recent studies have shown that speciation which introduces evolutionary novelties requires many changes to many genes, totalling some thousands of changes, but that was not mentioned. The section on macroevolution discussed the persistence of species, on the order of 1 to several million years, but they failed to comment on the implications of millions of years with no changes, followed in a very short time with a new species in the fossil record, fully changed with thousands of base changes.

It was published in 1969. The book follows the adventures of our family from the time I was only a small child in the middle 1950's, as my parents raised my brother and I to be accomplished mountaineers. With very little fictionalization, it details trips into the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains of the American west and Canada. Through harrowing episodes that would make modern parents cringe we back-packed, rock climbed and ascended prodigious peaks that still had Sierra Club summit registers signed by the likes of John Muir. An incredible legacy for me and my brother Greg Lewis, we delight in the sweet phrasing and adventurous spirit of our father's writing.

The vocals are alright, I've heard much more range though...but I can't shake that feeling of monotony. And what's all this about technicality...Cannibal Corpse has become a monotonous gorefest, not an innovative powerhouse, and has become mainstream to the point of issuing clean versions of their cd's!

Corpsegrinder really is the shining one on this album for me. He didn't write that much lyrics, if any, but his vocals on this album are awesome. He can scream a lot better than before, and he's also gone deeper gutteral wise. The music is really good, very fast, heavy, and aggresive. \\"When Death Replaces Life\\" kinda reminds me of the song \\"Gallery of Suicide\\" because it starts out and builds up into a brutal death metal song. The lyrics from the song \\"Pit of Zombies\\" reminds me of the 'Live Cannibalism' cd artwork. Awesome new cd by the Corpse, if your a fan, you should buy now. Also the cover of \\"No Remorse\\" is so heavy and brutal, totally rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best with CorpseGringer","review":"I got this album when it was released. I have only heard of \\"Hatchet Unto The Head\\" on radio while I worked at Nightcrew... So it kinda inspired me of buying this album. The album \\"Gore Obsessed\\" is pretty much a \\"Bloodthirst\\" part 2 but a whole ALOT better in my opinion.Musically Cannibal Corpse has managed to create one of the best riffs ever made (listen to \\"When Dead Replaces Life\\" and you'll know by what I mean). The production is very clean just like Bloodthirst. Lyrically, it hasn't changed much so don't expect any surprises. CorpseGrinder's vocals are more amazing than Bloodthirst. Cannibal Corpse remains Cannibal Corpse and this work is their 2nd best release overall (their 1st would be Butchered At Birth). Anyways best tracks in this album are \\"Pit Of Zombies\\", \\"Hatchet Unto The Head\\", \\"Hung And Bled\\" and \\"When Dead Replaces Life\\".Buy it now, it can become the greatest release of 2002."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE","review":"I bought CC's \\"VILE\\" on cassette tape a year or two ago, and still listen to it over and over in my car to this day.

If any little kid saw this album sitting on the shelf, it would scar his mind. Whoever does the artwork for this band is extremely talented. Musically, this album is INCREDIBLE and JAW DROPPING. The riffs, basslines, drums, and lyrics stick in my head. They are brutal, in-your-face, and memorable. All of the members in this band are extremely talented. I can't wait for their next CD.

The show does a great job of showing various experiments being done at different universities around the country and then talking about the conclusions from the experiments.The only reason I am not rating this a 5 is because they only included 3 episodes on this DVD. I am pretty sure that there are more episodes in the series. I'd love to see the whole series on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally on DVD! Yay!","review":"True, this isn't a series for parents looking for advice (as one of the previous reviewers critiqued), but this is MY FAVORITE baby show and I am very glad that I can ditch my tapes now that it is out on DVD. There are a great many more episodes than those listed on this single DVD-- let's hope that this disk is profitable enough so that they decide to sell them all!The episodes present classic psyc. experiments of developmental perception that are simply facinating. If you are taking an intro. to psycology course and all the dry textbook descriptions are putting you to sleep, get this DVD! Actually looking at the sweet little guys go through the set-ups will help you remember the different cognitive stages. They are just too cute! and it is neat to see what \\"tricks\\" you can play on your own little fellow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not enough \\"Baby\\"","review":"A wonderfully insightful program whether you have kids or WERE one, which I think covers just about everyone.

My only complaint is that there are not enough episodes available for purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just the facts, please; hold the agenda.","review":"The Baby Human was a gigantic disappointment only because of the irritating use of the term \\"baby human\\" in each reference to the child (as opposed to baby gorilla, baby shark, etc.) I teach developmental psychology and I know terms such as \\"child,\\" \\"neonate,\\" \\"toddler,\\" and \\"baby\\" are routinely used in textbooks, but I think the agenda behind this video was to diminish the dignity of the human life and equate it with any lower form of life. The animal rights' folks will love this one. This in-your-face propaganda did elicit some interesting and insightful student responses however, and I love to see students think critically, so it wasn't a total loss. Factual content was good--but please' ' ' hold the agenda."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the investment","review":"It is, just as the second part, a pretty good tool for everyone who's interested in human development, specially children's and babies'.

It purports such monstrous notions that there was a world flood which has been debunked by common sense alone, for example: If there was a world flood and every creature that breathed oxygen drowned, then why wasnt there a break in history? Egyptians never noticed a flood.In all honesty, this book isnt worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Men's Secret's","review":"This book is the most complete book I've read so far on out of place artifacts.

But it's Sarah so what do you expect?","review":"What more can you say about this artist but awesome, talented, remarkable, non- better, and a true argument that angels do exist on earth. She warms your heart and tells you her stories behind what is going on in her life with such poetic poetry. In my world Sarah is not only the best singer, song writer and true artist out there but she makes it O.K. to be who you are and who you really want to be. I thank her for every CD she comes out with, which I hope are many more to come! God Bless her...."},{"rating":"2","title":"McLachlan LIVE!","review":"This CD/DVD features all of Sarah's biggest hits with a few lesser known songs. This phenomenal concert taken from her Afterglow Live 2004 Summer Tour is a must for any fan and should win a few new ones over too. Some performers just can't cut it live. This girl not only keeps her signature sound in tack, but does things with her voice that are down right spine-tingling. Sarah is an amazing singer/songwriter who has done so much with her gift. This is one of the best live tours you'll ever buy. DVD also features her 3 hit videos off \\"Afterglow\\" and a backstage look at her life on the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"will not buy this do to copywrite protection","review":"I don't know whats up with this copywrite protection garbage, I would love to own this, but I cannot afford to ruin my computer. good luck all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sarah is beautiful--it would be nice to be able to hear her!","review":"If you want to hear Sarah's band, this is a great album. Unfortunately, the mix is so poor that the band drowns out most of Sarah's vocals. In a word, on most cuts you can barely hear Sarah. There are a few cuts in which you can actually hear her but not many. But she is as beautiful as ever on the DVD. The CD suffers from the same mix problem as the DVD but lacks the visual images."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah is awesome (as always), but the DVD is \\"off\\" slightly","review":"If you went to the Afterglow Live concert, then watching the DVD is just like being there. The constant blur-to-focus and inability of the camera man/editor to stay focused on Sarah or the band for any length of time makes me think that someone had Attention Deficit Disorder. But that not withstanding, the music on the DVD and CD are excellent. Overall, this is a \\"must\\" for the Sarah McLachlan fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for the warning!","review":"I must admit I haven't seen or heard this item. I just want to thank everyone who posted warnings about the absurd content protection software, and the lousy video editing.

It's sad that Sarah's wonderful works is being botched so badly by greediness and incompetence!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Sarah Release Yet!","review":"I was extreemtly hesitant to get this DVD since the \\"Mirrorball\\" DVD was so awful. I bought the \\"Afterglow Live\\" DVD only to get the CD that came with it. When I actually popped the DVD into the player, I was plesantly surprised. The concert is beautifly filmed with a wonderful mix of songs, spanning old and new alike.While it is a bummer that only half of the songs made it to the CD (due to length), the entire concert audio is available only on Sarah's website (sarahmclachlan.com) and is worth the download.This is awesome. \\"Afterglow\\" is already my favorite Sarah CD and the DVD just topped it.

Funny how Digital Rights Management only protects the record company and strips consumers of their rights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland Sound & Editing","review":"I was pretty excited to get this DVD. Thought it would be great. Well, Sarah is great...but the producing, editing & sound mix are pretty bland. Now, I am known as an expert in sound - so I am definitely biased. But the video leaves a lot to be desired too. Pretty boring.Tom Lord Alge is known as a great mixer (when you get a huge credit on the outside of the DVD box, you are big...) but I feel he 'pushed' the 5.1 mix from a stereo mix. Pretty lazy Tom. I am definitely disappointed. Stereo mix is OK but lacks any dynamics.Overall I felt the only reason it is a 2 is because of the talent of the artist. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"iPod Compatible, contrary to popular belief","review":"I see a number of reviews here that indicate that this disc cannot be transferred to an iPod. I would like to point out that it can be done, and can be done simply and legally. For those who are unwilling to spend a few minutes protecting Ms. McLachlin's rights, go back to Kazaa or what have you and quit complaining about legitimate customers. I sent a request to SunnComm about getting this to my iPod, and they responded both courteously and quickly, providing instruction that was easy to follow and successful. Do not worry about iPod compatibility - Sarah covered all her bases on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the dumpa","review":"In a classic case of betraying her true motivation for producing this disc, Sarah has copy protected it! One would think that she hadn't already made enough millions off the songs on it (What, maybe $10 million?) So, she copy protects it using SunnComm software to prevent her \\"adoring\\" and \\"wonderful\\" fans from using the music as they see fit. I guess making millions off her recordings is not sufficient. I would urge everybody inclined to like this music to examine Sarah's true motives - money, not pleasure! Skip it until she insists on removing copy protection."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO!","review":"CD/DVD set is great!But the big problem is CD has copy controlled!!!!Stop making this kind of copy protected CD, BMG/SONY!It really hurt our hearts when we pay for the artists!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"I bought this booking looking for some tools that I could use to help my son with making friends.

In this book, I wish I had a nickel for every adjective I read. The thin plot of this book was mired down in the weeds of needless prose.

The first, Suspicion of Innocence, is by far the best, although the others are also an excellent read. So I was very much looking forward to the release of this newest addition to the series.I was sadly disappointed. The book is not \\"bad\\" as such, just off the boil. There seem to be a lot of characters and not much action and the ending felt rather weak. Perhaps the natural life of these characters has come to an end - it is a shame. I would still heartily recommend reading all the other books in the series, but perhaps wait for paperback for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suspicion of Mediocrity","review":"\\"Suspicion of Madness,\\" Barbara Parker's 2003 mystery featuring Florida lawyer Gail Connor is so trite and predictable and Connor's character is so watered-down, that \\"boring\\" just doesn't even suffice as a review.Parker's treatment of attorney Connor verges on sexist, even misanthropy. But those words would require a story line worth staying awake for.Barbara, save yourself before it's too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good description of toleration","review":"This book's strength lies in its many examples and systematic structure.

I bought the other 4 \\"starring me\\" books from this author, one for each of my 4 month old twin daughters and one for photos of the three of them together. The text and graphics are fun and bright and hold my toddler's interest, especially \\"Busy Baby,\\" Peek-a-boo Baby\\" and \\"Bedtime Baby.\\"Its easy to insert the photos and they stay put.

I found much of what Dutton wrote to be healthy balance to some of the more extreme interpretations of Goldziher and Schacht insofar as Dutton is able to supercede the naivity of the current traditional approach to hadith among Muslim scholars of Islamic law while simultaneously integrating the conclusions of critical scholarship. Essential to the work and one of its main contributions as well is the treatment of the Qur'an as a source for jurisprudence and legal reasoning in Islam alongside the sunnah, 'amal, ra'y, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"A must havethe fact that some can still be found on the web is a real surprise to methe whole \\"elvis book\\" series stands out vs anything else in the elvis worldall is there: paper quality, large format, all color pix and a textno other work has got such a balance - and all the content is original though copied by bootleggers for their cs coverssean shaver was there with elvis, he invested a lot to be there and asked for nothing else but get pix of the man.

The book does contain tips and strategies to help you perform better, but when it came to actually working out answers to questions, _Cracking the LSAT_ failed. The book contained several typos: on p. 117 in the \\"Here's how to Crack it\\" paragraph, they write, \\"You've had (A) in question 5, (B) in question 6, (C) in question 6 ....\\" One question cannot have two answers! This example only makes me wonder how many other such errors this book contains. In other \\"Here's how to crack it\\" sections, the authors did not explain all of the answer choices and why one choice was passed over in favor of the correct one; and more than once, the explanations for sample questions were contradictory. This book did not help me in answering LSAT questions.

Just last night, I was about ready to give up on even studying becuase of that 'social heirarchy' question. What frustrated me is that the reasoning behind one of the WRONG answers could have just as easily applied to the RIGHT answer. Granted there are many well written questions and I allow for imperfections in 'simulations' and just move on but with this one I kept finding myself saying 'yeah, but what about...' etc. I seem to like Kaplan somewhat better after looking at it.

I ended up using it as my main source. What I liked about PR is that for those of us who don't like memorizing a lot of stuff, it provided few easily digestible categories of LSAT problems that are then easy to spot on the actual exam.One piece of advice I have given to every friend who has taken the LSAT since: whatever you do, make sure that you take a few REAL practice tests and time them."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABOVE AVERAGE TEST TAKERS BE CAREFUL","review":"These books are ok but they aren't for everyone.

That is what I will be doing next time, as I did on the SAT's as well. These books help lots of people I'm sure, but this is one case where someone scored significantly lower due to practicing methods not necessarily needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great resource","review":"I used this book in conjunction with the LSAC's TriplePrep books. This book presents the information in a straightforward and sometimes irreverent manner. The most appealing feature about this book was that it was very easy to follow. Each section and its strategies are presented in a very visual way, which encourages learning. For example, in the games section, it has you solve a game first and then goes step by step and shows how to solve it, how to put all the clues together, etc. This book is much easier than some other books I also used, notably ARCO's book. The one thing I thought that could have been done better was the games section in the diagnostic tests at the end of the book. They were much easier than the games in the TriplePrep books. But besides that, this is the best book that's out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This is the first book I bought and I wish I'd made a different choice.Although the writers of the book try hard to be clever, their tone is patronizing.

I started with Kaplan and all was well, working with their practice tests. I then picked up PR to work on theirs...totally confusing mess. I couldn't figure why I was getting 170s using Kaplan and all of a sudden I was getting so many questions wrong. Someone used the example of the 'social hierarchy' question in his review to point out there was no reason for the correctness of their answer - that was one of the first questions that had me questioning this book. I have now tossed it across the room and I'm going to stick with Kaplan and real LSATs only. I can't see how learning illogical rationale is going to help me on the test and it's totally undoing what Kaplan teaches.

This series has lifted the blinders from my eyes.In this story, Liam Rhenford must troll the sewers of society and game with the glittering aristocracy to solve a murder. I've read one other author who does such a good job of combining fantasy and mystery, and that is Glen Cook, whose Garrett series combines fantasy with hard-boiled noir detective fiction.

First thing I did when I got the trimmer was look for hair and skin follicles. I am unhappy to say that I found plenty of hair and skin and was actually happy to have received a used trimmer because this will be the last time I buy any home or personal use item from Amazon.

Several reviews about bean bags sold on Amazon refer to the chairs having labels that more or less are a warning that the bags are made with materials that are know to cause cancer and/or birth defects. After a little web research there are U Tube videos showing the warning labels on bean bag chairs bought in different stores. So I deleted the item because I didn't know if the bean bag chairs on Amazon had the warnings or not. My question is why are bean bags for children made w/ materials that could cause cancer or birth defects and why is Amazon selling them? If you are not selling bean bags w/ these materials and warnings then you should make that perfectly clear in the product's description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I spent several days looking at bean bags on Amazon. Against my better judgement, I purchased this bean bag that had no reviews at the time. Everything in the description looked good! Unfortunately when we got the bag we notice that every time you sat on it, moved it around...basically used it, that the filling was seeping out of the seams. When we opened it up, the bag was filled with what appeared to be crushed/grated styrofoam. It was coming out of the seams because some of the filling was super fine like shavings/dust. It was a mess! Since I had noticed that there was a 15% restocking fee and I would have to ship it back, I kept it and cleaned it out. We had to replace the filling with a better material. Nasty filling! I would not recommend purchasing this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small for (most) adults ..","review":"Had ordered the adult size and found it too small for regular usage. It hardly provides any neck support, which is very annoying and painful. Too small in size and perhaps that's the reason - The naming of product is kinda misnomer. The quality of product is good and my friend recently ordered an XL version of the same. The XL size was fair for adult usage. So if considering buying it for adult regular usage, XL would be a better option."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not adult size in any manner","review":"After the product was shipped to it has a label attached which says the product is known to cause cancer WTFSecondly if 6-8 years old are considered adults then this is okay for them, cause a full size adult or for that matter even a teenager cannot sit on thisShipping it back was a bigger hassle than dumping it in my trash so I just stuck to the latterNot recommended ...

The art by Chiang is awesome, you deffinately see his style in the art for the first two star wars movies. Lucas sure gave him a lot of artistic freedom, the robots are almost identicle in style and buildings had some similarities as well. Not sure how much Orson Scott Card contributed compared to Chiang for the story. It was a simple but good sci fi story. Chiang does discuss he had had this idea for a story at a very young age in the \\"Foreward\\" section as far as background setting, and finally realized characters during a trip he was taking in Northern Cal so i guess OSC polished it up.

Always one to judge a book by its cover, I am glad I did so in this case. Robota is a stunning portfolio of Chiang's talent.The text is underdeveloped, leaving the reader with many unanswered questions, and will likely not appeal to hard sci-fi fans.Most striking is the SORT of book which Robota is. It's a sci-fi picture book, the likes of which I haven't seen since Edwards and Holdstock published \\"Tour of the Universe\\" so many years ago.

I would go so far as to label them \\"dated\\", but not in some kind of interesting retro sense.I'd give the imagery a B+. However, there's not enough of it either, which adds to my disappointment.

I suppose this last one could be subjective, but to my ear, and with the way the instrumental section feels, that's how it sounds.

This however, appealed to me as a straight toning workout and I really enjoy it a lot. Allie Del Rio Pointer is a new instructor to me, and I found her to be very good, not annoying and easy to follow along to.The entire workout uses weights and to get maximum results, nearly every fast paced exercise works multiple muscles in one go. She also starts with a basic routine and then adds modifications to increase intensity. I also like this because all you need is two sets of weights and you're good to go.This is a good 40 minute routine to really do almost every muscle in your body and based on this workout, I'll definately give The Firm more tries. I enjoy this and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD WORKOUT","review":"This is a good overall workout, not too long, not too short.

Indeed, much of the supposed length of the video is spent telling the names of the women in the video. Good workout videos gradually introduce movements and then proceed to incorporate those movements in a creative and yet logical way into a full, robust workout. This video confusingly introduces a bunch in a small space and then never builds on them; we kept looking for a second chapter entitled \\"workout,\\" but alas, it's not there.

There is a beginers version and advanced version.You swat, bend, pump weights, sqeeze gluts, crunch the entire time. I feel guilty when I skip a day.I've been using it for a month.

I thik Allie's queuing is much better than some of the new Firm instructors but the video was still a bit tough to follow, mostly due to the really poor camera work. Most of the time the shots were very tightly zoomed when I really wanted a whole body shot so I could actually see how to do the moves. This seems to be a problem for all the new Firm videos. I won't be buying another one. As for the music, I'm not sure who it was trying to appeal to; it goes from rock to electronica, to disco and isn't right at all for the pacing. The only good part about it is that the music is so soft you can tune it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite a workout!","review":"I love the FIRM, and I love Allie!She really delivers a great workout in this DVD.

It's a shame, because the first chapter does a good job of grabbing the reader's attention and setting up the book. Once again, however, I find that a full-length novel by Ballard has only enough plot for a short story. The whole car crash-eroticism idea is an intriguing one, but it can't substitute for a storyline. Ballard goes into overkill, beating the reader over the head with all the minute erotic aspects of car crashes; meanwhile, the plot becomes less and less important, and the characters remain stagnant. I would almost say that this book is a parody of a sex-thriller, but after reading \\"Crash\\", I think that the other has more merit.*Also, I found Ballard's use of smells in this book laughable. The main character must have some Bloodhound in him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex violence and broken glass","review":"This is a really intruiging book. Its written in a detailed, deadpan style that is both emotionally cool and very stylish, and explores connections between sex, technology and death. At points it reads a little like a clinical dissertation on road trauma but is none the less absorbing because of it. The book also contains interesting information about the fatal road crashes of celebrities such as Dean, Mansfield and Camus. The story revolves around people for whom car crashes, and the psychological and physical immersion in them, provides increasingly intense sexual pleasure. I really enjoyed this book, and as an aside, felt that the movie by Cronenberg accurately conveyed the sense of chillingly kinky, sexually violent exploration articulated in the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"One idea doesn't make a book.","review":"Ahead of its time, yes. Disturbing, yes. Would make a great 5 page short story, yes. Is it a good book? No. It's prolonged and boring. After a hundred pages reading the same thing over and over again becomes a torture, the characters are underdeveloped, and the plot is almost non-existent.This book would've made a wonderful short story. It's written in good style, but if you skip a page, or two, or ten at a time, you're not missing much.I recommend it only for its novelty value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully dull","review":"Had to read this book for a class and I thought it was horrible. After reading only a few chapters you basically have the gist of the whole book because it really doesn't go anywhere. It's just a repetition of car crashes and lude sexual acts which the author seems to be using as a way in which to carry his reader's attention. It feels entirely forced and is noticable that the author throws in random sexual acts and fantasies at the end of nearly every chapter as a way to keep his audience engaged. It seems like it could have been a decent short story but that it was drawn out into a novel without any clear direction of where the story is going. I feel slightly disgusted that this was actually published."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid","review":"I tried to read it. After couple of chapters i was skimming to try find the inner workings of the mind of the characters etc feel of the plot etc Boring repetious gratuitous sadism ,gore,sex in different combinations but barely with any new way of expressing from the one before. The film was better. It made me wonder if the author was not churning out a novel to put a new dormer on his house- aiming at the public lobotomised by the same gratuitous stuff in movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"Ballard's writing has a certain descriptive fluency and some of his earlier short stories were good. It is depressing to see a real talent turned to the production of pretentious, convulsive trash.

It doesn't have a single redeeming quality. Even the use of language is poor. It's just an endless, nauseating, and thoroughly perverted musing about semen, crotches, and crumpled vehicles. Even the one or two times an infant appears in the book, it is involved in a sex act.Can't imagine what the author and publisher were thinking.

If I had not seen the movie, I more then likely would never of purchased the book, and I would never of gotten past the second chapter.Every paragraph is so over descriptive, and it's confusing to process if the character is day dreaming at any given time or actually doing something.I finb it a little errie that J.G. Ballard names himself as the character in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over, Harold Robbins. J.G.'s in da house!","review":"J.G. Ballard's Crash is a light-hearted , sexy romp thru 1970s swinging London. In tantalizing detail, it explores the lives of several hot, young hardbodies, cruisin' their vintage British rides and doin' the nasty--so what's not to love?My recommendation? Read it with a good friend (wink, wink, nudge, nudge) or be prepared to take matters into your own hands. It's that goooood!The only reason I withheld a star was 'cause there wasn't quite enough of that droll Dr. Vaughn and the dishy Gabrielle.Wadya say, Jimmy B.? How about a sequel?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of dumb.","review":"I bought this book for two reasons. First, I like David Cronenberg movies a lot and I wanted to read this before I watched the film. Secondly, Ballard was recommended to me because I liked \\"Fight Club\\" and other books of the genre. I didn't like \\"Crash\\" a whole lot though. Sure, the idea of people obsessing with the sexuality surrounding car crashes is original, but it's a bit tiresome when it's dragged on for 200 pages (thank goodness the book isn't longer). I guess the book would have been a lot better if it hadn't repeated itself so often. I tired after the fourth or fifth time the main characters had sex after either causing a car crash, witnessing a car crash, or staging one. I gave this two stars rather than one because it has potential to be a good book. I don't know if I'll like Ballard's other works. I also want to say the Cronenberg film was pretty dumb too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciatingly dull....","review":"This book *desperately* wants to shock and disturb you. Unfortunately, Ballard's hackneyed prose only succeeds in boring the reader to distraction.The third time Ballard used the phrase \\"natal cleft,\\" I threw the book across the room in frustration. You know an author is reaching when he runs out of synonyms for CROTCH!! (Perhaps Ballard needs Roget's Sexual Thesaurus!)I regret that I can never reclaim the precious hours I wasted reading the first half of this book. My only consolation is that I DIDN'T read the second half.Do yourself a favor and avoid *both* halves of \\"Crash.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled","review":"I've read a lot of books from various genres and written by crazy authors. I have to say though, that this book is without a doubt the worst book I have ever read. The story is completely disjointed, and you have no connection to the characters (you neither hate them, nor love them). I absolutely did not care what happened at the end of this novel. Given all this, the reason I allowed this novel to have two stars is because of the lack of emotions in the characters and the storyline - this seems to be a central theme. All the characters are striving to have some kind of emotional attachment to SOMETHING, whether it be cars, or people, or whatever. The author has done a spectacular job of extracting emotion from the characters and the story. This being said, the story is so terrible that I would never recommend this novel to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"One of the few books I felt compelled to throw against the wall so I could witness the tearing pages mold themselves to the pristine white paint covering my plasterboard.Not shocking, interesting, exciting or experimental... just boring, pretentious, repetitive and overwrought.The only experiment by Ballard was to see how many times he can end paragraphs with the same violent juxtaposition of car and body. Open to any page and you're likely to read something almost exactly like this:\\"Her left leg rested on the ground, the door pillar realigning both itself and the dashboard mounting to avoid her knee, almost as if the entire car had deformed itself around her figure in a gesture of homage.\\"OK, now try this for 220+ pages. I'm not kidding... it does *not* get more exciting than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"good grief","review":"Ballard, a writer of surpassing skill, is attracted to the grotesque beauty of car crashes -- the pretzeled steel, the smoke, the fountains of coolant and blood. I do not share his tastes, but I envy his ability to make me understand, or at least begin to understand, why his twisted mind might appreciate this gruesomeness. The writing in this book is gorgeous in a terrifying way. I recommend the book with little reservation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive, taboo for the sake of being taboo, overly-long.","review":"I really wanted to read this as a darkly-poetic statement about the direction in which our technology is taking us and/or alienation and the desire for connection (physical or otherwise), but was just too personally alienated (perhaps intentionally?) by all the issues I mentioned in the title-line to do so. I can appreciate the power of creating characters the reader doesn't entirely relate to, whether for the purpose of exploring a taboo or some sort of disjuncture or any other desired intellectual terrain, but the author's repetition and lack of major progression made it hard to even appreciate this book as an intellectual exercise. I had to push myself to complete it.I gave it two stars because of Ballard's use of language (he creates some powerfully repugnant analogies/allegories) and exploration of ideas. However, intellectual exercise, alone, does not a successful novel make for this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Thing I've Ever Read","review":"I really, really hated this book. After a few chapters it actually turned into a personal challenge to \\"beat the book\\" by finishing the horrid thing. I did finish it and still wonder why I bothered.At one point I actually started counting how many times Ballard used \\"Heavy Groin,\\" \\"Scarred Mouth\\" and \\"Semen\\" but I eventually lost count. There were just too many repetitive uses to track without more effort than I was willing to apply.Seriously. It is bad. Just plain bad.Made worse by the fact that I read it after Palahniuk's \\"Survivor\\" which was quite excellent. Kind of like following a spoon full of \\"Chunky Monkey\\" with a heaping helping of rancid mayonaise.This is the one and only book I have EVER tossed in the garbage when finished.I feel I need to quickly read something good to cleanse myself. Maybe another reading of \\"Catch-22\\" would do the trick???"},{"rating":"2","title":"crash, the novel","review":"To: \\"A Reader. 03/28/97. rating = 6 ... not bad after all...\\" your synopsis of the twentieth century's most enigmatic author, I find thorougly deplorable . It is my belief that you are an echidnious buffoon. This is an example of apoctalyptic literature and a halluncinary book that meshes our society of today with tradgedies you will not understand. The rapture of our beginning or of our end. Tomorrow when we die I will rise above you in the knowledge of \\"CRASH\\". I've nothing more to say!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sccccrrrreeeeccchhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!AAaaaahhhhhhh.....","review":"Sexual...mechanical...beautiful. The best words to describe this novel. An erotic essay on man made machinery and the deformities caused by the misplaced actions therein. The tender wounds inflicted on the human body and description of many objects as orifices leads one to believe that this is either the work of a sick mind or one so intrigued by what the mind can do to its vehicle. In many aspects it appears as a love story between man, machine and the rifts that rise between those affected and hoping to affect crashes upon their own bodies. It would be cheap to label their experiments as an extreme sport but correct to label it as extreme art. Art that is inflicted on the human body leaving scars to remember the experience. Now its your turn to buy this book and take the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful and graphic","review":"I bought this book with full knowledge of its controversial subject matter and I was not dissappointed. The book immediately opens with graphic descriptions that made me cringe and hesitate, for a moment, to read on. This is something many do not enjoy. I, however, did enjoy the novel and its graphic nature. I found the book to be slightly confusing though one must take into account the way in which J.G. Ballard wrote it, with a hallucinatory feel. The book itself is a whirlwind of eroticism and violence that caused me to see the link between the two, made so apparent by Ballard, that would have been unrecognizable prior to reading the novel. It was a great read and I fully intend to read more works of this skilled and powerful author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few reasons why I like CRASH","review":"Crash is first peice of writing that I have read by J.G. Ballard, and hopefully it won't be the last. I found the novel erotic, repulsive, and horrifying; yet at the same time, highly enlighting. This is probably due to the fact that Ballard, in my opinion, has an intoxicating style of writing that finds the deepest darkest place in his reader and stimulates it to surface. I found Ballards characters, emotionally depraved as they are, to be both complex, and compelling. Even more frightening is the fact that the car crash fetish is not just something out of Ballard's own imagination, people with this affliction do exist, and are much like the characters in his novel. It is a satisfying thing to be able to find an original peice of writing that completely undercuts your view of what is normal; and it is in this area that Ballard unquestionably succeeds"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash. And burn.","review":"I read the book. I had no problem with the subject matter. In fact, I was intrigued by it. BUT.. the writing was PAINFUL, repetetive and weak. How many times can you use the words \\"Stylized\\" and \\"Instrument binnacle\\"? Perhaps the idea was to make to characters and prose as mechanical as the object of their obsession. Maybe. That MAY make it forgiveable. But that doesn't make it good.The 2 stars I gave were STRICTLY for the subject matter. The writing itself was tedious. I think it's been a very long time since I've read a book that BORED me this much. I hated the characters, they were shallow and self-obsessed, and BORING! Any chance of erotic tension was lost because I honestly didn't give a rat's behind if the characters had sex or not. I stuck with the book, because I hoped there was a point. There wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollow Men staggering through a Hollow Plot","review":"The entire premise of the book was too thinly believable for me to accept - a maniacal doctor who's sexually aroused by car wrecks. He runs about photographing them, wondering whether the victims' genitalia were injured and masturbating at crash safety tests. As the book progressed, I found it harder and harder to believe in the doctor's obsessions - and in his desire to die. Admittedly, those factors do not make the book bad art, they merely make it repellent. Crash is not an entirely worthless book. It addresses a number of issues significant to present-day society. If you're looking for a masterpiece about sex and death, though, don't believe the hype on the cover. Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yaaaaaaawn............","review":"Even though the images in this book disturbed me at times and turned my stomach the plot of this novel was very mudane and boring. The characters were never fully developed and I had no compassion or even interest in their lives. Perhaps with a little more character development and a faster moving pace (the book was very repetitive) it would have been a more worthy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my thing","review":"I did not like this novel at all. I respect the author's audacity, and I admire his descriptive powers and use of language. Also, the issue of technology and machinery in modern human interactions is an important subject; it's what brought me to the book.The problem is that nothing much happens. I didn't mind the gore or explicit sex; I minded the fact that I didn't care about the characters or the plot. It's a theme-driven novel, and the theme doesn't change or evolve. The descriptions of cars, airplanes, crashes, sexual escapades, drug trips -- they're the same at the start as at the finish. I wanted to grab the author and yell, \\"OK, OK, I get it; can we move on now?\\"The only reason I don't give it 1 star is that Ballard's use of language is great, and his themes are important. But that's all I got out of this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"This book -despite a provocative concept- is not good. I don't recommend reading it. Ballard's language makes no sense and tries way too hard. If you read the last two pages you'll find out just how unworthwhile -blatently stupid- this work really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"I entirely understand what Ballard was writing about here...","review":"however, the story just never takes off. The comparisons Ballard draws between the metaphysics of cars and sexual response is slightly engaging, however, it is not engaging enough to carry you over these 220 odd pages. The story is lackluster. I give the book 2 stars for this concept Ballard explores - drawing parallels between cars and the human experience, etc., however I found the book tedious and repetitive. Bloody shame, too, the book came under high praise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and Bold","review":"A fascinating and grotesque Jim Ballard novel--it delves deep into the sexualization of violence, and the machinations of masochism with tremendous skill. Ballard places himself in this dark panorama, where he meets Vaughn, a man who gets off on car crashes. It's not easy to make it through Ballard's excruciatingly detailed passages that chronicle the a litany of sexually infused car crashes, events where the human body is disassembled and forever destroyed. Ballard's difficult novel asks us to consider the ways in which modern technology is distorting our relationships and our bodies--it is a relentless parable about the dark recesses of the man-machine matrix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its Vile but well written","review":"My god, this is vile.We have from the 1995 introduction by Ballardto this 1973 novel......I would still like to think that Crash is the first pornographic novel based on technology.Basically this revolves around a group of people that get off sexually around car crashes and the injuries they suffer.As a feat of imagination its is amazing, but that's J G Ballard but many of the scenes are staggering in their baseness. He describes it as pornographic but there is nothing even shallowly exciting about it. Ballard must have been on a retainer for writing \\" natal cleft\\", if he was he made a fortune.Vaughn the anti-hero is officially the most repulsive character in fiction, hands down there is no one even close and I would love to accept nominations.An amazing writer but I couldn't wait to finish this. The introduction mentions metaphors that the novel is meant represent but I must be too thick to get any of it.A truly horrible experience"},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzz. . . .","review":"I couldn't have been more dissapointed by this book. I decided to read Crash on account of the numerous high reviews posted on Amazon.com by other readers. I felt nothing towards the characters of this novel. Indeed, aside from occassional disgust (with myself for actually continuing to tred through this garbage), this book stirred little or no emotion in me. In concept, the relationship between sexuality, modern society and technology is thought-provoking. Unfortunately, this book did little to analyze this topic beyond using it as a backdrop for the rather boring storyline. In the end, I just didn't care. Don't bother reading this book. You have better ways to spend your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRASH - absolute peurile drivel!","review":"I have read a number of Ballard's works - Hi-Rise and The Drowned World are decent enough. His writing style is dry, mechanical; he's certainly no lyricist. Crash is one of the worst books I have ever read, not because of the 'shocking' content but because it is just BAD! No real plot, reams of description about cars crashes, etc ... in fact the whole book feels as if the same five pages are being endlessly repeated ... I can think of nothing whatsoever to recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste my time.","review":"The book's title would have been better as \\"Crap\\" As a hugefan of books that shock and offend, I was very excited aboutreading this book. However I was sadly disappointed afterabout 50 pages (I was also bored!). Maybe I'm missingsomething with Ballard's connection between the sexual actand cars, but I don't see any relevance. Ballard is lookingdown his nose at the reader, assuming their stupidity. Thebooks characters are weak and transparent, and the story isfar to meandering to really have any point. I was veryunhappy.

It was here Himmler met with his top 12 SS Obergruppenfuhrer and possible conducted occult rituals. There were two rooms built in the castle with ritual like symbolism. Wewelsburg plays a big part in my own novel, Out Came Blood and Water, which will come soon. Anyhow, this book begins with a plot to get the Soviets to go against the Allies by giving them a list of Nazi supporters in Britain. The plan fails, and the SS man assigned to do it hooks up with a British reporter and they use the list for blackmail. Through a series of events, Wewelsburg gets into the mix and the climax is great. Time magazine called the ending \\"...one of the best siege narratives since The Guns of Navarone.\\" This book is unlike most of Kyle's work, but nonetheless is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good summer read","review":"Dr. Laura Donaldson is a cancer researcher looking for the elusive cure for cancer, when she happens upon information and evidence of a death row inmate who seems to have an immune system that just eats up cancer cells. David Haines is the death row inmate with the super immune system along with a fanatical religious belief that will not allow him to give his blood. He's on death row for killing numerous doctors. Dr. Laura Donaldson's attempts to acquire a sample of his blood through legal means backfires when Haines makes a somewhat predictable escape from prison. Kevin Sheldrake, the FBI agent who captured Haines the first time, is on the case again. Can they capture him alive?With a gritty edge of suspense and a little background on cancer and cults, this makes for some entertaining summer reading. You'll see the depths reached by religious fanaticism and the fervor of a scientist with a goal. The ending was left open for a sequel and, to me, a little disappointing.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine, intelligent thriller...","review":"Oppel, in his first outing of \\"adult\\" fiction,has written a fun and fairly engrossing story. The medical parts of the book are fascinating. The search for meaning in the universe/faith was not original but pulled off with style. The last third of the book was very much a Hollywood screenplay, but still exciting. ocan easily see this on screen. The story is nonetheless quite interesting and it is solid read. The ending is a bit too Hollywood, yet for this price it was worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CD's that I have ever bought","review":"Stop reading this and order the CD now.

If you ask me, this CD is the crown jewel of my collection. Just enough beat to wind you into a frenzy and then a perfectly timed mellow song to let you catch your breath.

Without the trappings that usually define them, they're compelled to get down to basics and discover important things about themselves.While some of Lurie's earlier books are richer, the broad strokes seem appropriate here.

I eagerly bought this one in light of my past good experiences and have never been so disappointed. This is not a finished work; it is a rough outline of a plot with cardboard characters, no motiviation, dull description, etc. that neither the author nor her editors cared enough about to turn into a finished work. It is also surprisingly poorly written; Lurie is usually a fine stylist. But, really, what is one to make of sentences like \\"'Okay,' Lee answered repressively.\\" (see p. 221).

Wilkie is suffering from chronic depression and plotting his own suicide, unbeknownst to his wife. In an attempt to lift his mood, his 46 year old, bland and devoted wife Jenny suggests they winter in Key West, Florida. Wilkie is self-centered and egotistical. Jenny can only be called a \\"Stepford Wife\\". Her life totally centers around Wilkie and his wants and needs. In Key West a group of equally boring characters come into the lives of the Walkers - a vapid female CPA, a handsome gardener, in the beginning stages of AIDS, an aging has-been poet and a free-spirited lesbian. I cared about none of the boring characters, and kept wishing Wilkie would finally do the deed and kill himself so we readers could be rid of him.

It was one of the worst books I've ever read. I like to indulge in trashy beach books once in a while - for instance,I loved Bridget Jones' Diary and About a Boy, even though neither could be considered particulary noteworthy in the world of great literature. But The Last Resort is just plain terrible. Lurie's writing style is one step above a Harlequin Romance. Her dialogue was inane, her characters trite and uni-dimensional, and the plot was totally uninteresting. I could not wait to finish it! I cannot believe this author ever won a Pulitzer Prize."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time.","review":"This book was billed as a great beach read. It's not even that.

Her humorous attitude for a hard time of life is refreshing. \\"The Last Resort\\" illustrates again her shrewd writing talent. This book offers a laugh to seniors who trek annually to Florida. It is also a parable for younger readers. The characters are meant to be cartoons. I think the ending is very sly. Alison Lurie gets even with some pompous old writers and slings a little manure, too, at a self-important poet (Robert Bly I suspect).

Koontz writes like a BAT OUT OF HELL and knows what scares us and what frightens! He is this century's great contemporary writer regardless of genre.

Koontz tackles difficult topics such as teleportation and telekinesis. I say \\"difficult\\" in that it would be hard to write a plausible story with that subject matter. But Koontz pulls it off in \\"The Door to December\\" suprisingly well. The book is well-paced and the descriptions are vivid without being overkill.

What a mess!","review":"Not only heavily borrows from SK's Firestarter but also is much weaker and terrible. the girl just seems to be an intelligent young woman...terrible... nothing frightening or exciting...terrible...this is my third DK book and I am already becoming weary of him (the first one was Watchers, with which every one applauds but which I found a sophomore attempt preying on sentimentality of people...the second one phantoms which was better) how does he come up with such silly dialogue? Did I say terrible?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another opinion...a total snore!","review":"Wow! I was actually glad to read all the positive reviews of this book, because obviously it has some redeeming value. For me, however, this book was a big disappointment. I figured out what was going on as soon as the toaster started jumping around...and was bored ever since. If you have read or seen Stephen King's Firestarter, you will feel that you have seen all this before. I started skipping large parts of the book after I had gotten two thirds of the way through. Sorry folks but...I beg to differ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"the book was pretty good at the begining but it dissapointed me after that.its got some good moments but its got more boring moments.i really tried to like it but i couldnt give buyers a misunderstood review."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the author's best!","review":"The Door to December kept me enthralled throughout. The characterization was excellent, and the story line was exciting. I also enjoyed the typical Koontz wit which was threaded into the dialogue. Books like this are so intense that it's hard to move on to a tamer genre after finishing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"so great i hope they make a movie of it","review":"i usually do not read science fiction but i could not put this book down. all i could think of after i finished with it is i hope they make it into a movie . this book also needs a sequell."},{"rating":"2","title":"da Bomb","review":"This book will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire book. A must for any Koontz fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book reads like a great movie...","review":"What I mean by that is when you watch a movie you try to catch every detail that's going on. During a really good movie you don't leave the theatre to get a snack...you wait til it's over. Door to December is one book that I think I read every single word. (especially the many thoughts of the Luitenent) After I finished the book, I read it again to make sure I didn't miss anything. I read this book as many times as I've seen Al Pacino in the Devils Advocate. After writing this review I have the urge to run to my bookshelf and read it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very average Koontz book","review":"I've read many of Koontz's books over the years, and was disappointed by this one. I don't know how ANY of the readers here could say it is great, or \\"the best.\\" I'm a big Stephen King fan, and have enjoyed many of Koontz's books in the past, really liked Odd Thomas, and some of his older books, like Phantoms, Whispers, Strangers, Whispers, and The Bad Place. This was barely worth the read. I will continue to peruse Amazon for reviews of his better books, so wish me luck. I'd hate to give up on Koontz entirely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply put... Wow!","review":"I must say that this is definately one of my favorite Koontz books. I've read many Koontz books, and this is one of my all time favs. I did find it mildly disturbing at times, but nothing that I couldn't handle.It was a wonderfully told story about child abuse and the effects that abuse can have on children. Mixed with action, suspense, humor, and reality, it's really a masterpiece, simply put.I did, however, find the ending rather predictable, but even so I wanted to keep reading to see my predictions put into words by the best author of all time. And even though it was quite predictable, there were still surprising times at the end.I would definately recommend this book to anyone, especially the Koontz fanatic.-----If you find it difficult to stomach certain things, this book may not be the one for you. -It's still great, either way though!Other recommendations: From The Corner Of His Eye, One Door Away From Heaven"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm a fan of Dean Koontz, but this is definitely not one of his better works. The dialogue is artificial and hokey, and I actually found myself rolling my eyes during Dan's conversations with his colleagues. The story was predictable and slow. I usually pass good books on to friends and family, but I am not recommending this one to anyone I know. Don't give up on Dean Koontz if this is the first book you've read by him. Read The Bad Place, it is absolutely fascinating. Also recommended: Midnight and Lightning. I guess you can't win them all. Pass this one up and read his other books instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy Kid!!","review":"It was very taunting and easy to read. I can imagine this could really happen! So glad it didn't!

I found myself looking forward to a 1-hour ride home when I sit back, relax, flip the pages and transport myself into a consciousness where such things became possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Dean Koontz book!","review":"I love Dean Koontz! This is one of my favorite books by him! I work full time and am a single mother of three teens and I finished this book in three days. Every free second I got I was reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his best works","review":"The basic concept of the mother finding her daughter after six years, only blocks from her home and under unusual circumstances had me intrigued...at first. Then it is the usual boy meets girl and they fight the good fight together to go on to build a life together. In between is the typical surreal settings that Koontz is synonymous with in most of his books. I had this one figured out after about 100 pages and was disappointed to find out I was right. Read it if you must but there are better books in this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better reads...","review":"As a Dean Koontz fan, I must admit that I was rather dissappointed by this book. It was way too long, and although I usually find myself tearing through the pages of his books, I muddled along through this one. Before you read this, read Lightning and The House of Thunder. These are Koontz at his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very depressing ...","review":"I can't even get into this novel because it is so dark. Also, it just fails to grab and hold like so many of Dean Koontz' books. It has a creepy air about it with all the abuse and swearing. Give me something that's more exciting and in better taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yukkk! Please don't think this is really Dean Koontz","review":"The Door to December is the newest Koontz audio book in my local library system and I thought it would be up up his usual standards. Was I mistaken! Creepy but not mysterious should be an oxymoron but that describes this book. Child abuse and S&M; does not really make for entertainment, even in Koontz's hands. I felt depressed after finishing this book because there seemed no hope for the characters nor purpose to the story except for a generalized fear of the government.After Odd Thomas, The Face, Watchers, and other Koontz wonders, I was beyond disappointed. This book was originally published in 1985 under another name and I can only hope the author has left this junk behind. Thank goodness for George Guidell. He made listening bearable. I probably would not have finished a text version.Please Dean, even Steven King learned not to torture kids.(See Cujo.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid effort","review":"Overall, this book was entertaining..I liked the characters. The plot was fairly predictable...but Koontz handles it with flair so its not boring.It became a little tedious to read about Melanie's constant \\"blank\\" state and Laura pleading with her to do something. One more question, What happened to Pepper the Cat?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST book I have ever read.","review":"Koontz is a geniuses with his characters. This was the first book that I wasn't able to put down. The thrilling and gruesome suspense was consistent throught the entire book. LOVED IT!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A fan of Dean but not this book.","review":"Like all Kootz novels this book is readable. The totally predictable outcome and excessive length make the overall experience much more boring than the average Koontz book. I have not read all of DKs books but of the fifteen or so I have finished I would rate this effort as tied for last place ( I also thought Demon Seed was a waste of my time).I still plan to read all of DKs books. When he is good, he is very good. Even when he is bad I think he rates two stars for some snappy dialog and decent (though brief) characterization."},{"rating":"1","title":"Substandard","review":"I love Dean Koontz. But totally disliked this book. It was too pushed. What was happening was more than obvious since the very beginning of the book. The writer should know his fans better - most of us warmed up to the truth long, long before the grand revelation at the end of the book.Also not a fan of George Guidall. He narrates terribly. I can hear him licking his chops, and he sounds weird, sighs in strange places, his women voice is way weird, he disconnects me from the story, instead of drawing me closer. Total disappointment.Just listened to the Frankenstein series, last few narrated by Christopher Lane - loved it, both the story and the voice. This book - substandard. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertisement","review":"The tape measure pictured her is not what I received.I've been done wrong.The tape measure I got is far below sub-standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best tape ever.","review":"I've had this tape for three years and it's never let me down. It's accurate, strong, reliable and i know it will last a long time if maintained properly. Every so often I pull the tape to the 27' mark and lightly oil the blade and let it return under control to the housing. If i'm working with chalk or construction adhesive i'm careful not to get any on the blade. So if you decide to buy this tape, look after it and it will pay you back in spades. Simply the best tape measure on the market, end of story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Story","review":"This is a work of fiction that is based on people in our history and their lives though they did not interact as written. Though the book is written very simply and it's not difficult to guess where the story is leading it was very entertaining and much better than the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yippee! One helluva fine read","review":"Whoa, this was such a good book I was moved throughout to chuckle, sigh, sob and react. Please, more like this one, Alan Geoffrion, just as fast as you can and hurry up about it. There's a lot to savor in this novel, so much so that it's very rich indeed. Mind you, there are few Western novels that detail campfire food but we get that here in spades, yippee! Do yourself a favor and don't pass up this terrific novel.

Very superficial, very repetitive, with little detail, and few examples of how things actually work. All written in the passive voice. Much worse, criticism of the weaknesses of the current system is extremely muted, if not completely non-existent, and there are few or no suggestions for improvement. It seems to be written by a couple of corporate apologists. There is no sense of outrage over the loopholes in the current system, little attempt to point out ways shareholder safeguards could be strengthened, or to point fingers at the guilty parties.Exactly the book that the CEO's of large corporations, Congress, and the SEC would want you to read about corporate governance.What a shame, when the world so greatly needs to read informed criticism of the corporate structure and it's weaknesses, and how it can be improved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous for $14.99","review":"I just bought this book at borders today on sale. It is a fascinating book that is teeming with facts and stats. I do have one issue though, the color schemes used to indicate facts and areas, are very similarly colored, making maps not very friendly on the eyes.

I enjoyed the idea of the book... a black man making his way in the political arena.... but I didn't really like the book itself. It was set in a series of flashbacks, that at times only confused me more. I don't think that the emotions that the main character had were ever really developed between either woman.... therefore making the ending almost too.... bookish and unbelievable. It was corny actually. I finished reading the book feeling as though I had gained.... nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another wonderful work from Mr. McCann!","review":"Always...is nothing short of superb! It has just the right blend of politics, suspense, and romance. The final message about the importance of getting our priorities in order and living each day as though it were our last was beautifully communicated. It was wonderful to have an opportunity to know Cheryl, Leslie, and Henry Louis Davis II on such a personal level. Timmothy McCann does an excellent job of helping us to understand and appreciate all three of them. I was reminded of the positive difference an African-American United States President could make. I was also reminded of the depth of hatred and prejudice in the world.

Always by Timm McCann is a delightful read that consists of a unique story about an African-American man who seeks to be the first black president of the U.S. The story also goes back and forth with memories from the two loves of his life; his wife, Leslie and, Cheryl, a woman he has loved and never forgotten. The writing style in Always makes it a standout novel; Timm does a fine job writing with sensitivity, detail, intelligence, humor, plot twists, and poetic insight.The writer must be commended for taking a risk in composing a story that goes beyond the standard relationship tale. In my book, the risk was well worth it and, as such, Always comes highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need to Get This book","review":"Timmothy McCann writes the type of stories that are so real you are right there with the characters. A black man with a real shot for the presidency, if we all could know what are dreams are at an early age and never allow anyone to dissuade us of what we can't be we would all be so much richer. I am glad that no one tried to dissaude Timmothy from reaching his goal of being a writer. His characters are warm and complex and so like everyone I really know in the real world.Love and love stories are universal and speaks to what we all want for ourselves when I read this book my desires to feel and experience that kind of earth shaking love was fullfilled.

I tried going over areas several times and never felt satisfied with the result. I didn't buy this razor to go over areas over and over again... It's time consuming and uncomfortable; worse than using a disposable razor. Defeats the purpose of buying an electric razor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This razor requires you to go over the same area multiple times; as a consequence it takes a long time to shave.

This is the second time within 6 months that I have bought this product, only to have it fail after the 30-day return window. I am extremely disappointed. When the first shaver, purchased last December, failed to come on--for no evident reason--I called Panasonic customer care. What a waste of time! Their only solution was to package and ship the item to their Texas location, where it would be examined and repaired if possible, or replaced by a new shaver. Besides the time factor--sending it and waiting to get it back would take 10-14 days--it would cost me $27. For a $29 purchase, this clearly was not an option... so I bought another one. Same thing happened with the second one.

It never really worked. Even right after shaving my legs were NOT smooth. They felt like it had been about a day or so since shaving with a regular razor. How disappointing.

First hold your skin taunt because this puppy bites and if it gets a ahold of you, there will be blood. A team of trained professionals can't get the bleeding to stop and I put the sailors to shame! It takes forever. You have to almost scrap it along your skin, mind you hold your skin taunt, and go over the same area in many directions, many times. My old shaver took me 10 minutes max.

I don't particularly care to shave in the shower either. All I want in a shaver is for it to work well for my armpits and legs. I have sensitive skin, so I took a chance on this shaver; it's my first Panasonic, and my last.The reason this gets two stars instead of one is that it does do a good job on my legs, and the shaver holds a charge well, for several shaves. That said, my primary concern is shaving my armpits without irritation, which it does, and without having to keep going over the same area to catch all the hairs, which it doesn't. You would think that with the rotating head that this contour feature would help, but this shaver will not give you a close shave under your arms without several passes. I don't even have thick hair, so if you do, I certainly wouldn't recommend this shaver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for 1 month & now it's dead!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"When I first received this shaver, it worked great! I have it one month & now it won't charge any more. I was extremely careful with it & only charged it when the charge was gone, and never over-charged it. Now, I can't get it to charge at all any more. I'm very disappointed with this shaver - worked great for one month & then died! I would not buy this type of item from Amazon again either, because they don't even know how much of my money they will be refunding. They can't promise me a full refund because it's been over 30 days since I placed my order, even though the shaver is now useless!!

I found that it does not shave as closely or as evenly as previous electric shavers I've used. I noticed that regardless of the angle I held the shaver at, the left side of the shaver would always work better than the right, making it so that I had to repeat the area multiple times. Also, the blades seem to go dull very quickly- afte about a month and a half of moderate use! After that time, the shaver kept pulling the hair instead of shaving it, leading to an unpleasant experience and numerous bumps and redspots. The one advantage to this shaver is the wet/dry function which is very useful for using in the shower. Overall, I would say that this is an okay shaver for the price, but if you can afford it, get a slightly more expensive and higher quality shaver that will shave evenly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Remington","review":"Thought my mom's electric Remington razor that you have to plug in was outdated so I decided to get the Panasonic.

It needed a few passes to really trim the hair on my legs, but I have found that to be the case with all electric shavers I have used.However, after a couple months it began to not cut very cleanly, and then began to snag and pull out hairs painfully. I treated the shaver gently, stored it in a dry place and cleaned it carefully once a month. I don't know if the product just gives out after a short period, if I got a lemon or if there was some user-error on my part, but I am displeased with my purchase and I wouldn't buy this model again.Another point of note about the product is that the charger plugs directly into the wall, so keep that in mind.

I have bought the \\"Close Curves rechargeable Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver\\" 3 times in the past (they die about once every 18 months) and thought this would be better and was only a few bucks more. But I was wrong. The trimmer is difficult to push up and down, hair clogs in the trimmer and is impossible to get out. The other blades are pretty useless because the pivoting head makes it difficult to create any pressure for a close shave. It doesn't keep its charge either. This is the first out of hundreds of products I've bought on Amazon that I am unsatisfied with. Unfortunately they won't let me return it either.

Even worse, the trimmers are on both sides, so if you're not careful to keep the shaver totally flat against your skin, it will bite into your skin and draw blood. It doesn't even give a decently close shave without pressing down, and even then, it's inconsistent and stubbly.

This new one is worse! It gives a much worse shave. I have had it for a few months now and it just gives a horrible shave. I have to go over and over and over the same area and it doesn't look much better in the end. I think the issue is that there is no cord. So after a charge, it works well for about 2 minutes, but then as it looses power it stops shaving closely. I'm not sure what is so bad about a cord that manufacturers no longer include the option? Corded items like this always work better than cordless, but I couldn't even find a corded razor so had to go with this one. I am sure this item will not last 20 years like my old one, as it already doesn't hold a charge well enough to shave very close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close-less","review":"If you have course hair, this shaver will probably not benefit you.

However, I can compare this to the traditional razors. Although it is more convenient to have an electric razor, it seems like I need to shave more often than with a regular razor. This razor is easy to use and is easy to clean. It does not take long to charge and it holds its charge for a VERY LONG TIME. I do not have to keep going over the same area to get the job done. I have not used the attachment, so I cannot comment on that.

If you have wall plugs with horizontal blade holes on the top and bottom, the charger will need an extension of some sort, or one will end up charging razor on it's side (which I imagine is extremely hard to do).The Amazon price was excellent and I appreciated the super saver shipping.Panasonic ES2216PC Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver with Bikini Attachment, Mauve"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last long.","review":"I was new to electric women's razors, and chose this one because it was relatively inexpensive.

Sometimes, I had just had to give up and go back to my disposable razor/shaving cream. I'd only had it a few months when it started to give out. The \\"push out\\" feature, allowing a closer shave for certain spots gave out first.

I finally decided on this one because it's got the added bonus of the bikini trimmer. I had always had a separate trimmer for that but it was less than ideal (pulled the hair, wasn't very precise). I tried this one last night on my legs, with shaving lotion, too. It works pretty darn well on all counts - not as close as a regular razor but that's to be expected. It's a little less gentle than my old electric on the underarms so I'll have to tread carefully in that ares. It was great for trimming the bikini region pretty evenly and quickly.

I have sensitive skin so decided on the electric razor as opposed to an epilator as I understand they can be rough on your skin. At this point I think I'll put this shaver in the next garage sale and go back to my throw-away razor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Service sucks!","review":"This shaver broke after less than one year's use. I called the \\"service\\" department, and they expect me to pay for shipping to repair/replace. If it breaks one year into a two-year warranty, already not a good sign. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Any company that will not pay for shipping when their product breaks within warranty period is NOT a company you should do business with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmare!","review":"My fiance keeps his head shaved and thus, he has several electronic razors. He likes all that he has and his shopping process has been pretty straight forward. Trying to find a decent razor designed for a woman is time consuming and tedious at best. After much looking and review reading I settled on this Panasonic. Oh my god. What a P.O.S. - I think if my goal had been to find the worst razor out there that I would have chosen this monstrosity of torture. It pulls hair, skips right over massive patches of hair and in general is a pain in the ass. It performs no where remotely like it claims to. The best thing about this razor is that it's a pretty pink color. I ended up ordering a Philips Norelco Qt4070 Turbo Vacuum Beard, Stubble and Moustach Trimmer Pro, Black/silvermade for men. It works like a dream. I would absolutely never recommend the Panasonic to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"No use after 2 months. The blade is spining and not cutting. Also the blades cannot go back in when you take it out to clean"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good product!","review":"I have never been a big fan of electric shavers for women, but the Panasonic ES2216PC is probably one of the best I have ever owned! It actually gives you a nice, smooth shave.

You would assume that the pivoting head on this razor would be a GOOD thing. But it isn't. It does \\"okay\\", but just isn't what I was looking for.I do want to say that the Panasonic ES2207P razor, which seems to be this exact same razor WITHOUT the pivoting head, gives a shave that feels exactly like I have used a manual razor.Ladies, if you are looking for a good, close shave out of an electric razor, don't buy this one...get the cheaper one without the pivoting head. You won't regret it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible- cuts me","review":"This is the second Panasonic shaver (2 different models) that not only pulls hair, but has cut me and drawn blood while using.

The materials used in the razor itself unfortunately matched that lack of quality. Cutting heads were rudimentary and did not provide a close or even shave. My wife is going back to a blade not because she loves it, but at least it works as an effective tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"shaver","review":"Does not shave closely.

I was hoping for something that I could use quickly in the morning, but it takes more time then they regular razor. It also doesn't shave very well. I find all kinds of spots that get missed.

I've had this one for 6 months, but not to long ago, I bought another one, the \\"Cleancut PS335 T-Shape Personal shaver\\" and I think that is more effective than the panasonic. Oh.. another thing that I didn't like about the panasonic is that while I was shaving, I could feel how is pulling the hair out, so that's not fun when you have sensitive skin and after that some irritation follows."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellant","review":"best i have used. glad i read all the good reviews. i agree with all. great product. highly recommend. try it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"This did not work so I had to return it.

These things should give you more than a year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheaply made product","review":"It didn't cost a lot, that's true. But the plastic slider pieces are so poorly made that I can't get them to move half of the time. One of them is the on/off switch, and the other releases blades.

I recieved this on Wed, charged it and began use on Thursday. I have used it once wet and one dry and loved the results of both! It is quiet, provides a close shave already (claims to improve over three weeks!), and gives me NO razor burn. The whole reason I bought this razor was to try to find something that would eliminate razor burn for me and I had yet to succeed after trying all kinds of epilators, razors, depilatory creams, and other electric razors. This finally has me happy! It may not give the perfect smooth shave that my sister always seems to get right out of the box but I'm very satsified! I was never able to shave more than twice a week before so this will give me a closer shave with a better experience hands down! Can't wait to see what happens after the 3 week point!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for a while, then yucko.","review":"I bought this razor a few months ago. For the first few times, it was great. I recharged once, cleaned it faithfully, and it worked very well. However, even though I had fully discharged the battery before the second recharge, it didn't fully (and still will not fully) recharge, so the razor doesn't have enough oomph to cut the hair - it just pulls it out very painfully. Ouch!!! I do not recommend this item if you plan on using it past a few months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving it.","review":"Let me state this up front -- I bought this for my wife for Mother's Day. The remainder of it is HER review and I disavow ALL knowledge of any of it:It's a little strange to get used to the proper angle to use it if you're used to a manual razor, but I like it a lot. It works REALLY well. My daughter and I have used it for pits and legs and couldn't be happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought a shaver was suppose to shave off the hair?","review":"I was really disappointed with the Panasonic ES2216PC. I've been a long time user of straight razors and I thought I would save money from buying expensive replacement cartridges and save the earth from tossing out blades by buying an electric razor. So I choose this razor hoping to get the same close smooth shave that I got from the straight razor and boy, was I wrong. This razor did not get as close to the skin, even after pushing really hard with the spring loaded head, it still left hair stubble! The head of th razor also pulled on my skin which hurt! The button to turn the razor on and off, seemed flimsy like it would break at any moment. If you accidently pushed the wrong button, the button on the head of the razor, then the cap on the head and the razors inside would go flying across the shower. What a mess! So I returned the razor, and I am back to using my straight razor for a smoother shave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"This product does not shave well and it scratches the skin should you use it dry.

I have own Panasonic shavers before and it is great to have as a backup or when you just need a quick shave. This is a very nice razor and I love that it is flexible. It shaves as close as any other electric razor I have seen but don't expect it to be the same as a blade. I don't usually use it in the shower and think it just great dry. The great thing is that the charge holds for a long time and it never cuts skin. My teenage daughter borrowed it as well and we both thought it was good. I would definitely recommend this shaver and for the price, it is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaver works very well","review":"I've been using this shaver for a few months now.

Results improved with wet shave and shampoo. Haven't tried with cream. Still, very convenient for when I just don't feel like showering to shave. Comb attachment does its job, too, though I noticed the pop-up blade sticks a little after a few uses. Hard to work that with slippery hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality, Good Price","review":"This product cannot be rated properly by someone who expects the same kind of close shave that a razor would provide. Electric shavers simply don't do that, and cannot be expected to. Then again, they don't slice through the skin..This electric shaver has been worth every penny. I am one of those lazy women who forget about an important meeting at work until I'm in the shower and running late. I'm not going to wear a skirt unless I HAVE to, and I'm certainly not going to shave unless I HAVE to.So this shaver has saved the day several times over the past couple months. I really like the fact that I can use it in the shower and it does a better job than any other electric shaver I've used. It seems to charge quickly and holds a charge for what seems like several shaving incidents.I hope it lasts for several years, like my little Panasonic hair trimmer that is still going strong after at least ten years, but sadly only takes batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful product","review":"This barely even removes hair and pulls and snags on any you have.

Turns out that my assumption was totally wrong. This one was so lame that it was worse than a mechanical razor. If you had a Venus or Gillette in your hand, you atleast had better control. This one was the same physical effort but without the clean shaving blades to it. All it has is a fancy head and batteries. Both the dry & wet-mode were equally disappointing.

I spend MORE TIME going over one spot then I would doing my whole bottom half of one leg with the razor. Of course a razor has better results that last longer too. Don't even get me started on the bikini trimmer. First you think it might just need adjust since it has 3 levels of height. Nope!! Forget it. Wasting more time. Just get the darn trimmers out and razor and be done with it. This thing stinks! What a waste of money.

I've ordered a new Replacement Shaver Foil and Blade Set, so we'll see if that solves the problem. If it does and I have to replace it every 4 months, I'm going to be upset. Also, I found the set cheaper on 1800 parts dot com with free shipping.ETA: I've replaced the foils, which doesn't seem to have fixed the problem. There are also no instructions on the web that I can find on how to replace them - we had to take a tiny screw driver and pry out the old ones. The new ones seem to pull on my skin/hair.

It worked great, except for the battery charge (instead of 12 hours, it lasted on average 45 minutes per charge). After five months, however, when shaving my arm-pit, I felt a sharp pain. It turned out that the blade closest to the bikini pop-out trimmer had partially popped out and had given me a pretty big cut. I am not sure whether this malfunction was a very rare exception or not (judging by other reviews, it seems like it may be),but it shook me up (I'd hate to think what may have happened if I were using it on a more sensitive area, which it is advertised for).

I've used electric razors long enough to know that they will never shave as close as a conventional razor but I have always had nice smooth skin after an electric shave. Not with this razor.

It is completely useless for the \\"bikini\\" area, whether using the attachment or not. With the attachment, it did not get rid of any hair AT ALL. It's like just running a comb through your hair. For legs and underarms, it would randomly skip patches of hair. And like another reviewer said, whatever hair it does get, it then spits out back onto your skin. (This happened the very first time I used it, so it wasn't because it hadn't been cleaned). Even when pressing it down hard onto my skin, it still didn't get the hair. I tried wet, dry, with shaving cream, without. Nothing worked. You should also know that the manual claims the battery will last for \\"7 shaves, 3 minutes per shave\\" so that's 21 minutes.

I have always used an electric shaver and loved them. She is part Italian and has dark hair on her legs and under her arms,lots of it! She tried the razor and was quite amazed at how close it shaved and how the razor felt like it just kind of glided over her skin. She was very happy with her gift and I was very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Design","review":"I purchased an almost identical model (Panasonic ES2218VC) in March 2009. I was happy with it until the battery weakened. After a little over a year it would no longer hold a charge (which seemed like a very short battery life to me) and unfortunately battery replacement was not an option with that shaver. I did, however, like the shaver, so I decided to give this model one more chance. Also I had an unopened package of replacement blades that fit the same shaver, (and they are no small expense), so that was a big factor in my decision to purchase this replacement. So far I'm very happy with the replacement as there is no doubt that it delivers a closer shave than its predecessor did. The wet/dry feature is nice, and the swivel top is really the big selling point of this shaver. I'm giving 4 stars in this case because of my bad experience with the battery of the previous shaver; hopefully that was a fluke but only time will tell. I do recommend this shaver for the design and performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Shaver Ever!!!","review":"I have used electric shavers for years now.

It does not shave as close as a regular razor, but shaves about as close as my legs feel at the end of the day. I have not tried the shaver wet yet nor utilized its other sensitive features. If you are tired of shaving in the shower then I'd recommend this shaver for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chintsy","review":"I bought this in May 2011 on sale for $15 and just recently threw it in the trash. I used it about a dozen times.My original intention was to have something handy for a quick decent-ish dry shave. I know electric razors don't get as close as the real thing, but this Panasonic left me feeling like a wildebeest.Maybe I am a wildebeest. Hard to tell these days.First few times I used it, it worked o.k. Maybe a 3 star product. Definitely lacking in the longevity department. Made of cheapie plasticky pieces.Battery life seemed decent.I would definitely not use the bikini attachment or get this thing anywhere near my crotch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying!!!!

The reviews I read online of this Panasonic model were mostly favorable, so I figured I'd give it a try. BAD IDEA!This razor gave me a horrible shave (wet using a soothing lather). I had to keep going over & over the same spot repeatedly, it irritated my skin almost immediately, and it was very loud. I never got a close shave, no matter how many times I went over the same area & so I gave up after about half an hour of trying. My 5-year-old Remington shaver with a used blade gave me a smoother shave than this brand new, never-been-used shaver!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Charger Design","review":"Bought this for my wife. The charger is a small block designed so that the razor balances on top while plugged into a VERTICALLY ORIENTED outlet. If, like our house, your outlets are oriented horizontally, the razor sticks out sideways and will not remain on the charger. I called Panasonic's support line hoping that they would have an alternate charger available. Their only suggestion was to visit a hardware store to find an adapter to turn the outlet. Unacceptable, horrible, short sighted product design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I have a skin condition that makes razor shaving difficult. I have used several electric razors over the years and this one is excellent. Shave is smooth, fast, recharge lasts a long time, doesn't nick skin. For an electric razor, I would highly recommend.

She really likes the trimmer attachment.And, it shaves close with comfort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had a Remington wet/dry trimmer that I loved, until it stopped working out of nowhere. I decided to try to upgrade to something a little larger, that wouldn't crap out on me after a few months, and eventually decided on this one after researching and reading reviews. Unfortunately, I can't say anything good about it. If I use it to try to trim longer hair, it pulls and pinches but doesn't actually cut the hair (whether I use the shaving head or the pop-up trimmer head). On shorter hair, I still don't feel as if it actually shaves, and it scratches uncomfortably against my skin. I don't think I've gotten one good shave out of this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment","review":"I've had this shaver for just 5 months and already it fails to closely shave. The battery surges and the outer frame won't stay on the shaver unless it's taped on. It worked very nicely when it arrived, but I have to wonder if the unit I received was refurbished rather than brand new. I contacted customer service with a specific question and they responded with a \\"form letter\\" that didn't address my question and that states I have a one-year warranty (my paperwork indicates two years). I am unable to use a regular razor so waiting for this unit to be repaired and returned to me is not an option. I bought the unit at the original $39.99, but cannot recommend its purchase at any price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shaver!","review":"Best, closest shave I have ever had with an electric shaver.

That shaver gave me razor burns. This shaver is excellent, no pinching, pulling, redness. Good for both underarms and legs.

Works well dry and wet for my sensitive skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Women's electric shaver yet","review":"I get razor burn/bumps so have to use an elect. shaver most of the time for my legs. I've also owned the Panasonic Close Curves w/out the pivot action. It is OK but this new one is much better. It isn't as close as a wet shave but the closest that I've had so far. The battery life is good. (I'm 5'10\\" and have long legs. It takes me longer than 5-7 min/shave (their suggestion) and the shaver keeps its charge for at least 3 shaves. This is great!

Now I have put it in a drawer and will most likely throw it in trash in a couple years. What a waste of money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Agrrrr.......","review":"This product came as a faulty one. I can't charge it with the charger that came with. Actually I can get it to charge if I hold and tilt the shaver to one side but as soon as I let go, it stops charging.

I ended up going to our local baby store and get another Mud Pie Geramic Piggy Bank. The store only has the other pricess design with the crown on the head, but it is okay, just as cute.

I do have to add that I did not like the short dance intervals in the middle of the workout, but I think he put those in there to lighten the mood.

I sometimes do the entire 90 minute but sometimes I break them up. The 30 minute fat burning workout is good too. They must have the workout rooms temperature turned way up because I barely break out in a sweat with the 30 minute workouts on Taebo and everyone on the video is soaking wet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 90 minute workout!","review":"This is a great addition to my current Billy Blanks library. I use it when I feel like I need to do some extra calorie burning. It is not a workout that incorporates any of the bands/amplifier/weights. This one is mostly cardio. It is not nearly as hard as it says it is. There are lots of \\"resting\\" periods - what you get with this one is just a longer video (1 hour and 33 min). It has a ton of the original Taebo moves and less of the moves done in the bootcamp series, bootcamp elite or the amped series. If you can do the \\"Ultimate BootCamp\\" video then this one will be a piece of cake regardless of the time difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutley The Best!","review":"This Taebo DVD actually goes neck and neck with \\"Get Ripped Advanced\\" as far as intensity. It was non-stop moves. My heart was pumping so hard I could feel the rush of calories melting off. I did it for the first time last night and I did it again this morning! Wow! What a rush. I made it through the entire 90min. Even though he says you don't have to do this every day because it is very intense, i am going to do this first thing every morning. It's so much fun and you don't want to stop eventhough you feel your about to pass out - Billy gives you the motivation to keep going.This was just the jolt I needed to get back into an intense cardio regime.Billy just gets better and better."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what they promised","review":"I really do not understand everything that is written on this site about this DVD. I kept reading how intense this workout is and I must disagree strongly. I have been using the TaeBo II Get Ripped DVD for almost 2 years now and I have grown tired of it. So I went looking for something new from the Billy Blanks series. I wanted to be sure it was going to be a nonstop intense workout, which is what the Get Ripped workout is. NO GO! This Ultimate DVD does not live up to its name. The biggest problem is that there are too many slow periods. With each new move, Billy does at least three slow sets before moving to the double time. Then he only does two maybe three double time sets. That is not what I call intense. If you want intense, get Get Ripped. I guess I am back to my same old workout until I can find something that lives up to its advertisement."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!! THATS A TOUGH ONE!","review":"All I can say is that this is the toughest one I have done yet. I purchased it quite awhile ago along with my amped series but never did it because of the length. Who has 89 minutes to work out? Anyway, I read reviews on it this morning and decided to try it out for myself and add some variety to my workout this week. I did not know that you had an option of stopping after 55 minutes. Well although I was pretty worn out after the 55 minutes, I challenged myself to the additional 30 minutes. I was able to finish but I am very tired and my body feels a bit like jello. Billy lets you know in the workout that you should only do this one once a week and I see why. Overall, this is a great workout if you are a tae bo lover. I am shocked at one of the reviews I read that said this one did not even make them sweat. Very unbelieveable! Fun but hard workout. I cant wait to do it again (next week)."},{"rating":"2","title":"BILLY HAS DONE IT AGAIN!!!","review":"This workout was fantastic! I completed the 90 minutes and sweated so much. This workout is for alternating with the Get Ripped Series if you are advanced in Taebo. There was no fuss, no Billy bands, Amplifier bar or resistance balls - just good old fashioned taebo. My body felt more energised I have been drinking more water through out the day and I feel great. I recommend that you only do this taebo dvd once a week and Billy recommends it as well because it is very high cardio. Definitely not for the weak hearted or beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks Intensity","review":"I've been doing Tae Bo for several years and love the Tae Bo Advance workouts.

It works you all over and it is at a steady pace. You get a great workout. You can work out for 90 minutes and burn over 900 calories. If you haven't got time for the full 90 minutes you can do 60 minutes. If you haven't time for that you can do the turbo charged fat burner workout. It takes about 23 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The original Tae Bo was way better","review":"...My title above says it all. I didn't feel the burn or work up a sweat nearly as much as I did with the original Tae Bo series. There are 2 workouts on this DVD. One's about 89 minutes and the other is 23 minutes. So you're either stuck with an hour and a half cardio session or one so short you don't even work up a sweat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick a different one if you want an intense workout","review":"I would say I am in fairly average or slightly above average shape and this workout was not challenging in the least. The back of the package promises a \\"super intense workout\\" but does not deliver. Do not let the word \\"ultimate\\" scare you away from chosing this DVD for a regular workout--it is fairly entertaining. Just choose another DVD if you want a high-energy workout. Sorry I can't recommend another Tae Bo...although I am not new to kickboxing, I am new to Tae Bo, so you'll need to refer to other reviews for a better choice of DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The old versions (VHS) of beginning and advanced taibo were useful andactually fun.

If you like frenetic air-punching you will like this--he does that every few minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I am a semi-athletic 28 year old female. Taebo has been around a long time and I thought I would give it a try. I am very disappointed. Billy may have good technique but this workout is really long and poorly filmed. Billy talks at the same time as another girl repeatedly counts down 1.2.3.4... for every movement--very distracting not to mention annoying. Everything seems so disorganized and tacky. The room looks like an old cigar lounge. I have no desire to work out with it. Maybe there are other Taebo videos that are filmed better but I don't want to waste any more money to find out. Another option would be Turbo jam (I got mine for $12 by a seller here on amazon)which is similar technique but filmed much better,not annoying, and better atmosphere. Also, 30 day shred by Jillian Michaels is professional, pleasing to the eyes and ears, and is just 3 different 20 minute workouts you choose by difficulty level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money!","review":"This is a typical drug store mystery set in the mountains of North Carolina with an improbable plot, almost no character development, sophomoric writing, and an Indian tribe who turn out to be descendants of slaves owned by an Indian tribe. The only redeeming virtue of the book is a use of herbal medicine within the plot. It contains its own bromide, so to speak. Don't waste your time and money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish","review":"I have read and enjoyed several other Sharyn McCrumb mysteries--She Walks These Hills, for instance. However, this book disappoints. The characters are not believable, the dialogue is stilted, and you arrive at the end of the book not much caring how it resolves itself. My error, friends, for not checking the Amazon customer reviews before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elizabeth MacPhearson","review":"This is the weakest book of the series. I have now read them all, through PMS Outlaws. The book has the witty style of the other Elizabeth MacPhearson mysteries, but didn't hold my interest very well. It is important to the series, though, because it tells us a lot about Milo, who is featured in two subsequent books, and it introduces Elizabeth to forensic anthropology. The ending is a bit of a surprise, so I guess that's in the story's favor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too witty","review":"I've read two of McCrumb's mystery novels now and had the same reaction: witty murder is hard to take. I won't be reading more because I seem to take murder a bit too seriously for this light, fluffy sort of treatment, where the author's emphasis is often on cute dialogue and witty repartee.That said, the story here has three young people dabble in murder detection and forensic science because-naturally-grownups don't care. Several passages are very well written and McCrumb maintains a tongue-in-cheek touch elsewhere. Don't rely on either the science terminology and interpretations to be accurate even for the 1985 paleo-computer age. Other than the pedagogy, this story will entertain young readers and introduce them to an unusual Appalachian setting and the issue of proving Indian land claims."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the weakest Conan books","review":"What first catches your attention is the terrible, stilted style of writing. Very flat with corny dialogue. Not enjoyable to read, more of a chore. Perhaps a younger reader may enjoy it for the simplified language, although there are some adult themes in the books. A real dud. Avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Conan novel ever! Seriously.","review":"I had high hopes for this book, the cover was cool and the idea of Conan competing as a gladiator ala the movie, seemed sound. However I can honestly say this is the absolute worst Conan I have ever read in twenty plus years. The biggest problem seems to be that Conan's brain has been replaced by that of a 19th century English gentleman. After he is slapped on the had by a circus dwarf, Conan exclaims \\"Wait, fellow, that was most ill-mannered...I only meant to invite the lass to stop awile and talk, or mayhap share a puncheon of ripe cider. I would compliment you all on your fair costumes and fine talents.\\" Seriously he says that. It is as though Leonard Carpenter had never read an actual Conan book before pulling this out of his behind. That type of dialogue belongs in Regency Romances and Merchant Ivory films, not Conan. If you are a fan at all of Robert E. Howard I would strongly caution you against buying or reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Conan book I've ever read","review":"I'll try to be brief here, as you can read the other, better written reviews for more details and things from a more literary slant. For me, hands down, worst Conan book I've ever read, and besides all the Howard stories, I've read probably 25-30 books (John Maddox Roberts being my favorite so far). Basically, this book has a character \\"named\\" Conan in it, but doesn't act like the Conan we all know who's from Cimmeria. No revenge for repeated and severe wrong-doings done against him, just let's everything roll off his back. Yes, he's strong, and fairly smart when it comes to battle, but that's any number of heroes in fiction. All the things that make Conan \\"Conan\\" are missing from this story. It feels like Carpenter took an existing story he had and just changed the protagonist's name to \\"Conan\\" without bothering to update the character. Very disappointing, a total waste of money, and a stain on all the books that carry on Robert E. Howard's vision. Crom is not happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Book To Finish","review":"What good things can you say about this book? Nothing. Carpenter is not the best writer of conan. Some where in the middle of the pack or below. He's had some that were ok and some not very good. This one, sinks to an all time low. The main character's name is conan, but that is the only thing this character and the one we all know of as Conan have in common. This book should be hidden away from the public and forgotten. See all other reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Russell Crowe...the Barbarian!","review":"Well,....what can I say. The book is pretty weak. The plot would've been better suited to the Conan cartoon series (remember it?),seriously folks. I honestly can't see Conan staying that long in a city being a gladiator, no less. Also, he strikes me as too intelligent throughout the book. For example, in the arena, he orders them to form a phalanx! He's a barbarian from Cimmeria! How's he gonna know what a phalanx is? I thought the priests of Set might be cool,too, but they were more like Renaissance scientists or something. I only read this book because I want to read all of the Conan books. The end battle was cool, but that's about it. This wasn't one of the better books."},{"rating":"2","title":"An introduction to Shaolin stretching exercises and philosophy","review":"The book is beautifully produced and is an excellent book of the coffee table variety. I was hoping that it had more of the tensing and strength building exercises of the [DVR]Dynamic Visualized Resistance and [VRT]Visualized Resistance Trainng variety. Never the less I think the book will answer many people's exercise needs without the injury potential of lifting weights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaolin Work Out !","review":"I would recommend this book to all my friends as well as to all those reading my review;who are seriously thinking of trying out a work out that really work. I personally feel the effects of following Sifu Shi Yan Ming shaolin Work. My only regret is that this book should have been publish a lot sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, well written","review":"Buy this book if you wish to be a practitioner of martial arts. No matter what system you are in, you must stretch and breathe, this book walks you through, while explaining philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting!","review":"I am several pages in the book and I cannot put it down! I enjoy his wisdom and beautifully step by step pictures. I did recieve the book before the final due date and in GREAT condition!!! I am very pleased with the product. I am very happy with having it in my collection. Thank you for taking the time to wrap and send it to me promptly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Book","review":"The book gives the feeling of as if you were in temple with Sifu.Also the written style laced with soothing words very appealing.Wish I have had chance to live in New York and attend Sifu\`s classes.Illuminates my path. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A most worthwhile purchase!","review":"Of course it cannot serve as a total substitute for experiencing the real thing, but this book still manages to share a tremendous amount of knowledge in a very accessible format. It contains gorgeous, often stunning, photography as well as helpful and concise instructions. I particularly like the conclusion of each section with a passage of philosophical thoughts. The book does a great job with balancing the presentation of techniques for improving oneself both physically and mentally.Even if you ultimately do not adhere to the exact 28 day regimen as suggested by the subtitle of this book, you will most certainly find many valuable lessons to incorporate into your daily life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Workout","review":"I have been working through the Shaolin Workout after receiving it as a Christmas gift. It is a well paced workout, thoughtful and excellent for increasing or regaining flexibility. I find it to be uplifting physically and emotionally with focused meditations after each day's workout. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!!","review":"I've studied shaolin style for 2 years and like another review said, what he teaches you will learn the first day in class. I was really excited when i found out about the book but I expected way more from a shaolin monk. If you want to loose weight then sure, do some of his exercises over and over again for an hour and I guarentee you'll do so. But if your hoping to learn martial arts or \\"kung fu\\", don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cultivate New Habits","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I just completed the 28 day workout. If you have been living a completely sedentary lifestyle, you owe it to yourself to get this book - and do what it says. The photography is excellent and if you just follow along, you will be surprised at the changes you can make in just 28 days. I am not saying that you will be a black belt or anything close to it, but you will be on your way to a new lifestyle. This book SLOWLY lifts you up from the couch and enables you to create new habits for yourself in just 28 days. The initial \\"workouts\\" take just a couple of minutes and they build every day by adding a new exercise or stretch. Every seven days is a review of everything you have learned to date. By the end of the month (28 days) you are feeling better about yourself and just feeling better in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaolin? Sure. Workout? No way!","review":"The exercises in this \\"workout\\" are far from challenging. You could learn any (or all) of these techniques in your first week at any martial arts school. There is a certain inspirational spirit that the book does well with, and that's the only thing that saved this book from being a 1 star book.Check out the used book section. How many are being sold (52 copies right now)? Why are so many trying to sell it? How is the price in comparison to the new price (starting at 9 dollars)? Why are people selling it for so little? It isn't just coincidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more....","review":"The book is very small in size and scope. I expected more from a shaolin monk. It has several short anecdotes about how he tries to talk hip <rolls eyes>. If you want a book about simple stretches that any martial artist that has spent anyone time in a Dojo or in Kwoon, then get the book.If however, you happen to be a little more educated than a white belt when it comes to martial arts, then get something by Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming, he can be found at YMAA.COM"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific workout for beginners or masters","review":"This is a great workout for getting into shape or staying in shape. These exercises help build flexibility and strength. The exercises start out simple and slowly build in complexity. If you get to a point where you don't feel quite up to moving on just keep doing the exercises you are comfortable with until you feel ready for more. Most of the exercises are simple enough that you can do them anywhere. You might get strange looks from people, but don't let that stop you.Amituofo! Train harder!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for his disciples","review":"This book is one part basic wushu manual, and one part self help book, never really succeeding at either.If you love Yan Ming, ofcourse you'll love this book. It features great pictures and all of his buzz words and daily exclaimations (i.e. \\"train harder!\\" and \\"more chi\\").To perform the techniques as he does takes relentless hours of practice, so the 28 days mantra is deceptive at best.The history of the shaolin temple is standard fair and falls behind the current wave of scholarship on the subject.A book best considered entertainment rather than an actual text book on the martial arts.Two stars because the photography is so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use Caution","review":"This is a very glossy, slick book, as is typical of Rodale publications. As such, it is a pleasant -- if over-priced -- overview for the casual reader of basic Shaolin exercise routines. However, as a martial arts practioner for several decades and an instructor with years of experience, I have a serious concern. Some of the stretching exercises in this book are potentially dangerous for the uninitiated, especially older readers who may lack the flexibility to do them safely. If taken seriously as a training manual, this book should almost come with a warning label."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Beginners","review":"This book is a glossy, full color collection of philosophy and exercises that (apparently) Shaolin Monks do. It will not teach you self-defense and only focuses on calisthenics. That would be fine in most cases; however, this book is big, sprawling, and confusing. It is not for beginners. Many of these are exercises are difficult and unorganized. You don't know which to do, and how much, and which would be suitable for your body type. This book is more to satisfy your curiosity about ancient kung-fu than something of a sensible guide to exercise(s). 28 days to transforming your body, it says... Yeah, but how?"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLO. Very very poor. Actually useless","review":"Useless. Very very poor. A waste of money.

Literally stuck on an island will little choice in reading material, I'll admit to reading two in the series...the second (A King's Commander) in the hopes that something would rattle the prick's marbles sufficiently to make him semi-interesting. Don't bother with this garbage; get the master in historical naval fiction, Mr. O'Brian."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Quicky Sequel","review":"It is disappointing to start a series that had such promise only to have to toil through this poor effort obviously rushed to press. While it is surprising that Lambdin apparently never learned to punctuate properly, it is even more surprising that the publisher did not have an editor on hand to correct this very rough draft.

As I folded over my \\"practice shirt\\" to simulate sewing 2 ends shut; it never once pulled the bobbin thread thru and I ended up frustrated and without a sewing machine, because I am sending it back for something better.

The author is candid and unpretentious, speaking clearly about the ups and downs of applying some ancient wisdom to his work, ideas that have come from a genuine buddhist master, but still had to be applied by someone who, despite considerable experience in business, was still a student of applied Buddhism.

It sits about 4 inches above my gravel in the 10gallon."},{"rating":"2","title":"good filter","review":"I've used whisper filters on all my aquariums, the cartridges are easiest to find especially in bulk, downfall in my experience is they do get noisy after awhile, but keep the tank really clean"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks","review":"Not sure why the maker of this product puts a valve in the bottom of filter, more chances of leaking and I just received the filter that leaks, always fill the filter with water before you put it on the tank to check for leaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to Die!!!","review":"This filter worked well for almost exactly 90 days and then it died. The pump stopped pumping like an octogenarian's heart. It reminds me of \\"Bladerunner\\" when the replicants just die after a time. The same with this. Good thing filters for 10 gallon tanks are cheap. My tank is on it's 3rd in 6 months. First was a Top Fin. Crap! Second was this tetra whisper. Crap! Now I have an Aqueon 10 gallon.

Haven't used them so I have no idea if they are any good but I assume they are terrific. But can't somebody at Amazon sort all this out so that we can get what we order? And spell Galvanized correctly at the same time? Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Only I'd Known This Earlier!","review":"I was very impressed with the book, \\"Should We Stay Together\\" by Mr. Larson which is bascially a summary of all his research gained from testing of his RELATE Premarital Questionnaire. As a result sometimes the read can get bogged down in how this is just that, and lead you to say can you just get to the point. Overall it was a great source of informaiton, especially the questions that you should answer yourself and with your partner. I know it made me realize a few things about my partner I didn't know before. It uses a triangular method that seems straight forward enough, but there's more to it than you'd think! It leaves nothing to chance, and makes you question those things hidden in your closet and your partners'to give you a real picture of whether or not your relationship should go on, is worth saving, or should be dissolved ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"I bought this book used and was disappointed by the amount of underlining I found in the book. The comments about the book that the provider gave did not specify this. Also, I found the overall content of the book disappointing. The author, I felt, spent most of the time telling about his success during his dating years avoiding bad relationships and his success in confronting dating people with his counseling. I felt he was more or less bragging on himself then actually giving practical help and advice. Some of the tests were good, but some of the information/questions were repetitive throughout the book. Definitely glad I didn't spend much money on this - I would not recommend the book, or consider rereading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pre-Marriage Must Read","review":"Anyone in a relationship serious enough to be discussing marriage will find their decision-making clarified and relationship strengthened by reading this and completing the exercises together. There's no attempt here to promote or discourage any couple from getting married, only to put all the cards on the table face-up so there are no delusions of what a companion believes, feels, thinks about a full range of values and significant life choices. People don't change much - certainly not in marriage - and this is so valuable in having one's eyes open headed down the aisle. Serves as a convenient and thorough method of covering all the bases before making that final decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial","review":"This book is imho quite superficial. To my regret, it doesn't really cover the order of Odin (because, as the book says, the Order of Oding is only rumors). Another thing I really hate about the book is the front cover. It shows a man with a hornet helmet - no viking helmet with horns has ever been found... A bit too 'mythical' for me! Apart from that the book is quite boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as it should; for the person on a budget","review":"I use this cable for small home recording projects.

It simply doesn't work. The result is a loose mechanical fit which will certainly introduce noise into your system as the contact pins move relative to one another.After years and hundreds of Amazon purchases I am amazed that Amazon would sell this item. It is simply unfit for its intended purpose.Thanks to Amazon Prime's return policy I don't expect any problem returning this. In the final analysis it is Amazon which will sustain the loss, but don't waste your time with this cable. Amazon offers superior cables for a few bucks more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid cable.","review":"No problems w/ this cable.

Since I won't be using the engine, gearbox and other components, I could have saved money with a track-only kit.This kit comes with adequate instructions in both English and Japanese. There is a small wooden platform that serves as the base of the treads, assorted wheels and tracks, and a single engine and gearbox. There is also a battery holder for 2 AA batteries and an on/off switch. This kit was intended to be part of a tracked vehicle (like the name implies) like a truck with rear tracks or a snowmobile.

And that DVD sounded great.Jimmi Destri the keyboardist is missing, which is a bit disappointing but his replacement is fine.

She looks great in any case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music is great but keep the remote control in hand","review":"DVD rocks out of the starting blocks with two songs, then bogs down with call-in requests from gushing fans, interspersed with dialogue from the self-important and lame MC. Debbie and others gracious throughout the dopey interludes but pretty obvious by the end they were thinking, \\"why did we agree to do this?\\". Check out the look on the drummer's face as he takes a call, then throws the mike out of the picture! The good news is whoever set up the DVD must have realized also, so that when you hit the fast forward button, it skips almost to the next song.

I was also disappointed with the right hand side of this same part. Although the width was ok, the alignment of the two bushings which bolt to the frame was not correct.

I was somewhat apprehensive on buying these and other Hoppy box sets by Platinum, because of the rather modest price, but after watching quite a number, I am pleased to say that the quality is quite good. If you are a western fan, and have never enjoyed these Hopalong Cassidy films, you are in for a real treat. I was most impressed by the location filming, some of which included scenes in which the Carson and Colorado railroad was featured.

I like the general build of this backpack, but the straps are a little uncomfortable just at that adjustment area - it bit into my arm. Other than that, this backpack is pretty darn good. You can even use it for school when you aren't carrying too many books.The four star is for the straps. It's definitely worth it for the price though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied, but...","review":"I was looking for a backpack with a yoke shaped harness, and it didn't have it which is why I took off a star.

At the time, I didn't have any idea what that was, so I will take the liberty of describing it. The Suspension Strap System is about a 1\\" section of stretchy material on both straps that sits on the collar/shoulders. As you add weight to your bag, the suspension straps work by alleviating some of that weight. It really works! I have five classes, and I can definitely say my back and shoulders hurt less by using this bag.All-in-all, great product and a GREAT price.

The seams of the backpack are also coming unraveled such that 2-inch-long threads are hanging loose at seams all over the bag.

I already had the 5th edition and this was a nominal improvement at best"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite","review":"This volume was a bit of a step down from the previous two. Of course, it is still pretty good in any case. There are three episodes, Land of Wizards, Land of Books, and A Tale of Mechanical Dolls. The first focused more on someone other than Kino, but was more interesting for what it reveals about Kino's character than the 'triumph over adversity' story. The second was kind of incoherent, but pleasant. It seems they tried to cram a few too many concepts into one episode, so that the entire thing seems somewhat less than real. Definitely deserving of multiple viewings, though. The third had a really predictable ending, but I thought the happy family explaining what they could do for Kino was kind of chilling. Still, this series remains one of the best out there, and the lack of violence provides a nice contrast to the second volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped OFF!","review":"This Cd is a RIP OFF!!!

The translations seem to be very sharp, and the additional material was very helpful.It gives a terrific context for Socrates, both as how Plato presents him and how he was perceived by his contemporaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Translation, Great Dialogues","review":"Having compared this translation with 4 or 5 other translations and with the Greek, I was most pleased with the Plato and less pleased with the Aristophanes.The Plato texts are accurate and readable, and the prose is even and flowing. They portray the final conversations with Socrates before his execution. The texts are rich with topics for conversation and hold many curiosities when compared with the other Socratic dialogues.The Aristophanes was accurate, but at times I felt it was censored compared to several of the other translations; not censored in content, but in word choice. This translation uses the less harsh terms for what some of the other translations use. You may find this to be tasteful or dampening to the humor, its a matter of preference, but it is something to be aware of.In all a great translation of great dialogues and hilarious criticism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first CD!

According to Reba Wooden at customer service at Lodge who says ..... <rwooden@lodgemfg.com> wrote:> Ralph, Amazon sells the same quality as we do on our website.We no longer polish the cookware before it leaves the factory, so all the cookware now has a rough surface. With use and replenishment of the seasoning, the pan will become smoother. Unlike other types of cookware, Lodge Cast Iron only gets better with use. For concerns about roughness, it is OK to use a fine grade of sandpaper to smooth out the rough areas. Make sure to re-season the item before using.So unless you want to spend a few hours with some sand paper making your Lodge cookware usable I would not recommend you purchasing any of their products unless you can find some older used ones.

So, the pot has now dried, we want to put it away and what do we see has happened to the pot, a questionable (maybe rust) brown color has coated the inside of the pot.

If you cook a soup and liquid condenses on the top, you need to make sure it doesn't sit too long or or it will rust. Then when you open the lid all that rust drips into your stock/soup and leaves a bad taste and discoloration. Also without a knob on top of the lid you need two hands to open it up which makes quick stirs annoying as you have to set the lid down somewhere else. After you wash it you need to wipe on some oil to prevent oxidation but that wasn't too bad, just an extra step when cleaning.

Buy it along with the book Tartine Bread and you will never buy commercial bread again! With a simple recipe in this book, which is available from Amazon, you can make the Artesian breads sold in specialty markets. It produces a wonderful crust by cooking the bread in the shallow part and covering it with the deep part for the first 20 minutes, then uncovering it for the remaining 30 minutes. A bread like this retails for anywhere from $5 to $7 but you can make it for a few cents! The ingredients are just flour, water and salt. This pan also doubles as a chili or stew pot and the shallow part can stand alone as a fry pan. It is very versatile. If you need one pot in the kitchen, this is it. A great value and it will outlast a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice little oven","review":"I like this dutch oven! Ours arrived in perfect shape (and with free shipping!).

Jacksons character in this!......why was he hunting the Jumpers? what's his back story? so many annoying unanswered things!The rest of the cast were HUGELY under developed as well, especially Rachel Bilson, who had more to do in the O.C than she did in this. The only real highlight was that guy from Billy Elliott [forgot his name], and Hayden Christianson looked good in it............everything else was a fast paced, empty mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agonizing, if you read the book","review":"Steven Gould's book was a treasure. That made what Hollywood has done to it too painful to watch. I flung the DVD after about 15 minutes. Special effects can be nice, but they cannot compensate for a script written at the 5th grade level, or the stupidity of a plot that has a vast organization with unbelievable special equipment, credentials from every government agency, and which never has any problem with the police, all chasing teenagers who could easily kill its agents. I hope Steven got a lot of money, and I can understand why he does not want his name associated with this offal. The director put his signature on it - kind of like the dog putting his signature on a fireplug."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are the real good guys and bad guys?","review":"I thought this movie was weak because it had no real moral center. It pits jumpers, who are people who can teleport, but never seem to do anything positive for society, against Paladins, who want to wipe out the jumpers. The main jumper character is typical of why I didn't particularly like jumpers. He robs banks, frames a young rival for his own bank robbery, and never, ever tells his girlfriend the truth. Heroic behavior? Hardly. The main Paladin, played by Samuel Jackson, seemed more like a good guy to me, although his methods were of course way too extreme (no trial, death penalty). So for me, there was lots of great action, a little humor, and no good guys. That detracts from the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumper is a definite bummer","review":"I'd give it 1/2 a star if I could. This movie was absolutely atrocious; the dialogue was abysmal and laughable, the 'heroine' stunk, there was absolutely no point in Diane Lane's character, no reason for a lot of it really. An annoying waste of time with no redeeming qualities except for some cool special effects, an idea that has potential but didn't see it realized here and, of course, the good-looking Hayden Christensen. Just stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite nonsense w/ stolen plots and special effects","review":"Its apparent that Jumper has done well in world release, much better than the USA release. This is the type of movie that is shown frequently on airplanes. In fact I've watched this first on a flight without sound, and then later with sound on cable. Quite frankly the movie works exactly the same without sound as the dialogue is basic annoying emo angst nonsense filler.The plot is thin and crafted for ADD teens who really don't care about logic and backstory. It also stars Baby Darth Vader from the horrid Star Wars prequels. His acting is right in line w/ SW Prequels, lots of furrowed brow glances and generic emo angst.In short this is a pseudo sci fi flick not really about anything important with special effects that are Hollow Man + Matrix 2.If you like air headed scripts, pointless chase scenes and banal dialogue, this is the film for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, weak execution","review":"2.5 starsSuch a good idea, such a lame movie.Starts pretty well and just gets weaker by the minute. Christensen is simply boring (here and everywhere else I've seen him). He thinks looking seriously and quietly at someone is acting. I feel nothing when I watch this clown.Jackson is becoming a reliable sign of a cheesy flick.The effects here are good, but the plot and story are lazy and should be so much more ingenious considering the basic premise. So much to work with and so little accomplished.Not really worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was interested in seeing this film after coming across the trailer. Unfortunately the movie is a big disappointment. The story line is not laid out well, and the acting is amateur."},{"rating":"1","title":"PS3 trouble anyone?","review":"I recently rented this movie, its funny however I heard so many people talking badly about this movie I just had to see it for myself. I rented it today and put it in my my PS3 60GB first release and made sure the software is up to date and all but it won't play its seen as a data disc with an unreadable format. was curious to see if anyone has ran into this problem as well or if anyone might know of a fix for this. Thank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received the movie I ordered","review":"I order and paid for the movie, I never got the movie. I did contact the seller, who said he sent out another movie,that I never got either. I then recontacted the seller who said he was going to give me my money back. I'm still waiting for my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing scenes...heck missing some story","review":"I caught this film last night on satellite, and here is the short of it:Nice effects, some nice editing, cool visuals...everything else leaves much to be desired. Hayden Christensen is adequate for the role, but not the most gripping and charismatic fellow. Sam Jackson does the best with his material and is his usual intense self while delivering the goods as a baddie. However, the film-makers seem to have been so worried about keeping the pace of the film tight (barely a 90 minute film) that some scenes that may explain stuff further are just missing. Who the hell are the bad guys really? How are jumpers born? The director seems to have wanted to leave some mysteries for the sequel (questionable if there will be one), but there just isn't enough to entice with the first film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jumper is visually exciting and has a story to tell","review":"If you have read any of the books, let me assure you that while the story line and character names are similar, the story in the movie is different from the books. The views of the colosseum are stunning and also the setting in Egypt. The story moves quickly, the villains are hard to identify: are they the jumpers that steal and cause mayhem, or is it the paladins that trap and the stab the jumpers to death? Will our jumper who we have come to know escape? If so, how does he do it? What happens to the paladins who are after him? JUMPER will show you some of the answers, but leaves open the possibility of a rematch between some of the jumpers and the paladins who remain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only God must have this power","review":"I can only imagine the fantasies of people when they can possess the ability to go anywhere, get anything, do anything and eventually be anything they want to be. Such is the power of Teleportation, the theme of Jumper. The movie has a somewhat slow start but once things are in place there's no looking back. Hayden Christens with his piercing gaze does a good job. But his jumper partner, with the Irish accent was both sick and snobbish. Although the movie does not explicitly reveal it Hayden does have a strong connection with his father at home and his mother who had abandoned him long ago. When he enquires about the same of his jumper partner (the guy with the accent) check out the answer the latter gives. Only a heartless snob would reply like that. Rachel Bilser was sweet and charming. Samuel L Jackson adds sparkle. One scene, the killing of a Jumper was brutal.4 stars for all the excitement."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I do love this movie. I like the storyline and the special effects. I wish that they make a part two. The way they end it, it seems like it. Plus, watching in in high definition does make a big difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jump Around","review":"Jumper could have been so much better, had the film been a bit longer. I felt that, no pun intended, the movie jumped around too much. The premise of teleportation is quite fun, and there are several action sequences in the movie, particularly the one in the Coliseum, that play out nicely. However, I felt with an extra thirty minutes or so, character development could have been built up, and the movie would have flowed better. Hayden Christensen and Rachel Bilson aren't going to be winning any awards soon, and their characters definitely lacked chemistry. This movie is good, brainless fun, but just feels really rushed and sloppily executed. I'm hoping the sequel will be more polished and put-together. I'd say rent it, don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"RAYDEN CRISTENSEN AND THE GIRL FROM O.C .

He was awful in the Star Wars movies, and yet ... here he is even worse.So, thank you, George Lucas - thank you very much for unleashing this beast upon an unsuspecting world. I mean, wasn't Jar Jar Binks enough?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot-mess of a teenage sci-fi flick","review":"I enjoyed the young-adult novel and I LOVE sci-fi so I really looked forward to JUMPER. What a disappointment. Lousy movie. Hayden Christensen wasn't bad and can't be blamed for this abomination of an over-messed-with screen-play. Why do directors and writers take an author's beloved novel and idea, and screw it up so badly that any fans hate it?! This movie was a terrible example."},{"rating":"1","title":"read the book","review":"I loved the book, hated the movie. When I first read the book I thought this would be a great movie. Finally they made the movie, I saw it opening night and all I could think was, God did they blow it! My date had not read the book so I loaned it to him afterwards and he to said it was a great opportunity lost.The movie plot was almost non-existant, what there was made no sense. The book went deeper into the lonliness of being the only jumper, had more suspense and background. It had Davy actually using his power for a good reason. I could go on but lets just say READ THE BOOK! forget the movie.Spoiler alert(movie only)Question:How did Davys mom go from being a lower middle class housewife to a paladin living in a million dollar mansion?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumper (Good Effects?!)","review":"Package recieved in good condition. Everything in the box was received in its proper place. No complaints on the delivery, package or the condition of either. The low rating was for the movie itself. The movie itself, is kind of weak. Yes, the the thought of being able to \\"Jump\\", is pretty awesome! The effects, and tools the \\"Jumper Cops\\" have, are pretty friggin cool too. CGI and special effects have come a long way. Also the Cast is pretty good too. But they take the effects away and the dude is still Anakin who wants everything the easy way. If you are reading this Hayden, props to you for participating, and on your performance; but the plot kind of fell short. Either way the cast was great, and their performances were great.

But I liked it. I agree that it could have used a bit more backstory to explain the origin of Jumpers but even without a lengthy explanation the movie was easy to follow. As for actors, I thought Hayden was great. Easy to watch and believable in the part and I think he and Rachel Bilson have a nice, unforced chemistry. Jamie Bell was great too. If they ever do make a sequel, I'll have it on my watch list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enter a realm of Possibilities","review":"This movie Is a must for any sci-fi fans. And action fans.

Includes the false notion that Jesus studied with Buddhists in his youth, or was perhaps influenced by Essennes. Portrays Judas as trying to manipulate Jesus into declaring himself King and then being double-crossed by the High Priest. Ignores the Biblical fact that Jesus knew who would betray him from the beginning, and portrays Jesus as less than divine throughout the book. A mere hint of Jesus resurrection and victory over death on the last page indicates the author (Martin J. Lutz) was less than an orthodox Christian. I recommend this book only if you are adding to your collector of heresies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reliable","review":"Delivery and packing were good.This product was disappointing.

Finally, at about the last 2 pages, Janie, Reeve, etc. all decide abruptly how they will handle the dilemma-and the book's over. The end. I spent 16 bucks for this book, finished it in an hour, and returned it. It would have been a total waste of money if I hadn't. If you really must see what happens to Janie, wait for a paperback.

However, this book was full of roadblocks and frustration. The final emotional payoff never came. We were just left hanging, wondering about all the characters.

He puts suspense, alot of detail and mystery into the story. To me the story is very interesting. The author makes the title of the story sound mysterious and I like mystery books. If you like mystery books this is the book to read. This book has other books that go along with it. What Janie found was the ending to the books that come before it. I don't want to ruin the suprise on what the book is about so I won't tell you, but I suggest you read the book.

Still, lots of frustration here: it's essentially a rehash of the earlier material, with a complete vanishing of some characters & a pointless emphasis on a cartoony, annoying girlfriend who is meant, I believe, to represent the callous outside world. I don't know. I feel disappointed in this pat, over-simplified wrap-up of a fascinating, flawed, believable bunch of decent people. Cooney may have wrung all the \\"good stuff\\" out of it.

I do not understand why.I gave this book two stars instead of zero because it is well written and the characters have a little more depth than in the previous books.Warning -Spoiler ahead!!!They (the kids) decide that the best answer to the whole Hannah problem is to give her money!!?? It makes no sense. That is the author's answer. To give us no answers. They don't ignore her, they don't find her, they don't turn her into the FBI, they send her a big fat check.Lame!!! They do it so she has no more power over them! Huh? If they need to just drop it they could have. What an absolute waste of an intriging series."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST BOOK IN THE WORLD","review":"i read all the janie books and i would have graded most of them a three. now though, in this one, there is a lot of suspense that all leads to NOTHING!

Be prepared for most of the book to be what the characters are thinking about the various situations, without too terribly much actually going on. Keeping up the tension of the first three books, Cooney did a fair job of tying in events of the first three books without entirely rehashing them. These are like soap operas: don't step into the middle of it unless you already know what's going on. While I think various points of the plot might have been better, it was good to find out what happens between Janie and Reeve, and learn more about some of her Spring family. However, I personally suggest getting the paperback version (when it comes out) or getting it from your local library, as the book is fairly small and easy to read in one afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is thrilling.","review":"Most best book I have ever read the troubles she encounters are wonderful.tgvv fhfhvhbjvjjgj gjggg ggggftbggggfvgggfgv ggb ghf ggb th"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series of books for preteens","review":"I got the first book in this series for my 5th grader.

It's pretty sweet when she makes up with her boyfriend and finds out the truth. But the ending just isn't powerful enough. It's like one of those books where it holds you in suspense for the first twenty-nine chapters then on chapter thirty the end line is something like, \\"And I woke up and it was all a dream\\". *sigh* If you really have nothing to read, then go ahead and buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Janie Found","review":"Imagine being kidnapped when they were little and then growing up wanting to find out who your real parents are?

As for Stephen's girlfriend, why would he just suddenly find her so annoying? She annoyed me from the second she was introduced.

One can learn not only how dogs communicate with other dogs, but also (try to) communicate with humans. My one issue with this book is that it has been seriously under-edited. Many photos and much of the text are redundant, For example the chapter \\"This is my territory\\" is 22 pages long (pgs. 214-236) and could have easily been cut to six or less. That and overly long explanations, and over-use of poor quality photos made the book for me, a bit of a wade. Otherwise, I would have given this book five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canine Body Language","review":"This book is outstanding. An Excellent resource for both professionals and dog owners.

This is a book that if filled with pictures and explanations. It can be read in sequence, or by jumping around from section to section.

This perpetuates the stereotype of big strong men taking care of helpless women, which disappointed me.

Bad, bad, bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOt at all what I wanted","review":"Wow after reading the reviews I really wish I would have received the same results. I usually don't have ticklish feet and this product just makes me remove my feet as soon as I put them on.

This one is more of a foot scratcher and I have to wear socks if I am going to use.

I'm a side and stomach sleeper and can't get comfy with this laying on my side or my stomach. My hips naturally want to be at the end where the pillow meets the bed and it kind of causes my lower back to hurt.I'm pretty sure this is the best option out there, but I'm looking into getting a custom one made that is longer, so my hips don't bend at the bed-pillow-line and one with a hole so that when I lay on my stomach my head can go into the hole like on a massage table. Otherwise, you head cranes up at a big angle and makes your neck hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay if you like sleeping on a twin bed","review":"This pillow is narrow, so in spite of having a king-size bed, I am relegated to sleeping in a tiny space. It is foldable which sounds like a good idea, but the break in the wedge allowing it to fold results in a dip about halfway down the pillow so your chest caves in weirdly. I would return it if I still had the packaging. Many on the market far cheaper; I would try them first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Hard, Caused back aches","review":"This product was disappointing. As someone who has slept on a wedge for2 years for my reflux (I am 47), I am used to the elevated position. I wanted the Medslant pillow because it has its own carrying case and had a dust mite cover (which really is flimsy and I doesn't cover the whole pillow!)Well, the Medslant is so hard and uncomfortable, after 4 nights of trying, I gave up since I could not sleep deeply. It caused an achy back.When I called the company about returning it, the said it was a personalitem and could NOT be exchanged. So, I am out almost $100 for a useless item."},{"rating":"2","title":"medslant pillow","review":"I really like this product, I had a different wedge type pillow prior to this one, and the medslant is far superior. It is much more comfortable to sleep on, and the longer length takes away the pain that I had in my hip from my old wedge pillow, which only came down below my waist. It is definitely a wise purchase for someone with acid reflux like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not work for everyone","review":"This did not work for me.

This is how Windows knows, without special configuration for an individual monitor, what range of sizes and resolutions your monitor can support. This pin is missing on this cable, however, so you'll have to fend for yourself.If you have a monitor of nonstandard resolution (for example, it's actually an HDTV with a VGA jack), Windows won't be able to give you the matching resolution.Good cable for standard monitors, unusable for monitors of nonstandard resolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Advertised","review":"I bought this expecting a Tripp Lite Gold Plated SVGA cable.

If I pick it up, he usually pushes it aside and grabs another one. I think the problem is that the pictures are abstract and not really representative of the words. Toddlers and babies like to be able to recognize objects on a page. This book doesn't feature animals they know (dog, cat, lion, fish) but instead shows exotic animals even I'm not familiar with (arctic tern). Also, the people in the book don't have faces, which are interesting to babies and toddlers. If you want a touching story that your baby or toddler will also appreciate, I would recommend \\"Love You Forever\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as interesting as expected","review":"I was a bit disappointed with this book.

My copy (1999) doesn't have the problem that some of the below reviewers mentioned about using the temp zones in Canada only. Also, this is such a huge, heavy book, I can't imagine adding any more written information to it. The binding will become compromised.

Each flower mentions a zone for growing, it mentions zone 9 numerous times. However, the book says on page 21 \\"Zones 9-12 do not occur in Canada\\" ? I tried to relate zones in my Great Western Book to the temperatures of the Canadian zones. Zone 1 in Botanic is not the zone 1 in Great Western, we are comparing Apples to Oranges.

My husband put a bolt or something to redirect the coffee down.Water escaped through the steam valve. My husband put a seal around the edge of the valve.Lastly, it will overflow if you fill the bottom with water. You have to be careful about the water level.

The rim of the spout had some vicious burrs which could have caused a nasty laceration. I worked on it with emery paper to correct that issue.

The funnel of this so-called 10 cup unit has exactly the same capacity as my Bialetti Class 6 cup pot. The resulting brew was decent enough, but weaker than it should have been. Then corrosion spots appeared on the inside of the lower boiler. I finally solved all issues by buying a 10 cup Bialetti Musa. What a difference!

The lid is kind of cheap, but that's a non-essential, and the inside of the boiler base is not polished, not easy to clean and makes me wonder whether it might be acutally aluminum plated. But the tag says all stainless, so it must be just unpolished (which I've never seen before). But anyway, it doesn't really matter if it's stained or not on the inside of the water container. The only thing to remember is that you really have to tighten hard at first when you're screwing the pot onto the base because the gasket needs breaking in. (This is usually true of any of these kinds of pots.) If you don't, some of the water will escape and the coffee won't make properly.

The sound, the songs, superb. The between song interaction also has its moments (keep in mind this interaction was never meant for fans' consumption since the taping was intended for a TV music variety show). The performance starts out slowly, as the band members seem confused at times about the flow of things. But it gets progressively better as it goes along. The song selection mixes several hits with well chosen album cuts, much to the listener's pleasure.All the performances are great; my favorites are probably Don't Cross The River, Moon Song, Rainbow Song, and California Revisited. Listen for Dewey Bunnell's unique introductory guitar licks in Tin Man. And the fake crowd noise following Windwave gives a sense of the band members' playfulness.

Bought several copies for gifts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it appears","review":"Having a keen interest in the subject matter this book purportedly covers, that of piloting on the Delaware Bay and River, I was very disappointed to find the discussion of piloting is only a sidebar to the book's main theme. If I was interested in reading about Quakers and their objection to war, or the love triangle that ensues, I would have rated this book much higher. Although fiction, I was expecting this book to cover in much greater detail what it took to become a pilot at the turn of the century and would have found this highly interesting. To the contrary, the reader is left with little more knowledge of this area at the end of the book as he was at the beginning.

Just so you know were I'm coming from I also claim Bauhaus, Samhain, The Cure, The Smiths as favorites. Child of the 80s. I'm just glad that this band is still around making great music.

A great album for a Halloween dance, with just enough \\"slow\\" songs to encourage the wall flowers to slow dance. Not my favorite work, but interesting in an evolutionary way. Like most Xymox albums, this one sounds best at night. Try it with the top down ripping along a lonely stretch of highway. Warning: If you are depressed or recently ended a relationship, this album will hit you right between the eyes. It feels great, but it hurts as well. You know what I mean.

When did it turn from something cool to something so lame and predictible. Where's the creativity? All these bands sound alike now. We used to have goth bands with different sounds within the genre, now all the clubs play this synth-pop stuff which has absolutely and utterly no relationship with what Goth started out as.I'm sorry but since I have taste and a sense of history I just can't listen to this drivel.Lame - boring - repetitive - soulless music"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sold out!!","review":"After all these years i never thought Ronny would sell out just to make a buck.If you are a fan of Xymox's older stuff you won't like this album.It is nothing like their previous work,they went totally synthpop,hence the word sell out.Total disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your pennies on a used copy of this album or burn it!","review":"I just wanted to state that I have been a fan since the early 90s and love all the 80s albums they put out. Now I can say that the darkwave era is dead and so is the music. All I can say about this album is that it seem like left overs from the notes from the underground album and it is pure club synthpop Oomph sounding and there is only one song that relates to the older what use to be wiser xymox.

Some music just comes out good, when played right, that you don't have to fix or try to hard. Rock and Roll and Blues have been important music for almost 70 years now. Bands that get the blues, can't relate to what is supposed to be important pop music. The 22-20s are like many British bands, from Cream on, that have a fascination with the heaviness and power of the blues. Jet and The Datsuns have fizzled out for me. The 22-20s are the real deal. The Hiss where one band that made cool sounds. The 22-20s have taken over. Songs like \\"Devil In Me\\" and \\"Baby Brings Bad News\\" are great songs. The intensity of \\"22 Days\\" is impressive.

Are we to assume that the original releases in 1963 and 1969 lacked texts, translations and decent notes? Well perhaps that was possible then, but that doesn't mean that today a major record company should be able to get away with 3 pages each of French, English and German notes and a listing of song titles in French only.It isn't as if EMI France can't do it, because they already did for Christoff's 3CD Mussorgsky set - even providing the Russian texts in Cyrillic, something still rare despite the example of Philips' Kirov sets.No doubt diehard Christoff fans will put up with EMI France for the sake of the music, but if you are just browsing then search for the Mussorgsky set on Amazon and you will soon be the happy owner of one of Gramophone Magazine's top 100 recordings of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bury this deep","review":"It is hard to believe that Brigitte Aubert could have sunk from her previous high (in Death from the Woods) to the appalling low of this offering.The self-indulgent opening pages of Death from the Woods provide an ominous warning of what is to come.

Ms. Auberg's previous book, Death From the Woods, was unusual, with an intriguing heroine in Elise Andrioli, a blind, mute quadriplegic. It was an excellent, suspenceful and believable mystery--which is more than can be said for this book. Throughout Death From the Snow, rather than helping to solve the mystery, Elise simply goes from one improbable incident to another, without a clue.

Survivor was made famous by heavy keyboards and drums, not guitars. I was expecting another Burning Heart, Is this Love, High on you. No songs on this albums have that sound. The vocals by Jamison are top notch, but none of the songs sound like the Survivor I remember. Survivor guitars were only there to complement the keyboards, bass and drums, not drive the whole song. I guess Jim Peterik was the man behind Survivor all along. I give the CD 2 stars for Fire makes Steel, the rest are throw aways. ***Recommended for die hards only*** I highly recommend 'When Seconds Count' for anyone getting started with Survivor."},{"rating":"2","title":"the brilliance of survivor has not dimmed over the years","review":"I just received my cd REACH, by survivor.

I am up to the sixth song, and each song gets better and better. I had read that the songs that Frankie leads sings are a disapointment. The only disapointement is that he did not do more lead singing, although Jimi Jamison is as great as ever on the songs that he sings. What a group! I just wish that they could stay together.

It seriously lacks......DRUM AND BASS. 5 out of 16 tracks actually fit the genre. The other songs are nothing more than pure dark, twisted, hardcore TECHNO. I would never recommend this cd to another American in hopes they might expand their narrow-minded opinions about music. It has no cross-over appeal, unless of course you like the Pop-club progressive house you hear on your local radio stations. Drum and Bass Cd's should come hard or not at all. Drum and Bass, Thump and Kick. You should feel it hit your chest, consequently causing you to move your feet. It should not inspire you to twirl lights in a frenzy.

After trying 5 different lights of varying manufacturers, designs and prices, I ended up going with the $12 version of the Mighty Bright LED light. I'd rather have the spine clip than the cover clip, but my 48 year old eyes need the extra brightness that none of the spine clip LED versions seemed to be able to achieve.

She returned it after one night of fruitless experimentation and inconsistent lighting. The killer flaw seems to be the design of the battery compartment: every time she would turn a page, the batteries would jiggle and the light would flicker or go out. A maddening distraction for both mother and baby... The replacement product is the Mighty Bright Flex2 which, though bulkier, works like a charm. Don't buy this product: for about half the price the Flex2 is by far the superior book light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Itty Bitty Slim","review":"I really like this book light. I have only had it about a month so I cannot attest to the battery/bulb life, but it does the job and it provides enough light that I don't have to move it each time I start a new page. To me that is a big plus. The light is not yellow like some book lights I have used. It provides a nice white light that is much easier to read by. I have noticed that it works slightly better on hard covers than soft, but it is still completely usable on soft covers.

This is the third book featuring forensic anthropologist Elizabeth MacPherson. They are fairly lightwight and humorous. Some of her later volumes ('MacPherson's Lament' and If I'd Killed Him When I Met Him...') combine current and historic mysteries which I found particulary intriguing.This mix of contemporary and historical mysteries is also a key element of her second series. Based in the mountains of eastern Tennessee with titles gleaned from old Appalachian folk songs it is a more serious collection that is rich in the beauty and folklore of the region. My personal favorite is 'She Walks These Hills'.On the off chance that there is someone out there looking for something a little more irreverent than 'Highland Laddie Gone,' McCrumb has an answer for that, too. The title says it all:'Bimbos of the Death Sun'Don't laugh. It won an Edgar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish.","review":"I enjoyed She Walks These Hills and was shocked to discover that this book was written by the same author.

If you're lucky you may get a tracklisting; other albums not even that.

The moral of the story seems to be that money can't buy you love and happiness and that acquiring is more fulfilling than having.

I'm sure they must've had other ideas they sorted through before they reached a final decision. It's baffling to think that they settled on this one. The exact same goes for the title of this album....why. The music here pretty much coincides with the cover and title of the album. I love Quasi, and thoroughly enjoyed albums such as 'Field Studies' and 'featuring: Birds', but this album just falls short. It's just not fun to listen to, and the lyrics aren't what they used to be.

So says, Coomes/Weiss.Amazingly enough, Coomes and Weiss never spew this same bilge at Bill Clinton when he lobbed bombs over at Iraq in 1998. They just turned a blind eye.

To be honest, the only reason we purchased this was to see the conclusion of the Warick Dunn episode. The fact that Grissom leaves the show was a disappointment! Without Warick & Gil Grissom, this show loses all credibility. We do not normally watch this show when it appears on Tv so it doesn't spoil the effect of viewing uninterrupted on DVD. Fishburn is a complete joke and the entire show has lost it's effect from the past. This set starts out ok but then dies a violent death after Grissom leaves the show.

However, his character's back story is simply not believable. Why would a doctor and a college professor whom one would assume is making a good living, leave to take an entry level CSI job? It just doesn't make sense. Then all the other characters are asking his opinion on things; e.g. \\"Ray, what do you think of this?,\\" Ray, come take a look at this.\\" I find it simply not believable. Rather than attempting to replace a Grissom type character, I would have made Catherine a stronger leader and hired Demore Barnes formerly Hector Williams on the Unit to replace Gary Dourdain's character.

It was noisy right out of the box, it was noisy after their recommended \\"pick up and then drop\\" tip, it was noisy after 24 hours, and it is noisy now a month later.

Any assertion that this man is not delusional at best, and hateful at worst is to ignore many of the things he has said outside of his books.

This story line being that the main character(This time the character being Trinh) falls for another character and realizes something about him that makes her feelings for him complicated and forces her to take drastic action.

For every 4 liberal articles saying that everything is messed up, there is 1 conservative article expressing a different point of view. It is extremely one-sided on it's viewpoint and leaves someone who is for meritocracy (working for what you get in life) feeling like a racist even if they don't have a racist bone in their body.

Robert F.

He covers the unit from its formation by a Congressman who willingly went to war (find one of those these days) through every major battle. If you have any connection to the 77th, this is a must-have, but if you want to read about an honorable and brave unit that was consistently out in front in some of the most terrible battles of the war, you'll find this interesting, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best regimental history of VI Corps 2nd Div 3rd Brigade","review":"My mother's maternal grandfather fought in the 43rd NY, part of the same brigade as the 77th NY. Regimental histories range from non-existent (43rd) to memoirs of veterans (typically published around 1900 and therefore susceptible to fuzzy or aggrandized memory), to researched modern work.The old books are out of print, so what's available for sale are scanned. They lack graphics, the type is often garbled, and any index is worthless because of re-pagination.In contrast, this book is a modern work. It has an excellent selection of photographs & drawings specific to the regiment. Notes and an accurate index appear at the back. Like me, the author is a retired engineer whose late interest in the Civil War began with curiosity about his ancestor. The result has been very useful in my own attempt to learn about my great-grandfather, since by 1864 the brigade of five (later six) regiments was as few as 800 men, so they knew each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"it does what is advertised","review":"this came with everything it advertised...it was a 4x...nice hood..and really warm.

The Ro/Kira thing was good, but I didn't think it was right that Ro and Kira took on a whole criminal ring and won. Plus, I didn't think that Sisko would ever let Quark pilot the Defiant, so that was pretty dumb, and why would Sisko leave Deep Space Nine without a crew???? It just doesn't make sense.

Sisko and Quark taking the Defiant without a crew makes absolutely no sense. I can only assume that that part was written with the intention of using a runabout and they had to change it to the Defiant so that the ship would be in the novel at all. 3.

Also, it has a suicide prevention book contained on the enhanced portion of the first CD. So, it's invaluable in another way. I don't care for the low yelling and drudge-like music which fills the beginning and end of the first CD, but I really enjoyed the rest. Avenged Sevenfold is an amazing band that should be talked about among bands like Metallica and Systen of a Down because they're that skilled and are reminiscent sonically.

I suffer from the same thing: spend all day working out and still carry a gut. Anyways, without giving away all the fun parts, it's exciting with some humor.Race footage is good, not great. I feel some great items are only glanced at, while some not so exciting bits are extended too much.The real issue is the language. The \\"f-bomb\\" is dropped so much it becomes a bit uncomfortable (and I routinely ride with ex-1%ers).

Although this isn't LWR(but what is, right?) it is a great video and a heck of a lot of fun to watch, everyone is like-able and the filming is top notch. My only complaint is the theme music, my god is it awful.

He then proceeds to whine throughout most of the documentary.If you're expecting much racing footage in a documentary about a 9,000 KM off-road rally you'll be disappointed.

Welch writes her book from a Wiccan perspective. She attempts to bring her reader around to her idea that all of the Asynjur (Aesir and Vanir Goddesses) are really just different perspectives of one Goddess. The Wiccans believe that in the final analysis there is only one God and one Goddess. While there is nothing wrong with having such a belief system it is shameful to try to underhandedly misrepresent your belief system on those seeking knowledge of the Goddesses of their path.As an Asatrur this book is highly offensive for the above reason. The Asynjur found in the Eddas are named and their deeds are written for all who wish to honor them.As a Gydhja (Asatru priestess) I would recommend that any who seek to learn of the deeds of the Goddesses not waste their money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotional Drivel","review":"In the foreward the author states that she was inspired to write this book by the birth of her first child. This should have been a tip-off. I was very intrigued by the concept of this book and deeply disappointed by the shallowness and subjectivity of the content. This book is a classic example of an author thinking with her glands instead of her brain. There is no scholarship here, no research, just a lot of breathy pnuematic opinion stated as fact and dressed up with charts that assign Goddess correspondences in a more-or-less arbitrary manner. It isn't even feminist in the true sense, merely an emotional cathartic spew. It's fine that the author's new status as a mother inspired her to explore the feminine divine.

The cover, typefont and lay out with footnotes all try to ooze 'academic research' but it is not. What it is, is a work that tries to construct a primeordeal Norse Goddess from a tradition that is - perhaps even more than any other western pagan tradition - polytheist and animist.The bibliography contains too many titles by Llewellyn to be taken seriously as an academic research. From an academic research I expect original material, from disciplines like theology, history, archeology, antropology, but not work that derives from popular science.Some lines of thought - like those concerning Ygdrassil - are interesting, but generally I think it's rather too much wishful thinking and constructionwork.

In fact, however, there are many other better books that deal with this period that are available to readers. The chief problem with McClellan's book is that it perpetuates myths and stereotypes about Russia that should have been discredited long ago. Its style at times reminds one of either Cold War studies of Russia or of romantic treatments of Russian culture. If the purpose of introductory surveys of Russian history is to correct misperceptions as well as to educate, this book fails. Readers would be much better served by Hosking's First Socialist Society, Riasanovsky's History of Russia, or even Hedrick Smith's New Russians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but rudimentary history","review":"I read this book as part of the assigned reading for Professor's McClellan's class at the University of Virginia on Russia since 1917. The book, like the lectures and Professor McClellan in general, were none too impressive. The book has no new insights and does not even attempt to look at things in any sort of a new light. Instead, it is very traditional and not very good. The writing of the author is not noteworthy nor compelling. Thankfully, though, in the book McClellan does not make the outrageous and unfounded accusation that he makes in the class: that Lenin's last testament was a fraud."},{"rating":"1","title":"zero stars","review":"Do not buy this.

She looks like a teenager from the French TV program \\"Star Academy\\". But let's not be biased : I played the CD and : heavy sound, great voice in the tradition of Martina Mc Bride, Chalee Tennisson, etc. A look at the musicians around : the matchless Shannon Forest on the drums, Lisa Cochran for the background vocals, Jonathan Yudkin on the banjo and the fiddle (in addition to orchestrating the music of the greatest singers). She sometimes sounds like Jessica Andrews : a troubling similarity. Beautiful melodies (\\"No\\"), very good riffs (\\"The Next Big Thing\\"), nice ballads (\\"A Little at a Time\\"). A lively album, very pleasant, full of rhythm : in a word, a real achievement. We'll be waiting for the next album now, hoping for a little more personality, just something to distinguish her by, to give her a genuine identity.FACM ( French Association of Country Music - http://facm.free.fr )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed....","review":"This set is pretty disappointing compared to what I expected.

The front half of the book is the text the authors wrote and is organized from forming the company through making growth equity investments, LBOs, roll-ups, exit strategies and finally forming the PE fund. The latter half of the book contains excerpts of relevant SEC regs and IRS code as reference material for the topics covered in the first half of the book.Even if you don't have time to read the whole text, it is a very easy to use reference for almost any issue that comes up in these types of transactions.

There's only a few funny scenes, like the one where Rodney and Fender are trying to get into the Bigweld Ball disguised as a visiting royal and his personal attendant.Madame Gasket seems to me like she would be an outmode because her character design was drastically different from her son's and she was very clunky. Usually, I'm happy to enjoy these children's movies like Toy Story or Wall-E, but I cannot in good faith recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute!","review":"My kids still love this movie after 3 years!

He totally loves it and I went out and bought it for him.While some humor is more for an adult oriented, it still is a fun film for the kids. My son laughs, giggles, and can't wait to point out funny scenes to us. For days, he can talks about Rodney Copperbottom and Bender.Watching it multiple times, isn't a chore at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, visually appealing movie","review":"I bought this movie for my 6-year-old son after seeing part of it at a friend's house. Each time he watches it, he laughs with sheer delight at all his favorite scenes, and later references them while talking to me about other things that make him think of them. If nothing else, to me, that's the sign of a good movie - memorable scenes and quotes that you find yourself repeating later.While others have said that the story line is less than stellar, I find the visual eye-candy appeal and creative engineering of the parts-people and parts-places more than makes up for it. All in all, this is fun entertainment that a family can enjoy together."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE!","review":"I saw this movie at the theater and I loved it!

It's really funny,has a good plot and is hard to stop watching...even the second or third time through. There are several 'comical' scenes where gender confusion is introduced. For families who care about religious values, some of those scenes may bother them. Also, it may be offensive actually to people who are in favor of alternative lifestyles, because in this movie those traits are laughed at.The plot of greed being a force to destroy people is a healthy and instructive plot for young people to learn. The idea that one must go for the big dream in their heart or they will live to ever regret it is emotionally palpable and very effective.This movie should be seen by everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"....","review":"I dont know what you people are talking about...but I thought it was great (no Im not under 13 but oh well) I thought it was one of the greatest shows I've ever seen.

He was entertained throughout, especially by Aunt Fanny. Some of the humor seemed a little adult in nature, though it was way above most children's heads.

(Not having a young child handy, mine being away at college, I am unable to say how funny it might be for the littles.)DO NOT purchase this video expecting to be entertained yourself; if you must, purchase this video and a book.

Lots of Youtubers like me (brainouty) use it. Pity that Xtranormal then changed its policies, so the videos are now too hard to make. So you just dream about making them, now.So dream via this movie. Its characters are much the same-looking, and the whole movie is first-rate in every respect, from witty script and animation, to voiceovers, to film editing, to plot. It's really too fast and too clever for one viewing, so you'll want to buy it and watch it many times, as I will. A++++ to everyone.Like every animated film and sci-fi book, this one has socio-political meanings we all know, but for some reason the story never gets old. Here, the same theme is wonderfully told. Will cheer your day, even if you watch only five minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Very Good","review":"Robots is not quite in the same league as the Pixar films, but it is well written and the animation is excellent.

This is a real departure from Zingaia's earlier releases and I love where they take me on this new musical adventure. Super cool techno-tribal beats, world rythyms and sampled voices from Africa and the Near and Far East blend beautifully. This release really transports me into a whole other world. While I really love the vocals from Abbi Spinner and Katlyn Breene from the previous releases, this new drum heavy trance inducing excursion from Zingaia is a complete a joy and an amazing listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soles on Earth is Out of this World!!!","review":"This latest release by Zingaia (their third) is vastly different than their previous releases, both of which I absolutely love. Where their first release \\"Beneath the Veil\\" is a trance journey into the seductive heart of the Goddess, and their second release \\"Dancers of Twilight\\" featuring the alluring vocals of Abbi Spinner, further develops the original theme, deepening and expanding the voyage into musical spirit; with their latest release \\"Soles on Earth\\" Michael & Katlyn Breene and crew launch into a tribal poly-rhythmic trance dance groove that is no less than phenomenal. Middle Eastern, East Indian and African rhythms combine with sampled vocals from around the world to produce an album that sets the mind, body and spirit free to dance joyously to the pulsing rhythms of life. Definitively the most eclectic of their releases yet, Soles on Earth will stir your soul and get your feet moving. I give it my highest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds of the distance","review":"I am just learning about world beat albums like this and have been thrilled with what I've found out there!

The front suspension has a bit of stiction to overcome, but some graphite would probably overcome that. I rewired to connect the motor to a microcontroller, and the chassis happily accepted the extra weight and a cable hanging off the end. The tires are a bit hard for indoor material (linoleum) and I replaced with a slightly softer rubber for better traction.I might ask for easier integration with the components I wanted to add, but then they'd probably drill holes to match product C, when I wanted A. It's easy enough to drill my own holes, and probably far better than paying to match everyone's product."},{"rating":"1","title":"No steering, overpriced.","review":"I bought this for an arduino project, the car has no steering capabilities unless you jimmy rig it, which I haven't done yet.

It was a chilling tale when I read it back then and it definitely held my interest, but remembering how the terrorist went about (almost) carrying out his plan to crash a commercial airline into the Pentagon it explained a lot to me on how this could, in fact, happen in view of what has recently taken place in our country.

The format has always been easy to use and the cross references in the text make it ideal when you are dealing with nuances of words. I had forgotten that there is a heavy British English influence in the definitions and spellings, etc. For people used to using different dictionaries and formats, this won't be a problem. For more casual users, it does get confusing and it might be a better idea to go with a different dictionary. I love this dictionary and use it as one of my primary sources when I am doing general translation jobs. If you are looking for a more technical dictionary, this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally everything is getting really good","review":"Volume 6 of this classic anime brings quite a few surprises character related. It is great to see that the show has no reserves in screwing up the characters to move along. This volume answers a few things from the prvious volume, then goes on to other events, and how the enemy was defeated will leave you in shock. Then episode 30 has one magnificent scene between the lead male and female character, and is a legendary scene in anime. Overall, great volume, and awesome old achool series.

If not a \\"fellow traveler,\\" then he was one of the \\"useful idiots\\" on the left that Lenin laughed about. Wallace is revealed as so pro-Soviet as to be blind to the true nature of totalitarian communism, naive to the point of being dangerous and reckless, arrogant and haughty, and driven by passions the author does not want to delve into. The book also reveals, inadvertently, the duplicity of intellectuals on the left and the stars of the entertainment world who, knowingly or not, were essentially working on behalf of Stalin.

If you're just using it across a tub, I think it's fine for those who live alone or with a significant other, but I don't think I'd use this is the family bathroom.The quality could be better, but then again, for the price, I think it's pretty much in line with what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"\\"Wide Open\\" is surprisingly easy to experience, given its power to evoke such a wide range of life's emotions.

The music of Rich Marcello continues to grow. This CD, with Amy Jane for vocals is excellent - the best CD to date.There is an emotional honesty and depth to the music which reaches the soul. Everything from 'Blessing', a song to a 13 year old son to 'In The Beginning' a song about the view from the end of a very long, successful and blessed marriage, to 'If you Could See Me Completely' which is my personal favorite.The arrangements on the music is excellent and the lyrics come through clearly with great emotion.This is an excellent CD which debuts Amy Jane and shows the continued growth of the music by Rich Marcello at Pinnacle Records.An excellent gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great train video","review":"My sons LOVE this DVD. It has soothing music and very colorful trains. My three year old yells out the colors and types of trains and my 8 month old is transfixed the entire length of the movie. I highly recommend this DVD for you train lover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Those professional critics don't understand a thing!","review":"I think those professional critics don't understand the new ideas and techniques in From the Ashes. So we gotta make out point: FTA rocks. It has cools songs like God Save the USA, Waiting, Holiday in the Sun, Yesterdays, Judgement Days...This CD worth buying. If you don't have it, buy it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"something other than the mainstream ...","review":"this is a rad new cd from pennywise, after all these years they can still produce crazy good punk music and all of their songs are meaningful as well. People should support bands like pennywise instead of all the other mainstream ... out there so buy this cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"From the Ashes","review":"first off, pennywise is the best and this CD will not dissapoint. Pennywise's sound has evolved and matured while maintaining the raw energy that has made them great. The lyrics are insightful, dealing with the state of the government and the search for hope in the aftermath of 9/11. If you like Pennywise or just punk/hardcore in general, buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I've been a huge fan of Pennywise since I was a lot younger. But this is the album that has weened me off them.I don't know what Jim and the boys have done but it all sounds so clean and boring. The only song that comes close to firing me up in the way they used too is Punch Drunk. I think this album, and The Fuse were seriously let down in the mixing process. It just doesn't have that Pennywise edge any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"FROM THE ASHES IS FROM HEAVEN","review":"THIS IS THE BEST CD I'VE HEARD IN A LONG TIME (NOT INCLUDING PAST PENNYWISE ALBUMS) THIS BAND CONTINUES TO KICK SOME MAJOR A$$ WITH THOSE KILLER PUNK BEATS AND HARDCORE GUITAR RIFFS... YA GOTTA LOVE EM, I RECCOMMEND \\"GOD SAVE THE USA\\" BECUASE THAT SONG RULES."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album....Land of the Free part 2?","review":"This album reminds me of another Land of the Free. Some excellent songs, some good songs and some I could live without. I wish the guitar had more edge to it...It seems a little soft. And too much strumming, not enough palm mutting. Otherwise, a good disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Yet","review":"This is the epitome of Pennywise. This is the best album from them to date. From the Ashes will be number 1!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This CD rips! Lots and lots of true, fast paced punk rock. The song \\"Waiting\\" is awesome and is worth the price of the cd alone. \\"Yesterdays\\" while not as hard as the others, has a great fast pace and is one of the many great songs on this cd. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk Rock at its best","review":"I have been a big fan of Pennywise for a long time, althought i do not have all their records, this is by far on of the best! Jim's defined voice and Fletcher's guitar work is amazing. The songs on this album are very fast and altought the lyrics arent as great as \\"Land Of The Free\\" they are still realy good! If you are a fan of any punk rock bands such as NOFX, Bad Religon and stuff like that, you need to pick up this album! Its amazing. Peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"From The Ashes...","review":"Another Solid Punk Album from Pennywise, the highlight in my opinion is 'god save the USA' easily some of there best work yet. The Albums Super Fast and super cool, some tracks are a little samey but thats how it goes with punk. I saw them live @ Leeds Festival, best live act ever! So Buy It and help keep one of the few remaining punk bands we have left, peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rise from the Ashes.....","review":"Pennywise done it again.... An album filled with Unity and anger against the goverment and their way to treat people today... And a great follow up to the last album \\"Land of the free??\\"They have showed once again that they still are one of the best Punk/Hardcore bands in the world.Buy it and start the revolution..."},{"rating":"2","title":"RISE UP!!","review":"Following up Land of the Free with this political gem, Pennywise proves that after 15 years, they're still the best. While the messages in their two newest cds is quite different from their earlier music, it's no less serious, and they continue to stay atop the punk rock scene. From the Ashes is a great cd, rivaling even Full Circle. Too bad Jason isn't around to see them now; he'd be proud."},{"rating":"2","title":"stop bitching please","review":"this album is awesome, just awesome. all you people that are like \\"ugh there so mainstream ugh there old stuff is the only good stuff DURRRRR!\\" just shut up. its ok to like the new stuff too. personally this is i think the second best pennywise album, first being land of the free, and third being straight ahead. yes, i like the old stuff, but the new stuff is just as good if not better. this album has some great vocal melodies, its very catchy and just awesome. my personal favs are yesterdays, now i know, god save the USA, waiting, and judgement day. if you like your punk a bit more poppy then lets say AFI's Answer That and Stay Fashionable, than this album is for you. to all of you who keep complaining about how the later PW albums are mainstream, there not. so do the world a favor and stop bitching please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same old Pennywise + more melodic","review":"I give it 4 stars because I can't give it 4 and 1/2. I bought this some weeks ago and it's pretty much enjoyable. This CD features the same old Pennywise but with more melody just like they've showed us in \\"Land of The free?\\".Some songs they sound like they're repeating themselves a bit but it's not bad. Other songs they've come up with a witty composition and good energy. I've always been a loyal Pennywise fan and I still am. I only hope they release more CDs like this one. Their angry message and lack of conformity will never get old cause that's what harcore punk is all about. Another great release from an excelent band!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's alright but...","review":"Pennywise seems to be turning into another Simple Plan or New Found Glory. What happened to the Pennywise that made you want to shake your fist in the air and sing along while getting pushed around by a bunch of sweaty people with blood stains on their shirts? They won't get a good response if they play this in concert, so they'll probably just play their olther stuff, anyway. The bottom line is: You'll probably like this if you like Simple Plan or boring music like that. But I reccomend you steer clear of From The Ashes and get one of Pennywise's other CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST","review":"This is probably one of the best albums to come out this year!!! Best 15 dollars I've ever spent. Jim's lyrics are amazing!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Done it again.......","review":"Once again pennywise has done it again and have came out with another killer cd. Tracks like yesterday, judgement day, rise up,make this cd such a good album. My recommndation is that you just go out and buy it, pennywise forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing blend","review":"The latest offering from punk's most constant force is simply refreshing. It merges aspects of About Time and earlier albums seemlessly into the more mature sounds of Land of the Free. This album is the fruit of a decades commitment to integrity"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good album","review":"Another good album by Pennywise. Will never beat the first 4 albums, but this one is right where Land of the free left off. The lyrics are more diversifid... Some political songs and other songs about hope. This is kind of a dark PW album, some sad lyrics and good melodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"the greatest new cd out there","review":"wow when i first heard this cd i rememer why i started to listen to pennywise..... cause the are the best they pump me upready to go riding. get theis cd its better then u think go and get it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid and VERY Worthwhile","review":"You have to love that PW is back with a bigger vengeance. You KNOW you're going to get meaningful lyrics, especially with a title like FROM THE ASHES, a memoire to life after 9/11. Throw in some crunchy punk guitars and driving bass/drums, and it's just another PW masterpiece.But the true gem here is the second disk - the DVD that *really* tells the story. Don't walk, RUN to the BUY button on this page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Won't You be my Kissaroo!","review":"This book is fantastic! We read it every night to our one year old daughter as part of her bedtime routine. She loves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These are terrific","review":"These were exactly what I was looking for and needed. I had to be able to apply a good deal of torque in a fairly narrow space and the traditional Allen wrenches were impossible to use. The screwdriver form factor allows both high torque application and a straight narrow reach. The T-Handle approach would also never have worked due to the lack of operating space. The ball drivers and ProHold were an added bonus and work quite well. The materials also appear to be very strong and the handles are quite comfortable. So overall, definitely deserves five stars. My only very minor complaint is that all the drivers come tossed in a single bag so it can be a pain to find the size one is looking for without emptying the entire bag and rooting through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice for screwdriver-style hex drivers.","review":"I've always used the cheaper L-style hex keys, but after using the screwdriver-style driver at work, I couldn't go back to the old way. I picked up a set of the metric and SAE ball hex drivers from Bondhus, and I've been very impressed. They're made in the US, have comfortable handles, and the tips fit snugly.If you have a lot of hex bolts to contend with, the improved ergonomics over a hex key make them well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"a Treat!","review":"i bought this tape on a road trip and logged the miles spellbound by how Bishop's voice and inflection turned the poems I blew through in college into delightful, insightful stories. This tape, and i'll bet the others in this series, is an example of why poetry needs to be heard, rather than read. Send these tapes to schools everywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible","review":"this song is so beautiful and artistic. you can really feel the emotion and the description. its poetry. its brilliance. it rarely gets better than this. thank you mars volta. thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of his worst 3 albums","review":"I don't know witch one I like least, Private Passion, Step By Step or this one. This is not what I would call good Jazz, the rest of his albums are good to great. I myself prefer the more jazz side of Jeff, but these are just my thoughts on his music. Listen before you buy, I should have. This reminds me of Disco more than Jazz, and I never liked Disco."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Slightly Better Is Step By Step","review":"There's enough infectious grooves to keep the balance of this cd on the up and up.A couple of tracks border on campy pop-rock synth movie soundtrack material. Some tracks will sound dated but suitable by 80's standards. However, most of Lorber's earlier synthesizer and keyboard work and arrangements are still creative.Once heard a friend describe Jeff Lorber as the Kenny G. of R&B;, pop-synthesizer music. This was easy R&B;,soft-funk,pop-jazz with some pop-rock infused for good 'ol midnight partying and listening back in the day. His next release Step By Step was produced by Mic Murphy and David Frank (The System).It's a little more polished in production but a little bit ahead of In The Heat of the Night. It is also a very rare out of print cd Japanese import title to get a hold of also.In The Heat of the Night is a good start to get into the Lorber sound !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome remix by Hex Hector","review":"What more can I say, this is an awesome cd. This is probably one of my favorite Faith Hill songs to date, but what makes this cd worth having is the remix of Breathe by Hex Hector. It is an awesome remix which runs over 10 minutes and was previously only available on a Japanese import. Overall I think that this cd is worth having in your collection, and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delta 400 didn't hold up.","review":"I bought a Delta 400 about 5 years ago and within three years my plumber had to replace the insides of the thing. It just failed again and this time he told me that it couldn't be fixed. I called Delta and they want paperwork from five years ago that I don't have anymore. My plumber also commented that many of the 400's seemed to be defective. So if you must buy a Delta hang on to all the freaking paperwork!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting reference","review":"Someone please tell me why Morgenstern, in the Table of Contents and within the section on \\"Liner Notes\\", does not provide album titles. This also happens occasionally throughout other parts of this tome. It is very irritating and for this reason I give \\"Living with Jazz\\" four stars instead of five. Otherwise, a very exhaustive and interesting reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"200 Minute Marketing System","review":"A great resource for small business owners who need to understand the full range of marketing inj a limited amount of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly Pleasing TV Production","review":"I am a big fan of the Preston/Jones version of Meredith Wilson's \\"The Music Man\\" and purchased this DVD only because I think Kristin Chenoweth has one of the best singing voices currently performing. Matthew Broderick, while no Robert Preston, was not nearly so bad as I expected. Kristin Chenoweth was even better in the role (in my opinion) than Shirley Jones had been, and that's quite an achievement -- her performance moved this from 2.5 stars to 4, all by itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"No magic!","review":"I walked out of theatre when this first played. Recently bought the DVD to give it another try.There is simply no chemistry here!It felt as if they had to re-dubed most of the soundtrack. Timing was all off. It just felt bad.Using Broderick was a really bad idea!!!!Anybody want a DVD?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh!","review":"Being a huge fan of the original, this was a waste of production money. If one was to remake The Music Man, one would think the remake would be so totally different than the original there would be no room to compare. Robin Williams would have been great in that respect!Matthew Broderick was a cardboard cutout with limited emotion and no dancing ability. Why he keeps getting roles like this is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't believe \\"he's no Robert Preston\\" !","review":"My whole family (3 generations) watched this musical and loved it. We taped it, and were disappointed the DVD hasn't come out sooner. We thought the so-so reviews for MB were unwarranted; he doesn't have the overwhelming presence for \\"76 trombones\\", but the \\"Marion\\" and other love songs were BRILLIANT with much more of a nuanced performance than Preston. KC absolutely shines in this musical, and updates Shirley Jones' interpretations beautifully. She is the real gem here, and her duet with the \\"Lida Rose\\" barbershop quartet gives me yummy chills every time I hear it. Definitely worth buying, as my six year old watches it at least once a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you Crazy?","review":"This version of the Music Man would make Meredith Willson turn over in his grave! I have been a BIG fan of MM for many years. I have the original film version and saw the broadway show 4 times. This TV version ought to be burned!! Craig Bierko (who did the broadway version) should have played the part for TV. He is handsome, funny and a hell of a better singer that Matthew B. He is Robert Preston reincarnated! I'm sure, somewhere, there is a video of the Broadway version and Amazon.com would be crazy not to find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible version of great classic","review":"I have given Matthew Broderick 1 star for trying, but he didn't. His facial expressions during the great musical numbers are like looking at a wall, boring & never moving. What was with the Kristin Chenoweth & Broderick ballet in the library in \\"Cinderella\\" costumes. Come on! One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. I reccommend the original \\"The Music Man\\" with the fabulous team of Robert Preston & Shirley Jones, with the late Buddy Hackett and Hermione Gingold. See the original version. So much more lively, fun, and INTERESTING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just stick with the original","review":"I couldn't even stand to watch this. I watched bits and pieces of it but it is so awful. Trust me when I say just get the original. Don't waste your time with this version. However, on a plus side my kids enjoy both versions. Of course both are under 5. LOL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trouble in this Made-for-tv movie","review":"As a huge fan of the original \\"Music Man\\", I eagerly anticipated this movie. But after about half an hour of watching it, I had to change the channel. The main problem was Matthew Broderick as Professor Higgins. I found him to be flat and boring, with none of the pizazz as in the original. Take my advice, and go for the classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meredith Wilson is turning over in his grave!","review":"Chenoweth has a huge voice and she does her part, and reviving \\"My White Knight\\" from the stage play was a nice addition, but Matthew Broderick as Professor Harold Hill is the worst piece of casting in the history of cinema. The producer and director should go to Meredith Wilson's grave and aplogize. Simply an awful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it...!","review":"Meredith Wilson was a genius...his book and score of The Music Man are incomparable. This boring, badly acted remake does the almost impossible...it makes The Music Man look bad.For sheer joy, and an outstanding, joyful version of The Music Man, see Robert Preston and Shirley Jones in the 1962 film version.Skip this one...by all means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it! See the 1962 version","review":"Everyone tried to hard too make these characters \\"real\\" and ended up with a bland Harold Hill, a nasty shrill Marian, a true politician for Mayor Shinn, a Mrs. Shinn with bad timing, and basically an unexciting movie. See the Robert Preston/Shirley Jones version for true fun and appreciation of Meredith Willson's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matthew Broderick's version of The Music Man","review":"This is a younger version of the old tried and true version of Music Man. I liked it better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deseves to be in the 50 cent Bin","review":"Adore \\"The Music Man\\" and love Broderick (ever since \\"WarGames\\" in 1983) but he was the wrong choice for this show - despite whatever his chronological age was when he made this version, he looked way too young for the role - made me feel like I was watching a High School production of the play... and a BAD High School production at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Robert Preston","review":"Ugh. Low energy, unflattering tight shots which provide details of Ms. Chenowith's face which I'm comfortable not knowing about, including a huge bubble of saliva at the end of My White Night. The choreography is pedestrian (\\"walk-ography\\") and there is no momentum. The original movie with Robert Preston and Shirley Jones is definitive; I would advise sticking to it. This version only points up the magnificence of Robert Preston in the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Nightmare on Main Street","review":"This movie in no way can be compared with the wonderful 1962 version of the Music Man starring Robert Preston. Poorly paced, poorly written, poorly acted, and a wonderful example of why some movies should never be remade. Mathew Brodderick is non-existent in this role. He has the look of a deer caught in a cars headlights and acts as if he wants to runaway as fast as he can from this production. For anyone to say that these music and dance numbers are superior to the original is the equivalent of saying that Days Inn is better then the Ritz Carlton. No comparison! See the original and bask in its energy and joy because they are clearly lacking in this shameful remake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks","review":"What a bland performance by Broderick and other cast members. This version of the Music Man is worse than death warmed over - so badly cast that no expensive production values could save it. While the original had massive electricity, this one barely shows a pulse. I can't help but think that all the 5 star reviews are from Disney employees. What a waste of my time and their money. Truly uninspired. Merideth Wilson must be spinning.You could say I was prejudiced because my cousin was in the original Broadway version and also the movie version (as Buddy Hackett's girlfriend), and I've seen the original movie version more times than I'd like to admit. But there's more to it than that. It really is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Music Nerd","review":"I can't believe anyone gave a good review to this poor excuse of a production, and the fault belongs to Matthew Broderick. While he is good at playing nerds now, The Producers, he can't cut it as a leading man. Who would possibly have been charmed or conned by his boring version of Harold Hill, probably one of the greatest musical comedy roles.Poor Kristin Chenowith, she would have been excellent had she had someone to work against.Victor Garber, who was miscast as the mayor would have been a more appropriate Harold Hill.Get the original and forget about this horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new look to a classic musical","review":"For many years I have been an avid fan of the 1962 film so when I unwrapped this 2003 version and placed it into my DVD player I crossed my fingers and hoped for the best! I was not disappointed> Mathew Broderick and Kristin Chenoweth give delightful performances and the whole look of the sets and costumes is just great! It's a lot less theatrical than the Robert Preston-Shirley Jones rendition but no less entertaining in it's own terms. The singing and dancing is superb and the settings and costunmes just right. I love it!!! Now this does not mean that the 62 DVD is going to be tossed aside! Rather, I think they are great companion pieces giving different looks to what is one of the great musicals. I would thorougly recommend it. So there!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood Fails Again.","review":"Hollywood continues to try to re-make already perfect film musicals better. And more often than not they fail. With the Music Man comes another failure. Nothing good to say about this one. Bad bad casting = Matthew Broderick.

'Nuf sed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideous, Heinous, Horrible","review":"\\"The Music Man\\" is one of very few classic Broadway musicals that have been made into classic films. Why someone chose to remake it, to miscast virtually every role, is a mystery to me. I see that there are reviewers who like this version of \\"The Music Man\\", even some who prefer it to the original film. Let me put it simply: These people are idiots. If you are one of these people, then you are an idiot. Please, do yourself a favor and get the wonderful original."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Music Man is a True American Classic - Despite This!","review":"I will admit that I'm prejudice when it comes to Robert Preston. Preston had a limited range as a singer, but more than made up for it with stage presence, knowledge of the character of Harold Hill, and great moves that dominated every scene (and he was in nearly every scene). I would be hard-pressed to find someone who would fill the man's shoes. Still, Matthew Broderick seems uncomfortable in his OWN shoes. His awkwardness and gangly movement is disconcerting for me, the viewer. I kept waiting for him to fall down! I know they cast Broderick to attract viewers with his familiar name and his reputation as a musical performer in The Producers, but it's like casting Ray Romano to play Don Corleone in The Godfather because he's Italian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better tham the \\"original\\"","review":"In my opinion this new version makes the Preston/Jones version look dated. Kristen Chenoweth has a much better voice and the low key Harold Hill by Matthew Brodrick is just right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much less than the sum of the parts","review":"What a disappointment! I needed to buy the movie and debated between the original, which I had seen before, and this, which I had not. Boy, did I make the wrong choice. I'm not a real fan of Shirley Jones, and absolutely adore Kristen Chenowith, so bought this version for that reason alone. Matthew Broderick is absolutely HORRIBLE in this production. Absolutely no charm or energy, with awkward movement and bland, uh, everything. Kristen is, of course, a MAJOR musical theatre talent, but even she can't escape the horrible costumes, direction and cinematography. Victor Garber and Molly Shannon are also wonderful actors, but are horribly miscast, so none of their lines make any sense or have any impact. The Music Man is a bravely unique, brilliant piece of musical theatre. You absolutely must see it. Just do it at your local community theatre or the original movie version. This dreck will ruin it for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for BIG dogs:-)","review":"I sent this as a gift for my daughters dog.

If you're wondering what the state of rap in Japan is, think old school. Most of the songs on this disk would have been very much at home here in the US around 15 years ago. The tunes and beats are very simple (think early Janet Jackson).The rapping itself is excellent. I should add that I have no idea what they are rapping about without the liner notes (complete with translation in my copy), but this helps to break down rap into its most basic form: using the human voice as a rhythmic instrument instead of a melodic one.I would have enjoyed this disk more if more of the songs had been more energetic. They are around 1/3 upbeat lively tunes and 2/3 mellow. For a first step into rap from an asian country, this is not a bad one to take."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it is suppose to do.","review":"Why the other reviewer had and interference problem with this cable could very well be due to something else. If he had a bad cable he should have sent it back. If however he ran it under the carpet and allowed people to walk on the cable, well there is the problem. No cables are made to allow people to walk on them as this will damage the internal braid that is use as an RF shield. Having been an Electronics Tech for some 45 years I use these cables since they have been made. The only big difference between a Mini-Coax and a normal sized Coax like an RG-6 that the cable companies use it that with a smaller diameter cable like a mini-Coax you will get some additional signal loss (db). If however you can live with that like I can then you use a mini-coax cable. I use it in applications where I do not want to run a bulky rigid cable like RG-6 and can deal with the slight signal loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother.

In discussing \\"The Hero Within,\\" when the subject of autism arises, this author calls autism a disease which it most emphatically is NOT. Autism is a neurobiological condition that affects sensory input and processing and communication to varying degrees based on the individual. I also didn't like the R*** M** reference because the title character Dustin Hoffman played in that 1988 movie is not representative of people who have autism. Less than 10% of the autistic population are prodigious savants and the very term R*** M** is extremely offensive in autism circles and is always best avoided. I for one am quite sick and tired of that savant stereotype being so readily applied to people with autism.All in all, this is a decent book that serves its intended purpose of providing synopses of movies that are suitable for family viewing, but that inaccurate definition of autism and the quick rush to the crutch of R*** M** cost it one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"kiddo","review":"I used Yahoo to see about this book initially. Wow, out of 9 reviews two gave it 5 stars but oddly had the same 4 words \\"I liked this book\\" and nothing more. The rest were a single star with one 3 star. Lots of misspellings and incorrect grammer, or just plain jibberish (the three star one was just a joke, I take it). I looked here to see if I could get any more than just one person saying they liked this book. I liked getting her past reviews for free on Yahoo earlier in 2007, but now they are hoping for book sales and won't let you look at her opinions for anything that is not recently playing.

I found it to be a very interesting biography that did a good job of documenting the life and accomplishments of an exceptional individual. Although I am not sure that any book can capture the true charisma, dynamics and sphere of influence of one of the most remarkable gentleman I have ever known, it does an excellent job of providing personal insite into the man and the community he loved.

I haven't got any such (lame) friends though ... but as it is, I'll gift this as a gift anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Castle Waiting is wonderful!","review":"I have been a fan of Castle Waiting and Linda Medley for years. I was so excited to see this compilation. She is an amazing storyteller with very lovable characters. She has a wonderful wit and sense of humor in her storytelling. Two-thirds of this collection are previously published graphic novels, The Brambley Hedge and The Lucky Road. I was a little disapointed that there was not more \\"new\\" material in this collection. However the last third is a wonderful story involving Sister Peace a nun with a most unusual order. Sister Peace's story is so fun and a beautiful tribute to friendship and rebellious women that it is worth the price of the whole book just for this story line. I hope others who enjoy this book know that the story continues and you can buy more Castle Waiting from the publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"utter revoltion....","review":"Horrible.... just utterly bland dry horrible crap.God this book sucked.I suppose i should give it some credit- the first half is pretty good.... But god, does she ruin it with the rest. It builds you up with a decent story, and then just sucks, sucky, suck, sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and Good for Learning","review":"My grand children have enjoyed this DVD and learned the shapes and colors from this. It has a lot of information for kids about many different shapes and lots of colors. They liked the cute animations and I was pleased with the pace. Very educational, gentle. They display mixing of colors, combining shapes to form new shapes. Good DVD in my opinion and great teaching tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"I bought this for my toddlers thinking it would be an easy way to help them start on their pre school curriculum. Yeah, the whole set of DVDs are basically a power point presentation burned onto a DVD with horrible graphics... My kids hated these DVDs, they would never let me play them for more than 5 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Quality and Terrible Graphics","review":"I purchased this DVD as I saw some really great reviews on it and thought it would be a good place to start with my son (10 months) as we will be having a lot of travel over the next few months. I was horribly disappointed the first few seconds into it. The animations are terrible and come off really creepy, and my son wasn't even interested by it. The quality of the DVD is really poor with a lot of glitches. Too bad I can't return it! I will not be purchasing any more Gallping Minds DVD's again."},{"rating":"2","title":"the boys did it again","review":"This is one of those CDs where every track is great. The songs range from tight instrumentals, Wildwood Drive and Hog Potato, to a nine minute New Horizons that goes through some amazing changes. Dave, Jeff, Ben and Adam all are amazing musicians by themselves and together make some beutiful music. It seems every year this band becomes more popular, especially amoung college age demograph. Even though I've heard some of the die-hard bluegrass traditionalists disapprove of these guys for various reasons I belive even they will fall in love with this album. Order it now, you won't be disapponted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Junk. You can have mine for FREE!!","review":"Don't even think of buying this device unless you enjoy spending 15 minutes cleaning up after each use. The pitcher base detaches itself from the pitcher after about 5 seconds of blending making an ugly mess everywhere. After cleaning up that mess and screwing the base on tighter, it detaches itself after another 5 seconds...get the picture!Anything thicker than water won't pour through the spout, so that feature is completely worthless. You absolutely cannot walk away while turned on or it will vibrate itself off the counter and onto the floor. That is assuming that it doesn't self destruct and have parts and smoothie flying everwhere first. The only reason anywone would give this even a 1 star rating is that ZERO wasn't an option to choose from. You can have mine for FREE!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Off the Map","review":"if you've never been to a rhcp concert(like me!) then this is a great way to see what you've been missing. even if you have, this dvd is still great!as well as covers like \\"fire\\" and \\"subterranean homesick blues\\" it features their most successful songs, like under the bridge, give it away, blood sugar sex magik, scar tissue, just to name a few. rhcp is a great live band with some wild on stage tactics and i found myself singing along with this dvd.(and staring at their beautiful bodies..:) it also has pre stage footage and interviews with them which is interesting as well. 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Part Of the Map!","review":"What a shame. I still have no idea what this DVD is like. For the second time I ordered it and received a DVD that only works in regions 3/4/6. Amazon clearly lists the region code as being Region 1 for this DVD and I clearly live in Pennsylvania not Zimbabwe. Why would an American company send an American consumer a product that only works in Mongolia not once BUT TWICE?????????? You got me. Anyway I am sending it back for a refund a second time. I honestly am starting to doubt this DVD even exists in Region 1 format. Amazon can prove me wrong by sending it to me in Region 1 format if they bother reading the reviews their customers post. Until then it gets 1 star. \\"1\\" as in the region code it is SUPPOSED TO BE in order to work in my Blu-Ray player! DUH!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Cali - Fornicate","review":"This DVD is for everyone who liked Californication.The songs, although are from a mix of their previous albums,have an edge in their performance as they are touring & promoting for the same.As always they make you laugh as they perform, but the most unusual feature in this DVD was the lyrics as subtitles & I was not aware of it when I bought it.Its the first time I came across such a feature in a live performance DVD.As for the performance it met my expectations & was worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite DVD ever!","review":"I totally love this DVD! It has the neatest concert and backstage footage. It's very entertaining. In the backstage footage it shows the band getting ready to go onstage and the very moment they walk out onstage which I think is pretty cool. So if you are a fan of the red hot chili peppers than I think this DVD is the perfect DVD for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"a really badass concert , great if your a big rhcp fan. chili peppers really know how to put on a show! also a nice 5 extra live songs makes it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational!!!","review":"I saw this tour live and this DVD is better than being there. The 5.1 surround sound is awesome. Turn down the lights, turn up the sound, and sit back. It's like being in the front row. Buy this and you can go to a Chili Peppers show every night in your living room. Of course the DVD has been edited and there are seens from different nights that are spliced together so you will see Flea playing a blue bass and then a silver bass a second later... and Anthony's mohawk does vary from scene to scene as well but that shouldn't bother you if you are out to see an amazing performance.Bottom line is that this DVD [is great]. Before this came out Shrek was my 2 year old's favorite movie on DVD. Now it's this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Peppers rock","review":"I concur with most of the reviewers who say this DVD is awesome. They are such an intense and tight live act, which this DVD captures very well, with the reservations noted by others. My main complaint, as a drummer myself, is that the mismatch between the audio and video is really obvious with the drums. That's a big disappointment for me, however, I really don't notice the problem with the other players at all.I'm not a guitar player, but I know enough to see that John is an incredible artist. His arms are a mute testimony to his former life on the edge and I know now where they got the concept for Scar Tissue. That song on the album, and on the DVD, has one of the sweetest, most soulful guitar solos I've heard.A must have if you like the Peppers at all or just enjoy good live music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"finally after waiting a year it will be released!","review":"the peppers recorded one of the final shows on their californication world tour last fall in portland and finally the dvd (and video)will get their releases! this is the 1st offical peppers release for the t.v. screen since their what hits!? video comp. back in 1992 (hopefully what hits and the two older videos, psychadelic sexfunk and positive mental octopus will get their dvd releases like funky monks did last year)not counting the unoffical rock your socks off dvd/video. this dvd is said to have bonus goodies like backstage footage and interviews but all i can say is finally...the peppers release something new for the eyes to watch and just think...about 3 months later we should have something new for the ears from the greatest band in the world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I love chili peppers and that all! Every chili peppers show is amazing and that was one of them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!16"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money alone","review":"All of the \\"it's amazing\\" reviews are completely accurate with the 2 selling points being the varied setlist and of course Johns playing, but there is one thing that i would dish out $20 for alone. The version of the Stooges \\"Search and Destroy\\" is one of the greatest songs i have ever heard, and I'm not just talking cover songs, I'm talkin greatest tracks in any genre by and band period. It is unbelievable, if you haven't seen it go get it for that track alone you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Out","review":"This could have been an outstanding product if it wasn't for the decision to take footage from multiple concerts and put them along one audio track. If you didn't understand that (which is very possible) while watching, say, 'Around the world' you HEAR one show throughout, but the footage was edited so that you could see up to 3 different performances along that audio. Because of this you'll have syncing issues. If you are a musician you will notice it looks awkward then figure out \\"Hey what i SEE them playing, isn't what I'm HEARING\\". This in my opinion, spoils the continuity of the DVD. I recommend buying slane castle, even though they touched up anthony's voice on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh What A Shame..........","review":"When I saw this DVD was to be released, I could'nt wait. When it was eventually released, it took me a week to find somewhere with a copy. When I finally got it and started playing it, I was extremeley dissappointed. Went and replaced it, and well still dissappointed.This dvd has on around half of the songs a sync problem, ie actual sound is not in time of mouth movement.I have tried replacements, and on the 2nd copy have tried it 3 different dvd players.....still the same issue.It is such a shame I would have given this dvd 5 stars, now I doubt if I'll even keep it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great DVD for a great tour","review":"I live in Detroit and was in the front row for the Peppers show on the Californication tour. Very good show. This DVD is the entire concert that we all saw. Same set list and everything. The band sounds excellent on this DVD. Heck, even John sounds good here (lets face it folks, he isnt a great guitar player). Chad (A Detroit native, whom I met at the show) is an excellent drummer. Well, Anthony (also from Detroit) and Flea sound excellent as well.My only complaint? The bonus songs should have been edited into the main concert footage. To hear these great rare live tracks you have to go into the special features. It would have been nice to see a \\"mega set list\\" with EVERY song on it back-to-back."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks","review":"The author and publishers are losers. They ripped off the title from an amazing, award winning book called The Tibetans: A Struggle to Survive by Steve Lehman.

It has a cute story, cute illustrations, and a wonderful message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unloveable was a cute story","review":"I liked the book, however didn't really like the \\"Unloveable\\" title. Is a cute story about the little pug thinking he isn't as good as a big dog, and finding out otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible message","review":"A staff developer read this book to a class of teachers and, while I loved the SD, I hated the book. I'm happy to see others feel the same way. The dog's final friend is someone exactly like him. There was no explanation of or change in the other characters, therefore for me no depth. I see the intended message, but feel it was poorly executed. I would not recommend this book for any child who is impressionable, unless you were to read it to older children who could discuss the message openly."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can only find acceptance among those who are like you?","review":"As a strong supporter of anti-bias education, I really, really wanted to like this book. I now wish that I had read the two negative reviews because, unfortunately, I share their opinion. The message that I take from this book is that if you are different, you can only find acceptance among those who think and look just like you. So much for diversity! I'm reluctant to share this book with my kids but may give it a try anyway since it could provide them with an opportunity for critical thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was appalled by the message of this book","review":"The overall message of this adorably illustrated book is that you will find acceptance only with others who are EXACTLY LIKE YOU. Many other picture books successfully tell the story of an animal who pretends to be someone or something else just to find acceptance and then learns that being himself is just fine after all. The book, WIDGET, comes to mind. In UNLOVABLE, no one learns a lesson, no one changes an attitude, no one even finds friendship that is based on more than appearances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.","review":"A girl's grandfather disappears, so she and some friends go out to the desert to look for him, where they are of course attacked by the Sandsquatch. The characters aren't sympathetic or interesting, and left me feeling pretty bored. This is very low budget, but I guess I can't criticize it for looking like a film school project, however it wasn't too far above those standards. The monster was rather cool looking, and moved in a way that gave it some menace. Overall it was good enough for a boring Tuesday evening or something, but I wouldn't expect much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, it IS a textbook","review":"Not the easiest read in the world. There is a lot of omission of terms and without a professor explaining the gaps, there is a lot of head scrathing involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sea Witch","review":"The Sea Witch is a wonderfully enchanting book. I picked it up and never put it down until the last page and it left me wishing it was a longer book! Ambrosia Lambert (the heroien)is a loyal, stong and fiesty female. She lives a double life of devoted daughter to her family and a privateer for her king. Her fight for the man she loves (Capt. Riordan Spencer) and the strenghth of will it takes to make this man except himself and her gave me a thrill that actually made my heart beat faster. The Sea Witch is a wonderful story that will leave you hoping that Ruth Langan continues this saga, so you can see what will happen with Ambrosia's two younger sisters and Ambrosia hersaelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"One satisfied customer","review":"I am very pleased with the product.

I snatched it up when the collection was printed but was sorely disappointed.The story is unfinished. Worse than that, the book is padded with pages and pages of the author complaining about the publisher.The story itself, about a race of gods interacting with humans is not even that interesting, certainly not as good as the creator seems to think it is in his pages and pages of complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ech.","review":"I had heard good things about Mr. Windsor-Smith's work when I read this, but I was extremely disappointed.Most of the editorials, instead of being funny or particularly interesting, are pages upon pages of the creator angsting about how horrible his publishers are.The comics themselves, are difficult to understand until you've read it at least twice, and the humor, supposedly 'adult', instead of being more mature is just a lot of perverted sex jokes that don't get into the more mainstream comics very often."},{"rating":"2","title":"hmmm what can I say","review":"Ive always been a big fan of the visual quickstart publishings, I first got onto the quickstart books with learning macromedia Flash and when I went on the hunt to find A new Reason book I look for a quickstart book.

However, the canning methods illustrated are outdated and potentially dangerous. For example, the book suggests creating a vacuum seal on jars by turning over the jars after filling.

I am keeping it because it was inexpensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a terrible cartoon show","review":"I usually love cartoons and own a ton of them, but this set of Aquaman cartoons is just terrible. It's hard to describe just how bad it is. Terrible stories, etc. I can imagine that you're a little limited because you're in oceans, but wow, it's terrible. The Aquaman character was much better as part of the Justice League series rather than trying to carry his own cartoon (hence the short lived series)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Charlie Tuna show.....","review":"Having seen this cartoon recently on Cartoon network, I Laugh at how bad it was. It was typical Saturday mourning stuff with both flat animation and terrible voice acting.I also saw Aquaman appeared on Smallville and the charater design looked really awful in live action form. It was a cartoon being adapted in the wrong visual medium. I really must say that the intelligence level of both DC Comics and it's fans must be very low, for liking this awful stuff , same goes for Warner Brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun, light reading","review":"it's like having a new, more detailed episode of their lives right in your purse. it was cool to see the girls go on a trip to nyc--and only partly because i live there. the other part is that they did some things that you know they couldn't have pulled off/gotten away with on the show. i like the concept, and the book was fun to read. i'll get the second one, too--they're cheap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess","review":"The novel seemed slightly exaggerated on Toni's part and William's parts were flat out boring.

I wasn't prepared for \\"Pacific Drift\\", it's easily going to be up there with my 5 favorite albums of the year. Nobody's blend of psychedelic influences (suprisingly for a young producer there are covers of The Zombies, The Monkees, Pearls Before Swine, The West Coast Pop Art Band) with West Coast hip hop beats is really unique. Very cinematic and very dreamy but there is virtually no fluff. I can see why people have made the influence-connection with this new CD and classic dreamy California pop bands like The Byrds and The Beach Boys. I'm a big fan of Postal Service and was blown away when I heard Jimmy Tamborello was going to sing on Nobodys album, what a great combo. The album also includes members of Beachwood Sparks, Dntel and a keyboard player from Mars Volta...more of my favorites all in one place - but with a definite new twist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I never liked flip flops before.

After a lot of reading about how to remove it everyone has their own suggestion with no real cure out there.

Also, the shoes do not make that awful squeaky sound when feet are wet. The best all around shoe for active people in and around the water.

I don't know if the strap is different material, or if it has been sewn differently, but wearing these gave me blisters and rubbed holes in the tops of my feet around the toes. I am not able to put my finger on exactly why, maybe because they were new, but in five days of wearing these on vacation, I never felt comfortable, and was often conscious of the discomfort.

We are definetly now die hard NCIS Fans. The charters are all top notch and we continually dispute who is our favorite because they are all just that good! We also enjoy the different episodes as they continue to find unique situations every week. I totally recommend buying the series on DVD versus trying to watch it weekly, even if you have it recorded. There is nothing better then watching it un-interrupted from season 1 on.

Not the book I intended to read by the cover and search criteria. I had hoped to find a book that would express in words what it is like to RIDE a motorcycle. Not to the store. Not on a good weekend with perfect weather. But a book about the open road and how a mtorocycle moves a person to peace and change in their lives.

She thinks a load of stuff on animals that is not absolutly true. I am not arguing on the shapeshfting part that is not totally bad (could be worse), but on some things this writer puts in the book that make you wonder if she actually does know animals as she claims she does and if she does know shapeshifters as she says...If you are not new to this argument and feel like separating the loads of dumb stuff from the usefull stuff it could be good, if you are new to this kind of topic,DONT BUY IT, buy something else or the author could put you on the wrong path and make you think things that are absolutly not true."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!!","review":"This book was so awful.

The author seems most concerned with the EXACT definitions to the types of shapeshifters, she spent way too long describing the details of what makes one an integrated, as opposed to non-integrated as opposed to hereditary as opposed to classical, physical bla bla bla . The voice of this book is so immature and insecure, like shes trying to make sure YOU know that she herself is a genuine shapeshifer.

This is a wonderful recording, with excellent singing, expressive playing, and vintage sound quality. For me, the ultimate Das Lied recording is the Klemperer on EMI, but this Reiner-led performance is in the same league. Both singers are admirable, the orchestra is superb, and the somewhat archaic quality of the recording adds to the poignancy and longing of the music. This release is a bargain at the price.

Musically it's the sort of soft synthesizerstuff from the 80s, but actually with lots of guitars as well, which results in a mixture of New Gold Dream-era Simple Minds and early Aztec Camera...Titles as \\"Two virgins tender\\", \\"The first picture of you\\", \\"When you look at boys\\" probably tell you something about what to expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a review","review":"I was just wondering if this is a genuine release or a bootleg.

Every fan here loves U2, but many ones think U2 is going down and down.

This is great album, not the rock album that Bono promised, but vintage U2. When Bono sings, \\"God I need your help tonight,\\" and Edge's soaring guitar explodes in Miracle Drug, I knew once I again I was listening to something special.

All opposite, this album is an exaltation of Bono's Rock Star , who almost can't sing, and still thinks he is 25 years old and he can do whatever he wants with his rough voice. The lack of musical risk is seen in all scope, bands clothes , Bono\`s hair and sunglasses , the recycled canned music from ATYCLB, the silly and unnecessary production, the excessive marketing campaign, etc. Despite all hype, the only thing U2 have obtained is the opposite effect, that is, more and more fans whom are waking up and stopping to adore unconditionally this sell out band wrongly called \\"U2\\".Happiness is a warm gun U2..."},{"rating":"1","title":"this was a worst album ever which had won the grammy awards!!!!","review":"All the song in this album was so terrible when i first listen to.

In most of the songs, Bono sounds tired...like he's an aging rockstar who can't quite hit the notes like he used to. A lot of the melodies are mundane and meandering while the lyrics are pointless. A lot of the music isn't distinct either. The Edge seems to be making up the guitar parts as he goes along on some songs and borrowing from bits-and-pieces of old U2 songs some of the others.There's a ton of piano/keyboards on this puppy...too much if you ask me. In fact, a lot of these songs sound more like B-side tracks. Very disappointing!. Where's the song-writing ability here ?Tired music, tired singing.

For what its worth.","review":"U2 is best known for making deep and complex alternative rock anthems, which makes this album a bit of a shock. They've gone as musically conservative as they can-- digging themselves inside the trench of modern rock and roll, putting on a helmet, and then firing like mad. If you're expecting 'U2 being U2', or- that is- expecting U2 to be creative, daring, and innovating like in past decades, then you will be disappointed.But none of this, as most musical critics seem to think, really makes this a 'bad' album. On the contrary, I would highly recommend it to pretty much anyone. This is 'every song is a potential single' music that will never get any real respect, but it should. The band has given a certain section of their fans what they really wanted: A classic rock and roll album. And they did a fantastic job with that mission in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, this is a bomb","review":"Dear Friends...U2 has been at the center of my favourite music for over 20 years.

It failed to do anything but put me to sleep. It is the same guitar sound over and over again with Bono wailing into the microphone. They have lost their ability to capture my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"another year, another contractual obligation","review":"It should have been called \\"All That You've Heard Before\\". One pumped three minute single to start the CD and a bunch of wallpaper to fill it out. While the completist U2 fan will want to add this to their collection, there are too many other great CDs out there for the rest of us to have bought this particular one. Although I haven't heard every last U2 album, this is easily the least of the seven or eight that I've heard. It's assembled all the trademarked sounds and peculiarities that fans have grown to expect but when an album provides all the satisfaction of tap water, sometimes being U2 is not enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"This decade is the worst for music ever!!!","review":"And could U2 save the day, no, they put out an awful album lack of any passion or selective taste.The biggest dissapointment in the history of U2, they might not have one after this.I can't see how anyone would go to a concert to see these songs played live."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful bait and switch","review":"The two singles are uncharacteristic of post-War U2 in that they rock most heavily.

Rather I'm gonna talk about Collector's edition.Don't expect an actual collector's edition ( if you're a Genesis or Pink Floyd fan then you really know what is a collector's edition ) cause it isn't. The \\"book\\" is just filled silly drawings. Not even lyrics nor photos nor history... NOTHING !!!. 48 pages of emptyness.The same thing happen with the filler bonus DVD. More and more commercials from a band who is lost and gone away by selling out to the i Tunes. Who need the same songs played twice ? why not more different tunes instead ?Shame on U2."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album, thanks","review":"The early release of the lead-off single \\"Vertigo\\" created an expectation in my mind that this would be a hard-rocking album of sizzling guitars and powerful vocals. What comes after that rip-roaring song is a carefully crafted, mature U2 album that is prettier and more open than expected. I think \\"Vertigo\\" created such a strong impression that it took me 2-3 listens before I could appreciate this album for what it is. And it's great! Thanks, U2, for another album worth waiting for."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe these talentless hacks upset Mariah at the Grammys","review":"Personaly, I was livid that U2 won five Grammys this year. Mariah Carey was poised to win ALL 8 awards but she walked away with only three. How can U2 win 5 Grammys for an album that wasn't even released in 2005? I'm sorry, but this is robbery. U2 have cheated their way to the top with an album of mediocre songs like \\"Vertigo,\\" \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own,\\" and the silly \\"A Man and a Woman.\\" A stupid album for gullible people. U2 did NOT deserve to win anything at the Grammys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal","review":"Dismal. Dismal.

I believe that he owes this debt to incredible luck - there has never been a singer so average and a lyricist so mundane that has ever made as much cash as Bono & his band. U2's previous album just about scraped the bottom of the barrel of banal, but this one has bottomed it.How to dismantle this aboninable bum? Stop believing the hype and stop buying this stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vertigo is a misleading single for this record.","review":"While this record isn't terrible, it is pretty bad for U2 standards. All songs here are mid to slow tempo and quite dull; none of the other 10 tracks have the energy that Vertigo has. Slow songs are not a bad thing, just listen to 'All That You Can't...', but the ones here are just plain boring. I miss the adventurous U2 of the early to mid '90s. In my opinion, this record has been grosely overhyped and thus it's kind of disappointing you finally get to listen to it. 'All because of you' sounds like a bad rip off of Bowie's 'Hang On To Yourself', 'A Man and A Woman' will put you to sleep faster than a Tool record. Guess all those 4 star reviews from Rolling Stone and the like really are nothing more than maintainace for a business relation.The stuff on the DVD is mostly worthless, a funny performance of Vertigo by Edge and Bono only, a couple other versions that aren't worth the price of this 'deluxe edition'."},{"rating":"1","title":"U2 gone washed-up","review":"For the long-time fan base: This a carefully marketed corporate product. This is not U2, all this is just hype, cover magazines, tickets, Grammy Awards, Itunes, MTV, radio airplay, etc.It is a put-on sellout \\"U2\\" sound delivered with arrogance and decadence to the art. Do not support this heinous offense not only music but U2's legacy too. U2 have become in 4 sellout emtpy men who are cashing in big time on teeny bopper's allowance money."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've been living underground, eating from a can","review":"3/4 of the album is filled with songs as bad as 'Grace'. 'Vertigo' for example, was a hit single, and a terrible one. Cheesy, terrible song with dumb as hell chorus and pseudo hard-rock guitar. What else need the band of the guys who have lost their talent years ago to get some attention these days?.This soup is whole dull and has the most horrible lyrics in Bono's life. When the announcement of a new U2 album rang through media outlets, a question emerged as to whether this was going to be their best album. Unfortunately, it's sad to say that this very well may be their worst effort.The only thing missing from this album, with the exception of some actual rocking from what used to be a pretty decent rock band, is a label on the cover saying 'Buy an iPod.' Give it another video before little iPods are dancing around as Bono cries for world peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Are the Old U2","review":"Hard to accept it, but U2 are so irrelevant now. They're a rotten band dying awfuly bad by their own marketing propaganda.Many desperate fans have said \\"back to Old U2 !!!\\", \\"back to their roots !!!\\", \\"classic U2 !!!\\", and things like that.But the truth is as follows:U2 was a rebel band fighting against the system.They had a white flag, three chords and the truth.The system had money, fast cars, power, greed and lies.U2 2000 have money, fast cars, power, greed and lies.We have a whitle flag and the truth.IN OTHER WORDS: U2 have become the same system they hated so much, and WE ARE the rebel U2.BACK TO WHICH ROOTS MY FRIENDS ? BACK TO WHAT ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"THEY COULD BE FINISHED!!!!","review":"The hype even fooled me!!!I really thought that they could release another great album after 2000's dissapointment ATYCLB, but sadly HTDAAB is even more disapointing, oh well better luck next time guys!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rattle & Hum 2004","review":"'How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb' is so dissapointing because its merely a rehash of former glories, they barely challenge themselves to create an original sound, something they strived to do throughout their 1990s peak.Since 1999 U2 have been too pre-occupied with being \\"the biggest band in the world\\", has opposed to the best. The songs on 'How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb' show that U2 are obsessed with getting their music onto US radio and making it grammy-worthy, and so a lot of the album comes over has bland and boring adult pop.If you are new to U2 or are only familiar with ATYCLB you may well love this album (i'm sure the Grammy's will) but has a dedicated U2 fan it merely sounds like an attempt to make a 'worthy' album that will appeal to the mainstream masses."},{"rating":"1","title":"How To Dismantle a Career","review":"Start by making a CD like this, and then ........................................................................................................"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock is Dead","review":"If U2 is the best that rock has to offer these days, rock must be dead. The band that gave us \\"Joshua Tree\\" and \\"Achtung Baby,\\" are surely dead. This album pushes no new boundries and wallows in mediocrity. A band that usually pushes the envelope of musical technique, continually re-inventing itself, into something of interest for its fans, has finally hit rock bottom. Bono and lads, please retire before you start looking like the fat Elvis."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sincerity and depth of the band rings out","review":"After a first listen of the \\"Bomb\\", my thinking was \\"this sounds OK, but the melodies are not very new or interesting and it sounds much like what they've done before.\\" But I've found this album to be the proverbial \\"grower\\" I've played it through about 5 times now, and find that the impact of the songs comes not so much through melody as through provocative lyrics and powerful and fascinating combinations of rhythm, sound and voice. This music is meant for the arena; it's meant to move hearts, and it does. I especially like \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\", an allusion to the Biblical parable of the beggar Lazarus who longed to fill his stomach from the crumbs that fell from a rich man's table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Collector's Edition a Mixed Bag","review":"I let my emotions get the better of me and picked this up at a local Target store. You should know that the CD contained within DOES include the 12th track \\"Fast Cars\\" not available on the regular US album. That's the good part. The bad part: NO LYRICS to the songs, and the book is really not that interesting at all. Some scribbled notes by the band members, no interesting photographs to speak off, very disappointing. I will let other reviewers get into specifics about the songs, which I think are a notch below \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" after 2 listens. Stick with the original album for less than ten bucks at Target."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired Hype","review":"U2 was, at one time, a force to be reckoned with. They had a sound and a message as well as the ideal that music could change things. On their last two outings, they have borrowed heavily from others as well as themselves. That's ok if you can do something new with it but these guys simply don't anymore. This is more a fulfillment to a contractual obligation than it is music. It's well crafted but ultimately empty and boring. Bono should stop trying to sing and go fulltime into his charitable pursuits."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the end, beautiful friend","review":"U2 is sold out. What more in the name of money, Bono ?. This album is the most safe and lame effort I've ever heard. I'm glad you won't come to Chile, because we don't want you with all that Ipod stuff you love. Shame on You Paul Hewson. Time to give up."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"The songs were great on the CD. The packaging leaves a lot to be desired, especially the CD being exposed in the sleeve. The booklet is a one time read and not very interesting.

Overall I am disappointed in the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"U2 are finished as musicians","review":"It's about time that people have wised up and see U2 for the joke that they have become. Despite This moronic CD was number 1 in the USA, surely most copies end up in the used bin after people hear how crappy it is. U2 are finished as musicians, no matter hype and all that bulls**t propaganda. They can't write decent songs anymore, period. As a fan pointed out, this garbage is just COPY-PASTE from ATYCLB. Plus Bono can't sing anymore. Shame on U2HTDAAB is the very proof that U2 are so popular that talent is no longer a factor. Straight garbage.

If you like being ripped off you probably bought the deluxe version for 35.00, and you got your money's worth. You waited around to get tickets to this tour but couldn't because some chick from Minnesota had faster fingers. Don't fret Irish loving music fans catch U2 on the Corporate Waste Tour with Papa Roach and Nickelback, and pretty soon you can buy a new version of this album only it has remix versions and a few studio throwaways that couldn't make the grade. Where is Zooropa when we need it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great with only a few low points","review":"I originally bought this CD just for \\"Vertigo\\" but after listening, the whole album was worth the money.

Simply put, HTDAAB is the most disappointing record of U2's strong, lengthy career.It suffers from Bono's weathered voice and many moments of their weakest writing ever. A lot of that has to do with Lillywhite's astonishingly uninspired production. However the sad truth is that this is an album dominated by filler tracks- all that 'A Man And A Woman', 'Original Of The Species', 'One Step Closer', 'Love And Peace Or Else', 'Yahweh', etc - and shows a band in need of a new wind.What does HTDAAB have to distinguish itself? Nothing at all.It's U2 by numbers. Each track seems to blend into the nest with nothing to grab the attention.The band sounds tired, the tunes have run out, the zest is gone. Even the packaging looks boring.I got hooked on U2 far before they became the corporate/money machine they are now.Listen to their incredibly under appreciated albums Zooropa and Pop instead. Rest In Peace U2, please!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unforgivable crap","review":"This pathetic musical effort is unforgivable. The main reason why I hate it is... Mr Paul Hewson, better known as \\"Bono\\".The truth is that Bono does not deserve to sing for this former great band anymore. He just plain sounds horrible. He simply cannot sing. Listen to \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" and then this... His voice is annoying at the least !!!.U2 should quit as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"All in all they're just another brick in the wall","review":"Zero Stars would be appropriate. Many of the folks who have spent their money on this are obviously interested in validating their purchase, which is fine.

Brianwashed posers whom try to be cool among their classmates, YES.This was the most horrendous U2 album I had ever heard! I apologized to my poor ears for putting them through the grief of listening to it. Really devoid of substance. Music is so lame and repetitive. It's ALL about the fashioned and overhyped name U2. Even critics seem to be brianless when they pushed this piece of crap forward. Bono can't sing, period.Please stop supporting this corporation. U2 2000 exemplifies how superficial and empty music has become.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"I had high hopes for this album with the return of veteran U2 producer Steve Lillywhite. However, I was sadly disappointed. There are maybe three good songs on this album. The rest are just unlistenable. All That You Can't Leave Behind was such a great refresher after the disappointing POP. While this album continues in the ATYCLB vein, it doesn't even approach the melodic or lyrical quality of that album. I'm glad I didn't waste any more money on concert tickets to see this stuff live!"},{"rating":"2","title":"just a note","review":"This is a great album. Yea, it is. I think the problem is that we are a little bit pampered by all the great stuff they have done before (Joshua Tree, War, Achtung Baby, Zooropa etc.). If HTDAAB was some release of some group we would give it 4 or 5 stars. It is not so common to record such album where all the songs are relevant."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't stop U2","review":"Once again U2 has made another great album. As Bono once said, \\"We will stop making music when we start making crap albums.\\" After listening to this album multiple times, I can happily say this is a great album. Is this album another Achtung Baby? No, but this album is full a great songs, good lyrics, and Bono hasn't sounded this good in a long time. The Edge's trademark sound rings clear throughtout the entire album. Like all great albums, this one requires a few solid listens to get wrapped up in the feel of the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all about song #7, girls..","review":"I like u2, but I was a little hesitant on ordering this album. I didn't really get into their last one, but I loved their 90's experimentation with great cds like Achtung Baby, Zooropa, and Pop. But I've heard this one and it's really good. I think it kind of takes the flavors of all the different u2 styles over the years. I love \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" and \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it On your Own\\" they should release them as singles. I used to love \\"Vertigo\\" but I've played it way too much. My favorite one by far though is \\"A Man and a Woman\\". Ladies, you'll love it!

This plastic album on the whole falls in the same bin as everything the group has released since All That You Can't Leave Behind.We want something new again, no more of the same thing. We are sick of All That You Can't Leave Behind. HTDAAB is apparently even more loaded down with pop stylings than their last one, and started to fall off the charts fairly quickly.Do you want us to love their most lethargic and tuneless record ever, just because it's their lastest album?

The songs are evidence of a rich men whom are over-the-hill, sitting on their cash, spending their empty lives aloof behind dark glasses, cover magazines (As Rolling Stone and Time), fast cars, posh reunions and drinks.Any REAL U2 fan should not accept this awful mediocrity. Enough said.There is no hungry passion anymore.

And this time for good reason. Steve Lillywhite in the producers chair for some songs and a great lead off single. Unfortunately, that single is the only good song on the album. I am a huge U2 fan, and am so dissappointed. What a waste of time and money. I guess it was bound to happen sooner or later. Maybe I should have known after Stuck In A Moment. Most bands are lucky to have released two or three good albums. For U2 to have released six or seven is impressive. But everyone is praising this album just because SL is on it.

In time, they really didn't and we came to understand that the Beatles were unique. But what U2 did become is the coooooolest band in the world. OK, the Stones are \\"bigger\\", but U2 are the coolest (they even have their own ultracool iPod). So what could U2, after more than 20 years, need to prove or experiment? This album is plain, good ol' , fun, kicking rock n' roll at it's best. The album does follow the stablished 1-2 of rock, that is release a great album (All That You Can't...) and then repeat the recepie (for example: Red Hot Chili Peppers-Californication-and then-By The Way). The end result is great. \\"Atomic Bomb\\" will not change music history, but it's good to know that Rock n' Roll is alive and well. Overall, it's one of U2s best albums, highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-album review","review":"My big complaint here is that Universal and U2 have released this collector's edition under the pretense that it contains more than what you'd get if you ordered the deluxe version with DVD or the regular album. What is not mentioned is that while the Collector's Edition does contain a few photos, poetry, and documents, as well as the DVD and a bonus track (Fast Cars), there are NO LYRICS and NO PICTURES that are available on the regular album or deluxe version. When I spend $40 +, I better darn well get the lyrics and whatever the regular album contains. Instead, I've had to buy the regular album to get the pictures of the band and lyrics, which is a basic requisite for any U2 album. Shame on U2 and Universal for doing that to hardcore fans!

It seems Bono is stuck in this pop phase. it seems the band wanted to break out into a more harder rock format and it was brought back to a more pop/rock format because of bono's songwriting nowadays.

There are only two good tracks on this album. \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"Sometimes you can\`t make it on your own\\", although the second is beginning to sound like a repetitive theme. Vertigo is excellent, original sound and production, when I first heard it I loved it, not even knowing it was U2. Great energy. U2 should be embarassed about putting out such a mediocre album. Doesn\`t anyone tell them, \\"hey.. that is not actually a good enough song to put out\\". I was in a band myself, sometimes a song was rubbish, and you just have to let it die. Not all babies are beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why this album won so many grammies","review":"I just laugh at the number of people who give this album 1 star and then question as to how it won so many grammies. Well below are your reason...1) This album is an absolutely wonderful album with lots of great melodies and songs. The sound of 4 people playing in a room doesnt get any better than this.2) People who vote for the grammies are musicians, producers and people who work in the music industry. Believe me, they know good music when they here it."},{"rating":"2","title":"New stuff, and it's ok...","review":"I'm a rabid U2 fan but I've gotta say, other than the 2 big singles this album is kinda just ok, not ho-hum boring ok, but just a nice regular offering from U2 ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor U2 they're stuck witch such contradictive fans.","review":"I am, like many who have reviewed this cd, a long time U2 fan and I must say this album is strong, its really only hurt by Bono's voice (a little to rough). Fans since the Joshua Tree have complained that U2 needed to go back to thier guitar drum etc sound. They complained that U2 were to experimental and needed to go back to thier roots.Well U2 has decided with thier past 2 albums to give fans what they wanted and what do fans say. Oh what happen to the experimental U2, I loved \\"POP\\" though of course that wasn't the tune they sung when that album came out. I say all of this because in the end if you like a more traditional U2 then this album is as strong as thier older material. It won't be recognized until years later when fans are crying about how they loved this album and hate the new stuff. In the end this album holds its own and should be a definite inclusion in your u2 catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vertigo","review":"The overall album is solid, but has anyone noticed that the chorus to \\"Vertigo\\" is virtually identical to the Supremes hit \\"You Keep Me Hanging On\\" - preview it on Amazon and compare the two songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"Just another great album from possibly the greatest music band ever.

It seems to me like having been recorded before the Joshua Tree, but as if they (Bono and co.) had to go through all the work from Joshua to ATYCLB to write such songs.I love it. It is not very good, it is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very moving","review":"I LOVED this album. It is nice to have an album you can listen to with your 12 year old in the car without having to skip over songs. It was a very positive and uplifting album.

This album for me actually earned the dubious distinction of being worse than ATYCLB, which was a distinction not easily earned.Listen to Achtung Baby or Pop, then listen to this, and you too will feel the pain of disappointment.U2 play it safe once again, and that's almost completely unrecognizable as one of the most innovative bands in the 90s.The whole albums sounds too mechanized. this is simply a weak carbon-copy of ATYCLB that doesn't manage to notch any major hits and ends up sounding completely unexciting and overly commercial.If you are a casual U2 fan and if you have a brain and you don't run to the nearest music store trying to get every new s*** promoted on MTV or Rolling Stone as \\"masterpiece\\" you will find this an insulting piece of unmemorable iPod crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ladies and Gentlemen: The worst of U2","review":"This is the worst side of U2, by Far.

That's the only way I can describe U2's dwindling career, topped off by this miserable release.it's all been said with this horribly concieved product. a complete waste of time. U2 are so wrapped up in their isolated commercialist metal bubble that they can't see how irrelevant their sound and image have really become.This album is so bad that it does not merit a worthwhile review.By the way, this is definitely NOT the return to their former glory. This is a desperate attempt to regain credibility and more brianwashed fans that they had won upon the release of All That You Can't Leave Behind.Please Bono, Edge, Adam and Larry -CHANGE YOUR NAME- you're disgracing the legendary status you worked so hard to get by putting out this freaked out, silly crap you call \\"U2\\".This album is dreadful and should be avoided at all costs, specially for the REAL U2 fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short and filler DVD","review":"I'm not going to review the album, I'm only going to review this \\"deluxe\\" edition.

But from there to say that \\"U2 has lost it\\"...there is a huge HUGE gap.I think that we are forgetting the fact that U2 doesn't need to sell records anymore...so I am assuming that if they are still together, it is mainly because they still enjoy making music and not because they are looking for the \\"easy way out of selling records\\".With that being said, I think that this is certainly not the best album from U2, but still it is a pretty solid album, very fun to listen and very enjoyable...specially considering that these 4 guys still can have fun and rock at the same time in their 40s.I would have given this one 3.5 stars...but since there's no such an option...I am leaning towards 4 stars... 3 is average, and U2 could be anything but an average band."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars","review":"The first time I heard U2 was when \\"New Year's Day\\" was on MTV constantly.

The Unforgettable Fire, The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby basically form the soundtrack to my life. U2 is truly the most important band to me. Having said that...How to Dismantle is by far the most lame effort they have made. I seriously want my money back. This is horrible. I can't believe they are trying to pass this off as any kind of credible effort. I thought that 'All that you can't leave behind' was a very commendable and relevant recording. It showed that they were still a band worth following. Well if their latest recording is the best they have to offer then they need to retire. It's like an all-star athlete who just can't quit so they end their career with several years of mediocrity. 'One Step Closer' is a good tune! That's it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"\\"Vertigo\\" is a decent song, with a hook in it. The rest of the album - I suffered through it once - is dispensible second-rate crap. U2 ceased to be anything original or even vaguely interesting a long time ago.Their synthesis of Patti Smith, Simple Minds, Public Image Ltd, Echo and the Bunneymen, and Bruce Springsteen became codified decades ago and the horrible crap they propogate as music is duller than Lawrence Welk ever managed to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this so-called \\"Grammy Worthy\\" CD","review":"Can someone explain how a once great band (see their CD's Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby) has the ability to win music awards based solely on their likability by the music industry, rather than the actual music produced?

However, I found the biggest difference was Bono. For someone who seems to have boundless energy and seems to be all over the world promoting his beliefs and political views, his energy is non-existent on this album; or shall I say, subdued.How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is like watching U2 live in concert with Bono singing from a Lazy Boy chair. The music's there, best the vocals aren't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland, uninspiring effort","review":"\\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" was a great comeback for U2, and their first consistently good effort since \\"Rattle and Hum\\". Unfortunately, the comeback didn't last long -- \\"How to Dismantle An Atom Bomb\\" is stale, formulaic U2-lite, rendered by a band that seemingly has run out of ideas.

Joshua Tree, Rattle and Hum, Actung Baby, Zooropa did that ample, Pop to some extent. This album and the previous, is a huge disappointment for me. I don't believe U2 would have made any new fans with this release.I loved Vertigo. None of the other tracks are even half as interesting, which makes it seem almost out of place.

No imagination, no new ideas, just recycling older material. Same lyrical treatment, same production skills. Some of their '90s albums even sound more modern.

In retrospect, what could the band have done to improve on what they have already released? The tracks here, short of Vertigo, are slow, ill-paced and repititous. Vertigo, the \\"iPod\\" single, is itself very repititous and meandering, although it does maintaint an upbeat presence missing on the rest of the album. This is an album for only die-hard U2 fans. Don't buy into the hype if you are actually looking for ongoing, listenable music. Try All That You Can't Leave Behind or The Joshua Tree as much better examples of what this band is capable of (even Pop is a better album than this)."},{"rating":"1","title":"U2 is better than this","review":"This is a decent album by general standards, but U2's least evocative work. This album is plain and forgettable compared to their other excellent work. There are several strong tracks, but the lyrical content overall is weak, and the musical content is nothing new from average pop rock. How has the studio sapped the emotion of such a great live band? If you are new to U2, check out Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is AWESOME...","review":"I received this on November 24, and it is just AWESOME. The CD is beautiful. Bono's lyrics and his voice are the most honest ever. Edge's guitar sounds great, and Edge's backing vocals on \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\\" is breathtakingly beautiful. This is my favorite track on the new CD--I lost my father to lung cancer in 1991, and the song says a lot--I thank Bono for his honest lyrics in this song.U2 has done it again, and they will continue to be the #1 rock group in the world--CD has already gone to #1 in 21 countries...next come the Grammy Awards, the Mtv Awards, the Billboard Music Awards, and so on...I also can't wait for the tour to begin...long live U2 and I will long be a fan of this group as I have been since 1983.U2 rocks-the-bono-freak (;"},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to it a thousnad times before attempting to dismanlte any bombs","review":"Lets all hope U2 doesn't end with this album.

Thinking it was just a preview of things to come, I was surprisingly disappointed. Tracks are mellow, too mellow, and made me want to fast forward to the next song until I reached the end of the CD. This is supposed to be a rock album? Doesn't sound like it to me. By far the best track is the opener, Vertigo, and Miracle Drug kind of grows on you but I can't say the same for the rest of the album. Let's just say that if any other band was releasing this CD, people's reactions would be far more restrained. Also, I felt ripped off that the lyrics weren't included and the special edition is not worth spending the extra money on unless you want to see an outline of all the band members' hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looses flavor.","review":"You know what?

Much like Bowie has done on his last two albums, U2 is now content with recombining sounds from their previous albums to create quality new songs. While this won't create anything spectacularly new, it's a fine way to keep up a long term career in rock. Most of the music here does evoke earlier songs (maybe too much with \\"Miracle Drug\\") but there are few misses here (\\"Yahweh\\" comes to mind as a failed song). The rockers here seem to do best, and \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" are top shelf U2. U2's adventurousness may be lost forever, but maybe adventurousness is for the younger bands. In their roll as rock statesmen, U2 are doing well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swinging to the music","review":"I am blown away by this album.Miracle Drug, City of Blinding Lights, Original of the Species, & Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own will go down as some of the greatest songs in U2's career. This album has all the ingredients of a classic U2 album - soaring epics, chiming guitar work, passionate vocals, deep themes. I would disagree with saying it's ATYCLB part 2 (It's better) It fits in well with all of U2's work and it sounds fresh at that. Another note: many of the songs I disliked at first have grown on me majorly - best examples = One Step Closer & Yahweh.Like most U2 albums this one will get better on every listen.(also make sure to download Mercy, it's a B-Side for the album but single quality)"},{"rating":"2","title":"RUN and pick up your copy","review":"Not as of the same caliber as Achtung Baby, HTDAAB is a balance of Edge's hard riffs and solos along side Bono's deep slower tracks.

Bono's lyrics seem somewhat contrived and his vocals lost in the mix.

Part of the reason may be in that the pre-release hype was that this CD would rock a little harder than the last couple of efforts. It doesn't. When I first heard Vertigo, I thought it was an okay tune, far from U2's best, but I still had hope for the CD. There are some better songs than Vertigo on the CD, but in all the songs are fairly weak. Most of the songs sound like they were rejected from early U2 albums. You can hear hints of earlier works in many of the songs, but they just aren't as good as the earlier works.The biggest problem with the CD is that most of the songs are overproduced. There is some good guitar, bass and drum work going on, but the solid musicianship is drowned out by too much irriating synthesizer effects, hallelujah choruses, and repetitive keyboard work. The end result is that I feel like I am listening to the soundtrack of a Broadway musical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did it all go wrong?","review":"What ever happened to U2? they sold out.\\"All that you can't leave behind\\" was not half of a bad album, although it was a bit poppy with \\"Stuck in a moment\\" and \\"Beautifull daY\\".Whats happening to music these days?"},{"rating":"1","title":"only one good song on the whole CD","review":"The only song worth anything on this cd is Vertigo other than that it blows!!

I'm sure FM radio will love it, but FM radio programming sucks.They aren't progressing with this album, just maintaining.

While I felt that ATYCLB was a huge sellout for them, they have truly recovered to create their most powerful and complex album in well over a decade. Songs like Vertigo borrow heavily from their 80's sounds of The Unforgettable Fire, and songs like All Because of You that sound straight from Achtung Baby. During a time when album stores are mostly lined with repetetive overplayed pop or rap music, it still comforts me to see U2 still producing albums that show people how music is really done, from the heart, not from the wallet..."},{"rating":"1","title":"U2's trademark","review":"there's something we have to face in that bono is a sub-par lyricist. he's written the same stuff over and over again that we (or at least I) can no longer believe that he still means it and/or has better materiel in him. when \\"the edge\\" pulls out the same crap, it's not a lack of ideas, it's \\"vinage U2\\". the straight fact is that this record is so boring, dull. this is trying to find the gem in utter mediocre dad rock when any judgement past mediocre would be lying to yourself. the people who like this album and the previous one are those that would shun \\"stuck in a moment\\" and a majority of ATYCLB as worthless if it came from any other band. the disaster that was ATYCLB is renewed here. when U2 dont rock out, they have little to say that isn't tired as hell. i can't even get through the entire album in one go.once the novelty of listening to \\"The New U2 Record\\" wears off, you're not going to be playing this one at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what they promised.","review":"This is'nt the album U2 promised so no wonder everyones so dissapointed, not to mention it is a bit dissapoiting.They've got one more chance to make\\"The old rock n roll U2 updated - sounding album.\\"and reinstall themselves as the biggest and best band in the world, and not just in popularity - I mean musically.And we better not have to wait 4 years for it!!!Besides they're not as young as they used to be.For U2s last \\"good\\" album check out \\"POP.\\" and don't buy this, its really a big dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"5-star reviews: written by U2's marketing team?","review":"Caveat Emptor: there's a general rule of thumb for reviews for this album: bad or medicore reviews are written by real people, as evidenced by the fact that they have written other reviews. (just click on \\"see all my reviews\\")In contrast, the 5-star reviews are brief and usually written by people who have written few if any other reviews. Hmmm. Very, very suspicious.It's also very odd that about half of the 5-star reviews are written by people with Hispanic names - and most with only one review written. Perhaps a massive campaign of propaganda and lies was off-shored to Puerto Rico or Mexico.Also these reviews consistenly refer to the band's 2005 tour, proving that U2 manager Paul McGuinness is saavy at cross-marketing. At least U2 is doing a good job of watching the bottom line.It's pretty sad that a band that was once one of the greatest in the world has apparently resorted to flooding Amazon with fake reviews.

U2 can left all their past behind, can leave all attempt to make music behind, all honesty, all messages, all activism, all passion, but the only thing they can't leave behind is MONEY.Many of these songs are clear signs that U2 are now long in tooth.I feel embarresed while listening to this new U2 album. This album is nauseatingly bad to anyone who knows just a bit about how to write songs and create music.If being a \\"U2 fan\\" means being a blindly adoring fanboy , I'm not a U2 fan.

In most of the songs, Bono sounds tired...like he's an aging rockstar who can't quite hit the notes like he used to. A lot of the melodies are mundane and meandering while the lyrics are pointless. A lot of the music isn't distinct either. The Edge seems to be making up the guitar parts as he goes along on some songs and borrowing from bits-and-pieces of old U2 songs some of the others.There's a ton of piano/keyboards on this puppy...too much if you ask me. In fact, a lot of these songs sound more like B-side tracks. Very disappointing!. Where's the song-writing ability here ?Tired music, tired singing. This is the laziest U2 album ever.Time to quit U2, really."},{"rating":"2","title":"full circle","review":"Worth the price of admission for \\"Miracle Drug\\" alone, Atomic brings noticeably more cohesiveness than the last album (worthy in its own right), and perhaps the most certainty of sound and word since industrial Achtung (albeit a much different message).Atomic resonates with the relevance of one rock band's journey come full circle."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mighty U2 Have Taken A Fall","review":"How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is a real bringdown for U2. Their previous CD, All That You Can't Leave Behind was a career highlight. Almost every song on that CD had a memorable melody. On How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, the melodies are few and far between.At the least the CD starts out strong with the high energy single Vertigo. Origin of the Species, Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own, and One Step Closer are the best of the rest as on the fourth listen their melodies stand out somewhat.However, the other songs are pretty forgettable. Yes, Bono sings them with some conviction and the Edge add some neat sepcial effects on his guitar. However, many of the pieces are a little too restrained and coupled with the limited melodies on his hour long CD, I would recommend passing on this collection.Get All That You Can't Leave Behind and Achtung Baby instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, whatever","review":"I have never liked U2 very much, and this album reaffirms why. The production on this album is just a mess, I am SO glad I didn't buy it. I would say that \\"vertigo\\" and \\"all because of you\\" are reasonable efforts, but I would never consider buying them, I just listen to them a bit on the radio. What an overhyped band!! If you want to check them out in a time when they made interesting music, get the Joshua Tree album. That is the only necessary U2 purchase in my book, besides maybe All That You Can't Leave Behind, except I think that album is pretty boring also, but not nearly as boring as this lame cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Playing it too safe.","review":"Well, the members of U2 have finally sold out by playing it safe and stopped being creative with their music in this new album. All the songs are tepid, weak and lack passion from their previous albums such as Joshua Tree and Actung Baby. I even liked their \\"Pop\\" album because I enjoyed the new direction they were taking with their music with touches of electronica and with a certain type of groove. This has all ended now and maybe it time for the band to retire at the South of France. I'm sorry I have played it twice and already I am bored!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New U2 fan's review","review":"I am a new U2 fan. I am young (14). I have heard thier hits from thier last CD. I decided to buy this CD since I new thier history and wanted to give it a try. I was glad. I was surprised when I learned that Vertigo was misplaced in this album. This album has great guitar riffs and great lyrics by Bono. Each song has its own meaning. Vertigo which is getting overplayed is a great song besides that. My other favorite songs are Miracle Drug, City of Blinding Lights, All Because of You . My least favorite was A Man and A Women and Yahweh, they are still ok songs just my least fovorite. I just found that song dull. This CD does have some flaws but it is sitll a solid album from a great band. I will start buying some of the older U2 albums that way I can see the progressing over the years.And to the reviewer Myles J. Burke: Yes I will listien to this CD in a year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"U2 tired&Predictable","review":"I use to really dig U2 back in the day,but somewhere in the early 90's U2 got into this Over the top type of Music Making which distance themselves from the Good Songwriting they use to present back in the 80's. they have become so contrived&now they are like a Act that just shows up in Name only.this album is Average at best. not a single knock-Out cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"ATYCLB\\", part 2.","review":"After about 90 listens now, I find this to be another solid U2 album. What I notice most about it, is that it really reminds me of the last record, \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\", which I guess makes sense. Specifically, \\"Vertigo\\" seems to be the \\"Beautiful Day\\" of this album, and \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\", sounds like this records \\"Stuck In A Moment\\", etc. However, this is not a bad thing, as the last album was excellent. What keeps this from being a 5-star release, is the few tracks I consider to be really good filler, and not \\"wow\\" songs. In short, this album is easy to sum up: the U2-haters can pass on it obviously, but the U2-lovers need it like the rest of their releases, and most will consider it to be the \\"Bomb\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same crap","review":"Maybe you 5 star people like wasting your money on such a crap album but how many times are you going to listen to it?. There is nothing on this album that you haven't heard before.

The hits are great but there are some other songs that keep playing over again in my stereo of a brain, for example Crumbs and One Step Closer. And anyone fortunate enough like me to see them live in concert should consider themselves lucky!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It...This CD Is Awful For Lifelong U2 Fans","review":"I absolutely love every single U2 CD in different ways from October to ATYCLB - which was a relatively average CD as well.U2 have become charictures of themselves; sappy, aging, souless music industry veterans and the last of the great arena bands that are becoming as tired and predictable as the Stones have been for the last 15 years.Achtung Baby was the last truly inspired U2 release, although Pop and ATYCLB had it's moments.Atomic Bomb falls flat on it's face, why it has drawn the popularity it has escapes me. I don't even want to go into the song list and pick it apart and come-off as a bitter old, pretentious U2 fan - because I'm not - although I am a bit bitter because I never thought I'd see the day U2 lost it."},{"rating":"1","title":"U2 is dead...","review":"...but the old spirit now lives in Jon Crosby's band \\"VAST\\".

This now 20 years later and they have decided to strip down and do a rock album. This is one of the things that appeals to me. The sound is more raw then it has been in years, their playing is on the top of their game. Sure the writting is not Bono's best and it's not political or sociall concious. I think they were going for a straight rock and roll album. The song does get a little more on the religious side, All Becuase of You and Yahweh, than in the past.With that being the case this is one of their best albums (the only realy really terrible one being Pop). I would recommend this album to any U2 fan. My favorite song on this album is the one that everyone has been panning. Love and Peace or Else great blues riff with interesting textures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album of 2004?","review":"I don't know about all that, it gets great competition from the likes of Franz Ferdinand \\"Self-Titled\\", Interpol \\"Antics\\", and maybe Velvet Revolver \\"Contraband\\" gets some consideration. But even if \\"the bomb\\" is or isn't, it still is evidence that U2 have the skills good enough to make great music, which pleases Edge-Clayton-Mullen. It is also enough for U2 to hold on to the title of biggest band on the planet, which pleases Bono."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn good!","review":"This is a top notch CD. Unfortunately, there are many sad people here posting under fake accounts just to wail on this CD. Especially Roberto Diaz who is really GDB posting under another alias. He will be nailed shortly for account abuse. I've been watching this group for a while and there's one loser continuously posting under new accounts. IP tracking will be requested shortly.All Because of You -- a great rocker which has gotten a lot of airplay.Vertigo -- A FUN rocking song that most people will like if they lighten up a bit. :)Yahweh -- A simple, catchy, straightforward hymn to Bono's God. I always appreciated his open spirituality, even if I don't believe the same things he does.Crumbs from Your Table -- That funky chord they use and the rolling, rocking hooks. Wonderful tune.Miracle Drug -- Sounds like something from Boy and I can't get enough of it.Yes, this CD isn't perfect, however, it is NOT even close to being a 1 star effort like the lamers here are trying to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"To mainstream, to crap and to much nonsense.","review":"It seems all that talk was for nothing.So much for all that \\"best album ever\\" talk.Thats why many are'nt buying this (Literally!)But for many its to late - how could U2 settle for this, and I'm still finding it hard to beleive it took 4 years for them to bring this out.They sound to much like they are trying to sound to much like themselves from back in the earliear 80s, without it working and as for the less louder tracks, well they are just bland and unexciting.Sorry but its the truth - everything they did up until here was great and even the less gooder stuff was alright, but this is just a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"U2 fans... two different camps","review":"After \\"ATYCLB\\" and now this new disc I'm convinced there are two different types of U2 fans. There are those who came to U2 from a punk/alternative/experimental camp... the people who still want to hear new bands today like Franz, Interpol, Secret Machines, etc. Then there are those U2 fans who got into them by hearing their songs on Top 40 and Classic Rock radio. People who are generally satisfied with anything spoon fed to them.I can see no other way how it's possible any U2 fan who got into them for their intensity, fire and creativity can honestly care about this music. I don't know what is more depressing, so many fans fawning over milked-over mediocrity or actually hearing the guys in the band talk so strongly of this work (truly, it is WORK listening as well).

However, when I heard vertigo, I thought I would give this album a try. After putting it into my car cd player though, I almost died in a car accident because the album bored me to sleep.

How about No Hum?","review":"Once upon a time, you could count on U2 to give you 6 or 7 decent tracks on a new cd or record, 3 of which were brilliant, and 1 that amounted to a timeless gem (for example, \\"New Year's Day,\\" \\"Bad,\\" \\"One Tree Hill,\\" or \\"One\\"). On this new cd, you can count zero gems, nothing brilliant, and 2 decent tracks (\\"Vertigo,\\" and \\"Yahweh\\" if you can overlook the Jesus reference). A pattern has emerged: ATYCLB and HTDAAB demonstrate the lack of (and need for) propulsive bass lines and strong vocals (which Bono seems to have lost forever). Sadly, the Edge's reemergence on HTDAAB (after having gone missing on ATYCLB) isn't enough to merit repeat listening of the new cd. And so HTDAAB provides little reward for the waiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"What a letdown! The pre-release reviews and the marketing hype had led me to believe that this release harkened back to when U2 was a rock band and played accordingly. Unfortunately, the now overplayed Vertigo is the only track on this release that lives up to the hype. Much of the release is given over to Bono's sensitive side and his need to embrace humanity (which is a separate subject and worthy of extreme praise). I just wish he would separate his role as rock and roll lead from his other agendas. Maybe Henry Rollins was correct when he said that U2 has become a band old people who forgot how to rock listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY?","review":"Why is this band even relovent anymore?

I've got 'em all, and I can't think of any that I don't like something on. On this one, I really like \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it On Your Own\\" (though it could use a shorter title.) Trouble is, I don't really like much else on this CD. Vertigo is okay, but not great.Of course your mileage may vary, but this is not one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!","review":"Listening to the singer is worse than listening to a screeching baby. The guitarist is boring. The drummer is merely competent. The bassist sucks.There are no redeeming qualities to this album. Please do not allow them to think what they do is good.

So I was expecting a louder edgier guitar sound to it with heaps of \\"mega\\" tracks, and some straight forward sounding songs as well....................I just am really dissapointed........you should be to.......enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"HEY! They Made Another ACHTUNG BABY!!","review":"WOW! thats all i can really say, i mean WOW! this album blew me away from the first count in \\"Vertigo\\" to the last note in \\"Yahweh\\". Honestly, next to Achtung Baby, this is U2's best album.Especially love the song \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\". Bono puts the same emmotion into that song as he did for \\"One\\" or any of the acoustic versions of \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" i have seen them play. Defineately the best track on the album.Lets not forget, U2 has given us 4 Immortal albums that will last forever, I would say this was the 5th. I only hope that the band can keep up with themselves in the future!"}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],H={key:0},M={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",H,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const N=d(x,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-05e911b4"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/30.md","filePath":"library/30.md"}'),j={name:"library/30.md"},P=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(N)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
