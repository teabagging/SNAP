This book focuses on the cultural and political world in which McKinley rose to prominence and won the presidency. In doing so, Phillips makes a compelling argument that McKinley has not been given a fair evaluation by historians.If the late 1800's and early 1900's is a period of history less familiar to you, then this book will leave you wanting. I think this book assumes some familiarity with the period and is designed to enhance your knowledge and understanding of the important figures of that fascinating time.Overall, I felt the purchase was well worth the money and the time spent reading the book - both of which are relatively small."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor representative of the series","review":"I agree with other reviewers who found this book to be hard to follow. The reason for having a series editor is to ensure consistency across the volumes. Three others in the series were well written and insightful, so I was hoping for an enjoyable account of the life of this poorly known president - arguably the \\"first modern president\\". Unfortunately, I gave up half way through as I simply could no longer follow the narrative. I have full-length biographies of all the \\"important\\" presidents through Truman and have used this series to fill the gaps (W. H.

Usually books have a somewhat linear approach to writing, instead this author chose to discuss one point, jump eight points then go back to the first.For people who want to read the President Series, and are excited about Presidential History, please do not be discouraged from reading the other books within the series - I recommed the one on Warren Harding.

In a nutshell, this volume is more documentary and less bio. The chapters are full of good information but tends to be overly repetitive. Most disappointing for a biography is the fact that this president was ASSASSINATED!!! The author completely ignores this event. You would think one or two pages if not an entire chapter would be dedicated to this event. This was my first read about McKinley and while I am left feeling more impressed about the man and his time in office I would have liked to be better informed about the circumstances of his life, family and unfortunate death.

His goal with this book isn't to sketch in McKinley's life but to argue a thesis. His thesis is that McKinley was a important president, and the thing that makes him important is that he illustrates Phillips' career-making mega-theory about realignment politics. It's a campaign strategist's view of history.Phillips doesn't seem to have consulted any primary sources at all. We get a lot of \\"he must have reflected\\" stuff, and assertions that McKinley deliberately wore a mask of conventionality, and that his blandness was a conscious strategy, etc., with no attempt to demonstrate the historical validity of any of it.Still, there is some good stuff about Ohio's political centrality in the post-Civil War era, and a very good summary of the gold-silver debate, which was a matter of passionate interest in the 1880s and 1890s but is so baffling to modern Americans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much politics, too little McKinley","review":"I have read 18 of the books in this series, and this one is by far the least satisfying. Most of the other volumes maintain a balance between the personal life of the president, and his administration and policies. Phillips leans so heavily in the latter direction that I hardly felt I knew anything about the man himself. And can you imagine a book about an assassinated president that contains NO ACCOUNT of the actual crime, and not even a mention of the assassin? Phillips was too busy trying to raise McKinley's sagging reputation (especially in relation to his successor, TR) to give us more details about his life, family, and untimely death. I learned a lot about tariffs, the gold standard, and our relationship with Britain, but not much about McKinley."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Flower of Life to Rebirthing","review":"A bookend companion volume to Bob\\"s first book\\" Nothing In This Book Is true, But It's Exactly How Things Are\\" (15th Anniversary Edition), this book completes the learning curve about our purpose for being here and where we are going as well as how to effectively deal with our everyday life and emotional trauma's.

DeFilippo's success here is in the details---the fustian prose echoes that of the 19th century, as does the fiery libertine poetry, while the characters never quite lose a certain postmodern knowingness, a glint in the eye as it were.Alas, he never seems to weave these details into a memorable story. Two days after completing it, and \\"Hottentots\\" (the second of the three stories comprising the trilogy) is receding in my memory.

I read through the first story, \\"Victoria\\" with rapidly dwindling interest. Only because I felt it unfair to judge the book on less than half of the read did I bother reading through the second story, \\"Hottentots\\" which is no better (and in many ways worse) than the first.Steer clear of this one.

He had a shaky hand, did not lay down straight lines, and his lines never connected (a no-no in pinstriping.)Also his designs were never symmetrical. A five year old could have done what he did. I have never seen anyone use as many dots in their pinstriping as he does. We know a few good pinstripers like Von Hot Rod who would be a much better candidate to learn from. My honest opinion do not buy this video it is a waste of money and won't teach you the correct way to pinstripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Teaching Text","review":"I'm using this anthology for the poetry seminar I teach at a private high school in the Bay Area. I'm finding it to be the best anthology thus far for this generation (I'd use it for college students as well). The previous reviewer has offered a very comprehensive overview, so I'll just echo the sentiments expressed there. This text makes poetry accessible without dumbing it down. His introduction is also very provocative in terms of pointing out the potential racist, classist, and sexist implications of teaching only the \\"cannon\\". My students are thrilled to see a text that contains Frost AND Tupac. I'm using this anthology with Western Wind: An Introduction to Poetry (a more academic, but radically exciting approach to poetry), and I think that these two texts together make the ideal combination (with supplimentary handouts of other poet's poetry as well)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST!!","review":"I used this product at my gym and am now deployed to the Middle East, I just had to have it to work out with out here, it's perfect for some good quick cardio and your arms will thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth buying","review":"one star for shipping and 0 for quality.. wont buy putco again..the after market parts they put out are way to expensive an wont fit..i buy lund now"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Addition to PBA","review":"I purchase this PBA for a trip to Europe.

Using Vista, I was able to find the device, but the mapping software had constant issues with connecting to it and using it. I did end up using GPS Gate, and this resolved the issues that I was having. I also got the CF adapter, which is great for using the GPS in several applications.That being said, the device is nice. Once I got around the technological issues, I have been able to use this device without any issues. One odd thing, if you leave the device on and do not connect to use it, after a while the bluetooth goes into a stand by mode where you can not connect to it. You just need to turn it off and back on, and since it is a \\"warm\\" start, the GPS fix is almost instantaneous.I have not really got a chance to try out the battery life yet.-Matt"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"It's horrible because there's no guitar tablature.

However, for the sake of other consumers, I must say that it isn't flawless. Some of the songs are awesome (\\"Safety Dance\\" and \\"Moonbeam\\") while others can be pretty annoying (\\"Hey Men\\" and \\"Where do the Boys Go?\\"). You generally can't find many albums which have a perfect set of songs, so don't be discouraged to buy this album. I love Men Without Hats, but I still don't like those two songs which I mentioned above. If you like this type of music (New Wave, Dance), then I highly recommend this to you.

Having found this album in a rental car I decided to give it a spin and let me say that for the most part it gives 80's music a bad name. Synthesisers, cheesy vocals and vocal ballads are expected from good 80's music but for the most part this album misses the mark. The Safety Dance is stil a fun song that will bring a smile to your face but the rest of the songs just don't cut it. They aren't catchy, they aren't fun and they aren't worth getting.Bottom Line: If you want The Safety Dance im sure it can be on numerous 80's compliations that are much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"MEN WITHOUT HITS","review":"I loved \\"The Safety Dance\\" and \\"Pop Goes the World\\" back in the eighties! but that's all.

It took me twice as long to read this book as most other books do. I found myself reading and re-reading the early parts of the book. Loeb seemed to me to drift in the early chapters, heading in directions that seemed incongruent. I think the book would have been just as good if it were about 100 pages shorter. The last chapters of the book, from the chapter about burnout on, were very good.However, having waded through it, I found the message that Loeb was trying to get across hit home with me. While I would not consider myself inactive, I would also not consider myself an activist. Paul Loeb has inspired me to become more of an activist. To find a cause that is most important to me and take a stand. If you are not active now, this book can be the spark to ignite your fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible experience!","review":"I LOVED this book! I just finished it and thoroughly enjoyed every word. I loved the way it made me feel--far from hopeless, but inspired, renewed and invigorated. It was philosophical yet practical, and I now somehow have the feeling that even doing a LITTLE to improve the world, is doing a lot. It's strange to read something and actually feel like a \\"better person\\" for having done so! I've never had that happen before. I feel better for wanting to become more active, better for being as active as I already am, (even though it isn't nearly as much as I'd like it to be,) and better for wanting to share what I've read with others. This book, which was a gift to me from a dear friend, will now be a gift FROM me to many deserving people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A non-academic book for the baby boomer generation","review":"As many other reviewers I was asked to read this book as a part of a college course. My wife was recently assigned the reading in her MSW program. I do believe it has some value, but to a specific generation and type of activist. The book rarely (if at all) discusses a model of activism outside of that born from the peace and love movement of the 60-70s. If you are from these eras, by all means this is the book for you. If you are or will soon be a college student you will likely find little to connect with in the book. I suspect that its over use in courses at this time is a result of faculty promoting a book they feel applies to them greatly without thinking of how it applies to younger generations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Good Stuff - But a Bit Highhanded and Critical!","review":"The stories of the actual activists are excellent and the highlight of an otherwise unremarkable book. Much of the time Mr. Loeb criticizes others for their point of view and offers little in the way of constructive alternatives. Mr. Loeb was a guest at our University recently and his verbal rehashing of the book material did little to change my mind. This is not to say the book has no merit, just that his approach left much to be desired and in no ways aids the burgeoning activist remain committed - as is implied in the title. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great topic but more of the same,tired rhetoric","review":"Started the book with great promise. It is certainly a timely topic. And I agree with his premise that everything is impossible until someone takes the time to confront the issue. However, it becomes mired down with stereotypical examples of community activism. Thank God small groups of students from Ivy League schools exist to eliminate all the worlds ills. Generally, college student groups are not what I consider sources of great intellect and fact. There is an agenda. Hence the group. In my fifties, I appreciate their energy but question the content. Loeb gives great credit to these groups from the abolishment of Apartheid to the cure for the common cold (okay, my words, not his). And in writing this, I fall into his definition of cynic and can therefore be dismissed.Some of his examples were well thought out, but so many more were just too formula for me. I finished about half the book, and will go on to something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little More Than Stories","review":"While Loeb's work certainly demonstrates his dedication to service it lacks critical examination. Loeb repeatedly cites examples of amazing service and highlights compassionate people but fails to push his readers to think about the theoretical pieces behind the actions. Without critical analysis there is no reason to take this work serious. Additionally, Loeb entirely ignores working class people and the roles that they can play in service. The work is naive and generally fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"tired of it","review":"Must we indulge yet another collection of tripe in the guise of self-help?

You can read it a few hours later after you've snuck that man past your sleeping children's doors and out to his car, and feel good about yourself and how wonderful a person you are for reading something like this.For the rest of us that live with a real sense of morality, well, we know books like this are just excuses - a mechanism by which the anointed democrat leftists sanctify themselves.

I am a student entering university, and this book was assigned as reading that would be discussed in focus groups at the beginning of the year. Unfortunately, this book did not provide entertainment through its intellectual means, but instead family members chose random passages throughout the book that the whole family would act out and laugh histerically at!While many of the sentences on first glance may seem provocative, they are almost entirely meaningless; devoid of any content.I have never read something composed of such pretentious, pathetic bile, nor had anyone in my extended family. Its psuedo-intellectualism insults its readers, and is a complete waste of time.Do not buy this book; you would find more intellectual stimulation by watching two obese people tearing off each other's clothes on the Jerry Springer show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Immersed in His Own Political Opinions","review":"While Paul Loeb's message about serving others has some merit and valid points, it is hard to distinguish them from his own political opinions. Readers that do not identify themselves as a hard-core Democrat will have a hard time identifying with his point of view. He seems to spend more time complaining about the work of George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, and Richard Nixon than he does offering solutions to making this world a better place. So, unless you are a liberal, stay away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Welcome Recipe for Improving Our World","review":"This book offers solid, informative, practical advice on how to be better citizens and better people. It also offers hope at a time when many Americans feel helpless about so much of what is going on in our country--natural disasters, mounting federal deficits, rampant commercialism, and much else. Loeb forces us to examine ourselves (if we truly pay attention to what he is saying) and to see how we can make a difference. Very important, he lets us know that the actions of single individuals can have a broad effect.Paul Loeb is a national treasure.

The authors know of which they speak. God's acts, covnenants, messages and colers are for our benefit while those of the Devil exist to confuse, confound and to separate us from God. we are pawns in a battle being waged by the fallen ones. This is a very good book but it falls short because the authors speak of this as the first book and it being only a taste of the whole proverbial pie."},{"rating":"1","title":"find another book","review":"I had hoped for a scholarly book on the Nephilim, instead I got one chapter on that subject and a diatribe on the how that author knows the mind of God.

The authors' focus is not only about devils and demons; they also cover topics from the Bible's Hebrew origins, to the understanding of covenant, the Jewish Feasts, as well as a refreshing look on ancient mythology. What's more, they profide great historical and scriptural evidence to support their views. I was appalled by Miss Edith Bottom's review. Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but she obviously never read the book! I would highly recommend this book to all my friends! Buy it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Devils and Demons and the Return of the Nephilim","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and thought the authors did a very good job and even touched on some subjects that I myself recognized and they expanded on it even farther. It only has one chapter on Demons and Nephilim, which I regretted and they keep mentioning a second book which is disconcerting as it alludes to having even more information on the subject of Demons and Nephilim. I hope they do produce it.On a seriouse note- I do feel they are in error as far as there not actually being a new covenant!! Please read Hebrews 9:15 +/- all of chapter 9 talks on the subject of the old and new covenant and that Crist died for the new to be accessable to us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the second book?","review":"I loved this book.

Please tell me what the next book is called so I can get it.Also,....to repeat a point. This book was definitely mis-titled. It did get my attention though, and bought the book because of my interest in the Nephilim. I am disappointed in the fact that there was very little info about devils, demons and Nephilim, but was still engaged in the book, as it is full of great info about the Hebrew traditions and God's covenant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Was Expecting...","review":"This book, while it does contain some insightful information, is not the best ever written. Within the first thirty pages, the authors contradict themselves two different times when discussing languages. Their choice of dialogue lead me to believe this book is geared for a specific audience: Children. Their language and audience perception is geared very low, and has remnants of a middle school text book. Throughout the book, they lean more towards a conservative Christian perception of the subject with each page.I was hoping for an unbiased overview, not someone's opinion on how God sees Nephilim, or a lesson in languages and comparisons. I guess I'll have to keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangeous Ppl Should Be Ignored","review":"This book is a vendeta against poor, deformed children who are born with an extra finger.

The author is married to an Ecuadorian woman and has lived there for well over 20 years now, and he obviously loves the country. I found the sections on history, geography/ecology and culture/customs quite useful as a starting point. But then, he splashes cold water all over the reader with his sections on crime and health/medicine. He makes even a short visit to Ecuador seem like the most perilous possible journey -- if you don't die from some tropical disease, you surely will be mugged, robbed or murdered. In effect, he seems to be saying \\"Gringos! Keep Out!\\" Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inappropriate Practice","review":"This sample test had many typos and incorrect answers.

I saw that M&S made a retrofit unit and bought the DMC3-4 system to modernize the intercom. It has been very disappointing. The music quality is much worse due to the fact that the speakers are tiny compared to the original system. The sound reminds of a cheap 1970's transistor radio. We have also had a lot of problems with \\"squawking\\" noises and other types of noise interference that has made this system not very usable. The tech support from the company is very limited. They blame the existing wiring but offer little ideas or help on how to troubleshoot. I think the engineering quality of this product is very poor and I would not recommend this system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not better than your working old intercom","review":"I purchased this unit to replace an old 1974 intercom in my home with 12 speakers. To my surprise the old unit was many times better in sound quality of music and voice. It was difficult to install due to the connectors on the master unit. The tuner picks up a 1/3 the stations the old unit did. AM is specially bad. What a shame with all the modern technology we can't make a unit that is at least comparable with 1974!Another thing to keep in mind is that if you have at least 4 conductors in you home, use them and don't go with the 3 conductor setup. If you do, when you make an intercom call you can't listen in after the call, so the person receiving the call has to walk to the speaker to answer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult System","review":"The M&S audio systems are VERY problematic. Installation is no problem but if there is a service problem with the system, it is very difficult to get it repaired. The company relies on regional jack-of-all trades companies to do the repairs. In my region, a security alarm company is assigned the task of service but they really don't put much effort into knowing the system. Thus, after purchasing a new audio system from M&S two years ago, I've had five service calls from the alarm company and the system still doesn't work. M&S claims they are symathetic but they are not willing to do anything actively to help me. I'm ready to junk this system because of lack of technical know how once the system is in your house."},{"rating":"1","title":"M&S Speaker Systems","review":"It is impossible to use!

Taking a tip from an earlier reviewer I downloaded Foobar which has a dynamic rang meter. I also have a remastered version from about 1997. Comparing the two the SACD version is seriously compressed and clearly inferior. Compression squeezes the life out of the music and all so that it will sound as loud as the last compressed cut just played on the radio. The 1997 version also has some tracks with light compression. I am going to try to find a 1985 release version. The loudness wars are ruining most CD releases. Too bad manufactures aren't required to print the dynamic range on the package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Album in 5.1","review":"Simply a must have for your SACD collection!Highlights for me:\\"Why Worry\\" Sounds like the backing vocals are in your living room.

The illustrations are bright, colorful and charming for reading aloud or simply browsing. Children are reminded that it's okay to be different, no matter what their differences or similarities. While tolerance of others is one of the themes, self-acceptance is the most important message. This is a great book for showing that differences are perfectly fine and acceptable. The book does not reek of politically correct messages as much as it comforts us that being different is just fine. I, as an adult, liked myself a little better after I read it the first time. I think children will feel the same way.A friend of mine took the book to read at her local children's hospital where it was a big hit with the patients who often feel very different.

This book gets down on the floor with children and talks to them at their level! With its basic theme and big, bright pictures, Todd Parr's \\"It's Okay\\" is a fun read!I've talked many times in my children's classrooms about disabilities and adoption. I am a strong advocate for teaching children about diversity and that it is okay when someone else isn't \\"exactly like them\\".

One of the other books, The Wife by Meg Wolitzer was among the prized company it was in. Therefore, I thought this book would be of that ilk, written in the same high standard but boy was I mistaken.The plot was ridiculous, the reading level was Junior High and there was no character development at all. I wasn't even cheering for Kennedy because I didn't respect her and didn't see what this great chemistry between her and Declan was all about. This book was a total waste of my time in every sense. You are suppose to come away from a book learning something. For me, it passed the time on a long train ride, that's about it.

This is a wonderful book -- very funny, completely involving, with characters who feel like people you want to know.

If you're dying for good fluff, the novels of Jane Green and Jennifer Weiner are much more enjoyable, or if you want a story of marriage and motherhood that's not only fun to read but has some true insight, try Allison Pearson's I Don't Know How She Does It: The Life of Kate Reddy, Working Mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but would go for higher quality","review":"This product is OK if you're not picky about your bras.

The enemies are relentless, the ammo supply is just barely adequate, and the music chills the spine.

Here, you have dozens of bullets.So, where's the difficulty? In two things:1-Instead of a headshot, zombies require a FIXED number of shots to go down. That means, a unarmed zombie will take 2 shots to go down, an armed one 4, and so on. Also, it doesn't matter where you shoot him- you can shoot him between the eyes or in the belly, but it will ALWAYS require two shots to go down.2-But that still wasn't enough difficulty for the designers. So they decided to surround the player with zombies. That's right, even when you are in a tight hallway, the designers will find ways to throw zombies where you are not lookin'- zombies will fall down behind you trough holes in the roof. And they don't make any sound! Amazing! So a 200kg fatass or a 80 year old lady can jump down behind you without making ANY sound like some kind of CIA operative in a secret mission.Not fun.

It had no problems sinking the 2\\" brads I used. I installed window and door trim with it as well. No jams, misfires, etc.I did use Bostitch brads and would recommend that you only use them.

The tv will not come out of standby mode and I can't get it to turn on to save my life.

The HD channels are nice, especially for live sporting events, however there aren't enough true HD channels out there yet. These LCDs are still quite heavy and you need a haning device the size of TX to hang it from your wall. I'm going to stick with my large and very heavy CRT.

After talking to Toshiba, I had an authorized tech out to check it. He voltmetered one connector on the main panel and said the board on the LCD is bad but they don't make that part so you have to replace the whole panel. The panel is not cost effective to replace since a brand new set will cost just as much. Toshiba would not offer any financial assistance whatsoever after speaking to a supervisor. They said the set is too old.Bottom line- if you are going to buy this TV get an extended warranty. A TV this expensive should last more than 16 months.

In all the accounts I have read, I have never heard of Toshiba even caring about their tv problems. The Toshiba tv was fairly expensive too, approximately $ 1800.00 at the time.

While I don't expect everything I listen to to be happy, I would at least like a little hope once in awhile. Mr. Judge can't say anything positive unless it is said sarcastically. It's a shame because he's such a clever, witty guy, but come one! -- get some prozac or something.I do have a theory that perhaps the intent here is to be so over-the-top depressing that he is parodying gloomy artists; that this is really black humor, poking fun at doom-sayers.

Also, there are no health packs to grab during the game, so if your health is running very low and the game is automatically saved at a checkpoint, you must start that area with a low health score, finding it near impossible to finish the level you are at.One of the levels had a choice of a sniper rifle, which took forever to reload, and didn't give the option of a manual reload which meant if you were getting fired upon, you would likely die (certainly quicker if your health was very low) while reloading.On a particular mission, the \\"friendlies\\" were firing on me, which shouldn't happen in any game.Overall the game is very bad and gets the lowest possible score from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing glimpse into native american folklore","review":"A fascinating docu-dramatization of an ancient folk legend of Vancouver's Kwakiutl indians...

Get a front row seat to be offended with the truth. It only hurts if you don't laugh.Not as funny as some of Mason's other performances (see \\"The World Accoding To Me\\"), but he's loose and relaxed and seems to be having a good time with his audience of sometimes bewildered (?)

The CD opens with 6-1/2 celebratory minutes of a choir-accompanied performance of the upbeat and very gospel \\"Oh Happy Day.\\" Other notable songs include \\"Trees,\\" which has some interesting strings, and \\"Keep the Spirit,\\" with its reggae sounds accompanying the piano.

The tip and shaft are fine, but the fletchings and the nock look like they were assembled by someone who's never even seen a crossbow before. The fletchings are just slightly taller than normal crossbow fletchings, making the bolt sit funny in the rail. The worst part is the nock. The maker didn't even align them to the fletchings. this is kind of a safety hazard because in the best case they won't ever fly strait. worst case they jump off the string and go wherever the forces of chaos dictate.

In fact, one of the characters in transition tells a group of people \\" I'll be baaaaa-ck.\\" Okay, if you can get past the ridiculous premise of this movie, you are going to have a lot of fun. To the actors' credit, they make you care about their characters amidst all the wool bearing. There are some sly visual gags and enough gore to satisfy the wolf in sheeps clothing.

The actors do manage being believable but none are really worth rooting for. The production values do impress however. It's just a bummer to see a film with that great of a potential ending up being an okay time-waster, top.

I'd recommend longer tweezers if you're going to do long-term detail work, however.I'm a big fan of La Cross products, and this product definitely doesn't disappoint.

They make a pact to try to attain a goal each of them has been yearning for in their lives and the book follows them along for a year. Diedra was offensive to me in the beginning but she grew on me throughout the book. Lisa was irritating but likewise redeemed herself. The real jewels were Anne and Juliet and the classy ways they conducted themselves through tense situations.

This is all well and good, however,in this reviewers opinion, he does on occasions dismiss too much information. Despite these objections, some of the authors criticism of evidence is quite properly and correctly deduced.

In fact, when we were in other cities in Spainwe were wishing that Time Out had also made guides for those cities too. All the restaurants we ate at were amazing, and for the most part the info was accurate. The book has lots of color pictures and gives details on how to get where you are going. Oh yeah, the BEST, most USEFUL thing was that they had a bunch of different maps in the back of the book, and on any particular entry (say, a restaurant), they would give the page and the coordinates of where that restaurant could be found on the map, as well as the closest metro stop.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not everyone.","review":"TFF haven't done anything worth listening to in over 20 years. Come on, you know I'm right. Even Fish For Life was better than anything post-SFTBC. The Hurting was superb. SFTBC was good, albeit overplayed at the time. But ever since? Please. They've been grasping, struggling to re-live the past. It isn't going to happen. Even with Curt back in the fold. There comes a time in many an artists' career when an objective truth must be spoken. Guys, let me be the one: It's Over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Beatles, not very original...","review":"This comeback was a big letdown. I was really exited for Curt's return, and was hoping for some revolutionary music from T4F...Like \\"the Hurting\\" or \\"Songs from the Big Chair\\"...but instead i was really disappointed, as this disc of songs are quality songs... but they are so much like Beatles songs that I cannot tell if it is an homage/tribute, or just lack of original ideas (or fear of them).This is a CD that does not compare with their early discs style and originality. \\"Everybody Loves a Happy Ending\\" is like the song \\"Sowing the Seeds of Love\\", but more extreme in it's imitation of the Beatles style/sound.It wasn't a happy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy Ending","review":"I was excited to hear that Orzabal and Smith had reunited. I was hoping to find their finale work to be something like what we had come to love Tears For Fears for. After listing to this album three times through, I just can't find anything familiar or appealing. Only three of the songs would I even listen to as background music.Is this album like \\"Songs from the Big Chair\\"? No. Is it like Elemental or Raoul? No. It's something like a Beatles imitation. Instrumentation is rather weak, and the lyrics lack the pizzaz we've come to expect from TFF. Oh well, at least I got this one at a reduced price. I always loved Tears for Fears. Sad to see them go out on such a low note."},{"rating":"1","title":"A departure from the classic \\"Tears for Fears\\" sound","review":"The Roland Orzabal-Curt Smith reunion has been long awaited by many. The two guys are symbolic of quality music that will stand the test of time. Roland Orzabal made a successful transition to a 90s sound with \\"Elemental\\" while maintaing the Tears for Fears essence. It would be natural for one to expect a similar transition in 2004. Unfortunately, Roland and Curt have departed from their classic sound to something that sounds like the Beatles. The only song that is reminiscent of classic Tears for Fears is \\"Secret World\\". Most of the other songs are forgettable. \\"Everyone loves a happy ending\\" is not the milestone I was hoping it would be for the musical careers of Roland and Curt.Songs for the casual fan: Secret World, Last days on earth"},{"rating":"1","title":"BLAH","review":"Reactions to this album are very polarized - people seem to either love it or hate it. I have to say I'm in the latter category. Same ol' story as many others who have posted reviews here... I'm a big TFF fan, have loved everything they've done, and was eagerly anticipating this album ever since I heard about it back in the spring of 2003. But words cannot express my disappointment.To put it simply, the songs on this album are by-the-numbers, boring, formulaic fluff. Sure some of the tunes sound pleasant on the surface, but there's no depth, no substance. TFF (and Roland in particular) are capable of SO much more than this... how they could put out a dull unspired record such as this - after so many years of otherwise inventive, beautifully produced music - is totally beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"gets better with each listen","review":"Since the original relase date of ELAHE in April was delayed, I was chomping at the bit to buy this album. It is a beautiful rich soundscape and I'm so happy that the 2 principles of TFF have gotten back together to create their magic again. I'm not saying I wasn't a fan of Roland's or Curt's solo material. It just feels right to have the partnership once again intact and I feel this is one of the most satisfying TFF albums in a long time. From the first track, I knew this was going to be a eclectic album and for those sick of the \\"Beatles-esque\\" influence, get over it! Did you think they would go back to 80's synth-pop?! The only thing keeping me from giving this a 5-star review was the minimal use of returning member Curt Smith. Out of 12 tracks, I feel he should have gotten more than 2 lead vocals. In any respect, great album, welcome comeback, and I'm happy..but I hope it's not the end..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tears For Fears .....Too good to be TOP 40?","review":"I was introduced to this band in the 80's by a friend...The Hurting was all I listened to. I saw them in concert when they were big. I loved the seeds album....especially woman in chains. Can any of their best stuff be top 40? I saw them on Leno the other nite...fell in love with call me mellow. Listen to the words...full of wit,charm,a boyish,yet mature, intelligence. They are too good for top 40. Roland is a genius. The words get in the way...you have to actual listen to hear their music...thats what i like."},{"rating":"1","title":"They can still craft a song, unfortunately they're not good","review":"This CD is a dog and painfully embarrassing to listen to. The songs are all well crafted, as you would expect, but they're not good songs.What were they thinking? They used to be so good. On this CD every song sounds like the theme music to any children's television show from the sixties. Several songs start off well only to be completely ruined when the horrible sing-along vocals kick in.Beatle-esque? Sure there are some musical elements reminiscent of the Beatles, but not the vocals. If the Beatles sang like that they would have been forgotten 35 years ago.Be warned, quality-wise, this CD is the direct opposite of The Hurting, Songs From the Big Chair and Elemental."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened??!!","review":"Oh no, this CD is terrible! I'm sorry, TFF, I've been a BIG fan since the beginning and have really loved Ronald's solo career with Elemental and Raoul, but I am so disappointed with this new release. It lacks depth and soul. It's cheesy and childish. It's way too Beatles-ish and 70's psychadelic. No good meanings in the lyrics. Can't quite tell what the heck they're singing about and can't get through most of the songs without having to turn off. The only song that's good is 'Quiet Ones'. I just don't hear the musical genious that has always been TFF. I hope they haven't finally taken their turn for the worst like so many other bands. Or, maybe Ronald should go solo again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!!!!","review":"HUGE dissapointment. If you want an incredible Roland O. album then listen to his self titled solo album also recently released...as for thie TFF album, it is a BEATLES RIPOFF!!! NOTHING ORIGINAL, shame on you Roland. Another great new re-invention album is the new Duran Duran."},{"rating":"1","title":"TFF is D.O.A.","review":"I bought the album, listened through it once, and dumped it the same day. This is faux Beatles at best which is a bad thing. After a an opening track that you have no idea where it's going, it moves into Closer To Heaven which sounds like a lamer version of Sowing The Seeds Of Love. The album gets increasing dull and unmemorable as it goes on. If you're going to put a band back together, you better have something new to say. Except for nostalgic purposes, as a TFF fan myself, this was a sad waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dazed and a little bit Confused","review":"How I waited and awaited this release. How disappointed I am.Except for the track \\"Last Days on Earth\\" and a few vocal riffs where Roland soars this new album is headed for the discount rack.I wonder how this came to pass.Roland's \\"Tomcats\\" is very appealing to a TFF fan. However Curt's solo efforts as shown on his site are mind-numbing.Perhaps that's the answer.I was hoping for the best or at least a fair effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so happy...","review":"I really have tried hard to like this CD but have failed. I should say the album failed me. I love TFF. I welcome the reunion and new CD. I dig that there is a strong Beatles vibe. But the songs just don't work for me. Most of the songs don't even sound like TFF. I'm not against anything new. In the end I wouldn't recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELENT","review":"I never thought of Tears for Fears as Beatleseqe pop in the 80s. \\"Everybody Wants To Rule The World\\" was a great track, but I lumped these guys in with Duran Duran and Wham.My loss, because this album helped me discover a band I too quickly dismissed. If you did not like 80s pop, it was too easy to miss how melodiic, well-written and Beatlesqe a lot of it was.This is a melodic beatuy of an album. The songs are carefully constructed, and the bass playing could have come from Sir Paul himself.Of course, this is a modernly produced piece, and so you are never going to mistake this for the mighty John Paul Ringo and George, the Kinks, or the Left Banke. But musically, Tears For Fears has it going on, and none of the 60s bands have anything on these two in terms of creating wonderfully constructed pop.Fantastic ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Mainstream","review":"I previewed this CD before I bought it, and I'm convinced that I just heard the best parts of each song, which isn't much, sadly. I'm sorry I fell for that lure, because once I bought the CD and played it through twice, I was ready to get rid of it.Actually, it was after the first time, but I decided to give it another chance.I love TFF. But this is just so disapppointing. In each song I hear two things: the same old sound (that can be found on their previous albums) combined with a weak attempt at something soulful and popish. The songs are jumbled messes of weak melodies all strung together. It just doesn't hold my interest. Even their attempt at Beatlesque sounds, while promising, whimpers out too soon.If you want generic pop music, this is your album. Otherwise, you're better off saving your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kevin F","review":"I am perhaps the biggest T4F fan out there. Sowing the seeds and Elemental are among the best albums I have ever heard. I love Roland's thick production, his layered orchestration and his enigmatic lyrics. Unfortunately this album sounds like that unmelodic spew that curt recorded (Mayfield) which to me is just no-hook waves of falsetto dribble. Happy ending is way too Beatle-like for my taste. The tunes do grow on you but Tomcats will get much more play than this album, which sounds like a broadway show soundtrack to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long awaited disappointment","review":"I am the biggest and most loyal TFF fan there is, but this cd is an uninspired stinker. In my opinion, every TFF album was wondeful up until Elemental (the jewel in the crown, I believe). But then came Raoul...not a big thrill. And then Roland's solo album - yuck. And now this one. It really bums me out. Roland is a dark, layered, brooding talent, with a magnificently angst-ridden/melancholy voice...and yet he is putting out these lame songs. No doubt that the mastering is brilliant, and that these songs are all put together well, but the songs are tired, soulless. He does sound beautiful on many of them, but there is no thrill. There is no going back for another listen and hearing something for the first time. I feel like that with Elemental, with Seeds, and even with the others.But I doubt I'll be going back to Happy Ending in search of anything. And that makes me sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fabulous","review":"The more you listen to this album, the more you love it!

Haven't been able to put it down. It's always taken me awhile to warm up to new music, but these guys get under your skin quicker than most. I just wish that they would have included the lyrics.I was reading the reviews and saw the one by Cinema 4 and realized how on the mark he was. Attach pop and music and it is certain death. You almost feel embarrassed to say that your favorite music is \\"pop\\" of the 80's or 90's. I'm not actually embarrassed, but my favorite artist, Sting, whom I regard as the greatest songwriter to ever walk the earth, is a pop singer.Cinema, I am like you and most other TFF fans here, incredibly happy they are back. I can only pray for a Toad TW Sprocket Reunion."},{"rating":"2","title":"back to their best","review":"Everybody loves a happy ending could have well been written and released a decade ago as a follow up to the seeds of love,a wonderful record that combined brilliance for much of the album but faded toward the end.Not so though on this new collaboration that sees Curt and Roland hit new highs both musically and lyrically.Apart from the catchy radio friendly singles such as call me mellow and Closest thing to heaven,they have penned some of their moodiest and darkest moments since the hurting .tracks such as who killed tangerine and the infectous Secret World make listening to music a joy again.The beatle-esque influences are apparent but would make lennon/mccartney more than proud.Lets hope that the listening public give this album the credit it deserves and enjoy it as much as i have and will continue to for decades to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounding Like the Beatles is a Good Thing!","review":"This latest set of tunes from TFF is very remeniscent of their Seeds of Love album and very Beatlesque (is that a word?). If I didn't know who the band was, I would guess it was some rare Beatles recording. I must say that I do like this album and I like both Tears For Fears and I like the Beatles too. This is a very upbeat set of great songs by the guys who brought us Shout and Woman in Chains. Great place to start if you are new to TFF and a great addition to any folks who are already fans of these much overlooked talented fellows. Very good. - Ciao"},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a good underestimated album!","review":"I downloaded this album almost a year ago (sorry, but I did buy it later though...) and now almost a year later it's still in my CD changer. The album has just been released in Holland and the single is played often on all the radio stations. But there's not much attention to the whole album, and that's a bad shame I think, because it's really brilliant! I did not like TfF in the 80's that much, but this album made me deside to buy Songs From The Big Chair and The Seeds of Love too! Although this new album Everybody Loves a Happy Ending is far the best. Good compositions, nice lyrics and a bit of a Beatle twist. I am very curious about their live performance of this album. Maybe I'll check them out when they're in Holland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassingly bad","review":"The folks who wrote such rave reviews here are hearing something I'm missing. This CD is a sleeping pill. Generic, boring pabulum with nothing to recommend it. After the brilliance of \\"Raoul and the Kings of Spain\\" I expected so much more than this.

What went wrong????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Forgettable","review":"This Tears for Fears album is a guaranteed entry into the Hall of Lame. I have always had problems with one band mimicking another too much. This is like the Beatles reincarnated. Now the Beatles are one of the most mimicked of all time and for good reason. They were visionary... FORTY YEARS AGO. Not in 2004. Tears for Fears is much more enjoyable when it finds its own groove instead of copying someone else's. I'd recommend skipping this album and spending your money elsewhere. You'd only be looking to resell this a few months later, and resale value on it is a sure-fired Dog's a Best Friend's Dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I am a die hard fan form 1983 and I have loved most of Roland's work including his solo tomcats screaming album. I bought all of the cd singles as well as the group puts some very good songs on them. But I have too say that for a rock band and one with so much artistic talent it is an unforgivable sin to be boring. I was glad to hear curt smith was back but I think Roland Orzabel did most of his best work without curt.

I told them that I just needed a $3 switch they then said that ronco does not sell any replacement parts but if anything goes wrong they have an exchange policy only.Call them for yourself and you will see.

I bought this book in 1972 some months after my son was born. It is the only book I ever found that actually gave me the confidence to parent. It helped me to know what to do, as well as telling me when it was age appropriate or psychologically appropriate to do it. I gave my copy to someone years ago but the information in it has stayed with me all these years -- because it worked! I became a better parent and a more patient one too.

I was, unfortunately, gravely disappointed. It reads like Douglas Adams on acid, only not quite as coherent. The other book that jumps to mind is sections of the Illuminatus Trilogy, without the conspiracy.Overall, I just didn't see the point. Neat ideas, I guess, funny in a strange sort of way, but not enough of either or a sensible storyline or plot or concept behind it to make it worth struggling through to find the interesting parts.I suspect I'm just a bit too linear to like this.

If only the author wrote in a way where it was easier to follow. Half the time I didn't know what was going on, where the characters were, or who was who talking. The names are hard to remember, there were too many characters, and it was just a big mess to read. I was so interested in the plot, but it was too confusing to follow. The author only writes action, not narrative, so he doesn't explain whats going on. You basically have to guess for yourself. NO thanks, I do enough work at work.

Coherency here is traded off for significant amounts of imagination and entertainment value, as well as a few sharp notions here and there; the result reads more like verse than prose, and your enjoyment of the material will vary directly with how much a psychotic, book-length, knee-deep-in-blood-and-shells poem appeals to you. It's not quite as deep as it thinks it is - or at least, it lacks the clarity to prove it - and the plot burbles into the background, but the energy and the verbal imagination never lets up. Recommended highly, but with reservations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bizarre but surprisingly easy read","review":"Great cyberpunk sort of tongue in cheek freakshow ultraviolent book. It's really short, but packed with bizarre details and asides, the story flies off in different directions, but somehow is still really easy to follow and read through. Sometimes the story just stops dead for a bizarre ramble or aside about ridiculous moments in the history of the universe of this storyline and the city of Beerlight. Sometimes the story itself is the bizarre ramble.Ultimately though this book was fun as hell to read.

I was disapponited because I could not capture the essence of the ideas expounded by each philosopher. The pages are divided into three columns. One column on each page is for quotes or antedotes. The top fifth of the page is used for birth and death, main interest, influences etc, there are pictures of the philospher, and occasionally other art works. This doesn't leave much room for discussion. I'm still looking for something readable and useful. Strangely, I did not find Voltaire in this book. Overall, it did not do it for me"},{"rating":"2","title":"A visually-pleasing and organized reference to some major philosophers","review":"This is the kind of book you - as a philosophy lover, I assume - can keep on your centerpiece or desk somewhere easily accessible for reference. It's very visually pleasing and organized, so you can spend hours reading about this and that philosopher. Its limitation lies in the explanation of the philosophers' views, which summarizes a lot and as a result you cannot hope to learn much from it content-wise. If your goal is to learn some philosopher's views well, this is not the book for you, but if you want a quick reference for philosophers' time periods, historical heritage, theoretical orientation, etc., it is great.Conclusion: a good pick if its purpose is understood as a reference, as a poster noted below. The point is to talk about the people rather than the ideas. It will not engage you in deep ideas, but will tell you a bit about a great many thinkers."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea...not there yet","review":"Purchased for concealed carry with my off-duty Springfield XD 45.

Once the album came out I rushed out to get it but I was totally turned off. The mix of music does not make sense at all.

The crimpable gold connectors are ok, however, the rubber cover sleeve is average at best. What I can't understand is the amount of loose-ness of the rubber sleeves when they are designed to stretch to fit almost any thickness speaker wire. Thus, the rubber sleeves on my Monster brand 16-gauge (standard thickness) speaker wires are very loose making me concerned that the exposed speaker wire will corrode over time due to the exposure to air caused by the loose rubber sleeves.

One of the themes of these contatas is the acknowledgement of personal sin and the desire to surrender to Jesus.The result is a recording of spiritual power and beauty.

This book also is very helpful after you learn your basics because you can analyze various anchor setups and compare it to the analysis in the book. One drawback of this or any other book is that a picture is never as good as inspecting protection on your own at various angles close up.

Nonetheless this book is not for the fastidious, if you are easily offended by sex, drugs, violence, murder, gruesome displays of power, and tragic terrorist bombings, then I don?t recommend, however if that does not bother you, and you can stomach watching the 10:00 news, then this book is for you. Again, I strongly recommend using caution when purchasing this book, unquestionably not for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got took!","review":"I too was deceived by the hype.

If I could give less than 1 star, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Bad, Bad... what a waste","review":"The spelling and grammar errors in this sorry excuse for a book are so bad that you're not sure if the author's first language is English. Almost every page has mistakes that has you stumbling along as you try reading it & you're left wondering if anyone really bothered to proof-read this crap. It reads like it was written by a hung over 16yr old. The narrative is terribly weak and moves along at a painful pace compounded with grammatical errors as hurdles.The fake reviews of praise have obviously been planted by the author or publisher to stir up sales. Don't waste your time or money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many typos - so ANNOYING!","review":"I've read the other reviews - everyone has valid viewpoints. Yes, it is a decent story. Yes, it is good to support young, first-time novelists. But does this mean you pay money to get a book FULL (and I mean FULL - eg.first 7 pages, 19 spelling errors and typos alone) of grammatical errors? When I buy a book, I expect that all I need do is focus on the story. However, with this book, you are constantly distracted, and disappointed by the errors. A simple 5 hour proof reading session would have surely removed most of the problems - it's pure laziness on the part of the author and unforunately, many won't be tempted to read him again. A real shame to shoot yourself in the foot like this. The irony is if you have a look at his book publisher's website, they actually offer an editing service. It is clear he did not bother to do this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written","review":"Who edited this awful book? Nobody?!

Why....because it disagrees with everyone.? Hardships of self-published books aside there are reasons why I didn't give this book more than one star. I noted that the plot was excellent. Other than that it was not well written, the characters were not believable and it was confusing. That's my opinion and that's what reviews are for.....opinion. The misspellings and typos were totallly distracting. I understand it was self done but to continually confuse \\"there\\" and \\"their\\" is not forgivable in my eyes. Sorry ! Have noticed the \\"fake\\" reviews such as \\"superdad\\" and \\"deadcuz\\" who both use the same idiosyncracy of \\"?\\" instead of an apostrophe. Coincidence? I think not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is full of spelling and grammatical errors!","review":"After reading the 6 reviews on this book, all giving it 5 stars, I decided to buy it. However, when I received it, I was very disappointed. There are spelling and grammatical errors on almost every page. I tried to ignore them, but there were too many.

It is in a different league from The Da Vinci Code, contrary to the hype the author or his pawns placed in the book reviews there. I am insulted by the author's unethical marketing strategy. He got my $6 bucks (for the digital edition) but that was a complete waste of money. If I were Amazon I would penalize the author by banning this book from the site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"I bought this book on recommendations from others on Amazon. Usually, the reviews are on target. Here, they failed miserably. This would be a good book were it not replete with errors. The Black Coats took \\"there\\" guns, etc., throughout the entire book. At least the pain was diminished due to the fact that book was only 155 pages. The story was decent and the writer does have talent. But this book appears as if a rough draft was published without any revisions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't fall for the fake reviews!!!","review":"I too fell for all of the fake reviews. I can usually overlook grammer/spelling/syntax problems, but this was the worst book I've ever read in that respect!

My recommendation is that you ignore the fake reviews and listen to the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starts out slow, but then becomes an action packed thrill ride!","review":"The first few chapters of Behind the Dark CurtainStart out kinda slow, but then the book getsreal action packed with tons of thrills fromall sides.

This video may have well have been about German Sheperds. There was no in site on grooming techniques or anything. When they talk about feeding, they show a puppy gorging on a large bowl filled to the rim with food. The most distressing part of this DVD is that the narrator is shown with a Maltese puppy and is constantly having to prop him up because he is so sleepy and groggy. I really believe the puppy is heavily sedated in this film. The film is very cheaply made also for a DVD that costs $25.

It is small enough to stick in a pocket of my carrying case and it has space for 2 plugs to be used at the same time. The electrical prongs slide into the device so there is no risk that they will break off in transport. A light comes on to let you know the device is working.

They flip it sometimes to confuse you, but they aren't fooling anyone. Also, there are very few similarities between this and the real Hunchback of Notre Dame story.

We followed instructions very carefully, but the top strap kept sliding off no matter how snug we tried to make it. We were changing flights and the third time we attached the seat to this product, it broke! The seams that hold the arm straps and the straps where the seat is held are very weak. One of them completely fell apart, and this was a totally different strap from the one we kept readjusting, just in case you might think those events are related.Overall, I regret ever buying this product and consider it a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poorly executed","review":"The idea of towing the car seat in your back rather than in your arms makes this product very attractive. So, we got it for our Evenflo Triumph a couple of weeks ago. On the good side, it has waist straps and a lumbar pad, so you're not towing the whole awkward weight of the seat in your shoulders. However, the materials and construction are not the best. The first thing we noticed is that the straps that go around your shoulders and waist do not adjust easily, they are made of a coarse material that does not slide through the buckles, so you better take your time to adjust them before leaving home.Durability is a serious concern. Both straps were ripped by the end of the trip. The first one broke when we were leaving the first flight, the second one by the end of the first return flight.In my opinion this \\"pac back\\" is not worth the trouble. Maybe with better construction... but I'm returning mine and getting a luggage cart for our next trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work on All car seats","review":"This is a fabulous product and seems well made.

The concept is good and they worked well before falling apart. After 1 use (short flight with no connections) the 2 we bought were both falling apart.

Yeah you could play your GC games on Wii with component 480p output, but you can't use the GBA Player on the Wii or play online mode in Phantasy Star Online.

You'll really notice the difference (the colors will be more vibrant and the image sharper).If you want the ultimate in picture clarity, get the component cables though. I don't think Monster Cable makes component for the GameCube (I wish they did), but you'll be able to find other manufacturers that make them.I only give this product 4 stars because I'm using component cables and it definitely makes a difference over the S-Video cable.

There is a loooot more to life than the color of your skin and I found it extremely depressing that she is very biased against white folks. It is clear that she her disappointment about her white father having left her family has turned into irrational and often absurd prejudices against all white people. Her entire outlook on life is through the race lens; the author's generally high level of self absorbtion yields a potent mix that is not far from bigotry and racism.Keep in mind that I really wanted to like this book, too bad; I hope for Angela to find a white true friend that will open her eyes to the real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baloney!!","review":"There were so many inconsistencies & fabrications in the book that I almost put it down before I was 30 pages into it!

Rather than being filled with more in-depth information and additional recipes that didn't make in into the short time of an episode (as I would have hoped), the limited content of the book is padded in metallic-inked graphics, more like a \\"coffee table book\\" than a cookbook. Most of the recipes are special-occasion, junk-food-type items; this is not a good basic cookbook. Nigella's earlier cookbooks do appear from a quick look to be more substantial; perhaps one of them would have been a better choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nigella Rules!","review":"I admit that I started watching her show only because of seeing this incredibly beautiful woman on the screen. It was several minutes before I noticed the point of the show was cooking, and boy can she cook. She has the technical skills of any other gourmet, but she adds her personality to the meals that transfers very well from the screen to her books. She truly has fun and makes the reader enjoy following along. My wife and I have even enjoyed ourselves when we failed at one of her messy-style recipes. It doesn't matter, its all in good fun, and when success occurs, wow, it's a delight for the palate. Fortunately my wife is not the jealous type, and she happily accepts all of the Nigella books that I give to her. The book is well worth investing one's time, money, and enthusiasm."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO EXPENSIVE AND BLAND","review":"I found this cookbook to have terrible tasting recipies .I would not recommend this cookbook to any serious chef because they would laugh in my face.I found the outcome of all my strenuous effort I put into making these bland tasting dishes awful.ALL IN ALL THE RECIPES WILL LEAVE A BAD TASTE IN YOUR MOUTH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not made for americans","review":"I am a Brit now living in the US. I love Nigella and all her recipes but to be honest it doesn't suprise me that most Americans dont. Overall American food is a complete mess (I mean - what IS 'Swiss' Cheese?? Plus Cheddar is a famous English cheese but seems to be used here to describe any yellow plastic stuff). Most american recipes use too many mis-matched ingredients & as for the cooking shows! Rachel Ray is supposed to be the best but frankly her recipes are a joke (for example she puts RED PEPPER FLAKES in Spaghetti Carbonara!). So overall if you're a yank just don't buy this book - all the recipes work plus Nigella is a purist (obviously not a good thing here!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasure on every page","review":"What is really good about this cookbook is that recipes are simple and delicious. Looks quite obvious to say that about a cookbook, isn't it? The fact is that the ingredients can be purchased in any nearby supermarket (not the kind of gourmet specialties that can be obtained only in exotic far away oriental countries), the preparation is REALLY simple and not apparently simple like in other popular cookbooks we see around. Nigella is an intuitive cook. Her recipes are full of common sense and they are the kind of stuff that can be quickly and easily fixed everyday with excelent results. A great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Like The Television Series","review":"Another wonderful book from Nigella. A very good read. I just wish she had included all the recipes from her series \\"Nigella Bites\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love her show, didn't think much of the book","review":"I absolutely love her show on the Style network. I've watched her prepare so many recipes that i would love to try. I don't normally purchase cookbooks but loved her show so much that I made an exception. Bad exception. The book is nice but does not have very many recipes. For the price of the book, I would have expected much more. For this i gave it two stars. I've learned to go directly to the Style website for the recipes instead. The only caveat is that you must do so the same week she prepares the recipe on her show as the website does not catalog all of her recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great easy cook book","review":"Nigella Lawson is a good wholesome sort of cook, not interested in the glitzy, ritzy, fashionable, ego tripping and frankly bonkers style of cooking that is found in abundance in cook books these days, you know the sort of thing \\"sea bream in tangerine and peanut sauce on a bed of wilted dandelion leaves\\".She seems by and large to be interested in nourishing and old school food, here she presents a collection of punchy and unfussy recipes in her usual twinkling and engaging format.She is often accussed of being an ok cook and a great celebrity but I think this is nonsense, she is far to intelligent and interested by her craft to ever be intoxicicated by the cult of celebrity.She writes wonderfully well, so much so that a large dilemma is often deciding whether to cook her food or just read about it novel style! The photography is splendid too, the food and Ms Lawson looking equally stunning and deleicious.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who says that all the Brits can't cook?","review":"I first saw Ms. Lawson on the BBC and was enchanted.

Nigella Bites appears to be an attempt to quickly exploit the buzz of her show. Do the math: the book is half the thickness of How to Eat, with larger typeface, frequent half and full page pics, whole pages devoted to a single quote, and 2-4 lined empty pages per chapter for your notes. I would guess that there is about 15% of the content of each of her previous works, and I am being generous. Avoid this tie-in and buy one of her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it.","review":"deflates. uncomfortable. weird. are the words that come to mind. totally regret purchasing this. just taking up room in my closet now. abs are made in the kitchen and at the gym not with odd balls such as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flight Stick Pro.","review":"It is a great starter flight stick. took some trial and error to get buttons set up; to what i wanted.

This is probably because we have become so much more sophisticated since the 1940's. Fibber and Molly, Bergen and Charlie are great on radio especially since both shows were so well written with the verbal interplay intense yet very entertaining. I guess I am doomed to listening to them on XM.

I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT I'VE CRIED AND CHEERED FOR A CHARACTER IN A VERY LONG TIME. MS. BERRY INTRODUCED HER MAIN CHARACTER SERPENTINE AT HER LOWEST AND ALLOWED READERS TO BE WITH HER STEP BY STEP THROUGH HER RECOVERY. UNLIKE OTHER REVIEWS THAT I'VE READ REGARDING THIS BOOK ON HOW HER WEIGHT COULD CAUSE HEALTH PROBLEMS, I BELIEVE THAT THEY TRULY MISSED THE ENTIRE POINT OF THE BOOK. IT IS VERY STRESSFUL AND MENTALLY DRAINING TRYING TO LIVE IN A SOCIETY WHERE WOMEN ARE EXPECTED TO BE A NORMAL SIZE IN ORDER TO BE LOVED AND SIMPLY LIKED BY PEOPLE. I TRULY APPLAUD MS.

She struggles with this society's fixation on image over substance, something we all can relate to. Berry's character development in All of Me shows improvement from her work in So Good. Don't get me wrong, I liked So Good, but I love All of Me. Mostly, I like the plot line better in All of Me. By the time I read So Good, I was ready to move on from pure problematic romance novels of the African American genre. All of Me does just that, much in the way Bebe Moore Campbell does in Singing in the Comeback Choir."},{"rating":"2","title":"All of Me Too!","review":"To know Serpentine is to love her. I know Serpentine very well. She is full figured, living in a society that tells us that to be anorexic is to be beautiful even though the majority of society ain't even close. Venise Berry has broken through the barriers and landed into reality. This is a full figured tale for those who need to fully figure out that being voluptuous does not exclude you from having a love life, from being good on your job and from living life fully and happily. Thanks Venise for fully understanding that good things don't always come in small packages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful story","review":"This book is my life.

I felt that Ms. Berry had the potential to go somewhere with this story; but, she dropped the ball.I really cared nothing about the main character. Like a reviewer wrote, she glossed over on a main event in the story. In areas that she should have came out strong, she didn't.

Some of the situations were not fully developed and I was very disappointed that a major event which occurs very early in the book was treated in an extremely cavalier manner. I was also extremely disappointed with the authors portrayal of Serpintine's last interaction with Carlin. The nature of her interaction with him and her response undercut everything Serpentine was supposed to have learned through her process of self discovery and self love. It demonstrated that she really had not learned much about self love and respect. Wait for the book in paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"all of me a voluptuous tale","review":"as a male who dates voluptuous women, i found this book to be an eye opener. ms. berry spin a tale of a woman struggling to come to grips with her weight. while reading the story i fell in love with serpentine's character.....her only weakness was falling prey to society's norm of what a \\"woman\\" should look like. ms. berry stay true to her sytle of wit and catchy sayings. after reading this book i immediately e-mailed ms. berry in search of my serpentine......i strongly recommend thi book to all those men who are dating, attracted to, are married to a BBBW. it would help you understand their plight. i have nothing but love for venise...... yours , cumtakernodoubt"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurrah, for the Full-Figured Sistahs!","review":"I've been reading since i was a little girl (about 3) and throughout my adult years I have never read a story about a full-figured woman. I like this story because it touches on several issues: weight, depression, self-love, and insecurity. Serpentine is a beautiful sistah, who hasn't accepted her weight, and is under pressure at her job. She is not really assertive about things in her life - her job, or men. She makes some interesting choices in her quest or search for self-love, and Ms. Berry writes with an honesty that makes this a difficult book to put down. I found this reading to be refreshing, interesting, and very entertaining. I liked to see more of this type of writing - or more of these types of characters. I do like the way Ms. Berry ties up the different issues of Serpentine's depression, and her learning how to love herself. The ability of Serpentine to accept herself AS IS, was powerful.Wonderful writing Ms. Berry. Keep up the good work."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth $25","review":"I was so excited by the idea of this book--a Black woman struggling with her weight issues and ultimately learning to love herself-- that I bought two copies, one for myself and one for mon amie, one of my best friends. I wish I had waited for paperback or the library.There are some good isolated scenes in this book, but, overall, it doesn't live up to it's potential. Serpentine has some important things to say and important lessons to learn, but the character is not fully developed and is therefore a shallow character who just happens to have a couple of deep moments. YES a lot of women will recognize themselves in Serpentine and her struggles and emotions. However, just because we can identify, doesn't mean we should settle for a poorly crafted novel with an illogically constructed plot.I also had some serious problems with the fact that a very serious occurence is glossed over in the book (I won't say what because I don't want to give it away to those who haven't read it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Boring","review":"Although the overall message in All of Me was uplifting, the story was boring. I plowed through the novel with trepidation, hoping that by the next page something, someone, or some word would spark my interest, but I got to the end of the book, and nothing interesting ever occurred.

I must say that I was very disappointed in this effort. The plot was not smooth by any means; it skipped from one theme to another and seemed to be a hodgepodge of every magazine article relating to weight issues and biases against overweight people. Very cliche and predictable. The icing on the cake was the incident at the class reunion; so silly and \\"thought about at the last minute\\". Ms. Berry, next time fatten up your plot and give us something to chew on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"While reading the blurb I thought I might find a deeper story between the covers. I am rarely one to leave a book unfinished; this one came close. I found it hard to feel any sustained sympathy for the main character. She consistently blames everyone for her problems (her mom, her men, the media), but rarely does the author reveal her consistently doing anything but looking for a quick cure to her obesity. The author's point about media influencing ideas of beauty (particularly weight)is well taken, but she takes no time in discussing the issue in terms of health and self esteem. How did Serpentine get to be a size 24? There are certainly deeper problems, and I felt cheated. I did not like the trite references to \\"Serpentine Fire\\", as if having your name as a title in a song is what validates you as a person."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALL OF ME","review":"THIS BOOK WAS A FAR CRY FROM \\"SO GOOD\\" IN TERMS OF INTERESTING.

It is really sad when professors write books for money and work but are not required to give answers to the problems they assign.

For a couple of tracks and then that dreaded word 'free' comes in. Basically 'free music' means playing whatever you want, all at the same time, no changes, just making an indescriable noise for thirty minutes and laugh all the way to the bank. This makes 'trout mask replica' sound conservative. It's just a noise and i would expect some sort of acknowledgement to the mugs like me that paid out hard earned cash to buy it. The arrogance of the three men bears belief. All superior players what were they thinking of? That it was listenable? Save your money and look else where if you're expecting excitement.

Also, I wanted to be able to use the board without standing in front of it or creating an obstruction (me)for students sitting to the right or left.This works perfectly!! Students love using it and feel in control when they have the pointer. It's a great motivator when you hand it to a student and give him/her the chance to 'strut their stuff' in front of the class.

I dutifully read the first part of the book and was amazed to find no nutritional information or even suggested menus. Could I eat all of one recipe - two or three recipes at the same meal - how much, how often? While Kathleen knows intuitively how many calories she's eaten at any given time of the day, I don't. And I definitely don't have the time to sit down with my calorie guide and figure out how many are in each recipe. One day, maybe I'll know the numbers too, but until then, the cookbook is being sent back. When I know my numbers, I can use the book. Too bad, though, the food looks delicious.

I have not tried any of the recipes, but from the ingredients on the majority of them, I'm wondering who in the world would want to???

MANY of the recipes have comments like \\"Not something you'd want to eat much of\\" or \\"You can take just a sliver.\\" Why put in recipes that are fattening when this is a weight loss book? The numerous tips on how to make something a bit fancier (\\"if the Queen is coming to visit\\" is cute, but quickly gets tiresome) are useful but printed in a way that makes them difficult to read. The design sucks; the recipes aren't particularly great and the ratio of recipes to lifestory is very low.

This book is a lot more than just a recipie collection in that you can almost sense Chef Kathleen's delightful personality literally bursting from its pages. Of course, having seen her TV show I should have expected no less. Sone of my favorite parts are her stories of her mom and the use of her dad as the the 'guy' behind the \\"Guyometer\\".

I pretty much ignored the comments from her mom and dad or whoever throughout, although I thought the \\"Queen's coming to Dinner\\" suggestions for making the recipes more elegant for company were helpful. To be honest, the only time the portion/nutrition info even occured to me was when I made the granola and wondered what an \\"individual portion\\" was.

And I thought that as someone who had lost a lot of weight, I would be able to get a lot of good ideas from her book. The good about the book is that there are not too many ingredients per each dish, so most recipes are easy to make. The bad is that serving sizes are not very clear in many recipes (the brisket recipe says it makes 10 servings with leftovers - how many leftovers? How do we know how much is base recipe and how much for leftovers if we don't know what a serving is?). Also, she talks about the importance of calories on pages 8 - 10, and again on page 80, saying she likes to know exactly how many calories she's having for breakfast, but there are no calorie/nutrition counts for the recipes! Perhaps she wants the emphasis to be on balanced diet, with good tasting food, but I frankly only wanted to read this book to get recipes with calorie counts.

Each page has it's own secrets and you must examine each carefully before moving on. The artwork is lovely and carefully detailed, you could look at it for hours.Some may write of the \\"Ology\\" series as a novelty but there is plenty in here to stimulate your child's imagination.

Though it was written in 1960, it is still amazingly relevant, and it's beautifully written, lyrical but never sentimental, open and frank, charming and intimate. The title may seem funny, even quaint but one must remember that at the time it was written, we were in full Cold War and few westerners were encouraged to think of 'Russians as people.' One of the best things about this book too is that unlike most books of this period it does not take an idelogical stand--though it is not pro-Communist in any sense, it is also not using Communism as a stick to beat the Russians with. But equally it does not ignore it. Instead, it tries to get in deep, to the Russian soul, the Russian landscape, the Russian character.

I wouldn't mind if it was some cheap version of the real thing, but just a printed shirt is boring.But all in all, even if it didn't even include the shirt, i wouldn't think twice about buying it.

However, Toshiba finally included the codes for the Moxi DVR (I have a 26\\" Toshiba LCD that doesn't support the Moxi commands) so it's not that bad.Update 10/15/07: I just spent the weekend watching football in HD on this TV followed by the Bourne Supremacy.

She also said there will be more hd channels as time goes on.I've checked the reviews here and most are good and with no mention of poor pictures so I called again.

We tested a computer's video-out graphics card (GeForce 7600 G series [go]) and using an HDMI it downgraded the computer's HD capabilities from 1080p to 1080i...if you know anything about operating systems there is a big difference between 'i' and 'p' when it comes to a computer's OS. Blurred and a little hard to read at best, I was severly disappointed to know an off-brand Westinghouse LCD tv of the same size converted the video-out to 1080p, and looked crystal clear. For me, this was a HUGE kick in the face as I mainly bought this TV as a sort of HD media center...I plan on buying another HD GeForce HDMI card and testing it out, but I don't recommend a 7600 GO so far...I'll keep you updated with what I find out.

This was the first book I'd ever read on Dada and I found it quite sufficient -- all the personalities are introduced, and their motivations and how they came together are revealed. Richter is best in the earliest sections, while discussing the birth of the influential Cabaret Voltaire and how the First World War helped amplify Dada's influence in Europe. The book peters out a bit in later chapters, but is still a detailed look at the subject. If you are simply seeking an understanding of the movement, this book is a fast and entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"dada, where art thou?","review":"In the interest of re-appropriating dada, read this book on the origins of the movement in Zurich at the Cabaret Voltaire. The Hanover period is less than compelling except for the brilliant Kurt Schwitters. His attempt to gatecrash the Club in Zurich led to marginal friendships with the progenitors - he was perceived as too bourgeois - and Schwitters went on to non-fame in exile in Britain, snubbed by the international art intelligentsia, which still denigrates his late work. Most interesting role? Hugo Ball, the impresario of the Cabaret Voltaire who championed the idea of the gesamtkunstwerk (total work of art) then dropped out to live in the Ticino in Tolstoi-esque self-induced poverty. Greatest sub-narrative? The battle for the ownership of dada by the hangers-on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for reading in the car.","review":"I bought this book in Flordia because I had to go to a wedding, and there wasn't much to do that I enjoyed.

This one is both stylish and rugged and has lasted me for quite a long time.My only minor gripe is that there is a felt circle on the back, inside of the case that covers a plastic rivet for one of the buttons.

Best songs have Doris in pensively romantic or melancholic spirits (\\"Imagination\\", \\"Thoughtless\\"), and while this is a bare-bones budget collection, the sound quality (which does vary a bit from song to song) isn't bad and the selections are at once interesting and engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"song selection a mixed bag","review":"Ten songs from 1947-52 with various orchestras.

I knew something about the Anasazis from the American Southwest before I read Tansey's book, but now I have a greater understanding of the Anasazis and other Precolumbian cultures in North America. The book is an adventure story, not a classroom text, which I appreciate, yet it takes the reader into the realm of field archeology as seen through the eyes of a layman, one with the boundless curiosity of a child in awe.I intend to avail myself of the Resources section at the back of the book to take one of these trips through the agencies listed there, and experience the learning and adventure firsthand.I'm looking forward to the next volume in the Bonehunter Series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly enjoyable.","review":"This was a fun book to read and informative on a great many subjects. Mr. Tansey becomes our personal guide as we walk with him on his exploration of archeological sites in the New World. The author carefully adds interesting facts which augment the central theme. Mr. Tansey obviously comes from a time when people enjoyed knowledge just for the sake of knowledge. They enjoyed understanding as much of the world around them as possible. From his diverse educational background he shares with us along our tour features from the world of archeology, early man in the New World, biology, geology, anthropology and paleontology.Reading Tansey's book is like walking the wood with a naturalist. He sees and he shows you what he sees and how he came to see it.

It explains the origins of espionage networks in Athens and, later, the formation of guerrilla bands such as EAM/ELAS. The book's main strength is its detailed coverage of timely events and politcal platforms, making clear the often complex web of powers, policies, and factions.Personally, I would've liked more details concerning the missions, supplies, and tacticts of the guerrillas; equal parts warfare and politics, instead of the heavier slant towards the latter, especially concerning the British SOE involvement.Overall a good book of history, politics, and foundations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't fit.","review":"The grips didn't fit the revolver but Hogue was fantastic about customer support.

You are constantly aware that he is mindful of being on camera and is playing to it. This is true of most of the performers--the word that best fits the people in this film. The outtakes you can view on DVD only further this observation (the scene with the luggage on the stairs is embarrassingly amateurish). As a result, \\"Six Days in Roswell\\" is about as funny as a government film of crash test dummies.I'd give this film one star for being just plain stupid, except that it introduced me to singer Suzanne McDermott, who gives us the most honest, genuine and professional performance in the entire film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Joan's best...","review":"I'm a huge fan of some of Joan Wolf's books, particularly her early ones.

Patsy is a NYC supermodel who turns for help to a childhood friend Michael, a former DOJ accountant, for help with a tax audit. Michael discovers that her manager was financially ripping her off, and the manager's partners come after Patsy and Michael to prevent them from going to the IRS. The book is smoothly written, as are all her books, but doesn't pack an emotional punch. If you're collecting her oldie goldies, spend your money on \\"His Lordship's Mistress,\\" \\"The Scottish Lord,\\" and \\"Summer Storm.\\" I've read them countless times, and, each time, I'm impressed with how affecting they are.

One tip I'd pass on is to grease the turnbuckle prior to installing it. The aluminum tends to bind to the screws after a couple seasons if not lubed.

It's a serious look at cannibalism in films and culture, and also in history and true crime. Repeat: a SERIOUS look. Even though it looks like a gorefest from the picture on the cover, it's not - it's a wide-ranging study (maybe a little beyond some of the people who gave it a low rating).

I can't believe how cool it is. There's only one tune I don't like on the whole album, which is really good becuase I'm picky about my music. The songs are very musical and passionate. I just love her voice. And she's doing one thing really well that you don't see too much of anymore (at least not in pop-style music like this) and that's writing really deep lyrics. The only (maybe) bad thing is that there is a lot of variety of styles on the album. Which is something I love but maybe it makes it too diverse for the general public. (?)Overall, though, great songs, great voice, nice production. This is probably the best indie album I've heard in a year or more.Bob"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Broke first socket within secounds of opening package on 3/8 IR impact gun.

These screws were so tight that even these drivers twisted slightly during this job but they did not break. All the other drivers had broken on the first screw.With great effort I used one of these drivers to removed all twelve screws using both a breaker bar and impact wrench (at different times).I would have given these drivers five stars but the one did twist slightly.I was still quite impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this book!","review":"Overall it's a very simple story of a Rabbit getting a book on wolves to learn a few things about them. The artwork is interesting My daughter liked the imagery used for the wolves as they kept getting closer and closer.The one thing that did bother her was the page where there are two giant eyeballs right behind the rabbit and the rabbit has a wide eyed expression of \\"oh oh\\"I diffused the situation by using a Bruce voice(the shark in Nemo) and saying \\"Hello Lunch!\\" She likes Bruce and thought it was funny.She didn't get the implied meaning of the rabbit being eaten by the page with Rabbit's torn up book.The alternative ending is funny as I think it's meant as a joke but I think my daughter liked it better.I would say if your child is sensitive and doesn't really grasp that some animals eat other animals; you could delay this one for a little while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a phrase book - Finally some real help.","review":"This set of tapes and the book was just what I was looking for.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"Although the first couple of lessons on the CD are OK for beginners, the CD rapidly progresses to complex dialog.

By itself, it is not helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away!","review":"Not much to say, except - stay away! I got this book for my wife to learn some basics as I introduce her to my language... Not only have I found this book incomplete, it is full of actual mistakes and misinterpretations of Slovak grammar. It is unfortunate, that there is such a limited number of Slovak grammar texts in English, and the few available are this bad. I recommend obtaining Slovak middle-school texts, which are much more precise and correct. Slovak is a very grammar-centric language; one will never master it without a good grammatical foundation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Language Book","review":"THIS BOOK IS AMAZING!!!

The description also states \\"368 pages\\" next to \\"audio CD.\\" And there's even information about reference pages.

Naughton's book and I have come to the conclusion that it is the worst text book I have ever come across. The conversations in the book are not relavent to every day life and so usually a waste of time. Also he puts words in the conversations which have no translation on the page and are NOT in the Slovak-English dictionary section at the back. After extensive investigation you find that the word was mentioned and translated in a conversation some 10-100 pages previously, and only once! So what you have to do when you come to these words is look back through EVERY conversation in the book until you find it! It's ridiculous! I have learned many languages in my time and have a lot of Slovak freinds who after being shown the book also agree that it is more of a waste of time than it's worth.

I was particularly drawn to the combination of klezmer influences with Afro/Cuban jazz lines. I was blown away by the realization that this track wasn't close to being the best on the CD. This is some of the funkiest and freshest jazz I've heard in years and I hope to hear more in the near future.

If you are looking at Faithless' work, I might suggest going to Sunday 8PM or No Roots first."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing like their previous albums","review":"Faithless is one of my favorite bands. Reverence and Sunday 3am have been on my playlist since i first heard them. But since then their works have degraded and with this release it has hit rock bottom.What's sad is that the music itself isn't even that bad (though it's been done before, and feels lifeless), what just drags it into \\"terrible\\" is the inclusion of the kid (i'm guessing Sister Bliss's child, i didn't investigate though the CD jacket includes info about the kid... simply put i don't care). I can understand the inclusion, but it breaks up the album, in terms of flow and since the music is already not great, the overall experience feels like you're listening to someone's time with their kid, and you're paying for it...But, on it's own, the music still does not reach the power and variety that the first two albums did, or the albums prior to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Green fuzz all over - Green fabric is terrible and doesn't hold up","review":"This product does help keep the moisture from the floor but not 100% and the green fabric is terrible.

At first","review":"I bought two of these for a litter of German Shepherd puppies. My female had a very small litter, only two pups. I loved the whelping box liner in the beginning. It worked great! It was easy to use and washed like a charm. What was even better is that it was extremely easy to keep the box clean, and the puppies were able to move around easily. The bad thing about these liners is that even though they say they're machine washable, they really don't do well in the wash... After about 10 washes, the back of the liners started peeling and coming off. Whenever the puppies peed it would soak through to box, and even onto my carpet (as I moved them out of the box once they were older). I am extremely disappointed with these liners. They've very expensive for how poor quality they are. I wouldn't recommend getting these, unless you never put them in the washer (you can just hose them off instead, and that works great except for when you do winter puppies like I do)."},{"rating":"1","title":"No fresh and dry!","review":"I'm not sure if my order is an isolated incident, I hope it is for other's sake.

Wonderful stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really does fit the phone like a glove.","review":"I've had this case/holster on my Motorola V180 for several weeks now and am very pleased with it. It provides a little bit of cushion for the phone to protect from dings. It fits the phone perfectly, and even leaves appropriate holes for the ports, LCD screen, plugs, lights, microphone, speaker, etc. Thus, it enables you to use all of the phone's features without having to adjust or remove this case. The tab on it that you push to release the phone from its ratcheting belt clip is a nice feature; however, that tab can get pushed accidentally, which may cause the phone to fall off when you don't mean for it to. (That happened to me once when I sat down in a car's seat.) Overall, I love this case/holster, and wouldn't want to be without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does makes you think ...¿Por qué?","review":"Like most of Riberi's work it's beautifully shaped and elegantly crafted but bordering on the overly sculptured.

I want to focus on a careful expression of my thoughts before allowing the influence of the considered (and often excellent) opinion of others. But I just didn't care enough about this movie to try to think carefully and then express carefully. I wanted to dash off a review--and quickly check to see if others were also offended--to warn to avoid this film. So, first, these opinions from other reviewers:\\"Nagging and dragging\\". . . Exactly!\\"Nauseating\\". . . Exactly!It is sickening to see this level of cruelty and hatred in a film. Anything positive here--the fun and sexy relationships between the young couples, the camaraderie between workers, between drinkers, the attempts at compassion, at befriending--seems so shallow, so trite, so false. Anything evil here--the hatred of the mother, the sexual sin of the son--seems so real, so true. This is sickening stuff. This isn't a film; it is a pathology report."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful Flick","review":"Vaugh has created another masterpiece.

It turned out the be a great movie. I like all the actors/actresses in this movie.It keeps you wondering whats going to happen next. Hopefully it will come out on DVD. I think the soundtrack would be great too. If you can't think of a movie to watch tonight, try (The Locuts). You will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nauseatingly depressing","review":"Don't get me wrong; I can appreciate depressing stuff, and sick and twisted isn't always such a bad thing either, but I literally felt ill after watching this. Maybe it's a credit to the cast, the director, the writer, etc. that they were able to provoke such a strong reaction, but it felt like they just threw in as many horrific ideas as they could think of to make it all as tragic as possible. I could barely stomach watching the repulsive, tortuous abuse heaped on poor Flyboy by his domineering monster of a mother. I wanted to strangle Kate Capshaw myself when this was over with."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Marty's Best","review":"Recorded in 1992, this one catches Marty and a stellar supporting cast of first call N.Y.C. musicians doing what they do best = swinging with glee on a bunch of pre-world war two numbers. Jazzology had thankfully started to record Marty and his small bands in state of the art studios where the magnificent sounds of the hot choruses and hotter solos could be captured for posterity. Marty Grosz collectors will all have this one. Shame on them if they don't. It's a dandy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of a let down...","review":"If you're expecting something like \\"Friday the 13th\\" or \\"Halloween\\" out of this, you only sort of get it. Theres a masked killer murdering teens, but it doesn't have the actual fun of F13's or the scares of the \\"Halloween\\" series. For the most part, it's pretty boring, in the same way \\"Prom Night\\" was, but even more so. Theres a TON of boring build-up, with teens and teachers having conversations, and stuff. The kills are pretty lame, too. However, it's not completely bad. It's actually pretty well made, and the directing is pretty good. You also get to see some cool clothes and hair from the early 80's, which was very enjoyable for me. But, again, it's mostly a snoozer, but it really doesn't deserve less than two stars. I sort-of reccomend it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is like a \\"Pixie Stick\\" candy,great as a kid no good as an adult","review":"I really like this when it first came out, but after watching this again I am not sure why. It was poorly written, the directed, the effects are very run-of-the-mill, and the ending really doesn't hold up well.The star of the track team in Any town U.S.A.(meaning Canada in the 80's) drops dead at a meet, her sister comes to town looking for answers and the kids start droping like flies.Very little logic is used in this one and I must say it was better when I was 12."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Diploma for Graduation Day","review":"Ah the 80's. A good time for horror movie fans and CGI wasnt a factor in the movies, so everything looked real. This movie sounded like a winner. Of course, you'll never read a good synopsis followed by all in all this movie sucks. Troma owns this film and it fits them good. A track runner dies because well I never figured it out. The first kill takes awhile and the pace of the film is slow. The first kill was horrendous and it looked really cheap. There was only one real good kill and the rest of the film felt like it was too long and way to boring. If you like 80's film then maybe check it out but there is much better themed day horror films out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who will survive to graduate?","review":"After a track star collapses and dies after a meet, her teammates start following her example. The assailant appears to be the coach, but is it? Nothing much to report here; pretty bland stuff but there are some good scary scenes toward the end. Christopher George is particularly fine and watch for a young Vanna White. One of the least of the holiday-themed slasher films."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rip-off of Friday the 13th and Halloween","review":"This is your typical slasher flick with bad special effects and bad acting. A killer is killing students before their graduation and kills them with a machete,knife,sword,and a football. The plot is a rip-off of other better horror movies and the characters look like their 29 instead of 19. Please don't watch this junk and rent a better slasher flick. The only good part was when the teen asks for his football back and the killer attaches a sword to the football and stabs him through the stomach."},{"rating":"1","title":"an okay slasher film!","review":"Members of the track team begin to die. Why? Seems a girl on the track team got a blood clot and died at a track meet. Her boyfriend decides to butcher the whole track team, and a few others. Not the worst horror film around, but I've seen much better. The movie is notable for an appearance of Vanna White, and an early role for scream queen Lennea Quigley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Thing It's Cheap...","review":"The only thing worse than the script, acting, plot and production values of this horror cash-in is the DVD transfer. I could've done better recording LP mode on a VCR...25 years ago. I'm a sucker for grade-Z films made on the cheap over a long weekend, but even this one tests my limits. Still, it's fun to have it as part of the \\"anniversary\\" horror-themed movie collection if for nothing else than Vanna White's screen debut. Even at $5, though, it's overpriced by half."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst slashers I've seen","review":"This is about some high school track team members who start turning up dead. As far as \\"atmosphere\\" goes, it's much more of a '70s movie than an '80s one. The characters range from banal to absolutely detestable. The pace is plodding. There's basically no plot at all, even by slasher standards. A little T&A;, which just makes you notice how poor the picture quality is. The soundtrack is a joke, it actually sounds like you're listening to an old album. There's hum throughout, and snaps and pops all over the place.There are a couple of interesting scenes, but that's about it. I was really looking forward to this movie, I mean, an '80s slasher with girls on the track team. But it took me three tries before I even finished watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS COVER","review":"My husband has kept his phone clipped to his belt for years, so when he got a new Motorola Razr, he wanted to continue wearing the phone on his belt. I got him this cover a month + a week ago, and wish I hadn't.This morning, the clip to the belt broke while he was walking and his phone crashed to the ground. Now we have to figure out what to do to get the phone fixed, as it's stopped working. Unfortunately there is a one-month window for easy returns on this Amazon and we're a week overdue.Even if the belt-clip hadn't broken and trashed my husband's phone, he still hated the cover from the day I put it on, as the clip was always difficult to remove from the belt when the phone rang, causing him to miss calls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay....and thats about it.","review":"This case turns one of the best looking phones on the market into an ugly duckling. It does however cover the phone in a manner in which it will not be scratched. The case also is very tight, and hard to put on at first.

Not a pretty display of the phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read additional reviews. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.","review":"Hard to fit on the phone. You cannot take pictures with cover on. Outside screen is not covered, so it will be the first part of the phone to get scratched. After only one month of use, the leather covering the clip-on insert in the back of the phone broke... because of the weight of the phone!

It covers the \\"side\\" buttons of the RAZR V3. I had to be inventive and use a marker to mark where the holes on the plastic coverings should have been and use nail clippers to make the holes.

It works great at both of these.I didn't find the belt holster convenient and it added to the thickness so like another reviewer I removed it with a pen knife.The case fits snugly and you can use all functions of the phone with the case on. Unlike the reviewer that had problems, I can easily charge the phone while it is in the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you hurt my ear now??","review":"The case was very hard to put on and the clear plastic on the phone had split.

I'll try something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be a better case somewhere?","review":"The phone is hard to get out when you need to answer it. The plastic clip was hard to release when you wanted it to, and at other times it will jump off your belt for no reason. This is a good case if you have a blurtooth headset.

You have to use force to put it around the bottom half because the microphone part sticks out. Even the top takes a bit of force to get on.Also, after not even five months of usage, the sides are starting to wear thin.This case is a horrible fit for the phone. None of the holes in the case line up with the holes on the phone, making it look like it has on it's little brother's clothes.It is also more difficult to hear with the top half on. I don't even use the top part anymore. I also took off the clip, but left the rest of the bottom part on so it has a softer landing if I drop it.And the part on the top half that snaps to the bottom half gets in the way of the camera if you're not holding it with your finger.Once again, I ask, who designed this thing?I give it 0.9 out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is terrible","review":"Did someone actually try this case out after they designed it? When I got my new Razr phone I was very happy to see a case for it on sale. I ordered it, received it quickly and tried it out. Then I realized what a piece of junk this case was. It did not allow the phone to close completely which caused the display lights to remain on. This, of course, will drain the battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"this cover sucks","review":"I waited patiently for more than 2 weeks to get this cover and it turned out to be an absolute disappointment.

Its a damn disappointment that the most popular phone in US does not have a great cover available anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Topless works best","review":"So, I agree with most of the negative comments regarding the case. I also think that there is a way to salvage your investment. The bottom covers most of the important parts and does support a clip which allows you to keep the phone on your belt while using all of the cool bluetooth features. Topless does let the 'ex-appeal' of your phone show itself.

The author brings his reader into a very different world, slowly introducing new ways of thinking, new words, new concepts.Mr. Donaghe makes no secret in his works that the worst enemy of anyone's happiness is the regimented belief structure of organized religion, cut off from the strength, joy and beauty of nature and love. This book had me cheering throughout for the victories of men and women who love openly, whether gay or straight, and who care for one another without regard to personal gain.Don't read this book expecting the intricacies of Dune or the grand scale of the original Foundation series.

So far, the one thing I do not like about it is that \\"on\\" and \\"off\\" are controlled through the timer. Not only is this a somewhat confusing extra step, but timers are notorious for being the first thing to wear out. Whether this is a problem or not remains (at least a decade, I hope) to be seen. Another reviewer lacked an instruction book and asked for the directions for toasting. For most toasting, use the bottom rack in the \\"up\\" position. Turn the temperature control knob to \\"Max.\\" Turn the function selector knob to \\"Toast.\\" (Both the top and bottom heater elements will operate.) Turn the timer knob past 15 minutes and return it to the desired setting (for bread, I'd recommend starting with no more than 2-4 minutes and taking it from there)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the toaster oven I expected from Oster","review":"My biggest beef with this oven is that it is advertised as a SIX SLICE toaster. There is no way you can fit 6 slices of bread in this over at once. It's a roomy 4 slice at best. 2nd biggest beef is this thing gets REAL HOT on top when you are using it. Hot enough for 2nd degree burns if you aren't careful. Don't leave anything sit on top of it or it will get melted. Finally, the toaster function is not real great. You adjust darkness via the same timer control for timing say a 30 min pot pie. Problem is in the 1-2 min range, it's hard to reproduce consistant results. You really have to watch your toast. The pros? Well, it's very pretty sitting there and it is BLACK with CHROME which is what I needed to match my kitchen and the only reasonable priced one in those colors. So I guess you get what you pay for but I am still disappointed with the fact that you can't really toast 6 slices at once... with 4 kids that's a problem for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this toaster oven!!!!!","review":"This has got to be the worst toaster oven ever made! I have not had a decent piece of toast since I purchased this toaster oven. It either does not toast evenly or burns my toast. The controls are annoying and my first toaster oven broke after four months. Oster did send me a replacement, which I have had for about a year now, but this one is breaking also (just stops toasting halfway through, so you have to jiggle the controls to get it to work again).

This film could be a cultural phenomenon that could help to change things. THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING FILM.

I am sure that Juarez has a lot more to offer than the murderous ways it has become known for, but so many people are unaware of the goings on there and I was so excited to know that a movie was going to be released. Rather disappointed it went directly to DVD but like most movies with JLo as a main character they tend to not do very well at the box office. I liked her in this movie and she is not completely hopeless as an actress either. I think some tend to forget her phenomenal portrayal of Selena amongst other roles.

The alternate was the X10 which catches the signal from one source and sends to a receiver connected to a TV. The satellite box only has one set of a/v output so this handy device allowed me to send the signal to both the TV and X10 transmitter at the same time. The setup works great. There is no signal quality loss by sending it through this device. I've also hooked up a DVD recorder without problem.

Her vocals aren't commanding and peircing like Jenni Rivera's, however they are more cantina style. I would categorize her as a classic \\"cantina\\" style singer, she has an appealing and youthful voice, that is commanding, emotional, and sexy. A perfect cd, and a wonderful and powerful singer.

At the same time, we see a man of intense Catholic piety and devotion making his way through struggles with finances and the early loss of his greatly beloved wife.If you enjoy literary biography, you'll find Pearce is a master.

It's occasionally a bit too much by-the-numbers, and declines somewhat toward the end, mirroring the decline of Belloc (one gets the impression that Joseph Pearce began to lose interest in Belloc as his subject's life entered its final and least interesting phase).I think that, overall, Old Thunder would be pleased with \\"Old Thunder\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"songs are ok, sound quality not great","review":"The songs are actually good songs - but they seem to be re-recorded.

The book explains the concepts in a clear and straightforward manner, and in the context of practical examples!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cost Effectiveness Book","review":"The information on the Amazon web site regarding this book should make it clear that it covers CE analysis for educational situations; it has a very limited usefulness, as all examples given refer to education 'performance.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives the reader an idea of how powerful CSS can be","review":"Got this one a while ago and Amazon e-mailed me the typical \\"Write a review\\" just recently. Oh well, here's my two cents...Not a complete guide on XHTML and CSS, but I'll keep it. It's a good primer on the world of CSS hacks and using creative ways to incorporate CSS. Good for those that want more than the raw rules of CSS.The book has great examples that give parallels between how web pages are typically developed, with bloated \\"table\\" based HTML, and how they can be developed in ways that make them faster loading, highly accessible, and cross-browser friendly.Keep it for reference and for supplementing your current XHTML/CSS templates. All web sites referenced in the book are a \\"must bookmark\\" for further inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CSS Advice","review":"If you want to build a standards-compliant, flexible Website, buy this book. It's not necessarily for someone just getting started with CSS- you will probably be a bit lost without the basics down first, but once you have built at least one CSS based Website you will learn a lot from this book.I am also a big fan of Dan Cederholm's other book, 'Web Standards Solutions'. If you are new to CSS, you should probably read that one first as it is a bit more on the introductory level.So why only four stars? This book contains a huge error: page 195 is included twice and 196 is missing. Yes, I am sure it is missing because figure 8.10 is never shown in my copy of the book (pg. 195 references 8.9 and pg. 197 references 8.11). Hard to believe such a large error could not have been caught. I pre-ordered my copy so hopefully, for those of you shopping now, that error has been corrected. Without that error, I would definitely rate this book with 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"This is a well written book about how to build better websites. He shows you a non bullet proof way and then shows you the correct \\"bullet proof\\" way of getting the same result with cleaner more flexible mark up.I think you will get out what you put in to this book. I also purchased his CSS book. I highly recommend both!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bulletproof is an essential book for every web designer","review":"This book is a must-have. Even advanced CSS gurus will benefit from the techniques outlined. Real-world examples are used to explain how the usual ways of doing things can be improved and made \\"bulletproof\\". Let your web text be resized for low-vision users without having the layout fall to pieces - bulletproofing is your key to doing this, and a lot more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CSS book yet","review":"This book is very readable, and the examples are presented in building block style, step by step. Practical benefits of XHTML and CSS are provided, and the code needed for the samples to work in the major browsers. I highly recommend the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful","review":"This book is great. Sets you up with examples of web sites that real world major companies have created, and will walk you through a better way to do specific parts of the site."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read, not for real beginners though","review":"A good book if you have already played with CSS and read some CSS reference work or a more beginner-orientated book, such as Rachel Andrew's CSS Anthology. Dan does not start back from the basics as Rachel nicely does, but Bulletproof Web Design is very effective in teaching you three essential skills:- make your website resistant to scaling and variable resolutions- organize a clean and flexible \\"table-like\\" layout with floats- remain readable for tiny devices and low-end browsers.A very pleasant read with a constant and comfortable rhythm, teaching you a limited number of concepts but then crucial stuff for designing a clean and robust CSS website. Well done Dan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - You need to ALSO know Photoshop","review":"I was disappointed - not because the CSS stuff is poorly presented, because it's on the better side of average, but because to learn this book's stuff, or try to emulate some of the examples, requires a knowledege of Photoshop. For example, you need to know how to create an image with a gradient applied to a canvas, or to create a 1 pixel transparent row within an image - something that your average person may takes weeks to learn on his own. Photoshop is not all that intuitive to just grab a copy and simply create an image that the author uses.And the author's website to support the book lacks the images we could use - just to get through with the book's examples.By the way, the images the author uses do not even specify their size, so even trying to recreate these images augments this inherent problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have book","review":"The book itself is a pleasure to look at and work with: it's nicely designed and in color. The examples are excellent, the writing is clear and enjoyable to read, and there are very few typos. Dan Cederholm demonstrates what excellent results a good designer can achieve when he or she is willing to master some code.This is not a book for absolute beginners, in my opinion. I think you'll get a lot more out of the tutorials in <cite>Bulletproof Web Design</cite> after you've worked through a basic book on CSS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have as part of your toolset","review":"This book is a fantastic resource for web designers and developers. It presents easy to read and follow real world examples of why you should be using CSS to design and develop your pages.No more than a day went by after I got the book and I was already using and implementing the suggestions and code and \\"solving\\" problems on my client sites.One big blunder though (and why I gave it four stars): where's page 196? page 195 is included twice...Small price to pay though for such a valuable resource. I immediately bought Dan's other book and found it just as valuable.

You learn Klingon you can only talk to other Trekkers, you learn Spanish, French or Japanese and the world will be yours. It automatically gives you a few thousand bucks extra in your monthly paycheck, it will get you more callbacks if you put it in your resume. You will open yourself to more people and you will never get lost in Europe.

So he's totally recreated the Klingon language to fit what HE thinks it should be. No hard K's, they are a linguistic cliche, so we have all kinds of strange Q's being used, and linguistic revisionism to tell us that they really aren't called Klingons, etc. So for someone wanting a guide to the Klingon language as shown in the original (and best) series, this is an extreme disappointment. If you want to invent your own language, fine, but don't mess with someone else's creation if you don't respect it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"Ok, I'm not a hard core Trekkie, and I don't speak Klingon.

For a book that cost $0.1 it was in great shape, the cover and binding were good. The only flaw I found was a yellowing of the paper. Since I'm a member of a Klingon fan club it's going to be used a lot, so having it cheap, but good quality was important. I mainly use it for translating Klingon fan clubs ship names. Which can be very difficult like Steel Dragon. I've never heard a Klingon say Dragon on any Star Trek show.

You can explore the chocolate room, ride the great glass elevator, and see other rooms from the book. 2 times in this game, you can get stuck. But thanks to a little thing called internet, and another smaller thing called search engines, and a microscopic thing called a walkthrough, you can simply read how to beat the game, step by step. The game is very fun, but you can only visit 3 rooms with the elevator, and yet, an elevator door (if you find it) is found in all rooms of the game! The game is very fun nevertheless.

The plastic button resides in a small pocket sewn into the rear of the glove. The problem is that the button flange that holds the button connector to the glove is floating inside of the rubber elastic glove. The pocket stretches! As soon as any pressure is applied to the phone when it is hanging on your belt (like when you sit down or bump anything), the connector easily (and silently) dislodges from its elastic pocket!!!

Not that he was English, or American, he was most assuredly very Russian, but Frank's effusive manner and luminous analysis bring out a character in Dostoevsky's early work that could be easily overlooked when, as I did I first, the reader jumps from Brothers Karamazov to Crime and Punishment to the Idiot and then jumps over to Tolstoy or Turgenev.

The book gives inside view of how the show was taped, with lots of interesting tidbits. (Like the carpets on the living room floor were painted on, and Archie's shirt was deliberately drab because a true white shirt would \\"burn\\" on camera.)

My cat didn't experience seizures like the other reviewers mentioned, but he's a big boy; that probably had something to do with it.Bottom line, do not buy this product if you want to keep your cats healthy or get rid of fleas.

He's much too small to even sit on it so his big sister gave it a try. She's 4 years old and at the upper end of the recommended weight limit. We tried every way possible to get inchy to flex and move but it just wouldn't.

We did as suggested and it was perfect for her to ride, as well as other children at the b-day party. It's a great exercise activity for children and lots of fun.

I put the rest of it together as my son and daughter were watching with enthusiasm. After my son jumped on, his face was priceless. He looked as if something was broken. He is only 3 and seemed to big and heavy for it. He is not even 35 lbs! My younger and much smaller daughter tried it with the same reaction.

I can push the seat down and hear springs, so the mechanism is in there, it just doesn't work.It would be okay for a climbing/sitting toy if it didn't have wheels, but my kids see the wheels and they want it to go.

My 4-year-old daughter also weighs 40 pounds, and she can't move it either. I believe it's supposed to \\"inch\\" along as you bounce up and down on it, but even applying all 40 pounds, neither my son or daughter can make it work. I, of course, can make it work, but I weigh 145 pounds! They scoot along on it using their feet, but it's hard to make it go, so they get bored with it pretty quickly. I'm so disappointed.

Very annoying, this game should have been alot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"oh my gosh","review":"phenominal game. like the other guy, i am about 21 percent through the game but i found the chase exhilerating, like no other in any game. the blurryness is from your panic and if you do well, you won't be very blurry but if you keep looking at the guys breaking down doors that you lock behind you, or get shot a couple times, it goes downhill fast, but that is what makes it so intense. i wish they made more games like this where you actually do things and flesh out the story before going in guns blazing (like half life 1). overall one of a kind game and actually pretty scary and intene. I don't even find games like resident evil or silent hill 2 to be scary or intense like this. hell of a game with great graphics on my 360 and great surround sound with an enthralling storyline and detailed world. very good for a mature gamer who has other games like devil may cry and halo to satisfy my bloodlust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for a few months","review":"The remote died.

In this case, instead of being able to spin this CD on repeat and enjoy a cool twist on Christmas music, you have to keep in mind that one song needs to be skipped. Keep that remote control handy folks.All that being said, the rest of the songs are great and add a lot of atmosphere.

The flavored pieces stick with classic combinations and provide some nice variety and contrast. The product descripton's suggestion of offering the assortment after dinner is good, especially with coffee. I find they are very nice to set out at parties or just for everyday guests, too. It's so nice to just have a taste as I run out the door. The best part is that none of these disappoint because they're all chocolate with no mystery fillings.Leonidas' packaging for shipping will protect the box and ensure it arrives safely.

The bottom compartment is packed full of different chocolates, and the top compartment holds the rest in order to make it 1 pound.I took all the chocolate out and organized them into flavors and was quite dissapointed that there weren't any Cinnamon flavored ones in my sampler. That's the reason I gave this sampler only four stars. I also got a whole bunch of Nibs, and barely any Dark, Milk, and White.Nonetheless, the choclates are mighty tasty. They seem very fresh.

It's a story of turmoil within a coaching staff that got out of hand and ultimately led to the collapse of that staff. While the book is Franklin's personal view of the inside of a college football program, it sadly misses the mark due to false accusations and attacks on anybody associated with the program. If anything, Franklin's account is a lesson in how not to handle things as an adult when disagreements arise in the workplace. Franklin would have been better served to sticking to reporting the facts and stories that transpired. His interjection of paranoid and bitter beliefs and views about situations, circumstances, and others dramatically reduces the credibility that the book could have otherwise had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"Many East Front aficionados may be tempted to purchase the companion volume to Colossus Reborn.

What I mean is that Lewisohn's book was the first to strip from the Beatles the legends and the anecdotes and present what really happened and when. This book does the same for the Who. The level of detail is simply incredible. Things which were hard to pin down to months are now given dates and venues. You can open the book and follow the history exactly as it happened. Anyone caught up in the obsession known as Who fandom owe McMichael and Lyons a debt of gratitude. Here's where you'll find the answers to everything you wanted to know about the Who."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Near-Complete Who Record","review":"Seem to be reading and listening a lot to the Who, and this book was an impulse buy.For the fan, this is a way to walk through history with the band, from the earliest beginnings as the Detours, and even before with Daltrey's founding of the group, and Townshend and Entwistle's affiliation with others.A lot of stories, memorabilia, set lists, and very interesting stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does it have enough?","review":"O.K, thanks for all the reviews people. I'm a huge who fan from Australia, and want to buy the book. However, I need to ask you some questions, cause there are a lot of who books on offer, so if you have read the book, and want to help me, contact me at; rubbersole1 at hotmail.com and answer this question.I've read a couple of who books, but none had enough or any info about their off stage antics...I love those stories, and want a book with them, does this one have it? Which ones do? By the way, if you like Led Zeppelin and love those stories, read \\"Led Zeppelin revisted\\" by their tour manager. It's a fun book. p.s; If Amazon refuse to print this because it does \\"not follow guidlines\\" I think that would be very silly for a potential customer who is serious about buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with Peter J Moore","review":"The exact same problem.

The book has many disturbing elements -- a missing parent who turns out to be dead, for example (to give away the plot) -- but it's tastefully and beautifully written.

This is defidentily one of my faves! A MUST READ!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book!!!","review":"I teach school and I use this book in the classroom. It is wonderful. It is a multi-layered book that even states that it is in the beginning of the story by comparing the storyteller's story to a wall that the storyteller's father tears down only to find something beneath. The figurative language is wonderful. I would highly recommend this story to anyone that is looking for a good book to read that really makes you think.

So if you like adventure books do not pick this book.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Read with your child or they should skip","review":"My 6th grader was required to read this in his class. He came home very upset by the unyieldingly depressing tone of the book, the disturbing description of a stillbirth, the child abandonments that occur throughout, and the affair that the grandmother had. It may be a well-written book, but if your child is younger than 13, I wouldn't suggest this one. If your child's school is requiring it, please read it yourself first and discuss it with your child, no matter what their age. The topics covered are too emotionally charged not to have parent involvement in the discussion. My son hated this book, I think because he was too young for it, as he loves to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walking The Two Moons","review":"I really enjoyed reading this thrilling, excitinng,yet tear dropping novel.

The second layer was Pheobe's story. Sal's story was the third layer. This book was very happy in the beginning when Sal went on the road trip with her grandparents, but sad, and depresing in the end. I found this book to be interesting, but funny in parts. Pheobe was my favorite character because of her wild sence of paranoia. This book was the greatest book that combines sadness, laughter, and excitment into one great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk Two Moons to Read This Book","review":"Walk Two Moons is a beautifully written book that captures all of your attention .

Phoebe keeps receiving strange messages but she doesn't know what they mean.

I would recommend this book to mostly girls because this story is about a girl that goes through different struggles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Walk Two Moons","review":"I really enjoyed this book because it had a lot of suspenseful, sudden, scary, and sad moments. As Salamanca tells her story you can picture the places she visits, and you can feel, with intensity, what she is feeling.

Sharon Creech's words painted a picture in the reader's mind. On the trip, Sal tells her story and behind hers there's Phoebe's story. This book was wonderfully written and I recommend it to readers of all ages. I would gladly read it again. This book was a little corny.

It's so sad, but so good. I makes you feel really bad because Salamonca ( the main character ) is in denial about a lot of things. Including her mother's death. Throughout the whole book she is telling herself that her mother is lost, that her mother is away. That's what makes it a beauty, until the end she doesnt really believe that her mom will never be coming back to her. She finds friends and love and she finds that it is ok that her mom has left. She gets strength and in the end she realizes that she didnt cause her mom to die, and that she is not going to stop breathing because her mom is gone. This book is the best book I have ever read.

The main character's best friend's mother also deserts her family as she goes to deal with the appearance of a son she had put up for adoption before her current marriage. And to add insult to injury, we find that the main character's grandmother went off on a three day affair with the \\"egg man\\" because the main character's grandfather was cursing too much. To finish off the list, another friend's mother is in a mental instution. There are no positive female role models in the book - something disturbing in itself.

I have to say the first time you read this book it is kind of hard to follow. Yet, if you read it again you will understand it better. I think my favorite characters in this book were Salamanca Tree Hiddle and Phoebe Winterbottom. I love Salamanca because she was kind of strange. She is afraid of many things like, pregnant women, buses and many other things. These things are clues in the story.I love Phoebe because she sees danger in everything, and I mean everything!

On their way Sal tells about Pheobe Winterbottom's life. Also on their way Sal has some bad and good things happen. The end has the most sad and exciting things happen.

I'd say this was one of my favorite books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk Two Moons","review":"Salamanca Tree Hiddle, Sal for short, a thirteen year old girl, really gives Walk Two Moons a twist. This book is about Sal and her grandparents taking a road trip to Lewiston, Idaho. She is going there to find out exactly what happened to \\"Sugar\\" her dead mother. Sal tells two stories to us in Walk Two Moons. She tells her Grams and Gramps a wacky story about Phoebe and all the rest of the gang. One thing that happens when she is with her friend Phoebe is, Phoebe thinks she has a stalker. On her way to Lewiston, happy and horrific things happen to poor Salamanca, such as, her grandmother gets bitten by a snake, and something horrific happens to her, as in a result of the snake bite.I thought this book was a very well written piece of writing.

At one point the main charecter Sal (Salamanca) Maple Tree Hiddle is at her farm house, the next minute she's moving. Then she's with her grandparents on the way to Idaho, while telling a story at the same time. The book goes on like that. Sal tells about a friend named Phoebe Winterbottem. The Author confused me by having too many events at the same time and I couln't keep them all straight. I found this story to be a blur. But... I would recommend it to middle school readers and up.

I thought that Ms. Cadaver and Pheobe were both disturbing, and the way the author thought. Looking at the other reviews, I am a little disgusted at the ratings. No one will probably listen to my review, but I guess you'll either love it or hate it, I don't know anyone who doesn't love it though. I do not know how it got to be a newberry.

She also talks about how she likes to kiss trees. It is really borring. I don't reccomend this book for boys. It was an easy read and it was dumb. No one in my class liked it.

There are actually 3 stories going on at the same time. I laughed all the way through --at the slightly daffy grandparents and the strange friend of the heroine. The 13 yr.old along with her friend do a little detective snooping to find out who is the town 'lunatic'. I was very surprised to find myself bawling my eyes out at the ending. Every teen should be allowed to appreciate this author's style."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK WAS A AWESOME BOOK","review":"This book was so good i even read ahead in class.

I hope you read this book and and will enjoy it as much as I did.Salamanca tells her grandparents a story about a girlfriend that is about 13 years old.

Her mother has taken off to Idaho and nobody will tell her anything. During the course of the book which is easy reading for adults as well, this Newbery Award winning novel displays a girl seeking the truth to rectify her life at the moment. There are revelations and the book is used in middle school classroom as an approved material. There is nothing objectionable about it though.The author does a very good job but I thought it could have been better and more dramatic with the revelations in the end of the novel. I felt the book needed another revision in order to succeed and really capture the essence of the story. Apart from that, the novel is interesting but it's not for everybody like myself.

The story of a girl and her grandparents trip across the U.S.had both of us doubled over with laughter at times and at other moments crying at heart-breaking events. Creech beautifully explores many complicated issues such as mistakes made early in life, death, and friendship in a very humorous and emotion-gripping manner.

Several of my friends had read this book and absolutely loved it, so I eagerly checked it out from the library. I was pretty dissapointed. Though it was kind of entertaining at some points, I thought the book had strange characters, a wandering plot, and way too many deaths. I think that this book is more of what my mom calls a \\"slice of life\\" book. That's not really my type of book, I usually read science-fiction, so this was quite a change for me. Again, not to offend any Walk Two Moons fans, but I really didn't like the book, (judging from the general star ratings I guess I'm one of the few)."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorate books!","review":"The quality of this book was excelent!

Before Sal's mother left, Sal and her parents lived in Bybanks, Kentucky. When Sal's mother left, Sal and her father moved to the town of Euclid, Ohio. In Euclid, Sal made friends with Phoebe Winterbottom, whose mother also disappeared. To entertain her grandparents on the trip, Sal told Phoebe's story, and behind it, like a fireplace behind a plaster wall, lies her own. I like this book because the author keeps the plot moving and has the funny parts countering the sad. I also like how she ties all the loose ends togeather at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gosh this book was interesting!","review":"Walk Two Moons is a fantastic book. We read this book for an assignment and we thought it would be bad. We were wrong! We were confused about Sal's mother being dead. We thought she shouldn't of died because we wanted it to be a happy story. She could have lived. The picture on the cover on this book is kinda weird when you first read it but then you get the meaning of it after you have read the book. It doesn't seem like it would be that \\"real\\" because there are lots of weird characters. Our favorite characters are Gram and Gramps! They are so gol-dang funny! I think that Gram also should have lived...because Gramps didn't seem right without her. Phoebe's family was so peculible. We think their last name is so funny! It's kinda weird that with the lunatic and everything in the end...about how he became..well you have to read the book to figure out what the lunatic is because we thought he was like some physco-killer or something but it turns out he's not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All thumbs down for Walk Two Moons","review":"I read this book as it is required reading for my 5th grader this year in school While the book is well written and contains a complex plot the story and characters are extremely disturbing. The characters in the story is psychologically unstable and live in a paranoid state (example: Phobe believes her neighbor Mrs. Cadaver is an axe murder and has murdered her husband). The adult role models in the story have complex problems and either have walked out on their children without explanation, and one Mom is living in a mental institution. The book also contains graphic detail of a stillborn birth. I do not think this book should be qualified as childrens literature. The issues discussed in the book are serious, and far too numerous for a child younger than age 14 - regardless of \\"how mature\\" your child may appear. I strongly recommend that parents read this prior to putting it into the hands of their kids!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too confusing","review":"Sharon Creech's Walk Two Moons was way too confusing.

The story jumps between the trip, Phoebe's story, and Sal's past.This book is unlike so many others because it has a deep meaning.

The product is made from an inferior wood.Yesterday, I had some friend visiting, I moved the stand from my bedroom to the dinning for my friends' coats. Soon after I put this product on the carpet, the track which is created at the bottom of the long stand in order to fix the three legs was broken. Noting that at that time, the stand was carrying some loads which I thought not heavy (a leather coat, a warm coat, 2 trousers).Today, when I tried to fix the problem, I realize that the wood is quite low quality. It tears easily when you put a nail on its body. Maybe only specialized equipment works.2. The product is not very stable. In order to keep it balance, I should arrange the load on its different hands symmetrically.Recommend other product if looking for a serious one."},{"rating":"1","title":"find another coat rack, dont waste your money","review":"cheap product and quick assembly. but just poor quality. the day i got it and put it together my wife came home and picked it up to inspect it i guess, and the legs fell off (the legs dont stay on @ all, u pick it up and they slide right off). my wife put one of the legs back in the slot and the slot completly broke!! i had it about 6 hours!!!! i think this is a very simple product, but i most have got a really crappy one, so im saying dont waste your money"},{"rating":"2","title":"really like","review":"Received the hall tree and it was exactly what I wanted and serves its purpose very well.

What really bothered me was that the package had obviously been busted open on the side, as it was just taped back up with packing tape. The finish on the coat rack was cracked in many places from top to bottom, but it was the large, gaping crack on the base that resulted from just the gentle pressure of sliding the feet into the grooves, which was the last straw. Luckily, I bought this to drill into in order to create a play stand and perches for my birds.

What Jackson gives us is a deeply researched, thoughtful, and judicious history of the show and its implications. There are numerous divergences from common wisdom here-- most notable is Jackson's read on the so-called \\"integration\\" of Bandstand, which he treats with nuance and sophistication. References to obscure tunes and performers indicate that Jackson is surely one of those legendary record-collector enthusiasts; it shows in his footnotes but not, blessedly, in the text itself. Instead, the book gives us a closely observed history of the pop music business and one of its most important institutions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"I read anything about Dick Clark who introduced rock and roll acts to mainstream TV in 1957.

The visual images and the story at first propels and urges the reader to continue. Then it drops dead. On or around the 70th page the book begins to get repetitive and useless. The images of white people as ghost is weak. The connections drawn amoung social classes and class consciousness is useless. For the time it takes to read the book and the effort a different book on this same subject material would be advised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"This book was my summer reading for coming to the University of Pennsylvania. I thought it was one of the worst books I have ever read, due in part to the author's totally contrived writing style. Towards the end of the book, Kingston just plain helps her reader along.

I didn't really like how she wove Chinese mythology into her writing style. I know it was supposed to be magical realism but I just felt kind of confused and bored.

I had to read this for an English class in college and it made no sense at all. I understand that Chinese people, especially women, have suffered a great deal, but this incoherent account, where you can hardly tell where she's making up a story or telling you a truth, does absolutely nothing to inform you about her childhood except that she had to have been terribly abused and therefore unable to clearly tell anyone what she went through. If you must be grotesque and frightening in a book, either be all the way fiction or all the way autobiography. King switches without telling you and frankly, I was not impressed by that technique."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the worst","review":"This is simply a terrible book. Including myself, my poor Ashley had to read it and suffer the horrible stories contained in this book. To put it simply, all Kingston does is continuously insult non-Chinese people and spread ideals that should have been lost in the void of time. She also continuously complains about America, without any ideas for fixing her \\"problems.\\" The story has no sense of organization, purpose or time. It continuously jumps around a terribly written story that noone could make heads or tails with. This book is not worth the $8.80 or even a blue light special at K-Mart, with mail-in rebates for the entire prce. Infact, people should be paid to read this book. Nonetheless, even with ANY knowledge of the Chinese culture, all this book paints is propaganda for barbarians.Frankly, I'd rather stuff wild weasles down my pants."},{"rating":"1","title":"stop......major boredom ahead","review":"I have just started reading the book and already im wishing i never picked it up.

The author threads the stories her mother told her when she was a child, through the retelling of her own life, using them to draw you into her own imagination. As she grows up, living half immersed in traditional myth and half in gritty reality, where mothers and daughters are only human, the reader grows up with her. The first person telling of her childhhood stories puts the reader directly in the shoes of a child/young adult working through the stories she has been told, using them to form her hopes and dreams and her understanding of the world.(N.B. You may not think that your childhood stories influenced the way you live, but if you think for a minute, I am certain some will come back to you and you'll realize that just the other day you did something based on or combatting that belief.

I found it confusing and I couldn't stand the feminism garb. I don't find this style of writing interesting at all and I don't see how it was entertaining. And I'm one who loves to read, this book was a waist of time. I either want to read a book that is fiction or non-fiction. I don't want my mind messed with.

This book also got its point across about immigrants and the need for a person to have an ethnic background. As a 9th grade student, I found this book to be challenging since there were so many metaphors and images that were hard to grasp"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time with the book, watch Mulan.","review":"I'm not going to recommend this book to anyone, at least not any of my friends. If you are interested in reading about the Chinese culture go ahead and read it. But if I were you I would just watch the Disney movie Mulan. The following quote from the book is mainly what it is all about, the Chinese woman. \\"Families are glad to be rid of daughters. Girls are like maggots in rice. It's more profitable to raise geese than daughters.\\" All throughout the book the Chinese women struggle and it is made clear that women aren't valued in their culture. You will all have a better time watching the movie Mulan and you will get the same thing out of the movie that you do from the book, women have to work a lot harder than men do to be respected in their culture. The best part in the book is the second story, White Tiger. It has most of the action in the book and it is just like the movie Mulan. So you should just watch the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood Memories","review":"I am reading this book in class and the wonders of Maxine's family and her childhood have shaped the way I observe on new life. My favorite chapters are \\"Shaman\\" and \\"The Western Palace\\". Maxine's mother, Brave Orchid, and aunt Moon Orchid were powerful people describing about the way they lived in both China and U.S.A."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much pretense to actually be decent","review":"This book was written just to jump on the bandwagon with Maya Angelou and Amy Tan. It was written in a popular style, about a popular topic (cultural diff. between America and China and the problems that arouse because of these differnces between the narrator and her mother). Full of pretence. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A contrived novel full of blatant misconceptions","review":"I read this book because my English 12AP teacher recommended itto me personally. Well, I got the book, read it, and absolutely hateit. Kingston's portrayal of Chinese history and lore is horribly distorted and I don't appreciate the cracked glass through which she describes Chinese culture. She mashes up everything whether it be good, bad or insignificant. Her writing style is boring and so obviously contrived. As a Chinese-American I am disgusted with Hong. The book probably appeals to Americans because it supports their ignorant stereotypes about Chinese culture. That's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Written, Bad Representation","review":"Although the book was written well, it does not represent Chinese. I couldn't get over the fact that Kingston made Mulan a victim of Chinese male misogyny. Look up the Ballad of Mulan yourself and see if there is anything about Mulan being abused. Bear in mind, Mulan never had a tattoo. And, the Chinese character for \\"woman\\" and \\"slave\\" are not the same. And, there is no \\"forbidden stitch\\" in Chinese literature. And, Kingston misuses the word \\"ghost\\".Many feminists like this book, but don't forget, Kingston is doing this in spite of Chinese people (specifically, males)! Sure, this isn't a book of history (Kingston says she is not perserving Chinese myths and fairy tales), but I don't think it's fair to ruin the Ballad of Mulan doing it and making up phony stories about Chinese. If anybody uses this book for a term paper or a dissertation, beware! You are using a book from an author who doesn't know Chinese literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Most Unique Memoir of Growing Up Chinese-American.","review":"Very challenging book to read. The author seamlessly weaves her own experiences in with the fantastic tales passed down by her mother. Sometimes you forget what's real and what's not. By the end, the reader really gets a sense of how alienated the narrator felt, growing up amid the old Chinese traditions in America.Kingston's writing is different from anything I've read. She makes no bones about describing how badly girls were regarded or treated. Her stories are angry and powerful. One of my favorites was the retelling of the legend of Fa Mu Lan (THE woman warrior), but even the stories of the author's mother as a medical student, the sad story of the aunt coming to America to reclaim her husband, were very exciting. The end of the book was a very emotional chapter, and I loved how the author tied the entire book together. I couldn't put this book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Struggle of Identity","review":"The Woman Warrior is a compelling and intense narrative, depicting the struggles of a young Chinese-American girl trying to establish her identity in America. Maxine Hong Kingston takes her readers on a twisting journey through her struggles with perception, tradition, and alienation. Maxine fights to define herself in a country that has already \\"etched words onto her back,\\" while attempting to understand the only thing that binds her immigrant-family together: their tradition preserved through her mother's \\"Talk Story.\\" As Maxine learns to distinguish the truth from the stories, she becomes empowered to fight the \\"ghosts\\" that haunt and alienate her and comes to grips with her identity, heritage, and relationship with her mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written, but boring and mind-numbing.","review":"I am a ninth grader (so you probably won't take me too serioiusly) and I just finished reading this book for school. I found it to be well-written, but it just couldn't keep my attention for long. I found it to be boring and all of the characters seemed to be in a strange mental state, especially the mother. Also, the book greatly confused me, espically the purpose of all the ghosts and the \\"talk-story\\" that her mother kept telling. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys contemplating the meaning of books for hours and getting really confused, but otherwise, it seems useless to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"Kingston shouldn't have written a book about Chinese identity when she's not at all in touch with it. Her \\"experiences\\" are equivalent to those of a white man's claiming to be an exploited, underprivileged black woman. I dont' see why she got rave reviews, and I REALLY don't understand why her resentment for Chinese men makes her a \\"feminist\\" while Frank Chin's works challenging her false renderings of Chinese myth and history makes him a misogynist.A note to teachers: If you intend to endorse cultural sensitivity and understanding, Do not use this novel as a part of a \\"minority\\" or \\"cultural\\" unit. \\"Woman Warrior\\" is representative of a psychotic mind, and not of authentic Chinese culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating","review":"I was quite irritated by how Kingston seemingly tried to use Chinese mythology, but did not stay true to the story. I don't want to hear her life story! The only life story I would ever want to hear about would be of my own, my pet gerbil Foo-foo, and possibly the Dukes of Hazzard. I was forced to read this for a Writing class at UC Santa Cruz whose writing faculty most likely consists of a bunch of zit-brains. My suggestion to anyone who is required to read this book is to pretend you've read it and make stuff up as needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Communication","review":"Books communicate. This book communicates very poorly. At first I thought it might be \\"stream of consciousness\\" but it kept on and on into such a jumble that I wanted to abandon it. But, it is on the College Boards list of books for college bound students so I plugged along. The stories in each chapter were interesting but the writing made me work for understanding rather than helping me understand. If you consider what the Chinese accomplished and are accomplishing in America, surely this portrayal can't be typical. Woman Warrior should be on the College Board reading list only as an example of poor writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only i could give less than one star","review":"This story is indeed about Kingston's childhood but it sounds childish at the same time, with the complaint of \\"life is not fair.\\" Maxine Kingston is a manhater and a racist, referring to white people as \\"ghosts\\" and africans as \\"black ghosts.\\" There is no question that Maxine Kingston had a rough childhood; she was born a girl into a traditional Chinese family. Her brothers were, in all likelihood, favored over her. However, she allowed all of her troubles from her childhood to remain with her in adulthood, where mere troubles grew into a festering hatred. That hatred is undoubtedly one of the primary factors that pushed Kingston to produce this rambling, non-sequential, non-linear, painstakingly incomprehensible complaint of a novel. While not a talented writer in the least, Kingston does convey thoroughly her two main messages; \\"I hate men\\" and \\"woe is me.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A book full of evil thoughts","review":"I read this book for a college course. The book is verymind-disturbing. The thoughts are very psyched. Anthing, good, bador neutral in nature, bacomes a sickness. \\"No Name Woman\\" and \\"Shaman\\" are the unrational cries of a girl for being a Chinese in a society with low Chinese visibility(mentally). Mistaken the reason to be being a Chinese, she wished to be whiteouted eagerly. In all, it's a book to be covered with dust, a book shouldn't come to our classroms."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was alright, but pretty confusing","review":"I thought that The Woman Warrior was an okay book. I learned a lot about the Chinese culture. At first I was pretty interested but it took a little getting use to because it was told in a strange way. I thought it was kind of jumpy and hard to follow. Towards the end of the book it seemed to drag on, and it was tough to stay focused. There was a lot of stuff that I didn't know about the Chinese culture. I learned a lot about the beliefs and the way of life. I think the author did a great job expressing both of these aspects. I don't think I would read this book again, because it wasn't too interesting to me. But, anyone wanting to learn more about the Chinese way of life, this is a great source."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible, awful, disgusting, and a waste of time","review":"I had to read this book for my tenth grade GT English class.

That is the nature of the beast, giving customers what they want. Worlds in Collision is a repackaging of two other Star Trek stories: Memory Prime, and Prime Directive. I hadn't read these as separate books, so I was delighted to get both full-length books, packaged together, at a very reasonable price. Woo-hoo!These are great Star trek stories, full of intrigue, and rich with the Star Trek personality development I expected.

Take his advice and save your eyesight, as well as your money. Don't succumb to the urge to fill out your collection by buying books you probably already have in more readable type. Just as Star Trek: The Original Series DVD Collection was sold as two episode discs and now is offered in Season Sets, repackaging stunts are aimed at getting fans to own multiple copies of their favorites.

That means I had to buy an additional short hose to get it to the kitchen faucet. Because the only one I could find at the right length was a clothes washer/dishwasher hose with two female connectors, I also needed an adapter. This added about $15 to the cost. Other than that, it's the perfect size for the 4-gallon pot I use for the wort boil. It should also work just fine for a 7.5 gallon pot by stretching out the coil more. If you do your boil outside and use the garden hose, it will hook right in with no additional parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"childhood favorite","review":"I remember the exact aisle of the used bookstore I was in when I found this book sometime in my third- or fourth-grade year of school. I read it many, many times as a child (and a dancer!), and have continued to read it about once every couple of years as an adult. As a child, it made me hope that I, too, could become as talented and disciplined a dancer as Samantha (didn't every little girl want to be a dancer??!!); as an adult, it reminds me of the fun I had when I was dancing. If you can find a copy for yourself (or a young dancer in your house!), I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book!","review":"True to the Sams series, this book is well written, easy to read, and thouroughly covers the topic. As an Access user and developer, I found this to be one of the best books available, and used it to refresh my knowledge of Access. I had no trouble reading it from cover to cover (which should say much for a computer book). It is suitable for all user experience levels, and balances technical content with an easy to read writing style. I highly recommend adding this to your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please change the tiltle!","review":"...It is fair to say that the author has a good story to tell and gives a good description of USAF bomber crews during WWII. However he never saw a Lufwaffe fighter during all his raids and fails to give any credible explanation for this. Also there is not one thought for all the civilians that were killed during Allied bombings. Jackson's first missions were over France and although he does mention USAF bombing US army positions, there is nothing for instance on the bombing of Caen where 5000 French civilians were killed. Later during the bombings over Germany there is no mention on the death of hundreds of thousands of German civilians. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amulets of Ancient Egypt","review":"The most recent reference book on Egyptian amulets although incomplete.

Then you've come to the right place. Could have been a glorious concert film, but unfortunately the moronic film editor seems to be interested in everything EXCEPT Bjork! Time and time again, while Bjork is hitting the high notes of an impassioned stage performance - the camera cuts AWAY from her and the lens is directed elsewhere.Just what you always wanted: ENDLESS footage of fingers working the dials on an amplifier or a drum machine or some goddamned thing, while Bjork sings her heart out - OUT of camera range, that is. This DVD will leave you exasperated and furious. I was ready to strangle the cameraman after viewing the $%&*@ thing. If I'd just wanted to hear her voice I'd have played the CD. You should too.

Let's Get Together was great however!! But all are characterised by Hayley's total inability to sing a phrase in one breath, hold a tune, or inject any sort of personality into the music.

I should have read the product description, because it clearly says .5 cups. I'd seen french onion soup served in bowls that look really similar to these, and it is hard to get a sense of the size of these by just looking at the picture. They looked ok, but they are completely unsuitable for soup. Frankly, I don't think you could serve much of a custard in them either. Condiments might work.

Arguably, the most absurd item he throws out is the suggestion that that the fission bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the USAAF were the direct outgrowth of the scientists, hardware and information captured by the US and British forces at the close of the fighting in Europe.Unless you're a serious Wermacht '46 modeler or wargamer looking for new material, I strongly recommend that you save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good....","review":"Sorry Mr Georg, but you missed the boat with this offering. Truly disappointing, aside from the great illustrations by Mr. Shestakov, is all I can say about this book. Most of the pictures were of MODELS, yes, plastic models. It appears that the purpose of the book was not to inform, but to display the authors models and give the paint schemes for other modelers!

And although some pieces were made so you can punch them out of the book, the more difficult shapes, like the people and parts of the boat had to be cut out by hand.

I was not sure if it would make any difference(these are pretty heavy on their own) but it did. The change was fairly dramatic. The sound is much tighter which to my ears makes it easier to listen to for longer periods of time. The main reason I chose to mass load was that I suspected the hollow tubes were creating a resonance. If you flick it with you finger you will hear it ring for a second. With the sound that resonance is gone. Not to mention the stand is much heavier. Worth the time and effort if you decide to try."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent stands","review":"These are great.

At times on Volume 1 it would get so repetitive that you would fins yourself pressing the 'skip' button just once too often. There was good material on Volume 1, it's just that there is more on Volume 2.Apart from Chicago Underground Council's repetitive track, there is much to admire on this double CD collection of some of the best material on the excellent Peacefrog label. Insync versus Mysteron offer up some wonderful Detroit-styled electro-techno. Maxwell House's surprising guitar-based song is as refreshing as it is exceptional. Theo Parrish gives us some jazzy deep house so reminscent of Peacefrog's output. More jazz-based techno material comes in the shape of Ian O'Brien's superb track.All the contributions on here are superb, with those of John Beltran and Stasis among the most memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty functional, a little bulky","review":"Got this a couple weeks ago.

You can attach the charger and data cable just fine but the ear peice jack seems a little scrunched. You can't access the TF card.There is a strap that goes over the top so your v710 definitely isn't going to fall out.3 minor qualms: The see through plastic has a little glare on it, especially when there is oil between the LCD and the suit. Also, it adds just enough weight that it flips open with a little knock. (noticed this most when having the phone horizontally mounted on my belt). Last, the flap sort of comes into the field of view of the camera. You already know the v710's camera is crap for its specs, but I occasionally have to hold down the little flap.

Once we recived it and I popped it into the player, I realized I also had this album when I was little!!!

He enjoys listening to it in the van or while he's playing on the floor. The adult singer has a nice soothing voice and the kids kinda do the whole backup singer thing. It's a great cd also because it has a lot of \\"classic\\" tunes.

The switch got stuck in the on position so the only way to turn it off was to remove the batteries. The replacement worked well enough to make it through halloween.

Yes, it has lots of really cool features - you can program it to recognize who is calling and play a pre-recorded (by you) message telling you who is calling - but after using it for about 6 months, the handset is barely working.

It has a feature to have the phone play a recorded message when a specific person calls. It also has the option to play a message for an unknown caller.

It was complicated to set up, time consuming to edit (God forbid the power went out--resetting the clock was a real pain) and after about six months the reception became poor---unless you stood perfectly still, there was so much static you could hardly hear. On top of that, the microphone would go dead---you could hear the caller but they could not hear you. If I tried to take it upstairs to use, it would not let me dial out--it couldn't seem to make a connection with the base. I finally took it and threw it in the trash, and the companion one I bought will not be far behind. As soon as I find a decent phone to buy to replace it, it's history and I will NEVER buy another AT&T product."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap hunk o'plastic","review":"This phone IS NOT user friendly. Complete pain to set up, and then if you DO need more assistance than what the jumbled instruction book gives you, they ask you to call an 800 number....an AUTOMATED help line.....a little robot woman tells you her best guess on how to fix your problem, then if that doesn't work, you're to call back on the same 800 number and press a certain number to shoot you straight to a live customer service rep......then a recording comes on saying \\"sorry, our office ours are blah blah blah, please call back another time\\".......ha ! We're taking it back and buying another brand of phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"I'm only giving this phone one star for its decent answering machine.

This phone was very warm (where the battery was located). I called the manufacturer and they said that was pretty normal for this phone.

Audio cuts out at low volumes (typical of all AT&T digital technology). Annoyingly loud ringer--no volume control. Poorly designed interface--hard to access caller ID and stored numbers, each call logged must be deleted separately. Handset microphone stays on even when headset is plugged in. Low battery tone sometimes does not sound--just hangs up on call."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"I purchased this phone 1 month ago because it had all the features I was looking for caller id, speaker phone, answering machine, head set, talking caller id, ect at a good price. The Phone is hard to program, the volume control is either too quiet or too loud, It takes forever to turn on when recieving a call and the worst part is reception is terrible!

It isn't! I've now bought two of these phones for my mom and each has lasted only a year before breaking. The quality of the materials is terrible, the range is pathetic and the sound quality is dreadful. The only thing unique to this phone that has drawn others in (as evidenced by prior reviews) is the \\"talking\\" Caller ID that allows you to record a mini-announcement for up to ten pre-programmed callers. It is this feature alone that compelled my mom to insist on this model, but it isn't worth the headaches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this phone","review":"I have had this phone for about 1 year and I am already searching for another phone to replace it. The reception is EXCEPTIONALLY poor. Simply moving or tilting your head will cause enough static to block out all conversation. Now the phone is randomly cutting off, (depending on where I standing), even if I am in the same room as the main component of the phone.... I will NEVER buy AT&T again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be Duped","review":"My husband and I thought this would be a neat phone and it does have some cool features, but what good is that when all your conversations are drowned out by constant static?

For people saying that they sold out are mistaken, bands that play the same style music over and over are bound to die, look at everclear, their \\"I had a hard childhood\\" sound lasted a little while, but they're on their way out already. Incubus grew in that they found new music to create not to sell. They can still create their old style music but that has already been done so they tried something new. I cant wait until they come out with their next album and hopefuly it will be more remniscent of their previous albums like Fungus and S.C.I.E.N.C.E. I rate this album 5 out of 5, I listen to it whenever I drive and I dont forsee myself ever getting tired of it. I can't think of a reason why anybody shouldn't buy this Album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Incubus is a talented band. This cd is a display of their musically versatility. It's definitely worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and slow....amazing lyrics and tunes","review":"Incubus' Morning View is by far, my favorite cd...besides being my fave band. I never get tired of listening to it. My fave song on the cd is Warning ; usually, i have to listen to a song at least 3 times to know if i like it; but with Warning, was different, I fell in love with the song the first time I heard it. Other songs I recommend from the cd are: Circles, 11 AM and Nice to know you. Every song is good. A lot of feeling in all of the songs....songs about love and about hate...also about lessons. I highly recommend Morning View."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, just not my style","review":"I got into Incubus with S.C.I.E.N.C.E. which is by far their best album, and though I was disappointed with the direction Make Yourself took, Morning View just made me not care at all about the band anymore. They went from a great hard rock/metal band into a soft rock/pop band and to put it bluntly it [is bad]. I'm not saying the CD is bad, just bad compared to everything else they've done. If you're into the slow boring poppy music then this CD is great, if you're expecting the Incubus of old, don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Progression","review":"This album is great progression for Incubus from their last album. \\"Wish you were here\\" will be a staple on the radio for a while but it is the softer, more acoustic songs that set this album apart. Incubus goes seamlessly from a fast pace to a more mellow one in their songs in this album. If you like there last album you will love this one. It is really a naturaly progression from the last album, it is what you thought they would become two years later and is very smart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Album","review":"I think this album is amazing. I think these guys will be influencing the music of other artist to come. I love the original guitar work of Mike Einziger and Brandon Boyd's vocals/lyrics are so heart felt on this album.

Apparently I can't look the other way without Incubus being all the rave now. I have a little secret to say to all this Brandon Boydites: GET A LIFE! Incubus is not orignal at all. The Cure has been doing music like this for 24 years. Incubus is nothing but a lame version of The Cure and Red Hot Chili Peppers (a band I absoultly hate), and no, they are not rock. This is music for 15 year old girls who got tired of listening to Backstreet Boys and wanted to listen to Incubus in order to seem smart. Well, no. If you want intelligent music, try The Cure's Disintegration, or some early Pink Floyd. Avoid this at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD gets worse everytime you listen to it.","review":"I wrote a review of this yesterday, but now that I've listened to it again it even worse.

Eisigner is the sorriest excuse for a lead singer I've ever seen. All the way through this CD, the band repeats its' sorry performance on \\"Make Yourself.\\" There's so much noise- not music, it just sounds like 5,000 guitars all doin' their own thing at once. It's just screaming, ferocious guitar playing and, well, that's really it. You can't distinguish one song from the next, you can't even begin to guess what they're talking about, and (worse of all) it sounds just like their last ...release. No development here. Keep moving, folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faith No More for people who like to play hacky-sack.","review":"That pretty much sums it up.

I love the way the voices change so much in one song. It is a great CD and it is always in my changer. I listen to it every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who dislike Morning View","review":"I listened to incubus long before their success with Make Yourself, and my opinion is that for anyone who dislikes Morning View, you don't know who incubus really is.They are progressive, and they change their sound with every record,while still keeping their roots,proving they can play all types of music and this is just the next phase for them.If you don't like this one,then you were kidding yourself when you said you did like them.You just jumped on the bandwagon.This is the most inspiring and creative band out there,and the best damn live band that i've ever seen.I anticipated Morning View for a long time, and wasn't the slightest bit disappointed. Solid record from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incubus continues to improve","review":"Each album gets better and better from them. This is no different. Warning is one of my favorite tracks by them ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good CD Too!!!","review":"I have heard both Morning View and Make Yourself today...so like yea.....anyways....I think this one is not as good as Make Yourself but he has some good tracks on it and I think it's pretty good.... Anyways I again recommend this CD for any Nu-Metal listeners. This is a must have for Incubus fans though....GO GET IT! Peace out folks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"another great one from incubus","review":"The thing i love about incubus is that every one of their cd's is different. They all have a different sound. They don't just sound the same cd after cd like some bands. And unlike other bands who try to sound different, Incubus sounds good with every different. I would highly recommend this cd for anyone. Although it's quite a bit softer than MY or Science it is still a great album. Mexico is by far my favorite song. It is one of the most beautiful songs i have ever heard. Get out and get this. The best album of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"they didn't sell out!!","review":"i think this is great album it has a variety of styles of music and a unique sound. i really don't think they are selling out, if they've changed they're music and more people happen to like it i do not say that is selling out. anyway i liked every song on this album and it is deffinetly worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album from 2001","review":"I think Morning View is possibly one of the best albums I've ever owned. It's impossible for me to pick a favorite, although Just a Phase, 11am, and Warning stick out a little more than the others. Incubus is definatley one of the most talented bands ever, and Mike is, in my opinion, the most talented new guitarist out there. Definatley buy this album. I got it the day it came out :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a new sound...not sellouts","review":"Given that i have been a long time Incubus fan, i respect their change in style of music and look at it not as selling out, but letting their music mature. Morning view is the soft acoustic side of Incubus that they were so afraid to let out back in the family values tour. Even though I like their old style better, its still incubus and they have a magic to them that few other bands have. IF u want good lyrics and great singing look for morning view, if you want powerful hard hitting sounds check out SCIENCE. Itsn't good that incubus covers all areas of rock? ahh...well anyways if u don't like this Cd your probably a angry death metal guy who loved their old style..but i hafta tell you there's a lot more incubus to come. they've been life long friends and their definatly not about to give up, chances are their next albums will be very diffrent......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incubus can do better, alot better","review":"If your just getting in to Incubus buy Science and Make Yourself. I have been a hardcore Incubus Fan for 5 years, have seen them in concert 4 times and have all their albums and I can honestly say this is their worst album next to fungus amongus. If you watch TRL then you would probably like this album. Too bad you dont know what good music is."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken","review":"When I received the CD, the case was broken.

So this album is no slouch. I actually enjoy this one straight through, just as with the previous albums I mentioned. \\"Just A Phase\\" is a really cool song, too, but some of the stuff on here is more experimental, so not everyone is going to get into it as much as a die-hard fan would. It is kind of hit or miss with me. To me, Incubus has kind of faltered on the two albums that follow this, so I recommend their earlier stuff up until this one, and if you enjoy the more experimental side of them, then pick up their new ones too."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTLEY SUPERB!","review":"Yet Another mind blowing album. This is killer!.... so many good hits including, Warning, Wish you were here, Are You In?, Nice to know you and Just a phase. Just A phase is a song that i can listen to and it pleases me each and every single time. This album is one where every song is listened to twice. I love this band.. They have changed my life and i suggest you go and buy it. CHEERS!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Band's Metamorphosis","review":"One thing I have noticed lately is that rock and alternative bands are becoming more mellow. An example of this is Stone Temple Pilot's \\"Shangri La-de-da\\". Many people are angry because of bands changing. People have got to realize that it's completely natural for a band to change. As time goes by, the music they make becomes more mature. It's just something different. \\"Morning View\\" is Incubus's change into a more mellow, mature stage. It is an excellent change. The experimentation with sounds in the last track is very creative and unique. It's a different Incubus, yes, but give the music a chance before you judge them."},{"rating":"2","title":"It took awhile to grow on me","review":"Apparently I was too hasty when I first reviewed Morning View, I saw a lot in it I liked but some of it just seemed tacked on. But after about 5 months of listening I can honestly say this album is one of their best...It's hard to choose Incubus' best album though.The more I listen to Morning View the more I find, it's not just another pop rock album, but very textured and deep. Acoustic songs like Mexico and Just A Phase balance out the rockers like Under Your Umbrella and Circles. The album also contains a few experimental Incubus songs, not like their funk on earlier albums, songs like Aqueous Transmission and Are You In? are experimental in a completely different way. Brandon's vocals are even better than they were on Make Yourself, his range has ind once again.Still why haven't they released 11AM as a single yet? It's obviously the song that could reach Drive success on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic view","review":"Many Incubus fans have showed dismay when it comes to \\"Morning View,\\" calling it too \\"pop,\\" but I love this album. \\"Aqueous Transmission\\" finds the group doing something that many bands are afraid to do these days, and that's experiment. \\"Mexico\\" is not like many other break-up songs because of its heartfelt and well-thought-out lyrics. I mean anyone can sing \\"please don't leave me baby\\" or \\"I can get another man/woman.\\" Of course, \\"Wish You Were Here\\" drew a lot of unwarranted fire, but there's nothing wrong with a delightful enjoy-the-day kind of tune.I was not introduced to Incubus until \\"Make Yourself,\\" and I have steadily gone backwards in purchasing other music by the band. I must say that it is wonderful when musicians can break free from the prison known as genre and just make great music. I'm looking forward to their next CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dang good CD","review":"I believe that the reason I first started listening to Incubus is because I like to imitate their guitarist, but as I heard the CD more and more, I learned that the lyrics to are very poetic, something you don't hear much nowadays. Like in Under My Umbrella, I was utterly blown away by the power in those lyrics.And the other aspects of the music are very good, like the guitar, numerous trills and fast paced strumming, purely Incubus.It's classified as Rock but, I have to admit, sometimes their songs sound a little too much like Pop(e.g. Aqeous Transmission), but hey thats my opinion.The only thing that kept me from giving this CD a 5 is that they seemed to have kept to the rock genre more in this album than in Make Yourself and there just isn't that diversity of music that they had.If you like Rock, great guitar and powerfull lyrics, pick up this album right away, it won't dissapoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"i can proudly say that incubus is my favourite band. and mv will prove it. along with s.c.i.e.n.c.e. this is my fave cd of all time. i would give both this and s.c.i.e.n.c.e. 6 stars if i could, fungus amongus 5 and make yourself 4. but back to mv. while i was going through the many reviews i came to a couple idiots claiming this was incubus' sellout album and even that s.o.d. is better cuz they sold more albums. this album is lyrically amazing, and sounds awesome. the quality is terrific (we can thank mike for that) and the musicianship is something to be proud of. each song was obviously written and recorded with great care. just watch the mv sessions (dvd). some people say it's horrible cuz it's \\"so different from the last\\". well, each album is different from the last, so go out and buy all of them! listen to pistola and megalomaniac (from lollapalooza) and you'll hear a whole new cd coming out next. - miranda"},{"rating":"2","title":"I cant Wait for their Next album","review":"I think incubus will progress into a great original band. Once they will hopefully outlive Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit, who they have been unfortunatly mentioned in the same sentence. But i think they are probably the new chili peppers with a faster progression. With songs like Mexico, Warning, Wish you were here, Are you in ? , Tumbing down the river, echo, just a phase, 10 am , They have proven that they can sit down write songs , and not rely on fans who only like distortion. They can still jam like a crazy but like Sytem of a Down they actually have songs which gives them more substance.i think we should all expect good things from this band. they have a made a very good album but next they will make a great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD's and Vinyl are two different things...","review":"Incubus is awesome, but when my package came in the mail it was not a vinyl.

I started liking them late in the game, but this CD makes me glad I finally jumped on the band wagon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Yet!","review":"Call it what u want- selling out or maturing, this is the best incubus album so far. It has a little something for everyone. \\"Blood On the Ground\\" will please old school incubus fans because of the hard rock. \\"11 am\\" is a great acoustic song, which \\"drive\\" fans will like. \\"Just a Phase\\" and \\"Aqueous Transmission\\" are two weird, but good songs. GREAT ALBUM!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This album deserves four and a half stars, so I put four. It is incredible, they have beautiful melodies, incredible guitar playing, brandon boyd has one of the best male voices out there. Not quite as good as Make Yourself, but so different that it is still really good. I love how each and every album they put out is different from the last, excellent and musically tight band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great piece of work","review":"I was very pleased with this album from the very first time I listened to it. As usual, Incubus has offered well performed songs with meaningful lyrics. I agree with everyone else who says Aqueous Transmission is the best song on the album, even though I fell asleep during the one minute ensemble of crickets that trails at the end of the track. Morning View has not left my CD player since I put it in for the first time, and I'm sure it will hold it's place there for quite awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise for Incubus","review":"Although an incubus is an evil spirit that creeps up on sleeping persons, like a nightmare, the band Incubus is nothing of the sort. \\"Morning View\\" is an excellent display of their talents both lyrically and musically. It seems that after two years in the dark since their last record, Incubus has better crept up on us with this more mature record. The songs are well put together. The lyrics are meaningful. And Brandon's singing has improved. \\"Morning View\\" is very different from Incubus' last album, \\"Make Yourself,\\" yet it seems more mature and diverse. Listen to \\"Morning View\\" by Incubus. Hopefully you'll love it as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Rock Albums Ever","review":"Ok... I admit it... I am a new Incubus fan, and I was only interested in them after hearing \\"Stellar\\" and \\"Drive\\" on the radio. I was expecting less when I heard this album, I was expecting a kind of top 40 ...collection of \\"rock\\".And it hasnt left my CD player since I bought it. Brandon Boyd (and yes.... he is gorgeous) actually SINGS the songs, unlike Fred Durst and others, who try to cover up the fact that they have no talent. He is loud and rebellious when he needs to be, and soft and gentle when he needs to be, but always keeping his voice at just what the song needs. Right now, my favorite songs are #11, #13, and #6, but all have equal grace and beauty.The lyrics are incredibly introspective, and require one's own interpretation. These guys are musical geniuses, and its sad to see that someone like Britney Spears outsells them. But I can tell you that Incubus will definitley be around for a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT!!!","review":"It is a great album. Its one of those albums that you can just put it in and leave it to please your ears. They are different and brandon has that voice that you can't deny. Trust me, it's great. Relaxing songs and there are songs that you just want to get up and dance and SING!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I have become a fan ever since i bought this album. I am mainly a fan of punk rock and emo so my view of the album will be different from others.Nice to know you-great opener and great song overall. 10/10Circles-Nice heavier song with great guitar riff.9/10Wish you were here-Excellent song you've probably heard a million times.10/10Just a phase-i can't really understand why everyone loves this song. I don't know why, but i just dont like it. 6/1011AM-an OK song. 7/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the best Incubus album to date. ...","review":"...And also one of my favorite cd's I own. This album doesn't sound much like their old albums at all; it's actually more heavy, just in a different way, however, there are more soft songs on this cd then hard, and they are all brilliant to say the least. If you want something similiar to S.C.I.E.N.C.E, you won't find it here, but you might as well give it a chance or you will miss out on an icredible album. The only thing I don't like about the album is the slighty muddy protection."},{"rating":"2","title":"THis IS THe BEst!! !","review":"The new INCUBUS album is awsome.Has rock-on melodies and a killer DJ(DJ Killmore;)If u want hard rock with some slower songs, BUY THIS ALBUM, IT ROCKS!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing.....","review":"First off.... Incubus is an amazing band with a great talent for making intelligent, and good music.The lyrics are really heart felt and sung that way. The guitar and turn table-esque sound is great. They have really matured and broadened their horizons on this album. My favourite songs are \\"Just a Phase\\" and \\"Under my Umbrella\\".so- in short...... BUY IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They Just Keep Getting Better!!","review":"Morning View was released. I ran down to the local cd store and bought me a copy. At first i was dissapointed, felt a little let down and again very disappointed. I heard it as Make Yourself Mach 2.A couple of listens later i gave the lyrics a read along with the music. I found that the cd was definately a \\"grower\\", but it was also lyrically better than Make Yourself. Although, SCIENCE is my favorite Incubus album i feel as though musically Morning View is superior. The best example of this is Just A Phase which is a brilliant song.The lyrics follow the same type of message to oneanother, it seems as though someone has affected Mr Boyd emotionally at the writing of the album as through every song he refers to you. His lyrics really hit home and this album is his lyrical best as the emotion really hits home.This album reminds me of Silverchair's Neon Ballroom. Best tracks are Nice To Know You, Just A Phase, 11AM and Under My Umbrella."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Album","review":"Incubus' third full length album is a solid one. While not as good as their last effort this album still has its strong spots. Some of the best cuts on the album are \\"Nice to Know You\\" \\"I Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"11 am\\". The only bad thing about this album is that it sounds like a veteran bands experimental album. However, I would still recommend purchasing it. But if you want top of the line Incubus, go pick up Make Yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album and all, but what happened to the science?","review":"This album is really really good! There's absolutely no disputing that. Incubus is good at what they do.But I MUST ask, what happened to S.C.I.E.N.C.E.?? Where's the sound experimentation, crazed funk, the DJ-oriented tracks, the Secret songs, etc.Where's the Magic Medecine that got me into Incubus in the first place? It began to dwindle during the Make Yourself days, and now it can be considered all but gone! I'm surprised Kilmore even has a position in the band's lineup now. I think I heard him about 4 or 5 times in the whole CD.Don't get me wrong - this is a great album in it's own rite. Songs like Wish You Were Here, Blood On The Ground, and Under My Umbrella are very good examples! They're catchy and well-written.Even so, I miss the old Incubus...."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great album!","review":"They did it again... Morning View is a wonderful album. The sound is more laid back than Make Yourself and you can tell that they were in a more relaxed atmosphere while recording it. Everyone should definitely get this cd. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never cease to amaze me...","review":"First thing I have to declare: This is my ultimate favorite band. So you're asking \\"What the hell makes them so great from others?\\" Well what other band is so diverse, so intelligent, and so unbelievably talented than Incubus? \\"Morning View\\" is another great album that I'm so proud to own. I don't necessarily have a favorite album of theirs because their talent and musical ingenuity has grown up from their roots, which is also very good.Oh and don't listen to others who say they're sell-outs. They aren't and you know it so please dont succumb to other people's thoughts. I mean hey, if you honestly think that don't read this. But if you're not sure, don't just not buy it because of some else's idea. Think for yourself and make yourself.So just get this CD, be happy, and shut up so you don't block out the sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is nothing but elevator music..","review":"Okay.. so there's one halfway decent song on the album.. \\"Wish you were here\\". The rest is below terrible. I wish I could give this album less than one star. DISAPPOINTMENT is not even the right word to use for what I feel about this album. They might as well play the rest of these songs on the country music station.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"Horrible, nothing like the old days,hopefully next CD will be better. BTW, their not so hot live either :-\\\\"},{"rating":"1","title":"MOURNING VIEW OF WHAT USED TO BE","review":"This album is in my \\"dating\\" music section, right next to Dave Mathews and Blink 182. Girls will love the simple and serene vocals and the pleasant, unaggresive guitar work. The placid scratch work which blends in nicely with the smooth, easy listening vocals will have her loosening her blouse almost instantly. Thanks Brandon!For music fans that miss the energy, anger and frustration that so delightfully make their rounds on SCIENCE and Fungus Amoungus, you are in for a listen to a different band with this release, unlike Mike Patton who this band so clearly rips off (go out and listen to Fantomas) - all that good stuff is gone. This is a boring, uninspired, rich kid release. Once again, money changes some of the most talented musicians I knew in the mid 90's."},{"rating":"1","title":"You knew it was coming","review":"Long time Incubus fans (as in before they were popular) no doubt knew that this would happen after the \\"Drive\\" single from the mediocre \\"Make Yourself\\" shot Incubus to never before thought of heights. And, what do you know? Incubus has gone from a unique sounding band (check out \\"Fungus Amongus\\"), to one of the new wave of post grunge sensitive pop rock in the vain of Nickelback and Creed. \\"Wish You Were Here\\"?, gimme a break, where have we heard that before? I think they were called Pink Fl...something or other. The \\"heavy\\" songs sound like the Backstreet Boys adding downtuned guitars, and it is a real shame because Incubus was once a great band, but as with the times, they've just gone with the trend. Skip this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incubus, Hoobastank Wanna-Be's","review":"Hasn't anyone noticed how these guys sound just like Hoobastank?

After hearing S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and Make Yourself you'll use this CD for a Beverage Coaster. The Lyrics and music of Morning View seem thrown together without much thought. I give This Album A -1 out of 5. They really let me down with this one. Otherwise one of my favorite bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo Hoo Hoo to the girl tired of this album getting picked o","review":"Well here's what I think of the album.... It's a sorry excuse for any of Incubus' work. And to the guy saying that Incubus changed mainstream. Heck no. I still talk to people everyday that have no idea who Incubus is. And when they do they usually just know one or two songs. Yes there is a few Incubus circles around, and thats probably how they'll stay. I could best compare it to the Insane Clown Posse. You have your fanatical listeners that live and breath it then everyone else will listen to it when they are forced to by those \\"fanatics\\".Thats it."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST BUY MUST BUY MUST BUY","review":"OK, I WAS NOT MUCH OF AN INCUBUS FAN WHEN I FIRST SPUN THIS DISC. i MEAN, I HAD HEARD \\"DRIVE\\" \\"STELEAR\\" AND \\"PARDON ME\\" FROM THE \\"MAKE YOURSELF\\" ALBUM AND I LIKED THEM SO I GOT THIS.WHEN YOU POP THIS INTO YOUR CD PLAYER THE FIRST TIME, CHANCES ARE YOU WILL HATE IT. MAYBE NOT ALL OF IT, BUT MOST OF IT. yOU WILL TRY TO SIT THROUGH THE ALBUM AND YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF TURNING IT OFF. bUT IF I WERE YOU, I WOULDN'T TURN IT OFF. I WOULD SIT BACK AND LISTEN TO IT. THIS ALBUM IS FILLED WITH METAPHORES AND HIDEN MEANING AND CONTAINS MORE STYLE SHIFTS THAN YOU MIGHT THINK. THE HIGH POINTS ON HERE ARE \\"ECHO\\" AND \\"AQIOUS TRANSMISSION\\" WICH ARE THE QUIET NUMBERS. hOWEVER, \\"MEXICO\\" AND ALL OF THE HITS \\"NICE TO KNOW YOU\\" \\"WISH YOU WERE HERE\\" \\"ARE YOU IN\\" AND \\"WARNING\\" ARE GOOD ALSO. GO GET THIS ALBUM NOW AND LOVE IT LIKE I DO."},{"rating":"2","title":"a definite step forward","review":"I just grabbed this CD the other day, after hearing \\"Nice to Know You\\" on the radio, and I was really impressed. I thought SCIENCE and Make Yourself were both quite good, but I didn't buy Morning View because I'd heard bad things. None of those bad things are true, though, since the album is awesome. \\"Nice to Know You\\" and \\"Blood on the Ground\\" are both real rockers, and \\"11am,\\" \\"Just a Phase,\\" and \\"Mexico\\" are all amazing songs that show the lighter side of incubus. It's definitely apparent that Brandon this singer has gone through some trouble with a lady friend, especially because he hasn't talked about women nearly as much as he does on the album. He sings the classic songs of a broken hearted man, however, but gives it the interesting twist that only Incubus can. I can't wait to hear these songs live as soon as I can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of \\"Morning View\\"","review":"First off, let me just say, I loved this CD. Incubus is different from other bands. They've got something to say. I'm mad about them. I love the way they use different instruments, and do things differently than other bands. Give the album a listen. It's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY IF YOU BUY THIS","review":"You should buy this album if you like anything incubus has ever done. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd!!!!!!","review":"first of all I heard about incubus in a hoobastank review, (im a hoobastank fan). people said hoobastank was a rip-off of incubus, and that they sounded alike. so I decided to get one of their cds hoping they might be as good as hoobastank. THEY ARE BETTER!!!. there is a bunch of awesome songs on this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"well I liked it...","review":"k so its not like old incubus and thats ok. not as good as science or anything but i mean come on not much can compare right? if youre more into the really old incubus tho like fungus amongus incubus its not like that at all. its a lot more mellow. and ok some of the songs lyrics aren't that great. the music is good but sometimes the lyrics get kind of un-climatic like...goodbye nice to know you over and over. but when i'm in certain moods i really like this cd. i mean thats why i love incubus so much is cuz they always have SOMETHING from one of their albums to offer when youre in almost any mood. its great. but depending on your taste it might not be for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Incubus I Knew","review":"Incubus is a great band i must say, but this album is very different than their older stuff. It happens like clockwork in many bands; they start off hardcore, creative, and heavy, and slowly move towards less creative and more mainstream music. If you were a fan of fungus amongus or S.C.I.E.N.C.E., you will be dissapointed with Morningview. But, this album deserves four stars, because the songs are still good, and if you had never heard Incubus's older stuff, you will most likely like this. The last song, even though very slow, has a mellowness and trippiness that is very cool. There are songs on this that will please any rock fan, but its not their best work. Go for S.C.I.E.N.C.E, an amazing hard rock album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy the damn album!","review":"After listening to \\"Morning View\\", a few things jump out at you. First of all, not a bit of their old metal personas, which were started to be discarded with \\"Make Yourself\\", remain with this album. Instead, this album simply spans from alternative to trippy pop. Second, the musical progression made from \\"Make Yourself\\" to \\"Morning View\\" is staggering. The songs on this album are tight, ending just when you want to hear something different. And finally, and most obviously, there is not a bad song in the bunch. Each add a unique part to the album as a whole, and make \\"Morning View\\" a fantastic album. If you don't already have it, go and buy Incubus' newest...you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"like it","review":"i am a big incubus fan. the first song i heard from them was new skin. this album is so very different from it. with this album you can just put it on and completely mellow out. incubus not only managed to make a good album with curse words, but also seemed to have mastered the softness of there strings, drums and volcals. this album will always be recommended by me to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD has no flavor","review":"This CD has no flavor. Every song is just one meaningless piece of trash after another. I really would like to know what happened to the band because they didn't sound like this before. This CD is just dull. I just don't like it that's all. I would recommend their earlier CDs though."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated, derivative ...","review":"this album is terrible, terrible, terrible. vaunted by teenyboppers and college kids as the future of rock, this band brings you nothing but whiny lyrics, derivative melodies, and all around sissydom. ... goooodbye incubus, nice to know you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Incubus","review":"I am sorry to say but this is by far the worst incubus album. They seem to be living of the pattern of Drive and ignore what really made them special. Their funk roots from their Previous albums like Fungus Amoungus, Enjoy Incubus and ever Make Yourself have almost toatally been left behind. In fact i would call this an album for love starved 14 year old girls.Weak incubus Weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOWN WITH (...) ROCK!!","review":"If there is one thing that I despise more than pop it is a \\"rock\\" band that doesn't know what rock is. These sell out backstreet n'stink wannabe's may have riffs, but that's the only piece of driftwood that they have to cling to in the dense ocean of music. Their first album was good, but all that this rubbish proves is that they're nothin' but southern-californian hippies who wouldn't know a true rock track if wacked them in the head with one of their surfboards and said, \\" Dude, pick up a Sabbath record.\\" (...) rock is a cancer almost as bad as pop (almost) and it is up to true fans of nu-metal, metal, thrash or whatever your favorite branch of rock is to snuff it out before it kills innocent people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sellouts","review":"Incubus used to be my favorite band. Fungus Amongus, Enjoy Incubus, SCIENCE, barely Make Yourself, but how could they sellout? Morning Veiw (besides its stupid name) shows the least talented part of Incubus. No one looks for talent anymore, just how thw band members are. All of the members are starting to look like Backstreet Boys. I just can't believe what they did."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAK","review":"this cd is so freaken WEAK. I listened to it while I was on a road trip, and I nearly fell asleep at the wheel! They've definately lost their touch. I no longer enjoy incubus because of this cd. Their lyrics have gotten to be repetitive--almost as much as dance music has gotten these days! Thanks to incubus, they've turned me back towards better bands like Adema, Primer 55, Blink 182, and Green Day.I don't recommend this cd to anybody going on a long road trip-- not only will it make you fall asleep at the wheel, it'll make the trip seem LONGER than it actually is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the $$$$$","review":"This album is not all that great.My favorite track on this albu mis the only track that they made a video for.This album isn't worth buying.I was very suprised about this album sucking so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to go back to the Incubator.","review":"This needs more heat and maybe then something good could hatch.

While some critics maintain the DJ is less present, he is distinctive throughout every song. Even on the gentle, Chinaesque \\"Aqueous Transmission,\\" listeners will unearth subtle scratching from stellar acoustic guitars and Brandon Boyd's pleeding and sometimes hypnotic vocals. Incubus brings hard and mellow rock together on \\"Morning View,\\" like \\"Blood on the Ground\\". \\"Circles,\\" \\"Have You Ever,\\" and \\"Under my Umbrella\\" are hard core, but the rest of the album is driving, pleasureful, and throbbing. This album is a MUST-HAVE. I've never heard so many great songs on one album. You're going to hear 10 of these songs on the radio and the name \\"Morning View\\" mentioned in the same sentence as Nirvana's \\"Nevermind.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An OK Incubus CD","review":"It is a different sound considering Incubus. Alot of the album sounds like there last single \\"Drive\\". Many songs are acoustic and soft. There are some songs like \\"Wish You Were Here\\", \\"Nice To Know You\\", and \\"Blood on the Ground\\" that are full of electric sound. No, I don't think Incubus is selling out. I do think Incubus is getting softer. Anyways, it is pretty much a good CD. Many people will enjoy it. Its just not something the mosh to."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCUBUS IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is an amazing cd. Their last cd \\"Make Yourself\\" was very good also. I recommend buying this because you'll be amazed at how good they really are!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Letting the sunshine in","review":"Filled with high energy and with descriptive lyrics, Incubus' third album \\"Morning View\\" comes out to be a joyful and uplifting scene. With acoustic tones and with a slow style of Nirvana, you get \\"Mexico\\". In \\"Aqueous Transmission\\" has very nice twangy guitar tone that'll give you a nice exotic feeling towards the album. \\"11 am\\" a detailed with a depressive mood but beautifully played. An unexpective song would have to be \\"Are You In\\" a nice song that gives the album and nice jazzy twist. Besides the slow acoustics tones and depressive lyrics, the album also comes with the normal accressive thrashers like \\"Circles\\", \\"Nice to Know You\\", \\"Blood on the Ground\\", and \\"Have you Ever\\". Without rap or screaming vocals found in most bands, it's nice to find a band that experiments and tries new styles without using the rage or aggression that much.

I'm a S.C.I.E.N.C.E. fan basically, and after that i could perosnally live without this band or thier brothers audiovent.

Hope this CD made you rich fellas because the fans of your early cd's will be more wary when they buy your next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Familiar but good","review":"I bought Morning View because I already love \\"Wish you were here\\" and I love \\"Make Yourself.\\" I think the new disc has a similar sound to make yourself, but that's good. there's less hard-rock guitaring, more slow and musical. and always with the odd phrases \\"the sky resembles a back-lit canopy with holes punched in it,\\" just like some of the nonsensical lyrics of Make Yourself. Overall, i think this will become one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so great?","review":"You cant deny the true pure talent shown by Incubus, but lately, the focus on the band seems to be more at Brandon's body, than the music. The last reviw i read was from some chick talking about how she liked that he took off his shirt. This completely pisses me off. This is a great band, and the music can just melt into you, and become a part of you, and these brain-dead little twelve year olds only see him, i bet you they dont even own S.C.I.E.N.C.E. Which is by far the best album. All i gotta say is if your gonna be a fan at least be a fan for the right reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"SELLOUTS....learn how to write lyrics...again","review":"This cd does not even compare to any of the first three Incubus albums. It all started going down hill with \\"Make Yourself\\". An apt title to preceed this album since \\"Morning View\\" is exactly like every other main stream rock album out there. Brandon used to have so much lyrical talent. Now all he does is sing \\"I wish you were here\\" over and over in the choruses. Or \\"good bye nice to know you\\". I guess it has a lot to do with doing too much drugs.

ENJOY the CD...you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid album from incubus","review":"Incubus, already regarded as a great band, have managed to keep it together and evolve with their excellent new album 'Morning View'. The cd, which was released while their breakthrough single 'Drive' was still climbing the charts, displays Incubus's new found maturity and music chops. Brandon Boyd's vocals are a bit whiny but compliment the music nicely, Mike's guitar is shimmering and while ultimately simple, is still interesting and *applauds* Einziger has really found his voice on the instrument! The rhythm section is a thumbs up, and while I don't tend to really enjoy a dj as part of a rock lineup, kilmore manages to add great effects to the overall sound and vibe of the record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"what happened??? Fungus Amongus, SCIENCE, make yourself all of which are incredible CDs. They are hard, they are innovative and they all have something to say. Morning View is just easy listening crap. With the success of Drive, and all of the fans that just hopped on the incubus fanbase because they heard that song without even hearing their older work, i beleive incubus has changed. Morning View is an example of that. If you listen to SCIENCE and than hear this CD, you would think its a different band. I just hope the next CD they plan to do goes back to the sound that their earlier CD's were representing. All in all if you are an early incubus fan... dont waste your money, but if you hopped on the bandwagon this will be your number 1 CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another sigh","review":"Maybe it's just because I used to love Incubus and they broke my heart, but I couldn't take this radio-friendly MOR mish-mash. Nice to know you - goodbye. At least they have a positive view of life; that's exceptionally rare these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best alternative rock CD out there.","review":"Ususally when I buy a CD there are only 2 or 3 good songs on the album, and the rest aren't worth listening to. But Morning View is totally different. Every song is unique in its own way. Most alternative rock bands out there today have no problem playing a good song, but the lyrics just aren't there. The deep spiritual lyrics matched with Brandon Boyd's voice really round out the album. I love the way they can move from \\"harder\\" songs, like Nice to Know You, Circles, and Have You Ever, to the more mellow 11 a.m., Are You In, Echo, Aqueous Transmission, and even the beautiful acoustic Mexico. This album is a great buy and I promise it will never leave your CD player!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incubus is rock","review":"This is my favorite Incubus CD. The mellow sounds of the band and the trippy riffs are the heat."},{"rating":"1","title":"It used to be good","review":"I went back to edit this review and I realized that I haven't listened to this album in a LONG time and it was a waste of money. I gave most of the songs good ratings but now I deleted all of them because i really can't stand this album anymore. I liked it when I liked incubus but now they're for teenage girls and not for people who prefer intelligent lyrics and astounding guitar work accompanied by a knock out rhythm section (i.e. Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd). Nu-metal is dying, so don't buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not what i expected","review":"i bought this cd with high expectations. i thought that after make yourself i would hear something more close to S.C.I.E.N.C.E. or even maybe fungusamungus and enjoy incubus, the best of them all. What i heard was not the incubus i once knew. what i heard was something more like various other bands today, such as Hoobastank..., they sound like hoobastank and all the other emotional music out there now. This cd is not compleatly awful, but most of the tracks are uninspired and forgettable, unlike the previous albums which featured unique and generally strange but good lyrics. This cd has a few good tracks, but the best is definatly circles, which is remenisant of better days. On the whole, i would not recommend this cd. Why? because older incubus is much better...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced","review":"...The guitarist (einzinger?) claimed that when making this cd they were trying to avoid sounding like all other bands in the cluttered nu-metal scene. They sure did accomplish their goal. They were trying to make music that doesn't sound like something, and it's pretty obvious. Gone is the fresh sound from science and make yourself, replaced with a sound that i can explain as nothing more than forced. I had always thought that incubus were artists; I was apparently mistaken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should own this album","review":"\\"Morning View\\" is a bit mellower than \\"S.C.I.E.N.C.E\\" or \\"Make Yourself\\", but it just shows that Incubus is willing to allow themselves room to evolve. I haven't been able to put this CD away since I got it about two months ago. There is a lot of experimental stuff on this album, like the closing track \\"Aqueous Transmission\\" which has a very Asian feel to it. Definitely one of the coolest albums to come out this year. Some of my personal high points on this album are \\"Just A Phase\\" (the 2 1/2 minute intro is awesome), \\"11 AM\\", \\"Echo\\" and \\"Are You In\\" (any song mentioning the coolness of seafoam green has to get some props)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evolving California band grows up to the next level","review":"Make Yourself was a breakthrough for Incubus, complete with a load of catchy, fairly positive tunes, and an almost fulfilling denouncement of their early rap/rock creations. So that makes Morning View an almost flawless release from a band that seems to eveolve with every waking step. With everything from the beautifully estranged \\"Mexico\\" to the mosh metal of \\"Blood On The Ground\\" and the gregarious keeper \\"Wish You Were Here\\", this CD is everything it should be. Singer Brandon Boyd, with his sturdy vocal range keeps it postive, while the rest of the band writes a musically effective soundtrack. Rap/rock cliches? Not in this life. Incubus is much more adult than that, and they've got a musical masterpiece to back it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"This CD is decent. Really, after the first three tracks it takes a dive. The lyrics are pretty weak, the music is all right. Nice to Know You and Circles are their best efforts on this. I know it was overplayed but I Wish You Were Here isn't that bad, it's all right. The rest of the album isn't bad, it's just boring and bland. Their previous works (even Make Yourself, because the music was still active and interesting and the lyrics were still great) were fabulous showcases of their talent and ability. Morning View is just a bland attempt at trying to have melody. Maybe a 12 year old thinks this music is profound, amazing, and/or hard, but not anyone who knows what those words mean and what this band is about. As people have stated before, buy all their albums, then buy this. It isn't bad, but it certainly isn't good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps being generous but","review":"I've only spun this disc twice, but I'm going to give Incubus benefit of the doubt. Okay \\"Wish you were here\\" sounds like a filler song, and that's what I thought the rest of the album was going to provide. B side material. After two listens I can say that this is a lot more laid back than 'Make yourself' which I thought was a pretty solid album. 'Morning View' does have some rocking moments. \\"Nice to Know you\\" the opening track, catches your ear, with the familar sound of Incubus' last effort. \\"Blood on the ground\\" another cool track. Then somewhere toward the middle or closer to the end the tracks get real mellow. So I'm being generous with four stars, but I have a feeling that this one is going to grow on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Let This Album Pass You By!","review":"Every Saturday Morning, I wake up, drink a cup of coffee, get in my ancient mini-van, blast Morning View from its yet-spry speakers during the drive to my favorite run, and emerge to face 74 minutes of sweat and joy heading this record's Warning! Absolute Must Have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff.","review":"All I really have to say is listen to the song \\"Just A Phase.\\" If you aren't sold after hearing that, then just listen to it again. I like the entire album, and think Incubus is one of the best bands out there today, but \\"Just A Phase\\" may be their best song ever. It's just that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Wow. This record is one that really captured me. I've had it for almost 2 years now and its still easily one of my favorites. It seems that Incubus reached their pinnacle as a band on Morning View, combining a whole collection of interesting, moving, loud and just plain amazing songs. Brendan's voice shines, the instrumentals skyrocket- this is rock like it was meant to be played. If you don't have it already, do yourself a favor and pick it up, you won't regret this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apocalypse Never","review":"Despite its claims, this documentary does not in fact prove that every time Apple comes out with a new product, Armageddon will follow. As I write, the iPad 3 has come to market and the heavens did not fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"What the future holds the World!","review":"Everyone needs to see this DVD. No matter if you are a Christian or not. I just saw it and it shows you all of the phrophecies that have come to pass out of the Bible. It was made in 1997. The world was bad back then, and seeing it in 2006 just confirms that just as fast as technology has made tremendous increase, evil in the world has done the same thing. They are predicting that a nuclear exchange would take place in the middle east, we are now closer to that than ever.The only book that predicts what the future holds with 100% accuracy is the Bible, Countdown to Eternity shows this beyond a shadow of a doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another promo for Al Gore","review":"As soon as they started quoting Al Gore as their main reference regarding man-made \\"Global Warming\\" (now called climate change because of the negative connotation attached to the previous term due to bad and corrupted data that had to be shredded), I had to stop taking it seriously because anything attached to Al Gore cannot be trusted. They also totally misrepresent Revelations, just as every other new age attempt to interpret scripture without knowing the culture at the time, knowing what they knew (the ancient Jewish scriptures), and knowing how to actually read the Bible for all its worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm always on the lookout for good examples of the \\"Heroic Bloodshed\\" genre of Hong Kong action films. I had heard about this film off and on over the years and finally decided to check it out. Unfortunately, \\"Hero of Tomorrow\\" has none of the qualities that make \\"Hard Boiled\\" and \\"The Killer\\" so spectacular. The story is muddled and uninteresting and what few action sequences there are come nowhere close to the bullet ballets of John Woo. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this iron just over a month ago and it no longer works.

I thought it would be a really nice iron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor craftsmanship","review":"I have this iron and the on/off switch no longer works. The iron is about two years old. For the $50.00 price tag, I would have expected the iron to last for a minimum of five years.My husband even called the Black and Decker customer service center to inquire if he could purchase the special screwdriver from them to open the bottom and see if he could fix the switch. The answer he received was the following \\"You're not suppose to open the iron\\". Well, if it was still working like it was suppose to, he wouldn't be inquiring about opening it up!I definitely would not purchase another small appliance from Black and Decker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"We were looking to replace an old iron and liked the features listed on the box. Auto shut-off, the ready indicator, self-clean feature, and the steaming options. What they don't put on the box is how annoying the beeping ready indicator and the warning beep that the iron is about to shut off, the three beeps indicating that the iron has shut off, and the annoying clicking sound it makes when it is plugged in but is shut off. These in addition to the leaking feature make this iron very hard to have and make ironing more of an annoying chore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prestige Iron","review":"This iron is the worse iron I have ever owned. When I first used the iron the water reservoir lid snapped off. So, I returned it and purchased the Prestige X805. The same thing, the water reservoir lid snapped off. I thought no biggy it still works. After about 2 months of use, it began to leak water. I'm not talking just a few trickles, it just pores out from the bottom of the iron. I can't return it and now I'm in the process of purchasing a new iron. I WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER BLACK & DECKER IRON!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT get out Wrinkles !","review":"Recieved this as a gift along with a Target gift receipt. I exchanged it 3 times thinking the first one was just a lemon. Well the iron does not have enough power to get out wrinkles. I spent 20 minutes ironing a sheet and it still looked like before I ironed it with all the wrinkles coming back. Does make an annoying noise when plugged in & turned off. I never put water in it because I was afraid it would leak like the the other reviews said. It was made in Mexico so maybe this brand had poor quality assurance. For a $59 iron it's the worst iron!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All Black & Decker Irons will leak water profusely, sooner or later...(though usually AFTER the warranty has expired)","review":"You have been forwarned! Every Black & Decker iron I have ever owned leaked water badly, sooner or later. Never mind the fact that their ON/OFF switches fail frequently, too, and either won't stay ON, or fail to turn themselves OFF after inactivity. Honestly, I am amazed that they continue to sell irons (have they no shame?), although there must be quite a demand for replacement irons, due to the fact that theirs self-destruct so predictably. Save yourself the grief!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Black and Decker Repair Centers","review":"I own a different iron than the one featured here, but it needs rewired. To find a repair center for these products is virtually impossible. I could do the repair myself, as it is a simple short in the wire, but it requires a special screw driver to open it up, a tool they will not sell to the general public. If Black and Decker will find me, I'll be happy to buy another Black and Decker product. But if their units can't be repaired at home, and you can't find a repairman, why buy another $100.00 iron?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Iron X820","review":"When I bought this iron, I was happy for 2 months, then it started to leak water, now every time I hit the steam button I don't get steam all I get is a water leak...

He is a terrific storyteller, and I eagerly await his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work at all.","review":"This product is worthless, does not record the number to call when the alarm triggers, just redial the last number you dial so you cant use it as a regular phone if you dont remember allways that, and worst of all... it does not work at all, as soon as you put the alarm on, the phone start dialing the number no matter what, sad thing for what could be a very good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contemporary History, Sort Of","review":"This book tries to give a bit of everything, but ends up doing nothing very well. First, the book is not very large, which is not a good sign when you are trying to cover two thousand years worth of history. The biggest section in the book discusses what is going on in the modern Orthodox world in the various Orthodox jurisdictions. Unfortunately, even this information is not very helpful as it was not especially accurate. The author's claims, for example, about the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia are exaggerated; the author essentially take the statements of a few firebrands within ROCOR and projects them onto the entire jurisdiction as though the statements are ROCOR's official position or dominant belief. Readers would be better served reading The Orthodox Church by Bp. Kallistos, or even Fr. Alexander Schmemann's The Historical Road of Eastern Orthodoxy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great voice and banjo player.","review":"If you like New Orleans Jazz, you will absolutely love her playing and singing.

Unfortunately, this is the least appealing of the four. The songs are second rate, the mixing is of the voices is uninspired, and the orchestration is substandard. One of my favorites, \\"It's A Small World,\\" is a mechanical performance accompanied by an equally monotonous synthesized strings. Admittedly, I had high expectations for this CD. Afterall, Disney is noted for stimulating fantasy and excitement. Unfortunately, this CD is more suited for MUZAK than Disneyworld."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"If it were possible to rate this recording ten stars, or twenty, I would.

None of these songs are sung by Disney's animated characters except for a few brief seconds of Mickey Mouse speaking during the first song. This was a big disappointment for us.All songs are performed by a rather bland sounding singer accompanied by a bland bluegrass/folk band and an even more bland group of young backup singers. Are you catching my theme here? Childrens' music is supposed to be fun and playful, but the performances here are too polished and completely lacking in real gusto. There's just very little here to really engage the young listener's attention, and adults will find it pretty dull as well. There are plenty of better choices in the category of childrens' music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genre Film. Gambling Western Motif","review":"This is the definition of a genre film if ever there was one. It's a story of a gambler out west who gets into trouble and has to end up shooting his way out of it.

In fewer than three hundred pages it details the history of Rome (city and empire) from the Etruscan period through the republic, empire and founding of Constantinople to the fall under Romulus Augustulus. The book concludes with a chapter on the legacy of Rome. Certainly this is a fine addition to any general library, written at an educated popular level and concluding with a short bibliography (four of Grant's detailed works are listed, which shows the level or reference). The illustrations and computer generated views of the city at the height of power are added bonuses (bonae?). I might have some use for an absent index at some time, but I am sure the books in the biblio would have more detail.

It has a good introduction to group theory, which is the principal branch of mathematics that deals with the topics needed to understand symmetry, and it covers some types of symmetries usually neglected, like color symmetry. It's not at a very high level, which is good if you're starting off, but not if you already have a good dose of the necessary material. In other words, this is an introductory book and will not satisfy you if you are looking for a more advanced text, but I recommend it as a first book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's shoot straight!","review":"I've had these pickups in my american strat for 2 years and I love these pickups but heres the deal.

I've read many reviews and other ppl experiencing the same thing. And its not a ground issue its just the way the pick ups are made. So if your playing blues or rock or doing something with alot of soloing then these bad boys are great! And I love the blues but I primarily play in church so for my setting they are little to aggressive even when im clean and little too noisy for the FOH when they are mic'ed up.

The editing between skits is a little weird, but they are all master tapes. If you were a fan of Tom's run on MTV, you'll love this DVD to add to your collection. Highly recomended for any Tom fan.

The telephone set is very warm while charging makes holding it quite uncomfortable. The dial buttons are very hard to press & insensitive, I have to used extra efforts to press them frequently. Clearity is no better than the 900 analog, I recived lots of compaints from the person whom I called, espeacially when I used it in front of a computer, I had to change to speak on a normal phone. Keep your money to buy something else, it's just a waste of $50."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this phone","review":"The major feature that I wanted was volume. It gave me that and that is about it. There is a static that will not go away when the phone is in use. The manuel tells you to do several things if there is static and if none work then you are out of luck. None worked for me. I will never buy an ATT phone again."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This is the most horrible piece of garbage you could possibly waste your money on. Even if someone gave me this piece of poop I would fly over the Pacific Ocean and drop it into the deepest spot I could find. The battery lasts about 10 minutes and I can not seem to make it pick up if I have voice mail waiting. I think I am going to package this thing up with the slinkiest pile of dog caca I can find and mail it to my worst freakin enemy. I believe the combination of this phone and a hot steaming pile of dog crap will convey the message that I despise their very existence. So, save your money and if you really want some crap, I will send you some, I have time. This thing is truly Garbage, poop, caca, crap, and not worth your money. If I could give this zero stars, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I purchased this phone when Amazon. com was running a rebate special--the phone's final price was ($$$). Well, the phone is worth about ($$$)! It does have some nice features such as digital spread and speed dial. Plus, the design is rather compact. However, the sound is not too clear and calls get dropped. Furthermore, this phone constantly caused my phone line to stop working (granted, I also had a computer and answering machine hooked up). After a few months, I decided to buy a Michael Graves phone from Target (also available through Amazon)--that phone works perfectly and my phone line is in tact!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 purchased 2 bad","review":"I purchased 2 AT&T 900 Mhz DSS phones and was disappointed that after 2 months, both handsets were not communicating with the base unit.The handsets establish an open connection and tie the line up, but I can't get a dial tone.

It had an ecoh sound and the range was only 50 feet before it started to have really bad audio. It refused to connect with the base often (BEEP BEEP).

After a couple of months, the line buzzes when used, it occasionally doesn't pick a channel when used, and after a while it stopped disconnecting/charging when the phone was placed on the base. I replaced it with a 4 year old Panasonic 900Mhz (and bought a new Panasonic as well). I have owned 900Mhz phones made by AT&T, Panasonic and VTech and Panasonic phones seem to have the best range, sound and features for the money (especially in New York City where there is a lot of interference)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Overview - Short but Sweet","review":"I must admit that this is the first biography of Prokofiev that I have ever read.

This cd is not bad, but it is NOT a classic. Granted I'm still waiting, Ozzy has had his slumps in the past, and this isn't a BAD album, its just NOT a classic.The classics are the obvious 81, 82 releases BLIZZ and DIARY; also 1991's NO MORE TEARS and even 1995's OZZMOSIS has some styling of a classic album, even though a few weak spots it still is a heavy hitter.I feel like we've got something here to tide us over until the real offering comes. Ozzy is in a shaky point in his psyco-cycle and I know he ain't getting younger, but theres at least one more classic left in him. This ain't it. This is just another NO REST FOR THE WICKED or ULTIMATE SIN, they're good, but they're not CLASSIC."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's Back!","review":"This is a great comeback album for Ozzy. It's a lot heavier than his previous work and doessn't sound like his original albums but he still rocks like a mother.Gets Me Through- Good Opener.It's the first single.Not Great. 8/10Facing Hell- Heavy Stuff.Great Vocals, Great Music. 10/10Dreamer- A little soft for my tastes but still really good 8/10No easy way Out- More Great vocals and awesome riffs 10/10That I never Had- Better on Live At Budokan 7/10You know...Pt.

I like Ozzy with Black Sabbath, and I like Ozzy on his own up until about 1986. I just cannot accept Zakk Wylde. I think his riffs and his solos suck. Too hokey. Anyway, I was listening to the album and was pleasantly surprised. I thought that I would hate it, but I kind of like it. I think because Joe Holmes wrote most of the album it works well. Black Sabbath fans will also recognize Geoff Nicholls plays a role in some of the better songs on the album too. Basically it is solid with some great heavy rockers. The problems, and there are a few. FIRE ZAKK! The songs move along until the time for a solo, and Zakk's do not work. He is no Randy Rhodes, no Jake E Lee, and not even a Joe Holmes. Enough already with Zakk. Next, the lyrics are often painfully stupid. The ballad Dreamer is probably worst song ever made, and lastly I along with millions of others are waiting for BLACK SABBATH, not Ozzy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ozzmosis is complete","review":"I thought it couldn't get any better. I guess I was wrong. Down to Earth has all the makings of a great album. First you have that great OZZY rock mixed with a litte bit of a softer side (no more tears).I couldn't have asked for anymore of a great album. \\"Gets me through\\" is one in a million. A great rock song mixed with great guitar. When the song \\"Dreamer\\" combines OZZY's rock side with a softer side.Year after year OZZY keeps us entertained with OZZFEST and yet he still puts out studio albums. The next album will not come soon enough.OZZY will always rule the charts and rock out concerts all around the world. OZZY RULES!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Godfather","review":"The Ozzman proves to us all one more time that we should bow down and beg for mercy.

So loyal OzzFans... what are ya waiting for? BUY THIS DISC!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ozzy, Asleep at the wheel!","review":"I can rate this with one word, LAME. I am an Ozzy fan and love alot of his records. Although Zakk Wylde plays on the record, he wasn't involved at all in the writing, which is a huge mistake. He is writing the heaviest riffs of his career with BLS, too bad Ozzy's corporate influences pushed him toward a mainstream, moderate rock record opposed to rip your head off metal. THis record makes Ozzmosis look like a Slayer record. This is so far removed from his other Zakk era records, it might be time for retirement."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good ablum - Just give it some time","review":"I remember that when i first started to hearing this album i didnt like it. I thought it was dull and boring. Well i was wrong. After some hearings i like it. Its not an album to love, but its an album to like it. Its definitley a good album.

If you are a fan of ozzy (As i am ) then just but this album ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ozzy rocks","review":"No, this may not be the greatest Ozzy album, but since when does an Ozzy album need to be his greatest to earn 5 stars?

It's just gotton so boring now. He's 50-something years old,his voice gets more annoying as each album passes,and ozzfest is a total waste of time! The guitars riffs sound recycled,the energy is gone,and ozzy just can't sing anymore. So sad...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ozzmosis was better","review":"Yawn... Very Boring album. I wish he didn't put out this album.From Blizzard of Oz through No More Tears served as masterpieces. Even Ozzmosis had it's moments.

There was a few tracks that were really good, however overall it seems to me that Ozzy has lost his hardcore edge that he used to have, tracks like \\"Facing Hell\\", \\"Junkie\\", \\"Black Illusion\\" and \\"Can You Hear Them\\" are my personal favorites off of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goood Stuff","review":"it seems that as of late, ozzy has been quite disappointed with the ongoing music scene influenced by boybands and teen queens.

His voice is magnificent in the new \\"Down to Earth\\" cd. Unfortunately, you do not hear Zack W. on leads like in Ozzmosis but overall this cd is excellent!The melodies and lyrics are original but true Ozzy classics. Ozzy sticks to the old Ozzy that we all love. If you are an Ozzy fan this cd will please you."},{"rating":"1","title":"ratings...","review":"Why do people rate this album 5 stars?!!? c'mon - this isn't five star material. That is reserved for Blizzard of Oz and Diary of a Madman. Nothing else has achieved that level since.I think some people treat Ozzy like George Lucas. It doesn't matter how mediocre the work, they will rate it 5 stars and use the cliched \\"OZZY IS GOD\\" arguement.Certainly, Down to Earth isn't 5 star material. It ranks more towards the bottom of his works. SOme of the songs get boring, with generic mediocre riffs. Look for a used copy, but dont pay full price for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ozzy is [...]","review":"This album would be one of the worst albums ever ifit wasn't for Zakk Waylde. Ozzy clearly uses studioeffects to cover up his terrible voice. He is justold and tired here and it shows. Dreamer has to beone of the worst songs I've ever heard. Truefullythe only song on here that is worth it is \\"Gets MeThrough\\" and that is only because(surprise) Zakksplaying like it has been with the rest of thealbums.

Am I missing something?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Album But Songs Are Definately Not Memorable","review":"This is a decent album but the songs don't have the consistency, spark, or energy of past albums. The flaw is due the fact that on this album, the producer, Tim Palmer, and people like Dave Grohl (Foo Fighters) wrote most of the guitar tracks. At the last minute, they brought in Zakk Wylde to basically play as a studio musician and give the songs some balls. (ala No Rest for the Wicked & the No More Tears albums). Zakk rehabs some songs but not all. This album is a 4 out of 10. Let Zakk write next time!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I finally put my finger on what was wrong...","review":"I finally put my finger on what was wrong... This CD sounds like it was produced like pop albums, this one even has a sample or two (once unheard of for this type of music). I liken it to a pop CD, not because of the sound (it definately has some heavy riffs, some of them even very good thanks to Zakk), the problem is... everything is too perfect, it sounds processed it sounds like a manufactured product that's passed quality assurance. Metallica's Load re ReLoad have this same quality and I think Metal fans hate it.Other problem is the writting, Ozzy knows how to put togeather a \\"good song\\", but he's still looking back on his past glory days and that's all he can write about, it's kind of sad. A few reviers have noticed the Beatles inspiration, on this CD it's so in your face that I could have sworn Dreamer was a John Lennon cover, I had to check the credits.Buy if you must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets Me Through","review":"It seems that age doesn't affect Ozzy's limits...he has been the king of heavy rock. This is quite a heavy album but the quality of the songs is quite high.

Since the days of Sabbath, to now.Gets Me Through-Really good start. This one was written for his fans.Facing Hell-Amazing...Dreamer-Good ballad about everything going wrong these days (from the wars to global warming to hate, anger and bigotry)No Easy Way Out-Really good song that I can somewhat relate toThat I Never Had-Hell...who doesn't want something that they've never had?You Know...(Part 1)-A very short song to his kids.Junkie-Great song containing the one swear word of this cd. Ozzy can definitely relate to this.Running Out Of Time-All I have to say is this:No!!! Ozzy can't die!!!Black Illusion-Pretty good song, but I don't know what he was thinking in the chorus.Alive-Awesome song.Can You Hear Them?-This song is amazing.If you are a TRUE fan of the Prince of Darkness, you will buy this cd and play it over and over and over and over again.

Nothing he's done in the 20 years can hold a candle to his albums with Randy and early Sabbath. He is all about the money. Money. Money. Money.

Saying this is the best release of 2001 doesn't do this enough justice. After 6 years of Ozzfest, Ozzy is back and is kicking more...than ever before. From the eerie start of \\"Gets Me Through\\" to the last note of the CD this is one awesome disc. The best tracks are \\"Gets Me Through\\", \\"Facing Hell\\", \\"That I Never Had\\", \\"Junkie\\", and the ballad \\"Dreamer\\". Though these stand out..the entire CD is good.

I never really considered Zakk Wylde the godlike guitarist he's often heralded as, but he surely knows what he's doing. Good vox/lyrics from Ozzy too. I hate it when people say Ozzy can't sing. His voice may not be the greatest in the world, but he's far superior to Fred Durst, Jon Davis, and all those other numetal \\"vocalists\\".

The final product is always a hallow, lame, and redundant mess. Considering Ozzy has not made music or lyrics for decades. This cd of course is passionless. Ozzy just sings the words written down for him.Not matter how many people Sharon gathers together. She will never make Ozzy an excellent cd. Why you ask? Because Ozzy doesn't make the music. If it came from Ozzy's heart and soul his solo music would be outstanding.Skip this cd because none of the music is good. Plus Ozzy's voice is terrible. He doesn't even sing in concert anymore.

They're more dreamy than Lush, but that's the best fit to describe their style.I really like the lead singer, Danella Hocevar, not that's she's great, her power is somewhat limited, but the nonchalant way she phrases things, the little tweaks in her voice really grab me. Plus, chicks that play loud electric guitars . . . well, that's why I fell in in love with Lush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Assumes its readers to be Engineers","review":"It assumes its readers to be Engineers. Good book and all too rare. There are lots of other good Automotive electronics books around but they are, as far as I've seen, all from a test and repair/diagnostic-technician perspective. None of these others have any real engineering content. This book is jam packed with engineering insights that no one writing for a technician audience would bother with or perhaps even dare to bring up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shop Teacher","review":"This book is marginal in electronic theory and as a how to trouble shoot and repair information.All subject material is given a broad brush.Not recommened for the automotive gear head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Irish Literature","review":"I'm about to travel to Ireland and this book was recommended.

I actively hoped for the murder of one character, and prayed for the protagonist to grow a spine at some point, but she never did. I kept hearing about Edna O'Brien's humor, and searched for in these pages in vain.

Until 2011, this year alone We have gone through 4 Sprayers! IFA said it is one of the most returned items.

Inspired??? It's more like he copied 85% of Sakurai's book including exercises (he barely changed the title too). Since Sakurai's book is good that makes this book not bad but I recommend you buy Sakurai and get it straight from the horse's mouth instead of from this plagorized text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Unlike other textbooks which cover very abstract notions from the first chapter on, Townsend does a very good job of explaining simple concepts that will prove to be invaluable towards sharpening one's physical intuition. Townsend does not pretend that it is profound and often cites other references that are more challenging to read so for the physics enthusiast, they appetite is satisfied nonetheless. In summary, his book is an excellent introduction to very fundamental aspects of wave mechanics using both bras and kets plus operator notation. A must-read if you want to ground your understanding of quantum mechanics in very accessible and tangible physical arguments, especially if you have a bad memory like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great sounds horrible","review":"Just picked this up to play with my primary acoustic.

For $10 bucks more than the apple dock (standalone) you get a dock with ac adapter, a 3.5 mm to 3 RCA cable, an S video cable, a travel charger for the ipod (separate from the dock power supply), a remote, and a dock connector to 3 RCA cable (not dock connector to 2 RCA audio as advertised). Buying these components separately from quality manufacturers would cost over $100. The problem is that Cables to Go is not a quality manufacturer. The dock produced an audible hiss and reversed the audio signal, so that that the left speaker played what the right speaker was supposed to play and vice versa. Further, the remote was extremely shoddy, requiring multiple button presses and extremely accurate aiming even at a distance of 12 feet. I did not use any of the cables, but if they are anything like the dock I'd avoid them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for research","review":"A great book for research.

I mean, every single page is a picture, so none of the nice features of Kindle, like word lookup, will work. I understand that this book has a singular layout because of the drawings by the author, and that's likely the reason they turned the book into a set of pictures. But I think is dishonest not to stablish it clearly on the product description. I think is deceiving.

However, I wanted to buy an e-book version. But Amazon is making this product only available for certain devices, like their new Fire. I have an older Kindle, and I really resent this attempt to control what device I can read on. I usually support Amazon wholeheartedly, and, as an author who supports independent authors, I have sung its praises. But this type of consumer tactic leaves a terrible taste in my mouth. Frankly, it was not worth it, shaking my loyalty just to try to get me to buy a device I will not buy. I am disappointed in Amazon, and hope it will re-consider."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great children's night time book!","review":"A fantastic story of a \\"Little Prince\\" who travels the all over space and lastly earth.

There was a genuine, child-like quality to it that rang true to the books character and that of it's charming little prince. The new translation took me by surprise as I was not aware that it had been re-translated and sadly, the surprise was not a happy one. It just doesn't feel like the same book to me, and tragically, the original translation appears to be out of print now. Why in God's name did they feel the need to fix something that was in no way broken? Ghaaaa! Child-like and genuine has been replaced by rigid and sterile. The Little Prince would weep. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"I DIDN'T READ IT (in English)","review":"I read this book in German (Der Kleine Prinz), I liked it and thought I should order the English for a friend. The Little Prince went there ... but I don't know what my friend thought about. All I know is: Language is culture, e.g. a book originally written in French, later translated to German and also to English (British or US-English?) may or don't make the same \\"good\\" impression any reader. So I'm not able to create a review for The Little Prince."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story, not an eBook","review":"The original illustrations are the most wonderful part of this book (Kindle Edition), and essential (a good word) to its meaning. They are captured here magnificently. A classic in every sense, readers are cautioned that this is not really an eBook but an actual series of graphic illustrations, including the text. Hence no TOC, index, x-ray, text-to-speech or any of the other eBook comforts, but it reflects the original work faithfully - the book didn't have text-to-speech or font-resizing either, but one star off because it IS listed as a Kindle Edition and is without those features. And yes, Howard's translation is more \\"exact,\\" losing some of the poetic flavor of Woods' translation, but I think the meaning is not lost.

There are certainly moments that make you cringe - poor recordings, raw and some silly songs. But, there are some great moments that remind you of the power and talent of this hungry band. Baby is a standout tune that is Beattlesque and showcases Garay's vision for the band. As a matter of fact there are a lot of classic Garay tunes included here such as you're a Liar and the rare What would you say? There is also a great powerhouse remake of AC DC's tune Ride On. There is some hint at their more progressive future on tunes such as Pulpo and experimental Hulings/Broaddus tunes. It is also nice to hear the humor that was a big part of their earlier days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seller was great, but Amazon product picture incorrect.","review":"The seller was great, a 5 star rating, but the picture of the VHS tape is not right. The amount of video tape is actually one third of the amount shown.

That should be made clear. The EP version is obviously very bad compared to the the SP version. This is not the seller's fault.

I hate to admit it, but sometimes I'll stay in my daughter's room after she's fallen asleep, just to listen to the end of the disc. For babies, the music is soft and soothing.

I babysat a lot and he and I got to know it well. When I had my own baby last year I was so happy I could find it! I ordered it right away and it lived up to my memory. It's got songs that you can sing along with even if you're like me and have a terrible voice (by the way, baby doesn't care if you carry a tune-he just likes to hear you sing). I enjoy the songs. They're cute, pleasant and relaxing - just what the doctor ordered at bed time. There are 1 or 2 songs I could do without but I like the majority of them. For those who find the songs boring or slow-of course they are; they're lullabies!

Luckily, my 2 year old isn't too thrilled with it either and just asks me to play the first song (when you wish upon a star) over and over. I'm going to have to find that song on another album with a better singer. I'd recommend not wasting your money on this cd.

Professor Sachar's book tells us, in compelling detail, how our ancestors lived - and died - in Europe and Russia and the meciless anti-Semitism that pushed our ancestors to these shores.Page after page, the Jews who trembled and the Jews who triumphed, come to life as Professor Sachar recounts Jewish life in the Old World. The array of information in the book is sometimes overwhelming but always revealing about how Jews hung on to life and beliefs through the tortured course of European history.\\"A History of the Jews in the Modern World\\" tells it all. Between its covers American Jews will learn, identify and be grateful to their ancestors for coming to America"},{"rating":"2","title":"There is hope for a peaceful future","review":"In a time when war is brought into our livingrooms by embedded journalists with minute-to-minute accounts and live feeds it is refreshing to know that there is a potential for peace. Douglas Fry convinces his reader that humans have a tremendous capacity for peacefulness by addresing both agressive and nurturing behaviors and their ability to coincide in many societies. His arguments regarding peaceful conflict resolution are both valid and persuasive. I would highly reccomend this book to anyone who is hopeful for a peaceful future. It is exceptional reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Product","review":"I had this product less than a year. When I first installed it the Windows XP had trouble in recognizing it. Finally it did after spending some time trying to find a proper driver. I used this card mainly to connect and external drive to an old Pentium III that had only 1.1 USB connections. At first did not see the drive. found out that the drive needed to be connected long time (4 or more hours) until I could get accessibility through this USB connection. While connected it worked well. Finally 3 weeks ago the card stopped working completely and I need to replace it. Do not bother purchasing it.

I love in on all 22LR rifle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really does work","review":"Following the instructions on zeroing in this scope, it was right on at 100 yards. I also like the reicle: heavy lines to the outside then fine lines at the crosshairs' center. I only tried this with the 40 grain turrets and bullets. I have since removed the scope to put on a different .22, so I'll have to do t all over again. Also, as I use 2 different 40 grain bullets, one being hi-velocity, we shall see how it works then. If one were to use a different bullet weight, and turret, I assume you'd have to go through the sighting in process all over again.It's also smaller and lighter than my Tasco Mil-dot scope I had on my 10/22 previously, one of the reasons I bough it in the first place. For sure you can spend a lot of money on scopes for the .22, but this seems just right, and a bargain for the price I paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why don't you have one yet?","review":"If your going to be shooting a .22 at different yardage all the time, you need this one.

They emailed me a prepaid FedEx label to return it, which I am doing today. Good optics on the 'scope, but I could NOT adjust the bullet's point of impact up or down.

Probably the best 22lr scope you can buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing","review":"Having read numerous reviews depicting this scope as excellent I was quite excited when it finally arrived. Unfortunately, when I got it out to the range I discovered it to be extremely sub-par. The windage correction does not work at all. The factory standard sight picture came set extremely low and off to the right. At 25 yards I couldn't even see the bullet impact point through the scope. After an hour of tinkering with it, I still couldn't bring the crosshairs down far enough to the impact point to consider it accurate in regards to bullet drop. Like I said, the windage correction does not work at all. At 15 yards the rifle was firing almost two feet to the right, with the scope set to full correction, of where the crosshairs were aligned. All I can say is that the magnification seems to work properly and I hope BSA has an excellent customer service department."},{"rating":"1","title":"over priced.","review":"Why would I spend $137.00 here when I can go to Walmart and get the exact same the.g for $39.00?

If the turrets are accurate, then it's the buy of the year. It's clear, solid, and the screw in endcaps are a great touch for storage or transport. Maybe a touch heavy, and the eye relief could be a bit longer. But since 22's have little or no kick, eye relief doesn't matter much. It's not a big issue anyway.I shoot 22's a lot, I'm a bit of a junkie really, great practice for far less money. I've recommended the sweet 22 to several buddies who also bought and love it.

He's crazy. He thinks that gay porn is going to change the way society views gay men. He thinks that porn has all this super ultra cultural significance. And he goes to elaborate, fancy worded reasonings which completely baffled me.Porn is nothing more than visual pleasure for sexual purposes whether self gratifying or with a partner. I don't see a huge political motivation behind it, and that any life changing opinion or radical societal acceptance of it will occur ever in the existence of this world as we know it. He believes all history needs to be rewritten to tell the real story. It's only a white man's world.That turned me off right from the start, but even going through the book, I still couldn't figure him out.It's visual pleasure, pure and simple, to get your rocks off. Just like a guy. Women react with the emotions, men act through their penises. Rocket science not necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"I sad","review":"Right door was broken. It is not opened.

You'd have to feel a personal stake in the outdated conservative politics Podhoretz emblematizes or be deeply curious about a group of New York intellectuals who believed they were the center of the known universe in the Fifties, but who have hardly left a cultural legacy as important as (say) Bloomsbury or the Paris Lost Generation. Who the hell cares about the Trillings anymore, or about Lillian Hellman?

I always had the feeling that most of the New York intellectuals were and still are communinists. They hate America and Americans-though this book doesn't come out and state it directly, every page implies it.

She was also raised in a convent then on a farm so she would thereby be more sheltered than even the other 17 year old young girls. She was a very young 17. It might have made more sense for Ms. Hazard to yes, take Lili from the Moorland farm and live with Cornelia and Alastair but still wait until she was of age to do the Season.

It captures that magic of the book way beyond my expectations. My husband even liked it. The second half of the season took on a life of it's own and they must have been running out of material as the episodes became obviously preachy with good messages about racism, logging and other weighty issues. They are good messages but a little too obvious and less magical. Still, it's a fine series and I would recommend it to anyone who is tired of sex, violence and crudeness dominating the TV air ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need more series like this","review":"If you are a fan of shows like Little House on the Prairie, you will enjoy this family-oriented show. Christy has plenty of adventure as well as romance and is unafraid to discuss the characters' religious beliefs.

I think the only addition that would have been nice to have was some commentary by the stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely Done","review":"This was a present for my wife and she loves it. She prefers the series with Kellie Martin as Christy and this set contains only those episodes. The film quality is fine.

The story of a young woman from the city finding her niche in the lives of appalachian people at the turn of the century.

Add a pinch of romance and the uncertainties that go with it, sprinkle with humor and you have a winning recipe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Favorite !","review":"I have both the book and this complete DVD series.

The shows are wonderful. I am using them for a Sunday school class and it is a big hit.

I was disappointed that there were no extras at all for this show - not even a behind the scenes doc or interviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful.......... Just a Wonderful Production","review":"This TV series is a wonderful production. I as the rest of the world first saw this on TV in the 1990's and was delighted when it was put out on DVD. I am so glad that they put such wonderful productions on DVD for both young and old alike to enjoy for years to come.This production is a must have in you private collection it is truly a delight to own and watch whenever one would like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Cent!","review":"This rather short-lived TV series was everything I look for in a television show, and almost never find--believable, compassionate characters, brilliant acting, and a compelling script. Even the music is touching! I was thrilled when this series became available on DVD and couldn't wait to see the series all over again.Kellie Martin is thoroughly convincing as sweet and naive Christy Huddleston, Tyne Daly is nothing short of spectacular as the iron-rod-firm yet gentle Miss Alice (that's got to be such a tough combination for an actor to master!), and the rest of the actors were exceptionally well-cast.The DVD was worth every cent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"If you are thinking about buying this, don't hesitate. This was such a good series to watch... I can't even describe it. It was filled with the right amount of everything, yet portrayed Catherine Marshall's book well too. Kellie Martin did a fabulous job, and the other actors and actresses did as well. It's something the kids can watch, but that doesn't mean adults won't like it. I wonder why they stopped making tv shows like this every time I watch it. This series is something I will probably never grow tired of watching!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a series for the whole family","review":"You will laugh , you will cry and you will find yourself immersed in joy. This series will bring you closer to those you love and bring out the best in you as you see the struggles people face in Cutter Gap, their faith gives them the strength to pull together and face any difficulity that may come about. As Miss Alice tells Christy \\" Hold on to joy\\". This is just what you and your family will do . This is a 5* all the way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY CHANGE A PERFECT STORY ?","review":"First, I do really like the Christy DVDs, don't get me wrong. They are lovely, and has some marvelous acting by several characters, and in themselves they are a good story.....BUT...well, they are a far, far call from the original story by Catherine Marshall. So many of the plots are so far fetched as to be a little ridiculous- such as the doctors dead wife returning.Also, the hardship Christy underwent is not really apparent.Just my 2cents worth...."},{"rating":"2","title":"All time favorite with my kids","review":"This is an exuberantly high energy kids cd.

My boys, all grown now, loved this so much that we destroyed 2 cassettes from playing so often. So glad when we were able to get on CD.

I originally had the cassette version which I tried to convert to CD but we had played it too much and the quality was lost.

This is one you MUST have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantabulous!","review":"I love this thing! When \\"Shake It All About\\" first came out on cassette tape (early 90s?), I got it for my kids and we all liked it so much, I gave a copy to every new parent I knew. Our copy of the tape wore out after a few years, and a replacement was nowhere to be found. So glad it's available again, and in a more modern format. What a hoot! And, you not only can, but should, dance to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"RhinoSkin Aluminum folding case","review":"I, too, had heard that these were primo cases. I purchased one on-line for my new m-515 and had it in my paws in short order. When I opened the box, I found exactly what I had seen on the computer screen - sort of.The pictures on the RhinoSkin web-page show a beautifully-styled case. What they DON'T show is the tacky, cheap-looking exterior hinge, replete with sharp edges on both ends. The inside edges of the case were kind of sharp, too. A real let-down, but I was really happy I didn't spring for the titanium version.This turkey went back into the box and was promptly exchanged for the pricier Palm aluminum case. If shopping for an upscale, tough-as-nails, and convenient-to-use SUV-class case for your Palm, the Palm product is the one to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for an M505","review":"I had heard this was the best cases on the market when they came out and were originally designed for the Palm V. However, while the new cases say they fit the M505, mine did not. The rail was too skinny and my Palm M505 slid right off the rail and onto the floor--thank goodness it was carpeted! They supply plastic adjusters to slide onto the rail so it can fit the Palm V, but my husband tried his on it and it slid off too. Most other reviewers just put a piece of tape on the end so that it will provide a catch to hold it on the rail--but, I don't like having to pay so much for a case and having to provide my own tacky fixes! I tried the case on an M500 and it fit good, but not it does not fit for the M505."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed for the Iraq Desert","review":"I am deployed to Iraq (LSA Anaconda) and I really enjoy the aluminum hard case...I slip my pda into the pocket of my military uniform and sometimes I would worry about knocking it around. Not anymore...the case is strong...light weight...easy on the eyes...and I thought the price was great off of Amazon.com...I keep a lot of good information on my pda and feel confident that I wont loose it now...If you hot sync frequently I would recommend taking the pda out of the case first and then place it in the cradle...easy enough...I am very pleased with the case and would recommend one to my friends.thanks for listeningJoe in Desert"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this piece of plastic?","review":"Urgh, I had high hopes but ended up returning this piece of plastic that looked like something someone tossed out on the side of the street.

I highly recommend this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hearts Second Season Starts Slow","review":"The first season of Hearts Afire rocks! But the writing and the plot lines in the second season are a little weak. I am now remembering being disappointed watching them when originally aired on CBS. But the later episodes this season get a little better. If you were a fan of the show, it's worth the purchase, but if you are trying to experience the show for the first time, the first season is the way to go. Missing from the second are the hillarious characters of Senator Smithers, Miss Star, and Adam. Now all we need are the funny Delta Burke seasons of Designing Women and Women of the House."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hearts A Fire was a great show","review":"I have bought all the seasons of this great show. I love Billy Bob Thorton in this show. John Ritter and Markie Post had great chemistry together. Billy Bob Thorton and his most famous saying was \\"thats just a rule I have\\" never gets old. I think alot of us have those same rules, but do not voice it the same way.The entire cast had fun doing this show and it really really shows.My favorite seasons are after they move back to there home town.Watching Markie Post adjust to country life after always living in the big city was great. This is well worth what I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The usual Rollin problems...","review":"...which are: The subject matter would usually lend for a visual feast. However Jean Rollin manages to be an ultimate bore when it comes down to the cinematography in this production. When we all know from \\"Rape of the Vampire\\" and \\"Fascination\\" that compelling visuals can be his strength. The lighting is flat, compositions plain.The editing is sloooooow. Do we really need to see a guy walk across a field until he disappears into the horizon? In an end sequence maybe, however not in the middle of a story that already tends to induce sleep.My favorite: the girl that shoots herself in front of an audience. No gun smoke, no jerky body movement, no blood.The acting is as usual questionable however this is most likely not a priority when watching a Rollin film. The majority of costumes look homemade. Or completely pretentious.Bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Nude Vampire","review":"Months later, I forgot what I have seen in details. Nude scenes? Can't remember. Vampire?

That being said, these modular inserts are great. They really make your multimedia area look clean and professional. You typically don't unplug and reinsert cables after you get things set up so they should be durable enough and they're extremely versitale. I've used these for all kinds of connections: ethernet, a/v interconects, speaker wire, etc., and never broken one. I wouldn't exactly go yanking on anything plugged in, but if you're up for running cables through walls and such, I suspect you're not the kind of person who is abusive of your work anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mickey dance cd","review":"Wow! this Mickey CD provided times for movement and dancing in my preschool classroom, the student really enjoyed the sounds and tunes.

The glass is solid and Pyrex branded, with three slight bumps equidistant around the circumference of the rim, to keep the edge raised a bit, allowing steam to escape. Some assembly is required as the handle is a six-piece affair of plastic, silicone and stainless steel that takes two minutes or less to put together (the instructions are on the clear plastic bag the parts come in, so be careful when opening it). I ordered this from Amazon and felt lucky that it arrived intact... the packaging did not seem terribly secure for a breakable item like this. Before I opened it I was very worried it was broken, because the parts bag was rattling around inside and hitting the glass, making an unhappy sound. Thankfully the lid was unblemished. A bit on the pricey side, but exactly what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marine Review","review":"Liked it every time I have seen it - except! - the producers/director/wardrobe/etc., had the Navy characters fairly correct, lotsa hair. There are a few well executed movies out there with this same malady - trying to run a few Marines through it and doing it very clumsily. Anyone, never mind former Marines, that has ever seen a Marine would recognize that those folks trying to play Marines in these movies are simply laughable, if not down right insulting to the way actual Marines look! Even in 1973, any PFC seeing another Marine with as much hair as these actors displayed would have ushered them to the nearest barber! Only drawback/regret with CL is that they didn't bother to get the Marine players at least cosmetically correct..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heart warming story","review":"A sailor, whose papers are missing is forced to stay in the area, falls for a hooker with a street wise kid, and falls for both.

Excellent portrayals by Marsha Mason and James Caan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I haven't read a lot of DeLint's work, but this and his other two collections of short stories I found to be enchanting. I espically like that you find the same charachters in several of the stories, but from different perspectives so you really get to know the charachters. It's realistic in the way that people interact with thier circles of friends and the magical element is refreshing and makes you open your eyes to the world around you.......you may find yourself looking for the faries in the park without realising it after reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift for a penguin lover","review":"the recipient of the gift loved it - thanks! the mama/baby combo is really adorable and made for a perfect gift"},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"This toy was great.

He's about as long as my forearm, and the baby is about the size of a beanie baby from McDonalds kid's meal. Like others have said, the baby is easily removed if you wanted to.

Please note that the description is quite misleanding: \\"a soft microsuede cover reversing to twill\\" I think implies that the cover is reversible - meaning it can be removed and turned inside out (to reverse it). What they mean is that the unremoveable cover consists of one half twill and one half microsuede. So don't count on washing the cover apart from it's fat, fluffy companion.

Over the course of the next 6 or 7 releases Tim has dazzled us with heartfelt vocals and excelent song choices; unfortunately it seems that the streak ends here. I was waiting to hear some songs of self revelation, deep emotional impact or spirituality told in an honest and endearing way; basically the hallmarks that have made Tim such a respected member of the country community; sadly I found none of those gems here.

I thought maybe these were recipes that were developed and written down by Chinese cooks during the period when the Mongolians sat on the jade throne. But no! This book is only a collection of recipes from countries that used to be in the Mongol empire. In other words, since the Mongols controlled most of the Eurasian land mass, this book is simply a collection of random recipes from across Asia. It could be called \\"Asian Cooking\\" rather than \\"Imperial Mongolian Cooking.\\" There is no other theme I could discern like \\"Genghis' favorite soups.\\" Moreover, the book is small and bound in a way that does not make it easily used in a kitchen.

We were amused by the list of featured dishes, seeing borsh as a Mongolian food, and Uzbek walnut patties as samsa. Being first generation from Russia, I can see how the book is related to the authors family restaurant business. There is a \\"little\\" question about Himalayan POTATO curry (well, potatoes came from Americas a few hundred years after Genghis Khan's death) as well as Armenian and Georgian (did he ever reach these countries?) entrées.

The author also has kids making fun of another child who still believes in the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy. The children in the book are seven, the same age as my daughter. I just can't believe that a book my first grader can read would flat out say there is no Santa Claus. Stay away from this book if you want your child to still believe in any childhood magic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE AS ARE ALL OF THE PEE WEE SCOUTS BOOKS.","review":"I am definitly not a fan of the PEE WEE SCOUTS series. I would bet that the author doesn't have children. These books are full of mean thoughts and actions that I certainly don't want my children exposed to. In Pee Wee Scouts Peanut Butter Pilgrims, all a character (Sonny) needs to do to take a live turkey home from the Turkey farm is to throw a temper tantrum until his mother gives in. In this particular book, children are told that there is not Santa Claus and made fun of if they DO believe in Santa Claus. THIS IS A 3rd GRADE READING LEVEL BOOK! What in the world was Judy Delton thinking when she wrote this? What was the publisher thinking when they published it? Horribly, this was a required reading for my 3rd grader.

I did some on-the-fly creative story telling as I read this to my first grader to gloss over the Santa spoiler but it shouldn't be a freely available book in a kindergarten to third grade library.As to the merits of the book, there are none. Most of it is filled with rather thinly created characters acting poorly while rattling off the names of other characters to the point that you think the author has a pronoun obcession.Plot - hardly.Anything of educational value for kids - nope.Positive examples for kids - negligible.Reason to read - none."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mireille Mathieu not sings in spanish","review":"content of the TOTAL DIFFERENT layer of the content of the compact disc.

The next fifteen chapters provide detailed information on every aspect of HP shooting including rifles, other equipment, shooting positions, and match participation. The final six chapters cover all aspects of training and becoming a better shooter.Other books by champion shooters concentrate heavily on shooting techniques, and are well suited to intermediate and advanced shooters.

Perhaps","review":"As a rule, I am scornful of books that attempt to psychoanalyze public figures from afar; indeed, I am skeptical about psychology in general. In this case, the author himself points out that his analysis should only be taken so seriously considering he has never seen the \`patient'. I am also dubious about the notion of \`syndromes' in general. Certainly Bill is a liar and a vacillator who denies personal responsibility, but are these traits really caused by the fact that his father was an alcoholic? So I came to the book a skeptic. That being said, I found the book very compelling. The most amazing thing about it is it seems to predict the Lewinsky scandal, and Clinton's reaction to it. Those that loath Bill Clinton will certainly enjoy it, and find it very convincing. Those that love him will dismiss it out of hand. Those who are in between will be very disturbed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than I thought! LOVE it!","review":"It fits perfectly over the Britax Marathon car seat.

There's only one song on this CD I didn't previously own, which is \\"Dance the Day Away\\". While I don't regret my purchase for this one above average song, more Jodi Benson biased fans wouldn't find what they are looking for in this CD. Where's the all time classic \\"Part of Your World\\"? Or \\"Just a Little Love\\"? or my personal favourite \\"Dreaming\\"?The cover art is beautiful, and the CD includes a booklet with some hard-to-find lyrics to some of the songs from the TV series. There is also an offer for a free Ariel lithograph, but this expired early 1999 and is pretty much useless.I would only recommend this CD for true Little Mermaid/Ariel fanatics (like myself).

To use a tired but appropriate cliche, 'I could not put it down.' The reader will be very impressed by Matera's meticulous research, yet the book is not a dry rehashing of details. It reads like a novel; an exciting portrayal of a mesmerizing personality.

No, this book may not be for everyone but sometimes you need a break from the \\"heavy\\" stuff and this was sort of innocent and magical. Yes, she wrapped up story lines extremely quickly but here again, sometimes it's nice to not have to read 500 pages for some type of resolution.

Any excerpt. The writing lumbers with precisely that kind of late adolescent turgidity and overweaning insistence that makes reading undergraduate papers so unbearable; the argument is nothing more than a series of unsupported and simple-minded generalities; the depth of scholarship reaches about as far as the water in a children's wading pool.

West's entire career has been one of mediocrity, but in the interest of politics, he has been portrayed as a star. West is no more a scholar than Al Sharpton is a statesman, but never mind, the guilt-ridden liberal establishment needs a myth.Another myth is this book. West knows no more about pragmatism than he knows about philosophy. West's polemic -- that white America is fraudulent, corrupt and racist -- is pure demagogy. Ironically, West himself can be deemed fraudulent, corrupt and racist -- so repugnant, so blatantly phony, so arrogant, so loud, so obnoxious, that he's a one-man campaign to drive moderate Americans further right, in disgust that liberalism has been coöpted by the likes of a Cornel West."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important contribution","review":"A very important contribution to pragmatic philosophy and contemporary cultural criticism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and educational","review":"My in-laws bought this game for my 7 yrs. old son.

This book may be a tad superfluous for the old Korea hand who is interested solely in studying the business culture, however, and the cost appears seems somewhat high considering that it is only 187 pages in length.

Ecclesiastical historians hold the subject in a death grip and use their philological expertise to mute all nonspecialist's commentaries (how many of us speak Coptic, after all). Finally a social scientist, an anthropologist, no less, investigates the contemporary Coptic experience and shows that its culture is still rooted in its special monastic heritage. This book is a fabulous ethnographic account of monasticism itself as well as a penetrating synthesis of the anthropology of religion applied to a nonwestern variant of Christianity. Before an ecclesiastical historian attacks it as an intrusion into their turf I want to applaud it as a beautifully crafted and carefully considered study that supplies a great resource for a subject scarcely ever treated in this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"dont judge them like i did! they're NOT horrible!","review":"ok, i'll be first to admit that when i heard of Busted i thought \\"ew, another boy band? from england? is this like the guys version of atomic kitten?\\" im not dissing british music b/c i am the biggest coldplay fan you'll ever meet and i also like Dido. but another boy band didnt appeal to me. then, i heard this new Busted album and i was very surprised! i luvvvv it! i listen to it all the time! i like it b/c even though its mostly about love and stuff, its funny and not too mushy or cheesy (like n-sync). even if u dont like the other stuff that \\"people who bought Busted also bought\\" (cuz i hate atomic kitten and 3rd eye blind and stuff) you WILL like busted! they're just so good! and no, im not 11 either, im in high school! surprise surprise! all i can say now is i hope busted comes to the usa!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke!?

It was the first book he found so hilarious he would roll off the bed laughing. William Pene duBois has a unique sense of humor as he relays (as I remember 15 years hence) the trials and tribulations of an overweight boy, Porko, away at school. The story held a unique mix of pathos and ridicule, as Porko decided to join the hockey team. We were drawn into the action as we laughed at him along with his schoolmates. Yet we were then able to empathize with Porko as his pain was revealed. At times we found ourselves feeling guilty about laughing. Yet Porko was a likable fellow and we liked him. Illustrations were interspersed within the story to make it a great transition from picture book to chapter book. The story moved along building in suspense and when we were done we were ready to read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely AWFUL!","review":"You would think a Championship special for a basketball obsessed fan base and program like Kentucky, would put together a stellar DVD. That is not even close to what this piece of garbage is. The editing is choppy and the narration is incorrect and all over the place. Its as if this was put together by an amateur high school media student. You would have the narrator saying one thing while something completely different was on the screen. Then the highly anticipated rematch with Indiana in the Sweet 16 is only given TWO PLAYS! A foul by Davis in the first half and a rebound in the final seconds of the game. Then the national title game gets maybe 3 plays worth of highlites and then it cuts to the team driving into Rupp Arena for the celebration and then abruptly ends.DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! Cross your fingers and hope CBS puts together an official DVD because this is absolutely a waste of money.

This wasn't it. The video states as fact items that are not fact and ends the program in October, after the first wave of the flu, when a second wave came in late Nov/ early December. The personal narratives were wonderful, but I would reccomend viewing this video only AFTER gaining a broad knowledge of the epidemic, otherwise, it is doing a great disservice."},{"rating":"1","title":"read \\"The Great Influenza\\" instead","review":"like the other reviewers here, I found this a major disappointment. The good news is, a truly oustanding book came out this year (2004) \\"The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague in History\\" by Barry will tell you all you wnat to know about this, and it will also give you some terrific history besides, that you would not ordinarily connect with disease (politics, war, the press, etc). An older review here, written apparently before this book was published, mentioned 2 other books. Alfred Crosby's \\"America's forgotten Epidemic\\" is also a very good book, tho not nearly as good as Barry's. It is however shorter. Gina Kolata's book-- skip it. It has little to do with events of 1918; it's really about now-dated current scientists digging up bodies lookign for the virus. Barry gives you a far better understanding of both science and the virus."},{"rating":"2","title":"History Reminds Us","review":"From time to time the US and the world face outbreaks of disease that threaten to become pandemic before effective scientific measures and cures can be put in place. AIDS, for instance, remains a grave health problem globally, but it appears to be under control in the developed nations. This may lead some to forget the deadly impact of bacterial and virus-driven diseases. \\"American Experience-Influenza, 1918,\\" available from Amazon, reminds us of our ever present vulnerability to the whims of biological mutations and by extension to biological warfare.

I loved watching this. Its highly recommended for mature audiences. The story follows a love triangle bewtween a Touma who wants this girl who only dates college boys. Once more, there is another girl who tries way too hard to get Touma. The show is definetely on a scale of Ranma 1\\\\2 humor, so you know its going to be good. I like the dub, but if I had to choose, I'd stick with the original Japanese. The only thing I had to down grade this DVD for is the extras. Whats wrong with them? Well, THERE ARE NONE. Somehow, DVD always falls flat on there faces when it comes to DVD extras. Oh well. If your tired of seeing all the other anime genres that are currently out, pick this one up. It has a good story and funny sex-oriented jokes. I think you'll be suprised at how much you like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and sexy","review":"I liked this video a lot. I didn't really know what to expect, but it turned out to be a lot like Goldenboy, which I loved. The situations are goofy and funny, and Touma overreacts to all of it. Uraru's innocent sexuality was pretty good, too. I recommend this video to anyone who enjoys the funnier anime, like Ranma 1/2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexy? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!","review":"They must have left the sexy parts out of the copy I rented to preview the series - rented because something seemed fishy about the reputation. This is for 10-year olds who think a dweeb drooling for a babe is funny... All those \\"sexy\\" comments are the video maker's public relations department trying to make it racy and trap the viewer with.

On the other hand, if you like fairly silly, goofy, repressed...shows, this is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book","review":"This is a great book, yoga basics are laid out in a simple, understandable format.

Defenitely worth it, a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall, but problems with lids","review":"I bought two 18 oz Kanteens, one with a loop lid and the other with a flat lid. Though the Kanteen is a good size and easy to hold and clean, the lids have been a problem. The flat lid doesn't always feel like an air-tight seal, probably because of the metal-on-metal connection. It is, however, easier to open than the loop lid, which is very difficult to open unless you have very strong hands or a screwdriver handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"As advertised","review":"This is my first stainless steel water bottle (18 oz, with poly loop cap), and I really like it. No more deformed plastic bottle / bad tasting water! The only down side is that the water gets warmer on hot days and cool on cold days. but plastic water bottles have similar problems too."},{"rating":"2","title":"good size for lunch box","review":"I bought these for my kids lunch boxes. It is a good size for my 6 and 8 year old. I like that I can wash them in the dishwasher. The kids do complain that the bottles sometimes are hard to open. The seal is air tight. If I put the top on to loose it leaks. They just have to ask a teacher to help open the bottle once in a while. I feel that these bottles are a healthy choice, no chemicals from plastic leaching into the water. I bought the 4oz Kleen Kanteen for my 4 year old neice and nephew. I thought that was a nice size for the younger kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good purchase","review":"I liked this product.

The pink is so cute and I love the easy accessibility of the sports cap. There are two things, however that gets kind of annoying: 1) is the black ring that it comes with-- every time you screw off the top that comes off too; and 2) whenever I drink (particularly from a relatively full bottle) the mouthpiece makes an audible squeaky guzzling sound which can be embarrassing in quiet settings."},{"rating":"2","title":"loving it!","review":"I like that the mouth is wider than the Siggs though not as wide as the traditional Nalgene bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal solution for solution carry.","review":"The cap threading is the best I've seen, with no alignment or cross threading problems at all. Beats any on the market that I have tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best water bottle!","review":"I have tried other stainless steel water bottles, and these are the BEST! The size is perfect and I love the choices for the tops. I chose the one that has a loop and it makes it so easy when I go for a walk to hold on to it. I love that the kleen kanteens have wider openings for the top - this makes it easy to put ice in if wanted and so much easier to refill. I have washed mine many times in the dishwasher and it is extremely durable. This is the best water bottle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!","review":"I bought klean kanteen's for myself, my niece and my husband in hopes to try and cut down on plastic water bottles, and it not only keeps our water at a great temp but we have also saved $$ -no more buying packaged water, and the best of all, we are helping out the earth. We love our water bottles and take them everywhere we go, and fill them up throughout the day. and, the pink color is just too cute!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect fit","review":"The Klean Kanteen stainless steel water bottles are a perfect fit for my family. We do not purchase plastic water bottles with the potential toxins yet we always have clean water whereever we go.

I don't know if it's Amazon or Klean Kanteen but I have been disappointed twice.Probably will not purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Expensive Water Bottle","review":"I like the product very much, but I just don't think it justifies the cost. Its very stylish and dispenses water well, but you can find one 5 times cheaper at your local mega mart. I've dropped mine a few times and it does dent rather easily, but that's to be expected. The sports cap does make a kind of whistling noise when you drink out of it, but its a minor annoyance. If you want your water bottle to be a fashion statement then this might be just for you. For everyone else, you may want to find something cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stain, uncovered","review":"I bought 4. Three are covered by the plastic.

The bottle has really nice color and feels a bit more sturdy than the SIGG bottles I have bought in the past.However,the bottle leaks no matter how hard I try to tighten the cap - whenever the bottle is not upright,it starts leaking slowly but instantly - not enough to lose most of the water in the bottle but more than enough to wet whatever container it is in. So bags/backpacks get wet.Leaking seem to be such a basic quality issue that I didn't expect any leaking for Klean Kanteen (and have never bought a bottle that leaked). With this \\"defect\\" product that is under $20, it seems exchanging/returning is a lot of hassle. So I have kept the bottle. I will be very hesitant to buy another one in the future and wouldn't recommend it based on my, hopefully less common, experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Klean Kanteens Rock!","review":"We love these stainless steel bottles and use them daily...exercise, car trips, etc. An added bonus is their use inside our home. We have curious toddlers and pets who love to sample drinks out of glasses. Needless to say, we had a LOT of beverage spills before we started to use our Kleen Kanteens in the carpeted areas of our home. They wash up well and are healthier both for you as well as the environment. If those benefits aren't enough, think of all the $$ you'll save NOT paying for plastic bottles all the time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for me","review":"This water bottle has worked well for me. Just be careful not to over-tighten the lid, or else you will have a hard time getting it off! It doesn't have to be all that tight in order to keep the water inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"This is a great water bottle. It is lightweight and the water tastes very clean even after it has been in the bottle for awhile unlike plastic bottles I have had. The only problem with it is the squeaking when you open and close the bottle. Other then that it is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Klean Kanteen, a great purchase","review":"Great water bottle. I recommend to others and also purchase for gifts. I like the peace-of-mind I get from knowing that I don't need to worry about chemicals leaching into my drinking water (as would happen with most plastic water bottles).I highly recommend purchasing a compatible Built NY water bottle carrier to protect the water bottle, as the only negative with the Klean Kanteen is that they dent very easily when dropped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I thought it would be good to buy another 2 Kleen Kanteens for my kids since they carry water everyday to school. I go these on Amazon and they seemed very pretty and bright in color. One of them leaked immediately. I called Klean Kanteen and they sent me the replacement valve FREE right away. Very fast and amazing customer service. They are very polite. After using about 2 months the bottom of my water bottle had started to get round and pushed down like the cheap water bottles. It continually got worse. It ended up being so round at the bottom that it wouldnt even stand up! The paint was also falling off. Horrible. I finally just threw it away. My original bottle I owned is still in perfect condition. The paint is bright and the bottle seems strong. I imagine something changed. I think it has changed in quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magnetic","review":"I have been a long time lover of Klean Kanteens. I bought them for my whole family a few years ago. After reading some of the other reviews warning of a decline in quality I decided to check out my new purchase. My bottle was magnetic, which stainless steel of this grade should not be. It makes me nervous about what other heavy metals may be mixed in - certainly not anything I want to be drinking. So sadly, I'm sending it back. Please Klean Kanteen, get this fixed! I really want another one of your bottles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like it!!!","review":"I bought this water bottle thinking that this was the best out there...I was wrong. I hate it!!! For some reason, you put water in it and then after getting to work and opening it the water has a smell of rusting metal. I know that this is stainless steel, and that it does not rust, but It still has this odor to it. I bought Camelback BPA free water bottle 1 Liter, and I loved so much more!!!!! This product I would not recommed and would not purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It leaks! Bad design!","review":"It killed my phone when it leaked in my bag. The cap does not close properly. Very poorly made! Save your money and headache!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whistling Water Bottle","review":"This water bottle is well made - I have no complaints about the bottle itself. However I was shocked to hear a noisy whistle coming out of the top while I was drinking. This was actually embarrasing because I was in a quiet room! If you are purchasing this for outdoors or don't mind the whistle then I would say buy it. However if the noise would bother you I would stick to a SIGG water bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poly Sport 2.0 Cap leaked","review":"I purchased the 12-oz bottle for my son to take to school, figuring it would be a good size for his lunch box. The sport cap leaked after two uses. I returned it and got another bottle with a sports cap; that leaked after one use. For good measure, I returned that one and got a third bottle with a sport cap; that leaked before he even got a chance to use it. The water bottle itself is a great little product but I had absolutely no luck with the sports cap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, they rust inside. Low quality now.","review":"I agree with the poor rating. I've bought KleenKanteen, and within a year, it started rusting inside. None of the other brands we own do this. No more of these for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This bottle leaks...","review":"I previously had the same sized Klean Kanteen bottle which worked fine. I lost it so bought another one. Unfortunately the new bottle leaked no matter how tightly I tried to screw in the cap. I discovered this when I was carrying it in my purse. I tried to make do with this leaky bottle for a while, always making sure it's upright, in cars, in airplanes, while going for a walk, in the end I decided it's really not worth it. I'll look for another bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Packaging -- Arrived Damaged","review":"Bought two of these. Amazon packaged them together with a thin sheet of plastic separating them. Paint was scuffed on both bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's better than buying bottled water","review":"I've had my Klean Kanteen for 1 month so far and I'm not too happy with it. I got it mainly because it had so many positive reviews.My major gripe is with the poly sport cap. IT LEAKS ALL THE TIME. Even when i have securely closed it off, it still leaks whenever it's laying on the side. I'm majorly disappointed that a water bottle has so much trouble keeping water INSIDE.If you're intent on getting this canteen, i highly recommend the simple flat or loop cap, definitely not the sport cap (or another canteen altogether)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Alternative to Plastic","review":"I bought this for my wife so that she would not have to take plastic bottles of water anymore to work. She enjoys using it so far! I would recommend this brand to others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value, Great Product","review":"Excellent quality water bottle, heavy stainless steel. The best feature is the Sports Cap. The cap has a small flexible air valve that allows easy free flow of water. Great for hiking and driving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orange Klean Kanteen","review":"So far my kanteen has proven itself to be a handy sidekick to cut down on buying plastic water bottles. I've also noticed that I drink more water throughout the day when it's with me. My only complaint is that the orange started chipping after I took it camping, about 2 weeks after receiving it.

Not all water bottles are, which I found out by first wasting my money on a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"klean kanteen","review":"This is a great product. I have one already and bought this one for my daughter for Christmas in pink which is her favorite color. She is a model and works out every day and is very health conscious. I knew she would love this as much as I do due to the health problems with plastic. I have had mine for a year now and use it most every day when I don't have access to glass.

I learnt lots of things during my research about usage of plastics in our day to day life. To my surprise i came to know that we use plastic in simple things like Paper Glass, Milk Container, etc.Anyways, everything motivated me to take a Steel or Aluminum bottle. I compared lots of features (health & environment related) between Klean Kanteen and Sigg bottles. Finally, i decided to take Klean Kanteen bottle.I am very happy with the product.

Unfortunately, my good money spent didn't equal a quality product. After only a week of using this bottle the part that you sip the water out of on the lid broke completely off. Sure, the water tastes a little funny, the bottle was noisy and it's way too cold to touch when holding icy water, but my kids didn't complain so I didn't let it bother me. But when my son came home and showed me the broken unrepairable lid I knew these bottles had to go back. I'm sad because I now need to find a suitable replacement (not a Sigg - it doesn't fit regular ice cubes, and I don't have room in the freezer to make special ice)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty label adhesive contaminates bottle","review":"I ordered these expensive stainless steel bottles as a healthy alternative to plastic bottles and their leaching chemicals, especially for my kindergartener to use at school (where they normally use the same plastic water bottle for 4-5 months at a stretch). I was VERY disappointed when the bottles arrived with a label INSIDE the sports cap top (reading \\"Made in China\\" no less) that three weeks later, I still haven't been able to completely remove. The label is stuck on with such a strong, nasty adhesive that it remains there after many, many soakings in all kinds of concoctions of soap, vinegar, detergent, etc. So whatever this nasty adhesive is (from China), it is contaminating the water inside the bottle, thus defeating one of the main purposes of purchasing these expensive bottles. When I complained to the seller, they only offered a refund, not a replacement of the cap without a label stuck inside. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Klean Kanteen \\"18/8\\" I tested was Magnetic - Hmm...","review":"I bought a 40 oz stainless steel bottle at a local store, but had to return it. To test the quality of my new bottle, I used a refrigerator magnet. Quality 18/8 steel is typically not magnetic. To my surprise, this bottle was. The magnet also stuck to most of the 40 oz and 28 oz Klean Kanteen bottles that I tested at the store (attraction to bottles varied). The 28 oz I bought last year was fine (the magnet had almost no attraction).Magnetism suggest heavy metals in the steel, such as nickel. Nickel is a known carcinogen (http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts15.html). My fridge magnet did not stick (had zero attraction) to the other 18/8 stainless brands found in the store. I bought them instead. Test for yourself - it's easy to do so.

She seems to be pleased with this replacement. I have two of the 27 oz bottles and love them. They can be washed easily in dishwasher and have so far held up very well to being dropped and tossed around. The metal can get extremely cold if refrigerated but I believe they also carry covers if that bothers you. I didn't find it bad enough to bother buying a cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessary","review":"As I was reading up on the harms of drinking from plastic, I decided to invest in a stainless steel klean kanteen bottle. I ordered the stainless steel flat cap. Within a week, the plastic top kept coming off the top of the steel lid. By that time though, I realized I didn't like the steel taste or smell of the water and the loud screwing/unscrewing of the metal cap, so it wasn't worth fixing. I purchased a glass bottle at the grocery store for $1.50 and have been so much happier drinking out of that. I would gladly return the steel bottle, but I'm afraid I just put it on the back burner too long and now they probably wouldn't take it back. Either way, it was a regretful decision and a poor purchase for me. If you are dead set on purchasing a steel water bottle, however, my only advice is to stay away from the flat top steel cap, because it is very poorly constructed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"After shopping around I purchased these, and after using them for the past few months, it has been confirmed that these are the best! I like these so much that I purchased one for everyone for Christmas. The wide mouth, with a smooth thread for the top, is truly what makes these better than the rest. My husband and I have found that the 27 oz. size is good for everyday on-the-go, and we use the larger ones to store filtered water in the refrigerator. Don't hesitate to give these a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bottle, great taste, easy clean, but paint chips","review":"5 months ago, after A LOT of research, I bought 8 KK bottles.

No more plastic bottles; I use filtered water and sometimes add a bit of apple juice to it for the kids.The pros: Even after a full day of being used, no bad smells or taste. sports cap easy to use even for kids, but has to be upright to not leak. easy to clean wide mouth.The con- really just one: the paint chips, on some bottles (red) it actually flakes. My kids don't mind, and I'm still glad I bought the colored ones, to tell who drinks from which one at the moment.The replacement sports caps (recall) finally arrived (the whole process took over 6 weeks).I decided to give them 5 points because the only thing I can find fault with is purely cosmetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"These bottles are the best!","review":"After a cancer scare I decided to not ever drink out of plastic water bottles again.

I also like the option of having more then one cap, like Klean Kanteen offers (although I haven't taken advantage of it quite yet)."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than I expected!","review":"I made the switch from nalgene a few months ago, and had an earthlust ss bottle which I loved. I didn't love how small the opening in the earthlust was though. After reading ALL the reviews of klean kanteen and sigg, I ordered the 18oz red kleen kanteen with the standard top. I LOVE IT!It is lighter weight than I thought it would be. The opening is plenty big enough for large ice cubes, it keeps my water cold and looks great! No, I don't taste metal like the thermos' many of us grew up on.It is my favorite now, and will be using it daily!"},{"rating":"2","title":"40 oz - black: Great water bottle!","review":"I love these bottles. I've owned the 40 oz black bottle with the poly loop cap for about six months. I keep it at work and use it every day. My coworkers love its sleek look; I get quite a few \\"Wow, that's a cool looking bottle!\\" comments. Besides that, the water tastes great, no metallic taste at all.These bottles will dent fairly easily, but at least there aren't any interior epoxy coatings to worry about cracking. The paint on the bottom did wear off with frequent use (you can get the plain steel one if you worry about that). The poly loop cap can be difficult to open if you tighten it enough to keep it from leaking. It does sweat a lot with cold beverages, as most bottles do. None of these things bothered me except the cap being too tight.Overall, it's a great bottle, and I bought an extra one to keep at home. It makes it convenient and easy for me to have my 8+ glasses of water a day with two trips to the sink instead of 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sport Top, Tight Seal, No Metallic Taste","review":"The kanteen is just as I wanted it to be and the sport cap is well made with a tight seal.

I carry RO water to work and have several brands/types of bottles. No matter how I clean this one, it smells foul if water sits in it for over a day or so. The lid is also so hard to grip to open that I often have to stick a pen through the hole for leverage, and it makes an obnoxious squeak noise. I avoid drinking from this one while driving because the wide mouth always splashes water down my shirt. Much prefer the taste of water from a cheap aluminum bottle. Have other brands of stainless bottles that don't stink like this one too. I assume it is something with the lid that makes it smell bad, but don't really know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks!","review":"It would be helpful to simply shove the bottle in my bag with all the other stuff I'm carrying to the office or other places but this bottle requires *special* treatment and must always be upright b/c it leaks. Doesn't leaking defeat the purpose of having a water bottle?There's a written disclaimer on the label attached to the bottle that it must always be upright or it will leak which I did not notice until my friend pointed it out.I received this as a gift and now I leave it in the fridge as my \\"quick cold water grab\\" and that's it.I would not recommend this product for more than fridge storage use and will not buy one for myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tasted like metal","review":"I'm tryin to drink more water, and I thought a Klean Kanteen would be better for me than some plastic water bottle.

They recommend you have two quarts of water on you per day, so I got a 27oz and a 40oz.You simply can't beat the practicality of these bottles. The stainless steel keeps your water tasting fresh, even after a couple of days. They're easy to keep clean if you just put some soap and water inside once a day and shake the heck out of it, then wash the outside.A note on the colored bottles: My first Klean Kanteen was the regular stainless finish, but I picked up these two in red and blue because the colors were on sale at the time. They're great-looking in colors, but they pick up a lot of fingerprints. This doesn't matter if you're camping or hiking, obviously, but if you're going to use it at the office or something, you might not like it. The stainless finish doesn't have this problem.Oh, and one last thing; they're really LIGHT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Replacement","review":"I bought both the Sigg and Kleen Kanteen (with plastic and SS tops). The Sigg is better looking, but bruises more easily than the KK. You have to decide if the coating on the Sigg, which the company claims is secret, has any effect on the Water, and your health.

While the Epoxy liner was deemed safe, so was nalgine and I was afraid later on someone may find it unsafe.

I love how it looks, carrying it by it's little loop top, that it's better for you than drinking out of plastic, and the wide mouth makes cleaning easy. As much as I love it (I gave it four stars) there are some things that a prospective purchaser might want to know. Sometimes the cap can be difficult to open (gasket effect). Also, because of the wide mouth, it can take some getting used to. I'm mostly using it in a moving vehicle and I've sloshed in my face a few times. :) But I still love it and will consider getting more as enviro-friendly gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Klean Kanteen's are awesome","review":"I was looking for a bottle that I could take with my to the gym that was safe to use. This bottle is great! It is 100% food grade stainless steel and every time I fill it up and take it with me, I know that I am putting clean water in my body and that my water bottle is not making my water harmful. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is still using plastic or aluminum water bottles. It is also 100% recyclable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge money saver","review":"This bottle keeps the beverage cold for a long time. It is a huge money saver and is very convenient. The best feature is the wide neck, making it easy to put ice cubes inside. Highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"love the \\"no plastic\\" taste","review":"I have used my Klean Kanteens on several hikes so far. I really like the way the water tastes. I just put filtered tap water in each along with a few ice cubes made with filtered water. No more buying water in plastic bottles that have to be recycled. I didn't have the problems that I have read in other reviews about getting water out of the sport tops. There is a small hole in the sport top that is partially covered with a flexible plastic piece (this may be a new version). This lets enough air into the kanteen for the water to come out without a problem. Easy to clean in the dishwasher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bottle, perfect size","review":"This bottle is fantastic. A wide mouth so you can guzzle water without spilling it everywhere since there are no air bubbles. The size is almost as large as a Nalgene, but is narrow and fits in my bike bottle holder (or car cupholder). I got the loop cap, and there are two versions of this. On one bottle I purchased a few months ago, the cap is \\"solid\\" but the one I purchased over here a couple weeks ago has a \\"hollow\\" cap. The hollow one allows you to put a little more water in I suppose, but feels cheap and is harder to clean. Overall still a great bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - Does The Job Well","review":"After making a decision to stop buying bottled water, we searched for different solutions and ended up buying the Klean Kanteen.It is definitely a good choice for us - it's been sturdy and holds up to our son throwing it at other things (okay, that's probably not the best reason to buy this, but at least its durable!), I don't notice any leaching, and since I have the sport cap it typically doesn't leak when it's tilted to the side which is nice (again since I have a kid).Since it fits in standard cupholders, I can take it in the car with me... and when I go on business trips I just empty it out and put it in my carryon.All in all, well worth the money paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Klean Kanteen 27-ounce","review":"Excellent product. It's nice to be able to drink without ingesting chemicals from plastic bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"sustainably fabulous","review":"I was heartbroken when I lost my Nalgene. The Klean Kanteen has been above and beyond a perfect replacement. Love, I'm in love!"},{"rating":"1","title":"mold growing inside","review":"You can't see mold growing inside, until you look in it. Even then, it is dark in there without proper lighting. I couldn't believe I saw a decent amount of brown/black mold inside. Thought I would really love this bottle. Sadly a waste of money & I bought all the caps too. I now use a plastic see-through bottle FREE after buying health supplements. And so far that is not growing mold at all. Dunno how Klean Kanteen has all those good reviews. I should use it as a vase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great water bottle","review":"I don't even know how many plastic water bottles I've kept out of landfills and recycling plants already. This bottle is simple, but very well crafted. I have one in black and one in silver and they are great. The only problems have come from my own negligence. I dropped one of them and the bottom became dented so it doesn't sit well anymore. I may replace it one day if it bothers me enough, but the bottle is still functional. Go green and get a Klean Kanteen. I highly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All But the Sports Top","review":"I like the product and how it's made a lot. I took a lot of time to pick it out. The only complaint I have is the sports top. It makes a lot of noise when you drink out of it, so I just take it off and drink out of it. Great bright orange color, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally ditched the bottled water","review":"I've felt guilty about drinking bottled water for so long I finally decided to stop and start drinking tap water. The Klean Kanteen seemed to be the one Amazon customers liked best so that's why I decided to buy it.I've had it for like 2 months and no problems so far. I love just refilling my bottle instead of buying heavy huge boxes of plastic bottled water. And I love the the earth logo which reminds me why I'm using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"These are wonderful! I have a 12 oz. for my 3 year old and a 27 oz. for myself that goes everywhere we do. The top is very convenient in that the drinking spout pops up when you pull off the cover and replacing the cover pushes it back down, so you don't have to worry about dirty fingers touching the mouth piece. No chemicals to worry about with stainless and if you add ice it keeps it cool for a long time. My son also likes the fact that his cup looks like mine, so it makes him feel like he is drinking from a big boy cup. :-) Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Perfect! Klean Kanteen has the highest quality, no taste transfer, durable. The cap makes it easy to sip on the go, and the loop in it makes it easy to grab and tote. I have at least a dozen, and have been giving them as gifts for years. Save the planet, and use these for your water, ice tea, take them to get your frozen lattes."},{"rating":"2","title":"KLEAN KANTEEN STAINLESS STEEL WATER BOTTLE (27oz)","review":"IT'S A TOUGH ONE!! ACCIDENTALLY DROPPED BOTTLE ON CONCRETE FLOOR SECOND DAY OF USAGE. IT PASSED MY TEST!!!!WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND; BUT NOT THE ACCIDENTAL DROP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Water bottle","review":"I really like this water bottle. It is a nice sturdy stainless steel bottle that is available in fun colors. I ordered 2 lids so that I can wash one and use the other. Only one small problem. The bottle often squeeks or whistles when you drink out of it. It is not real loud but it does make some funny sounds if you work in a quiet office."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I have had several of the 24oz Klean Kanteens and haven't always liked them. They are just too tall and top heavy. This 18oz is just the perfect size to compete with the narrow mouth 16 oz Nalgenes. I would definately buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy camper","review":"Great bottle. But not too happy about the shade of red but then thats totally an issue of personal taste. Highly recommend this product to everyone. Buy American and support the economy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"metal taste and amount of liquid","review":"I ordered 3 of the 12oz size. I thought that it would actually hold 12oz, but it barely holds 8oz. I wanted to use if for my kids as well as a workout water bottle. It seems to have a distintive metal taste that is unpleasant for me. Maybe it is me, but I am not pleased and will return. If anyone has advice, I am all ears! The low rating is based on that only. It is made well and seems durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!","review":"Excellent way to cut back on plastic water bottles. Keeps water nice and cool and I take it the gym all the time. Easy to clean and doesn't dent easily!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's for the greater good","review":"Klean Kanteen is a good idea...however, I'll most likely order another cap. the sports cap is a good concept for a bottle that you can squeeze, but you can;'t squeeze stainless ;) we like the idea of not filling the landfill with bottles when these are available"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good product","review":"I purchased the 12 oz with a sports cap for my daughter. The bottle looks great, I love the design of it. However, I'd like it much better if it was insulated. We live in the south, and if you put cold beverages in it, the bottle sweats almost immediately. That's my only gripe with it, other than that, I love it! I will probably buy a couple of bigger ones for my husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective sports cap","review":"I may change this review if the company pays forward and replaces my cap. I bought 3 bottles 2 of them with sports caps (12 oz size) for my kids to take to school. One of the sports caps leaks from the mouth piece. The one that doesnt leak you can see that the inside piece comes above the outside, the one that does leak however isnt the same. The inside part is at the same level as the other, if that makes sense. Anyway I went to their site and found that they do not guarantee that the sport cap will not leak. Apparently it is not designed that way. So all the children will just have to suffer from soggy sandwiches and damaged textbooks. That's ingenuity and quality we expect from a $15 bottle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I expected.","review":"I already had the 20 oz Kleen Kanteen but over the course of a day 20 oz is not enough so I opted for the larger size. It's great; stainless steel no aluminum or plastic and the loop cap makes it easy to grab even if your hands/arms are full."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallic taste","review":"I read the reviews before buying this water bottle, and had high hopes for it. Unfortunately, even after repeated washing (hand washed with mild soap), water in this bottle has a metallic taste. I gave it two stars because I love the design, but as it makes water taste metallic, I did return the water bottle. Amazon is great and makes returns so easy! But I wish I had a usable water bottle instead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Not Easy Being Green...","review":"I bought the Klean Kanteen because I wanted to drink my daily water, and still feel environmentally sound. I bought this product, put my water in it, and took it to work. Unfortunately, the Kleen Kanteen makes my water taste like metal, and is barely drinkable. I do not recommend this product -- unless you like the taste of metal in your water!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PBA-free yes, leak-proof definitely not!","review":"I cannot believe the fact that this bottle is not leak proof. I bought it with sport cap 2.0 and it leaks.Unbelievable!
