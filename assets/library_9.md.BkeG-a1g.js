Reboot, reboot, reboot... Then I read the reviews elsewhere, and you would nearly think that this was the worst drive ever made. The Sony storage support website has NO official firmware updates, either. I tried a new IDE ribbon cable, but that wasn't the answer. Yes, the drive is properly configured per the instructions on the Sony drive support website. I've read that Sony doesn't even make this drive; well, they shouldn't put their name on it, either, since it drags down their namebrand quality. Best thing about it?

I was grateful that she agreed to perform three of my songs for a competition, and though she was only in her early 20's, I could tell she would develop into a monster singer. This album is testimony to my intuitive premonition. Every track on this record attests to Jude's marvelous musicianship and song writing craftsmanship. The material sounds so free! Listen to \\"Fall With Me\\". The harmonic treatment is so fresh; the song has no contrivance, and the text is so meaningful. This is only one example of the material given to us by a real genius. Listen to her other songs as well and be moved. It is a pity for everyone who appreciates real craft in music as well as abundant soul, that she has disappeared from the performing scene; her music is sorely needed by us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"This was one of the first positive thinking books that I came across.

As a Reiki Master who is owned by five dogs, all of whom seem to want or need Reiki on a regular basis, this book has given me many insights into the differences, and there are many, between treating people with Reiki versus animals. The authors go into enough detail about what Reiki is to be helpful to people who are not familiar with Reiki, however, the book will be most valuable to people who do Reiki on people and want to know how to transfer their knowledge to the treatment of animals. The book covers virtually all the species of animal the typical practitioner might treat, including assisting dying animals in making a peaceful transition.

There are many case histories and the book reads well. I am disappointed however as there are no instructions as to the practice of Reiki in the book; the reader is told to find a Reiki instructor and take classes. This book reads like a diary not an instruction manual - which I thought it would be. I have purchased Four Paws - Five Directions through Amazon and this book give clear instructions on Reiki, acupressure and other holistic animal healing. I highly recommend FOUR PAWS - FIVE DIRECTIONS to anyone interested in the holistic approach to healing family pet animals. But this book, Animnal Reiki? Naw - don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip off","review":"This book's subtitle, \\"Using energy to heal the animals in your life,\\" is misleading. It suggests that you, the reader, will be given instructions to use reiki energy to heal your animal friends. The reality is the book tells stories of how the author has healed animals using reiki. In fact, she states that if you want to learn reiki yourself, you can reference the training centers in her index.This would all be wonderful if the book were entitled, \\"Memoirs of Reiki Animal Healer\\" but since it is not, I am taking my book back for a refund.Great animal pics. but otherwise a total rip off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Introduction to Reiki for Animals","review":"Kathleen Prasad and Elizabeth Fulton have done an excellent job of presenting the basics of Reiki as applied to animals. In addition to instructions and explanations, the book is peppered with their personal stories of using Reiki in a variety of situations, including working with shelter animals. Although it is true what one reviewer said that you are expected to have taken at least Reiki I to begin doing Reiki (that is how the system works), you need not have taken any classes in order to enjoy this book or to understand what the authors convey so well. I'm guessing many readers are intrigued enough to seek out Reiki classes after finishing the book. I especially appreciate the authors' compassionate tone.

After practicing some of the techniques, I have noticed a change in some of the behavior issues with a couple of the dogs. In fact, I love it when they get so relaxed that they begin yawning (mentioned several times in the book). My next step is to actually take a class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the book to buy if you are looking to learn Reiki.","review":"I was disappointed in this book, since I was hoping it showed Reiki technique.

It has enriched and enhanced my Reiki practice exponentially. I highly recommend it to every practitioner, at every level ... even if they do not plan to focus their practice on treating animals. At the very least, this book will strengthen your relationship with your animal companions, both inside and outside of your home. But, be prepared, as it may very well serve as an inspiring catalyst to direct your Reiki practice in a new, deeply fulfilling direction, just as it did for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a \\"how to\\" book","review":"This book is not what I was looking for. It's full of testimonials and \\"gee-isn't-this-greats\\", but it never tells you HOW to do the energy channeling. Or HOW to ask your animal if they want to receive Reiki. Evidently this is a super secret, double-dog skill and you need to find a Reiki Master to learn from. So it basically told me nothing, except that Reiki could help - which I already suspected before I bought the stupid book! I didn't need a book of testimonials.So if you want to learn HOW to do Reiki, this book is a waste of money. Either find a \\"Reiki Master\\", or a different book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Constructive info for using Reiki on animals","review":"Great supplemental information for anyone that has already learned Reiki for humans and wants to apply that knowledge to animals."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent, Informative Book About Reiki For Animals","review":"I first read this book several years ago and found it extremely informative and educational about the method of offering Reiki healing energy to the animal world. I was so profoundly influenced that I eventually studied Animal Reiki with one of the co-authors, Kathleen Prasad, who I consider the foremost authority on the subject. I since have become a Reiki Master Teacher myself and I currently order multiple copies of this book at a time to use as a textbook in the Animal Reiki courses that I now teach. I recommend this book for anyone who is an animal lover and is open-minded about learning a new technique to help both our companion animals and wild animals as well. The material is presented very clearly in an easy-to-understand manner, and the sidebars containing specific animal Reiki stories are extremely moving as well as being excellent teaching tools."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animal Reiki","review":"Many thanks to N.

Good prices","review":"I actually have some pretty major issues with some of the reviews here. Firstly, the price of these cartridges is quite cheap compared to other cartridges. And, because each color is in a separate cartridge you might not even have to purchase all of them at once. In terms of the user that complained that his cartridges were half emtpy, it wasn't an issue I had. If this really did happen he should have complained. In any event, these are all user opinions and side issues.The bottom line is that this is a well priced machine that is easy to install, has a good software suite and is simple to use.

Or it reads \\"unknown error\\" or \\"paper loading error\\". I have emailed tech support to no avail. The troubleshooting website is no help either, the problem is never addressed.

I knew they were good quality and loved the idea of separate ink cartridges for color. Just recently, I had to replace all four cartridges at the same time. I did four head cleanings (the print heads seem to be HEAVILY clogged) and the cartridges were empty. OK. Head cleanings can use a lot of ink. But all of the ink in my color cartridges?Don't bother with this printer. I already miss my far inferior but far MORE reliable Lexmark Z-series.

Except my son needed a printer for a project due on Monday. I went to Best Buy and got a Canon instead. Adios, Epson. Add this review to the pile of negative views.Sure it went thru ink at a generous clip but most inkjets do imho. My concern is with the longevity of said product.

And so far, had to replace all 4 cartridges. To make life more difficult, as soon as one of the colours runs dry, the printer refuses to print. Not only that, but the printing speed for pages is woefully slow - much slower than my old HP photosmart, which is a big issue since we print more text than pictures. And to cap it all off, printing in draft output produces type so faint it's virtually unreadable.

Well I begrudgingly replaced the black cartridge and then very soon after two color cartridges went out - no biggie I said...I only print in black & white. Then the killer - this printer only prints if ALL cartridges have ink - even when printing in b&w forcing me to replace the color cartridges when I only need black & white.

At times, the symphonic arrangements seem a bit overbearing, and just when I start to get annoyed with them, Sigh reels me back in with another litany of blast-beats and primal screams.My only real gripe with this album is some of the noise going on in the background (e.g.: horror clips, ghoulish cackling, etc). In fact, at times the bombast of the CD borders on campy, and I can't help but wonder if Sigh have traversed a line that turned them into a charicature instead of a true musical force with which to reckon.Maybe I need to listen to it a few more times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast easy repair","review":"Best investment to make an old car new again.

Otherwise a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRIPPING..HA HA","review":"That's the word they use to describe movies..right? I liked this book. It's an urban tradgey but I liked it. Most women encounter a Lou-Loc in their lifetime. They probably just choose not to date is ass. This was one of those \\"i gotta get to the end\\" books. I loved the plot and it kept me wanting more. I cried at the end (call me a sucker for love)but this was a good read. Triple crown did it again"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Felt Like I Knew The Charecters Personnally","review":"This was definately a good book. It started off a little slow (first five chapters or so) but quickly picked up. The charecters felt so real to me. The book had some typos but still read okay. It was a page turner. I got so emotionally involved that I actually cried a few times. Pick up this book. It won't be a waste of your time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YEAH!!!","review":"\\"Gangsta,\\" is a story that's written straight from the soul.

The kid has finally made his presence felt. Now that's Gangsta!"},{"rating":"2","title":"On The Real!","review":"This book was excellent! When I read the first few pages I couldn't get into the language, but when I took a deap breath and read a little more slowly, I couldn't put this book down. I finished it in one day. Although Lou-Loc was a hustler/gangsta, I was cheering for him to succeed. There was so much action and drama, I thought I was reading a screenplay. It had you laughing and crying. K'Wan, your book was a masterpiece. I can't wait for the next one. Excellent job. Anyone who reads this book will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"da bomb","review":"My 2nd review of a book. This book was just what I titled the review. I read this book in one day. Grant it there were many typo's, which usually stops me from completeing a book, but the story line kept me into it. You cant hope but falling in love with Lou Loc, he has the drive and determination to get out of the game. K-Wan, another author who I say put it down really straight. This is a must read, and if you dont know the game this book will give you some insight as to what the ballers and gangbangers go thru. Note::: the first 4 chapters are so so,, but chapter 5 til the end is very explosive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I get A Amen","review":"Now this is realer than real! K'wan got da** I just read this this week and finished it the same exact day loved it. Now in the begining it may seem a little slow but it will all make up for it in the end and I'm proud to say that I read it. lou Loc is a phenomenal character I cried so much at the end but I'll let you decied what you think of it cause it thought it was great.

For those of us, who are not into the underground world of sex, drugs and street life, this book tells a facinating tale of that world. I really enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I basicly read this book in one day. If you read the back over it does not tell you much about the book. I hate to read reviews that tell the story. I love to read urban books, this one was one of the realest that I have read. The charters where real. I would have to compare this writer to Roy Glen. This is a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Terrible Read","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. I understand where Kwan was trying to go with the book, but the book should've been edited better before release. Sometimes it read like a book other times it read like a bad play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next","review":"First let me say that i am a HUGE K'WAN fan. I have all of his books and thoroughly enjoy them however Gangsta was for the birds. It was not well written and it did not flow well for me. It was slow and the whole gang connections were a little confusing and unnecessary for me. (I could've done wihout the whole bloodz and crips storyline) I also couldn't get with the way the book mentioned random people only to never talk about them again. I understand that this was his first book but I am glad that I didn't read this one before Hoodlum or Eve because I would have never bought another one of his books. However, I will say that K'wan has progressed as a writer and I am fan of his work (Gangsta excluded)."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT WAS REAL GOOD","review":"Put it like this. It did have plenty of slang in it and i can't see how in the other reviews people were saying they couldn't really understand what he was trying to say. I understood it. You basically have to understand what he's talking about and where he's coming from to understand the book or you might just be lost. In my opinion the story and plot deserved 10 stars because it was excellant. And this book is one of the better books that i have read from Triple Crown considering the publishings. But it's a good book and i recommend that you read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This man's retarded - and so is anyone who gave this more than a 1-star...","review":"Obviously, you all have no life to speak of...I would've given it a lower rating (like a MINUS 3-star!), but I couldn't find it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a really good book!","review":"when i first started the book i was like this is wack and even after i was done i was like it was ok. but then i sat down and read it again and me being from cali and moving to the east coast made me understand what they were talking about. in cali gangs are taken more seriously then on the east coast when i moved here looked at the gangs as a big joke and i still do sometimes cuz i see if the were to go to the west coast they would not be livin right now. so this is the type of book that you have to understand where the person is coming from."},{"rating":"2","title":"He kept it GANSTA","review":"This book was as the title states: GANSTA. Being from NY I took the whole gang thing like huh. They are out there but not like that. ANYWAY. He had me rooting for Lou-Loc and had me crying for Gutter. I was like damn Lou-Loc keeps it STRAIGHT GANSTA! I thought he would make it til I saw Martina trifflin azz. I am happy Gutter paid her a visit. This book was good. I thought it was different due to the gangs. It was good though."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST READ!!!!","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. K'wan is one the most talented authors of today and my favorite author. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Urban Tragedy","review":"Lou-Loc a well respected member of the Harlem Crips was introduced to the street life early. He was there to stay especially with his encouraging and misleading girlfriend. He wasn't headed anywhere until he met his true love, Satin. She turns his life around as he attempts to leave the street life and settle down. Can he leave the streets or if he addicted to the fast life?This book was pretty average. If weren't for the controversial ending I would have gave it 3 stars. It isn't a must read but It'll do. If you have nothing else to read this definitely a good book to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"This book reminded me of a very lame, teenage romance book. Pretty boring and predictable. Maid's daughter gets pregnant with mother's employer's rich son. He marries her, she loses the baby, she divorces him for money, they meet up years later, he falls in love with her again and they lived happily every after. The end. It finally had a sinister plot towards the end. I had to skip most of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the heart rate going!","review":"Ginna Gray is a new author for me.

Try this book; you'll definitely get hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"if it's your type...","review":"This is a good example of their live performances, no doubt. Listening to from start to finish can be tiring though. Some tracks last up to 14 minutes (if my memory serves correctly); which makes the songs you may not like last too long. Don't let me sound like the whole cd is filled with bad songs that are too long...that's not true. There are some great tracks such as \\"Front Porch\\" and \\"Maryanne.\\" I wish \\"Front Porch\\" would've been on Frozen in Time. This cd is great for background music while studying or having people over. It's not something everyone will like, and if you're new to FZ, get Frozen in Time first. I would recommend Frozen in Time before this cd, but if you are a big fan of Foxtrot, this is an obvious purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"No description on how unit power is re-charged!","review":"Haven't bought yet, because there is no explanation on how the buyer will recharge the battery/power.

Still, his solo work on this album is impassioned and gives a great glimpse of what's to come. Definitely worth owning for any Fela lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"SGT. PEPPER OF BLACK METAL","review":"The album blends classical and symphony sounds in Black Metal, including Gregorian style chants and classical church hymnals. Sounds like it could be used as a soundtrack for the \\"Omen.\\" I loved the final minute of \\"...and I am suffering\\" which was totally different than the rest of the song. I wish they had done more of it. The slow moving dirge would be an apt but unusual choice for the funeral of a death metal band member. Seems to lack the Satanic references of most black metal if I read my Latin correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back and more amazing then ever","review":"Very interesting directions this album takes place. Very emotional and after it is over I feel this is a dark masterpiece. Takes awhile and some listens to get into. Starts off slow and more classical/orchestral with an operatic atmophere they have used in the past but with the addition of the Adelaide orchestra it creates a very interesting soundscape. After that, they recreate the legendary song \\"Drink the Midnight Hymn\\" into a dark and doomy recreation \\"Midnight's Hymn\\" which is memorizing. From there the album turns into a gloomy and sorrowful experince blending and turning more into doom metal and gothic metal and rock with \\"and I am suffering\\" and \\"domine\\". Terrific album. I can't wait to hear the next two that come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reusable Grocery Bags","review":"Good product.

Ms. Syms made this recording at the end of her career, and the years have taken a toll on her voice. Maybe because I'm a year older, and a lot closer to Social Security than to my high school graduation, I gave this production a second hearing from a fresh perspective. I now see it as the effort of a valiant woman in the twilight of her years putting every ounce of her being into facing the challenges and indignities of what remains of her life. This time through I find her music heartfelt and touching. And I feel very privileged that I have this disc in my collection. It leaves me with the impression that the world is a somewhat better place because of the music that Sylvia Syms left to it. Don't buy this CD because you want to hear a wonderful voice. Get it because it is one of those rare recordings that will make you feel you are in the company of a very special human being."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sylvia Syms","review":"This CD is not easy to find since it was released on a smalllabel but do your damnedest to find it. Just to hear her sing\\"Fifty Per Cent\\" a classic from BALLROOM. She sings the song as if it were a three act play and tears your heart out. Miss Syms reallyunderstands the lyrics and even oddball choices like \\"YellowBird\\" and \\"Nice and Easy\\" are terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 stars performance.

It could be subtitled \\"I screwed Judy Garland and I want to tell the world.\\" The only earthly purpose this book possibly serves is to make the author feel like a celebrity and to wash his dirty linen in public. Even if everything he writes is true, he is barely a blip on the lifeline of Ms. Garland. It's not even well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to believe Meyer","review":"I am one of those fans that understand that Judy had her good days and bad days and accept the good as well as the bad about my favorite person. This book was nothing but a way for John Meyer to say that he \\"screwed\\" (to put it lightly) Judy in a hospital bed. It's a shame that people feel that they need to make up stories to make them look better and even make money off of it. The book is only interesting if you're into reading explicit details about sex between two people but who knows if it even happened. Other books about Judy do not even mention that she had a relationship with this man.

Based on another review here, I purchased 2 bands for when the new band inevitably gives. This band has already lasted longer than its predecessor, but I suspect it has more to do with me knowingly not pulling the band as far as it can go when shooting.Rubbing alcohol works great for lubing the forks to slide the band on, but be sure you have the band situated the way you want it to be when you shoot it - rearranging the rubber on the fork after the alcohol dries is nearly impossible without removing the band and starting over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Exercise Video","review":"I have been doing Jennifer Kries Pilates for years and just updated to the DVD's.

However, when it arrived I noticed that the small print on the back said that this is not the Pilates method, that it is not recognised or approved by the Pilates Guild and that references to the word Pilates are for discriptive purposes only. In fact, the DVD contains a combination of exercises from various disciplines.In addition to that, the main focus of the real Pilates method is improving posture, core stability and flexibility of the spine, whereas this DVD is only about 'toning and sculpting'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only use it for the abdominals","review":"its too much talking, not much exercising. the ab section is good tho.

But no longer. Frank Sinatra is a bit of a cad here, as he toys with the affections of 2 lovely women--Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak. The movie starts, in fact, as Frank (\\"Pal Joey\\") is being run out of town by the police, for trifling with the affections of an underage girl. Settled in San Francisco, Frank uses Rita to finance his new supper club, but cannot give up his star act, Kim Novak. All very shallow, and a rather nice (sweetened up) ending.Not to deny the power of the songs--Rodgers and Hart at their best.Not to deny the beauty of the Cinematography--glorious limpid shots of 50's San Francisco.But that plot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated, but not because it's old","review":"This movie expects the audience to believe that a really unappealing character like Sinatra's Joey would attract two very reasonable women.

Nice clothes, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - Would Love to See a Good Remake","review":"This movie took most of the great songs from the stage play and dumped them. For a theater lover this is heartbreaking. What a disappointing story. If a movie can be faithful to the theater version then this one is a class-A adulterer. Even the ending was changed and not for the better. The dubbing for the two leading ladies was also disappointing. A pretty face is not enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great film that's fun to watch","review":"You either love Frank or you hate him, that's all there is to it. Take the Frank factor out and this is still a great flick. Kim Novak is gorgeous to look at and plays the role of a good girl trying to make it in the rough world in a very charming way. Rita Hayworth is just lovely as the poor girl made good turned sugar momma. The music carries the story along in a way that you just don't see anymore.I'm not a fan of theatre and so I don't speak to the reviews of fans of the Broadway musical other than to say that they tend to go the route of the book people who never let films be just a film.If you hate Frank, skip it. If you want to watch a great old film with two gorgeous, curvy women to boot, then pop this one in, poor a drink, and enjoy. I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...except for the music.","review":"'Pal Joey\\" has a terrible plot, a disinterested Sinatra, a gorgeous Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak, never one of my favorites. The music and sound track is the only thing that keeps it above one star. There is no enthusiasm or chemistry of any kind. I am not anti Sinatra. Most of the time he does very well, but not here.

The worst thing about the TV is the VCR. From the very beginning, it didn't want to accept videotapes. At least 70% of the time, the tapes would \\"catch,\\" and the VCR would spit them back out. When we finally got the tape into the VCR, it occasionally didn't record properly. It was very loud rewinding and fast-forwarding. Then there was the DVD player, which didn't seem to handle the sound on the DVDs very well. Half the time, we'd have to turn the volume all the way up to the max in order to hear the dialogue. We tried adjusting all the audio settings, but nothing helped.In short, steer clear of this one... The model we exchanged it for is a Panasonic PV-DM2792, and so far, it's 100% better (not to mention less expensive!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd recommend against","review":"I just bought this unit about 2 weeks ago and have been very disappointed. The picture quality is inferior to most other flat-screen TVs. The red colors are oversaturated (Yes, I adjusted the colors), the picture is grainy. And the DVD player is noisy as heck. I wish I'd gone with the Sony flatscreens, which had far better pictures. I was persuaded by the convenience of the triple-play features, which are cool because they save a lot of wiring hassle, but the cons outweigh the pros. If the unit were much cheaper, it might be worthwhile. But aside from using this as a kid's recreation-room unit, I'd veer away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too heavy, No warranty","review":"I currently own several Panasonic TV's and TV/VCR Combo's and they have been for the most part trouble free. In September 2001 I bought a 27\\" flat screen TV from Panasonic and it has been nothing but trouble as of April 2002. The major problem has been with support. Yes, I own a good deal of A/V gear including some Pro A/V gear, but the support problem has been with the warranty periods offered by Panasonic on large heavy screen TV's. Don't be fooled by the warranty you see here or at a retail store. The labor is only for 90 days, and they'll charge you big time for labor.Almost everything I have from Panasonic has been trouble-free, but if you do have a problem, be prepared to throw away and re-purchase because it would cost less than the labor charges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misunderstood and Underrated","review":"So you're Joe Curious about Ween and see a lot of bad and good reviews of this record.

So, if you hate country, this probably isn't your thing, but the wealth of complaints about this record are totally unmerited. It's good, but not like the other 5 Ween albums.

Some Ween fans may not agree but I believe that this album shows the versatility of this band. The same comical, melodic, happy-filled music with a southern edge. Songs like \\"Mr. Richard Smoker\\" go above and beyond Ween's potential to write a good song, it is a reinvention of themselves. \\"Piss Up a Rope\\" takes you on the road to relationship angst that can be compared to the very best scenes from \\"Springer\\".

I can't stand Country/Western music; and I thought it was absolutely brilliant the way Ween \\"over-does\\" it, sort of a satire. When I heard this CD at a friend's house, I just had to go buy it. I played it at work, and two of my coworkers bought it. I played it for a friend of mine, he bought a copy and played it at work, and three of his coworkers went out and bought it!

Despite this, I found WEEN's album to be full of entertaining moments... despite the fact that it is steeped in country cliches. Perhaps it helps that I've been a WEEN fan for a while.. regardless, I advise this album to anyone with an appreciation for humorous takes on popular subjects. You'll not look at country the same way again... plus, there are some very competent musicians on this album - so even if you are leery of implied vicious punditry, you can enjoy the musicianship of the artists on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"end of confusion","review":"the '12' in \\"12 Golden Country Greats\\" refers to the number of musicians they had on the record; not the number of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The soundtrack of my life","review":"I Laughed, I cried, and I contemplated suicide.

It takes the PS2 to it's full capacity, with breathtaking graphics, a great story line, and excellent gameplay. It's the next half-life!!! But what makes the game truly awesome , besides it's fantastic gameplay, graphics, and sound, is the that you can blow up ALMOST ANY WALL!!! Have you ever had a door that you just couldn't unlock on half-life or any other 1st person shooter? And you just get so mad you wanna shout? Well, than this is the game for you. for this game, all you have to do is get out your R-launcher, take a well-aimed shot,and......KA-BOOM!!! Your problems are solved. Be warned tough, you cannot destroy well-reinforced walls or doors(obviously). So with this unique feature, and it's excellent gameplay, graphics, and sound; I rate this a 5-star game(I would make it a 10-star game, but unfortunatly, you can't do that).

You can make tunnels literally miles long with a rocket launcher or grenades, etc. Very awesome.The sound and graphics are pretty good but the control is a little hard to get used to, especially with no keyboard or mouse.Red Faction is definently good, but there are way better FPS games out there.

The action is almost non-stop, with a puzzle structure that is extremely well balanced: Chanllenging enough to hold the player's interest without being overly difficult to solve, making the pace of the game just right.The weapons are varied, and powerful.

The AI of the enemys is good enough to keep you from running out into the open and taking everyone down(that is except on the easy mode MMMMM.... eeeaaasssyyyyy). The Geo-mode technology is a cool feature. In one part you can blast a hole in front of a vehicle crossing a bridge. If the hole is big enough the vehicle will get caught in it and fall down.

It's one of the cheapest quality nail polishes I've ever used, chipping within hours of being put on (while I slept no less!) & lasting no more than 3 days total. By that time it was chipped halfway down each nail & looking like a 2 week old manicure. I'm pretty careful about my hands, wearing gloves while I do dishes etc. but that made no difference, it seemed every time I moved a new piece came off.Nars is *supposed* to be a high-end product, commanding top dollar for their cosmetics. This is the 3rd product I've used & the 3rd time I've been disappointed. I highly recommend you skip them entirely & take yourself to a MAC store! MAC's cosmetics last 3 times as long, contain higher pigments & are of much better quality for far less money. I was taken in by the hype, I should've stuck by the brand I trust.Not impressed, Nars."},{"rating":"1","title":"NARS' \\"Orgasm\\" is a horrendous color","review":"This review is for NARS' Orgasm color, which I bought on Amazon. Although the quality of the NARS product line seems to be fine (it uses safer ingredients than your average nail polish, some colors appear to be nice), I didn't not have such luck with Orgasm. When I reviewed the color sample online I had expected it to be a slightly pinker version of normal fingernail colors. However, when I received it, it was sparklier than it appeared to be in the picture, and there was also an ugly sheen to it, which only reminded me of bacteria and mold.I don't know about you, but I don't want unexpected yellow coloring on my nails, much less have it coming from something called Orgasm. Unfortunately I cannot return it on Amazon, so this nail polish will gather dust in the back of my medicine cabinet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful","review":"Many readers appear to seek a scientific work here, a scientific theory with solid evidence to back it up. This approach is too tight. The book is more fun and more useful as an elaboration beyond the provable of titillating facts from many disciplines. When all is said, the information from the various sciences is not just about engineering, but about our view of ourselves and where we fit into the universe. This book helped me reflect upon these matters, and brought to my attention information that had slipped by unnoticed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"I did think the book disintegrated in the last third, but the first parts were fascinating. I reread and reread how he explains that the conscious brain perceives things a half second after they happen, and back-peddles so it perceives them in real time. I couldn't avoid concluding that what the author was saying was that the conscious mind literally GOES BACK IN TIME to be in sync with WHEN an event actually happened. Did other readers understand it that way? An amazing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This book explains the bandwidth of consciousness.

For instance the part about thermodynamics and the connection with information theory and probability theory I found very interesting,although it has little to do with consciousness.I have one serious problem with the book : Norretranders is not intellectually honest. He attempts too much to force his theory upon his readers, all the while oversimplifying, using suggestive language (the word \`information' is used in different contexts, with different meanings and it doesn't become clear from reading the text), and avoiding problematic questions.The result is that the book is very tiresome to read, and its conclusions cannot be trusted.It raised some interesting points though, that's the reason why I 've continued reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"How many times...?","review":"The author repeated the same ideas so many times in order to get across various points regarding information, disorder and entropy in the first 100 pages that, feeling frustrated and lectured to to such a degree, I ripped the book in half and threw it in a road-side bin. Mr Norretranders is obviously a highly intelligent man, and knows how to write, but would have produced a far more engaging book had he assumed that some of his readership also knows how to think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusual Disallusion","review":"This book is a summary of work taken from books that Tor has read. The constant reference to other works is irritating. Having read them he then gives us his theory of conciousness which is not really supported by any tangible evidence (other than others have already thought of this idea - as well as the idea being the basis of many other religions).Its a well researched 'one idea' book, an idea that we all had at the beginning of the nineties when GUIs were appearing on computers.I bought the book because I thought it was a genuine scientific text.

Norretranders shows just how impossibly much information we take in each moment, and how much is stored away, way more than we would ever suspect. I've witnessed this many times in my hypnotic work, the shocking capacity and depth and quality of memory that comes up in people in deep trance, even when the information is seemingly trivial.

In addition the dictionary does not give you an English pronunciation and was utterly useless for someone who has a hard time reading arabic.- Not to mention that many translations did not include vowels.The speaker was practically useless as well considering only about half of the words had the ability to be amplified.This dictionary is a worthless piece of junk, and ridiculously expensive.You are better off with a paper dictionary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Help Me Find this song","review":"this is the best CD you'll ever buy there is a song on here titled \\" nobody knows\\" it was remade buy someone else I want this song extreamly bad but cant seem to find it any where are find who the artist is any help would be greatly excepted thanks rebecca"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Distinctive Music","review":"This album has lots of gems on it.

The album is not without its problems however, there are a few filler songs such as \\"Love Bomb\\" and \\"Population 4000 minus 1\\".

The plot was vague and the conclusion unsatisfying. It was surely not worth my time or my money. Very disappointing"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hard Read!","review":"Extremely disappointing if you're a die hard Kellerman/Alex Delaware fan. This novel was barely kept alive by its characters whom we've grown to love over the years. Perhaps as one other reviewer suggested, it's time for a new \\"hero\\" for Mr. Kellerman, or perhaps he should try a different genre because this one was particularly difficult to plod through and I would not recommend to anyone who does not have a loyalty to the cast of Kellerman's Delaware series."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I think this series has run its course. The story line for this one is very tired. The main characters go through the same motions. I could not work up any interest or empathy for any of the 'victims.' Everything seems to happen off stage.His son's new novel is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad Kellerman is not a psychotherapist...","review":"anymore, anyway. His world is divided into white and black - all right for pulp fiction, not for psychology. I wouldn't want him to try to make his characters any deeper, either. Even though Alex Delaware might recommend a patient take medication, Jonathan Kellerman thinks less of human beings who do. His \\"good\\" characters (victim/heroes), are too strong and good to succumb to needing medication. Hollywood = bad people. One of the worst villains in the book is named Robert Fisk, and likes healthy food.But it's not a terrible read. I did lose some of the threads in the middle, like others. Milo and Rick's relationship is great to have highlighted, and there are some vivid scenes. I'll probably read more of Kellerman's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to Finish","review":"I should have listened to the reviews before buying this book. No plot, unless you like reading over 400 pages to a disappointing, unfulfilling non-ending. Hard to keep track of all the characters, their relationships and their aliases. Confusing. No more Kellerman for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very exciting and intricate plot!","review":"I really enjoyed Jonathan Kellerman's Obsession which is an Alex Delaware/Milo Sturgis book. Tanya Bigelow was a patient of Alex's when she was just a girl. Now, at 19, Tanya calls Alex out of the blue and ultimately convinces Alex and Milo to investigate her mother's deathbed confession of having killed a man. Although armed with very minimal information, Alex and Milo believe they can quickly ascertain that Tanya's mother, Patty, did not murder anyone and give Tanya the assurances she is looking for. However, as they begin to explore the many address shifts Tanya and her mother made over the years they begin to believe perhaps a murder did occur. When someone new is murdered, they dig harder and uncover the truth. A very exciting and intricate plot...this is one you will probably have trouble putting down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"J. Kellerman always good","review":"I forget if this is one of the ones I read already, or if it's the one I'm saving for later (of 3 that I bought the other month). If I read this one, it's a good book. If I didn't, I know it'll be good, because I like all Jonathan Kellerman's books. (His wife Faye is too gory for my taste, but Jonathan is fine.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his worst....","review":"Kellerman's last few books have been forgettable to say the least and I hoped that this would display the quality of his early writing. While it was not a total waste of time, it came close. Far too much print was devoted to the half-hearted team meetings of people in mud colored clothing as they outlined ever more convoluted theories as to who had done what to and with whom. This is yet another book that lacks credibility or suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did Patty Bigelow do? (2.5 *s)","review":"The deathbed warning or \\"confession\\" by emergency room nurse Patty Bigelow to her college student daughter Tanya showed promise, but the book is ultimately unsatisfying.The character connections are too convenient, if not confusing: the drug-user neighbor of Patty who maybe fathered a deviant child with ex-porn star other neighbor with the child as a teen-ager having unseemly dealings with the son of the sister of the drug-user, the same drug-user found strangled shortly after Patty died - and so it goes.Apparently the author assumes that the characters are well known from previous books, because serious character development is totally absent. For example, it would have been nice for Alex Delaware's live-in girlfriend/wife Robin and detectives Petra Connor and Milo Sturgis to be other than sketches. The reader can decide if Patty's supposed involvement in a confessed action is actually established or handled well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't measure up...","review":"I must confess that I have only read a couple of Kellerman's novels, however, I completely enjoyed them. This one just didn't measure up to his ability to create a page-turner. I thought there was far too much dialogue, little mystery, irrelevant characters who only muddied the waters. I would prefer a book to be shorter rather than extended by fluff. I expect sharp, concise writing with developed, significant characters from someone with Kellerman's credentials. Too many names in the mix and it becomes difficult to maintain a smooth storyline; it becomes too \\"busy\\". I won't say that I will never read another of his books, but I hope they are better than Obsession!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsession","review":"I was very disappointed in this book and would certainly not consider it a 'best seller' candidate. Kellerman's constant use of dialog without the 'he said', 'she said' phrases was overdone to the extent of being ridiculous. If an unknown writer, such as I, were to present a manuscript like this to a publisher, it would probably end up in file 13, and I would be papering my bathroom walls with yet another rejection letter.The story line was good, and I continued to force myself to put up with the writing style so as to find out 'who done it?'. But I will not recommend it to my comembers of the First Editions Book Club at my favorite independent bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"obsession smells like bad fish","review":"I have read every one of the Alex Deleware series...some are good and others stink.

Kellerman Ever","review":"I wish I had read the reviews before I started reading this book. It has an incredibly weak plot - to the point that I just didn't care.

Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"He just gets better","review":"I am throughly enjoying this book. As for the scuttlebut that Robin should die or Milo. The books wouldn't be the same. It's an ensemble cast and they all play a part to make it work. Milo for the police work and Robin to provide Alex with some sort of life away from it all. What's with everyone any more thinking it's so easy to eliminate people from their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obsession","review":"I enjoyed this book,not like Kellermans past books but was ok. I read half of it while on a flight halfway across the country and the rest on the was back. There were no twists in this book, you knew from the beginning who the bad guy was. An ok book and kept my mind occupied while flying."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So","review":"This is a Ho Hum one from J. Kellerman. The setup in the first pages is interesting and contains the obscure premise for the remainder of the effort. The story proceeds like a scavenger hunt/charades game. Lots of meetings between various main and axillary characters and tidbits revealed each time. Finally a big climax. Then there is a gratuitous after thought in the last few pages.As another commenter mentioned, Robin continues to be an irritant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring,Boring,Boring.........Worst book I've ever read .","review":"This is my first book from Kellerman and my last. It started out slow and I hoped it would pick up. Well that never happened through out the whole book. I was so mad at the end of every chapter because I could not believe it was sooo dull. I would have more fun getting root canal. The ending was the worst let down. After putting up with the torture of reading the entire book it ended with as much excitement as watching your nails grow. Don't waste your money like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.......","review":"Although I'm usually a fan of Milo and Alex, this book was really boring.

Ill give the last one I have..(compulsion I think) a shot and hopefully its improved.

Or why. Or about any of the characters in the plot-line other than our regulars -- Alex, Milo, and Robin. I think the initial plot device, a vague deathbed confession from an unlikely murderer, was a good idea.

This story is so convoluted and ill conceived that I lost interest each and every time I attempted to pick up another thread.

For me the writing was all over the place. Not so much the story line, but the words themselves.Yes I finished it & towards the middle & end it got slightly better, but if someone was reading this book for the first time, I'm sure they wouldn't pick his other books up.I'll have to see if his other books keep me interested enough to continue with all of his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather boring","review":"I am a big Kellerman fan. Actually, the only reason I didn't give up on this book sooner is because he wrote it. What a letdown. The premise to the story was very dumb.

Bad story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Unbelievable","review":"This book was not up to the usual Kellerman/Alex Delaware standards. I think maybe JK has run out of ideas and is stretching a bit too much. There were way too many characters who were not well developed confusing the reader. And what PD has the time to spend on a crime which never was reported? I know we have to suspend belief when reading fiction, but, come on, Milo and Alex solved a series of murders from nothing more than a few words from a dying woman???I only kept reading to see if anything interesting was happening in the private lives of Alex & Robin and Milo & Rick!JK, please don't just keep churning out books."},{"rating":"1","title":"finish or not finish","review":"Thought I would look at the reviews.

I found that reading this one first made the River God book come alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read, references to self is too conceited","review":"I like Wilbur Smith's writing style.I think he does a great job of creating a compelling fictional story intertwined with plenty of true historical references and with placement in real-life locations and other real-life artifacts.I read the book in about a month of on and off reading and enjoyed the characters.The drawbacks of this author are that: 1) he can name-drop too much in describing the rich lives the characters lead and how they accessorize their material lives, and 2) the most egregious thing about the book is that Wilbur references 'River God,' in the book and himself too. I would never do that and find it offensive that an author needs to actually refer to himself in a fictional novel. That's just tactless and ruins what could be a superlative fictional book.If you don't mind these too much - and I guess I didn't - and love Egyptology, then I'd recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four Stars","review":"I did not like this one as much as I enjoyed RIVER GOD mostly because this takes place present day while RIVER GOD takes place 4,000 years ago. However, I found it to be a very good read, enjoyable and interesting. The descriptions are well written; however, I found some adjectives to be pretentious, and I feel that the disturbing scene a little more than half way through the book is too much. After reading RIVER GOD, I thought Wilbur Smith MIGHT be tied with my favorite author Marion Zimmer-Bradley. But, now that I've read THE SEVENTH SCROLL, that is not the case. While I give every novel in Zimmer-Bradly's Avalon series five stars, Smith's Ancient Egypt series has gone down to four stars on the second book. I do plan on reading WARLOCK, but if there are disturbing, gory scenes in that book I will have to conclude that Smith is not for me in particular. Until then..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it - but not a quick read","review":"Working in Ireland for nearly two months I picked this up in a second hand bookshop and figured it would keep me occupied for a week. Three days later I finished the book and was wondering why I'd not read anything by Wilbur before. He has a command of word that many authors don't and this book combines the thrill of finding an unknown tomb, a mystery, romance and treasure hunt. Not many men can write a good romance amid all the other action but this guy nailed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Archeology & Egyptology Buffs Take Note!","review":"I get into archeology, especially in Egypt, so I enjoyed this book and \\"River God\\" immensely.

I saw one of the reviews of this book stating that the books are approximately four thousand years apart in setting and that got my attention even more -- I had to see how this link could be ... the concept was wonderful. Now, on the other side of the coin, I found the characters and plot line development to be rather cookie-cutter. After being thrilled with River God, perhaps my expectations were simply too high for The Seventh Scroll. If you like an old fashioned treasure hunt, then The Seventh Scroll is for you. If like me you want to recapture the joy of reading about Taita, you'll surely be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Seventh Scroll by Wilbur Smith","review":"This book arrived in good condition but smelled so badly of cigarette smoke that Icouldn't give it as a gift.

I first read The River God and was amaized to find out that there was this sequal available. Having snapped it up immediately, I set down to read the book.I was found to be in a vegetative state whilst reading the book. Completely oblivious to everything else around me until it was finished. It was very easy going and I was taken into the heart of Ethiopia where our famous Taita created the most amaizing and stunning tomb--the richest in history.I now find out that there is another book which is the sequal to this book. I assure you that that book is on its way to my post office as i write this review.Wilbur - thanks for such a lekker series of books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indiana Jones and Mr. Smith's Wild Ride!","review":"Forget Doomed Temples and crusty Crusaders, this story growls like an English bulldog and chases you through 600+ pages of adventure sleuthing replete with unscrupulous baddies and just enough romance to keep you turning the pages. Smith dances across Eqypt and Ethiopia, chasing clues left 4,000 years ago by Taita, leading to a lost Egyptian tomb. Read it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have ever read!","review":"This book rates above 10, once I started it I could not put it down. The characters are expertly developed and the story line is impecable. There is twist after twist and that just keeps you reading. This book should carry a warning because once you pick it up you will have no life until you reach the last page"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smith's success","review":"Aside from the fact that I have not yet finished \\"The Seventh Scroll\\", I can justifiably say Smith's style of writing is the epitome of superb English. His selective diction & distinct atmosphere compliments the scintillating plot which makes \\"The Seventh Scroll\\" one of the most worthwhile novels I have ever read. Good Job![Dom Doyle - IRELAND]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the Macmillan Audiotape","review":"The original River God audiotape was superb. The Macmillan Audiotape 3 hour abridged version of \\"The Seventh Scroll\\" sequel is pale and frustrating. So much has been cut out by the abridgement that much of the story's glory and flow is lost. This edition is a great disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Amazing!!","review":"HI there!! I just want to recommend this book and River God since they are my favorites. Mr. Smtih is such a writing genius! He describes every single thing in such a perfect way that allows you to imagine every single detail of the landscapes. Besides, The story is incredible. It's a mixture of suspense, action, adventure, that keeps the reader in the edge of his seat through out the whole book. I would definetely recommend this book for the Egypt lovers such as me and those who are looknig an entertaining book. Just read God River first so that you become very well acquainted with the characters and the lecture of the Seventh Scroll is easier to understand. I hope You'll enjoy this book as much as i did ( i read both books 5 times each) kisses"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"what a follow on from his previous title, this finished the story of the Egyption lifline with great aplomb.I wolud recomend this and the previous book of Smith's highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wilbur Smith in Africa Again","review":"I enjoyed The Seventh Scroll.

I don't think it is as powerful as some of his earlier works but it is very enjoyable none the less."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzz","review":"This is the worst sequel ever to such a great book as River God. The characters are lame, straight out of a romance novel, and everything about the book is so incredibly predictable, I skipped the pages until I finally got to what I knew was gonna happen, after a lot of unnecessary detail. The good guys get what they want, and the bad guys all get their comeuppance. Very boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST DESI MOVIE EVER!!!","review":"IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE INDIAN CULTURE SEE THIS MOVIE.

It's fine for peeking into the neighbor's window across the street or looking at the a large, bright object in the sky like the moon. But for serious stargazing, one shouldn't expect much from this telescope or any telescope in this price range. No telescope in this price range is much good for looking at stars or other faint objects. A really good pair of binoculars for around the same price would probably give you more enjoyment and be more versatile. Just lie on the ground and look through both eyes at the moon or constellations, and then take them to the ballgame the next day. And try to get away from city lights. If you do get binoculars, make sure that the second number is at least 7 times the first number (e.g., get 7x50 binoculars, but not 7x35) and that they have fully multi-coated lenses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great scope for the kids","review":"I've had a C6 Celestron for some time.

Every chapter was moving, beautifully written and easy to relate to. This is a book no one should miss, a story that deserves to be heard.

I think the plot and characters were strong enough to build an interesting story without so many sex scenes. While I am no master at the drug dealing game, from my research, the content seems to be realistic and believable. Menage Unique Legend is the main character. We travel with him through his life of Benjamins, name brand everything and promiscuity. This combination proceeds to turn his life upside down. One this journey, he learns that material possessions and easy sex is not a part of obtaining true love and a fulfilling life.At the end of this journey, he finds himself and redemption, but at what cost?Rating: 2--Reviewed by Tanya Bates for C&B; Books (2/05)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest","review":"This author is so great.

I always look for new books that challenge the way I think about Jesus and the Holy Spirit. And what I have learned since becoming saved and sanctified, is that in order to flow freely in the gifts, or in order to minister effectively; we HAVE to become broken first. Everything about us must be surrendered to the Cross. We must not just have head knowledge, but heart knowledge. We have to become humble and allow the Holy Spirit to work in us, so that ultimately He can shine through us. Excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"book","review":"Arrived before promised date. Great for spiritual growth. If you want to get real with God, this is a definate read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Awesome","review":"This was the first book I ever read by Watchman Nee. A friend told me about him, so I decided to read this. I had no idea what I was about to read would forever change my life. This is not only a book. But there is so much of God's revelation in these pages it was at many times too overwhelming for me to read more than a few pages at a time. So I'm not sure if any of you have gotten as much as myself from this book. But I think if you are open to God's voice and have an earnest desire to live and walk in God's perfect will for your life, then the awesome truth in this book will impact your life deeply."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a new translation - look for an earlier edition","review":"After reading Watchman Nee's excellent book \\"Release of the Spirit\\" published by Christian Fellowship Publishers, I began searching for a copy to give to a friend. I found \\"The Breaking of the Outer Man and the Release of the Spirit\\" which I thought was only repackaged and retitled edition, but upon examination I discovered that it is in fact a quite substantial retranslation of the original work by a different publishing house.To me, this new edition has not captured the clarity, directness and frankness I found in \\"Release of the Spirit\\", and while it may be intended to soften the blow or make the text more reader friendly I find the basic message to be obscured in this new edition. Also, this new edition omits the diagram found in the introduction to \\"Release of the Spirit\\" which is so helpful and a key to the entire book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Releasing the Mingled spirit","review":"This is a critical book for every seeker of the Lord Jesus Christ. A lot of times we have our own agenda with God - what we want God to do for us. But the Lord's desire needs to overcome our fallen desire in order for Him to accomplsh His plan in us. This book shows, among other things, that God needs to overcome (break) our desires, plan, wants, needs, everything that is sourced in us, in order to fill us with Himself and and that we become an expression of Him. Hallelujah! Definitely a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is THE secret of success in Christ","review":"Nee unfolds the secret that sorts the mature from the immature in Christ: simply the breaking of the outer man. Having gone through what Nee describes in this book, I now see from the perspective Nee describes should be essential for all Christians.If you want to know why you are not fruitful in your life as a Christian God can use Nee's work here to reveal what you must do to be fruitful for His glory.It's a small book that God used in my life to do BIG things."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lord's Life Revealed","review":"Nowadays, few Christians prefer to talk about the truth of the Cross, the center of our Lord's life. Many christians are content with worldly comforts and shallow understanding of Bible. With a life testifying to the Lord's truth and love, Watchman Nee is one of the most important servants of the Lord in the past few centuries.I totally agree with a previous review which says \\" you have to live it to appreciate it\\".

This story of events grips the reader or at least me and had me questioning how things could go so bad. It does not really touch you on an emotional level but more on an intellectual one. The information is all there and is told in matter-of-fact prose. It does not really editorialize and that is what I liked about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re: Jack Benny 1930 \\" The Medicine Man\\" movie","review":"Nice funny movie.

For many of us that is just not an option.This book, instead, shows how to use Japanese fabrics, kimono, chests, etc, to give a Japanese style to your Western interior - WITHOUT - having to remodel. It does show some spaces that were built specifically for the Japanese look, but most of the book is more about decorating your existing space. I enjoyed also the suggestions about breaking up a space with hanging dividers and also creating a japanese-style bedroom, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I thought this was going to be similar to several other \\"Ranger\\" books,(like RIP Ford, Jack Hayes) eye witness accounts of Texas history.

A second-rate Smackdown vs. Raw ripoff. The story is stupid as heck. The garphics look like they were made by a drunk 4 year old. It's very gimmacky and cartoony to say the least. I give this game a 0 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible wrestling, terrible Simpsons","review":"Not even a good Simpsons game. The characters can walk through the ropes, the physics are horrible and your not even sure if your playing Bart or Lisa, even with the squeeky, hard to distinguish voices.

It was near the terrible line. The graphics weren't great and overall, it just wasn't good enough to be a good game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst game ever.","review":"I am an avid Simpsons fan, and I own upwards of 50 playstation titles. This is by far the worst game I have ever played. The graphics are abominable, the controls even worse, and the game is just plain no fun.

Do yourself a favor and don't buy this...get Road Rage instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Game Is An Insult","review":"Doh! The biggest mistake I ever made in my life is buying this game. It is not Playstation-quality. It is not Super-Nintendo-quality. It is not even Regular-Nintendo-quality. This game is Atari-quality. I played it for about 5 minutes - had no way of returning it - so I gave it away to my little cousin who might be too young to realize how bad it is. The graphics are amazingly bad (broken lines!) and the gameplay is non-existant. My grandmother could make a better game."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Game Rocks","review":"If you love the simpsons, and I know you do, then you'll love this Game.

I certainly do!! I watch all their episodes (new and old). And what's not to love about them? They're silly, funny, and witty!! I can't say i'm a big Simpsons fan but i am a fan none the less so when i saw they had a wrestling game for playstation, i said i had to get this game!!Well, like some of the Simpsons episodes, this game was disappointing. it wasn't all that interesting and the wrestling moves, i thought, were limited. and it's a very easy game to beat but then again, some of you might like that. In any case, it was still fun for an unchanllenging game. It was only fun for about 10 minutes.I wouldn't recommend this game at all unless you like simple fighting games. And if you are a Simpsons fan, you'll get it anyway regardless whether the game isn't all that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not great","review":"This game for me was a straight impulse buy since I love the Simpsons. I was hoping for this game to reflect of the show as being good but it was only OK. At first it was good, the humor in it and all. Then as I went to the tournment, I noticed my moves were limited. Along with the lack of moves the game gets increasingly difficult. Of course games are suppose to be difficult but this was too much. When I got up to Smithers I couldn't even get a punch off! Outof 10 fights, at least, I won 1. My advice is not to buy but if you want to find out for yourself, you might think different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool DVD!","review":"I wish I could say I use as much as I should!

I did not attempt the legs plus arms sections for my knees get sore easily. I did do the arms section without the legs and thought it was great! In addition, I absolutely LOVE the buns sections!! They are awesome and don't leave me with sore knees as some other buns workouts have in the past! DVD probably directed my a man for there was way too much breast showing. I found that irritating!!!

Nine different 10 minute workouts focusing on various muscle groups. Customize your workout and pick 3 of the muscle groups/intensity levels you want to do that day!The mix and match is awesome.

I hope these girls make more videos like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Way to Strength Train","review":"I LOVE this DVD. I don't even think you can buy it in stores anymore; this is my third time purchasing because I've worn out two other DVDs! You can choose from nine 10-minute sessions: three abs, three butt, arms, legs, or arms and legs. I hate strength training but this video actually gets me to do it. The 10 minutes goes really quickly and using this video in conjunction with cardio (doing one abs segment 4x a week and arms and lower body 2x a week) helped me get my best body ever. The moves are simple, the transitions are nice and slow, and the girls are cute and not annoying. My favorite is the arm segment! It's hard to find good DVDs for toning your arms."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for moms","review":"This dvd is great if you need to breakup your workout into little bits. I am home with a baby and sometimes she won't let me finish an entire workout so this is really good because you can just do 10, 20 or 30 minutes at a time. Not much on here cardio wise but a really good tone up type of workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout for the entire body","review":"With me being not as in shape as the girls in the video I did have some problems with the Ab exercise, but I could tell I was doing it good enough cause I felt it afterwards. I was sore the first couple of times doing all the different exercises, but now that I have done them enough times the soreness afterwards is gone. Overall a good toning exercise, if you want a cardio exercise you will definitely need to buy a different video. I would definitely recommend this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the working mom","review":"I was looking for a way to include exercise in my hectic schedule and this is it! I can do 10, 20 or 30 minutes depending on my schedule that morning. This helped me get back into the exercise routine even if it is only 10 minutes. I also like the variety of being able to pick from 9 different segments. The instructors give clear instructions and focus on proper form and are not annoying at 6:00am. I have a shelf full of exercise videos but I keep playing this one. Most others require 45-60 min. and I don't have that right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"With two little kids at home I have found this to be a great workout. You can pick any 2 or 3 10 minute segments and really feel like you get a good workout. Great for toning and firming butt and leg muscles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, concise, and effective","review":"This is an excellent workout DVD if you are looking for something to strengthen and tone specific areas. I love the fact that I can choose between three half-hour workouts focusing on the abs, buns, or arms and legs; OR mix and match three different 10-minute segments of my choosing. All three instructors are clear and concise, and the exercises are varied and interesting. None of them are very difficult but they are all effective. The time flies by since everything is done in 10-minute periods. I highly recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Challenging","review":"I was disappointed with this DVD after reading all the reviews on it. The exercises may be ok for beginners, but for anyone else, don't expect to see results. There are not enough repetitions of each excercise and they just seem totally useless. There also is not much explaining or warm up, so some of the ab and bun excersices could cause some back problems. The dialogue is much too cutesy. I would suggest Tamilee Webb's \\"I Want That Body\\" instead. You can do hers in 15 minute segments and you will see results. They are more difficult, but at least you're not wasting your time and risking injuring yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners or those with limited flexibility","review":"This DVD is for those who are already in good shape who need some new challenges. It could have been titled \\"Quick Toning for Contortionists\\". I have bad knees and have been back into exercising for just over a month, and a lot of these moves were very stressful to my joints (a lot of crossing and bending at weird angles). I was very disappointed with the choice of exercises.On the plus side, the directions were very clear, the sound and camera work was good, it was easy to select the segments you wanted and the ladies demonstrating the moves could give Barbie a run for her money. For those who are already firm, toned, and flexible, enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this DVD!","review":"Fast, efficient, and easy to change to accomodate my needs. I highly recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow I feel it!","review":"I'm impressed! I just bought this video mainly for the lower body part of the workout. I did the three buns segment, the leg and arm segment, and the legs segment...and I could barely finish that last ten minutes! This is my second favorite exercise video/dvd... right after Weights II (Francesca Gern...a fabulous body sculpting video that is hard to find). Make sure you warm yourself up before doing this dvd...there is virtually no warm up or cool down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mix-it-Up Workout","review":"I love this workout DVD concept. You can mix and match nine 10-minute segments in any order you choose. The only thing I wish is that there were a little more variety.You get three abs workouts; three buns work outs, one upper body, one lower body and one both. This basically means you have 4.5 lower body workouts. I would have liked a more even balance between upper and lower body.That aside, this is one of my favorite workout DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great system!","review":"This DVD is great. The only problem I have with it is the menu you use to customize your workout is a little confusing. It'd be nice to have some instructions for it. I'm sure I'll figure it out though.The workout segments themselves are great. I used it for the first time last night and did one ab session and one bun session. I'm really feeling it this morning, and I workout almost everyday. The moves are very different than your typical sit ups, crunches, etc. but are not hard to follow. The instructors are motivating but not annoying. I'm definitely going to keep my eyes open for more Quick Fix DVDs, I think I'll try their Yoga/Pilates DVD next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"This is a great workout to target specific areas. I like that you can mix and match the workouts. I only wish you can mix and match more than 3 segments at one time."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Beginners","review":"After all the great reviews I read on this item, I was so disappointed when I finally got it. I would consider myself advanced in terms of cardio but low intermediate in terms of strengths. Even with that, however, I did not find this DVD challenging at all. I'm sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS BEST!!","review":"I been tried use varied of all video tape of workout or i go GYM work out of walking. but this dvd workout is best. i mean when i start doing it for almost 5 min i start feeling the muscle is working good and feel there. wow. this best. Pls Lady and gentlment use this my husband is starting use this he also feel it. best. smile!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Husband noticed tighter butt!","review":"No kidding--I did all three butt exercises about 2-3X per week and didn't tell anyone. One night my husband said, \\"I don't know what you're doing, but I swear your butt is smaller.\\" That's the best compliment I've ever gotten to keep motivated! What is really encouraging is that I'm a fitness fanatic and pretty mean and lean, so for him to notice something was different means it's the truth! I've memorized the moves, and I do a few while the coffee is brewing, waiting in line anywhere...I really don't care what people think about that. I've gotten some people to join in during particularly long waits!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"This is a great workout in itself, but I usually use it for 10-20 min of toning after cardio. The video has three different sections it focuses on (abs, butt, and arms and legs). And then each section has three different workouts. You can mix and match up to three sections to play in a row. The workouts are all good. And the only equipment you need is a set of dumbbells and a chair. The only reason I gave it four stars is that they get really chatty and after the first time it gets annoying. I usually turn the sound off on the DVD and play music instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten minutes goes fast","review":"This is the first DVD format exercise program I have purchased, and I was unsure how I would like the switch from video. It is the perfect format for \\" Total Mix.\\" It's simple to select just which body part I want to focus on.If you haven't experienced the Quickfix system, it's a pleasant surprise. Each 10-minute session displays a clock that counts down the minutes - a reassuring little motivation to help you through the workout.While I wouldn't use this DVD as my primary workout video, it's an fairly pleasant supplement. The three attractive exercise teachers at times seem to border on salacious, and their conversations grow a bit tedious. The excercises are effective, interesting and seem grounded in exercise physiology. The music is appealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"great workout!!","review":"This is such a great exercise video!! I am not exactly thrilled with the idea of a workout, but when I did this one I loved it. Each segment goes by so fast yet at the same time I could feel that I was getting a great workout, I did four of the segments without even thinking about it and I felt great afterward. I can see this will be one workout that I will be able to stick with for a long time and not get bored with it because of the great variety!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My butt and abs are thanking me!!","review":"I LOVE this video. The girls have rock solid bodies and their moves range from beginner to really hard. I drip sweat continually with some of the routines. Read some of the other reviews to get an in depth feel for the video/DVD. I recommend this for anyone wanting to really target their abs and butt/legs. It only has two segments for arms and they are mediocre, I thought. But I love being able to choose 10 minute segments. I always start by telling myself I'll just do one and inevitably I do two or three. I don't think I'll get bored with this one, since it has so many variables. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for home fitness.","review":"I have a lot of the videos in this series and this is by far my favorite. You can choose between the ten minute segments of various body parts and create your own workout. The instructors are friendley and knowledgeable-they are also cute and in great shape which is a motivator. The sessions go by fast and leve you wanting to do another one. There is no expensive equipment needed-just tennis shoes and handweights. I have had this for a long time and I still feel challenged-especially with Julie's ab excercises and Minna's leg excercises. This is a must have for your home fitness collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This video has three 10 minute segements.

She tries soooooo hard at being cute or sexy that she BUGS ME immensly. Nancy Popp is good, but the workouts don't do it for me, they are repetitive and cumbersome. i'd recommend anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never get bored with this DVD","review":"This DVD is great for someone like me who gets bored really easily, and I wish they made more in this format. They give you a bunch of workouts to choose from and you can select which ones you want to do and in which order. Each workout is only 10 minutes long and there is a clock counting down so you can see how much agony you have left, haha. The workouts aren't very agonizing though, they are simple enough and I have already seen results after 2 weeks. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS WORKOUT!!","review":"I really, honestly love this workout - I tell everyone I know about it. The ten-minute segments are nicely-paced, the instructors possess neither too much nor too little \\"pep,\\" and you can truly customize your workout to meet your exact needs - and then change it up as much as you want for variety! I've even continued to do the arm and leg workouts, with modifications, while pregnant - because I love it so much! (I have even, in some of my more hormonal moments, suggested to my husband that we name our baby \\"Minna\\" if it's a girl!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Workout","review":"I just got this DVD today and went straight to the \\"Blender\\" where you can combine three ten-minute segments for a customized 30-minute workout.

I like the variety -- there are 9 10-minute segments to choose from, so you can change your workout according to what area you want to focus on or how much time you have. I did 4 of the segments yesterday and I am definitely sore today. The arms & legs workout was the most challenging, my only problem with it was that it wasn't the kindest on my knees, but then again, most exercises aren't.It's the sort of exercise DVD that I can see myself using on a regular basis...and isn't that the most important thing?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Results","review":"I've had this DVD for 3 years now and still love it. I didn't do it for about 8 months and started to feel rather flabby around the butt and arms. So I pulled it out and started doing the exercises again. After only 1 week I noticed a difference. I do 1 x 10 minute arm, ab and buns session 4 mornings a week. This takes 30 minutes and the results are fantastic. I run regularly so get plenty of cardio excercise, I just wasn't as toned as I wanted to be in the butt and abs areas and of course running does nothing for the arms. This DVD combined with regular cardio work is the perfect combination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Toning Exercise","review":"I bought Minna's Strength and Grace and Fat Eliminator workouts last year and still do them almost every week. I was excited when I found another Minna workout. This is an excellent toning workout. It gives much more varied movements from your traditional squats, lunges, and crunches (which are also on here too) The moves are new and fun to do. There is a clock in the bottom of the screen that is so inspirational. You wouldn't believe how much more you can do when you know it is almost over! Also, the workouts are broken down into 10 minute sections so it can be fit into any schedule because you can do one or all nine at a time in any combination. If you are buying this just for Minna, don't. She only leads in one section of the DVD, but the other instructors are good too. This is strictly a toning exercise, so if that's what you're looking for, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a place to start off","review":"Many people need a place to start learning the VCL. I recommend they look elsewhere.The author did not intend to walk hand-in-hand with the VCL newbie, portraying the glories of the VCL as he advances in the book. For this type of book - i recommed the \\"in 21 days\\" series.The book focuses on giving you WORKING KNOWLEDGE in quite a few areas : Component creation, threads, templates, services and (much) more. The book does not dive deep into any of these subject, and the chapters hardly relate. When you have grasped how to use the VCL, you sometimes need a guide to the other, non basic, stuff CBuilder can offer. This is where this book shines. It gives you great insight on many intermediate - advanced subjects, and really gets you WORKING. It doesnt explain anything under the hood. You just say \\"hey, i need to write an NT service\\", open up chapter 5, and write one.

You folks at Akklaim need to consult the game writers at EA Sports and do a little research before you release a game that brings a bad name to the great sport of lacrosse.If you ask me, buy the game just so you can play lacrosse on your playstation in hopes that maybe the sales will bring a possible lacrosse game to PS2.Hopefully by another company and some people who have played or seen this sport before."},{"rating":"2","title":"First ever Lacrosse game!!!!","review":"Finally the best sport in the world has a video game!I'm not sure how this game will be the graphics will probably suck but its a lacrosse game so im sure it wil be a blast to play.This game should bring new fans to the sport and maybe EA Sports will make an outdoor lax game for PS2."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME","review":"If you play lax as much as I do, You are probably stoked for this game as I was.

There are NO penalties or even rules for that matter! In addition, the commentary from Farell is outright degrading. \\"C'mon! Kick him! Kick him in the head!\\", has no place in lacrosse. I'm glad that Acclaim developed a lacrosse game but they totally missed their mark. They should create a game that is closer to NHL 2001 in style and play.

In many ways, this book reflects his essence - a scholar with a very personal love of the ocean and its inhabitants. You will also detect a reverence for nature in his words, and enjoy his sense of fun and poetry.

You will find it on display in the epicenters of finality regarding man's dress, Bond Street, Savile Row, London.

He correctly admonishes department stores for their unprofessional staff. He pins his hopes on the bespoke suit.

Thora Birch (American Beauty, Ghost World, The Hole) plays the dual role of Susan- in the sunny, happy world of light, and Karen- in the darkworld of nightmare. I was perplexed by what connection there could possibly be between these two women. I was pleasantly stunned by the answers at the end!

Although I enjoyed playing video games growing up, I never knew much about computers or its history, even up until recently.So it was fun and informative for me to watch this DVD about computer history. At just 50 mins, the history is brief. The program has a quick feel about it, jumping from period to period. Of course, since this feature was produced in 2000/2001, all of the newest stuff looks pretty dated by today's standards.

The game is relatively easy. sometimes, it is nearly impossible to control Rayman with that puny D-Pad, but that is only because Rayman is strictly a Nintendo 64 type game. The game works best with a joystick. In order to Make the game easier, I recommend purchasing a few cheap, but snazzy face plates with joystick attachments. The gameplay will be 10x easier. The game is rather dark at some points, so I recommend buying a game light. the game is very addictive, almost to the point where the only way to turn it off is to lose all your lives, and it's so addictive that you'll want a shock and rock or any power pak to let you extend your gameplay.

The game hardly gets harder as you go up in level, and the levels are horrible, they are all easy, boring, and they don't have very hard enemies.

Extremely challenging in the later stages but with the help of Rayman's friends those challenges can be met by some unique power ups.

The game is gorgeous (if your computer is able to handle the graphics) and the sound is intense.At first, you may be disoriented (I began running around shooting like a madman as if I was playing a Quake game). But soon, you will realize how to play. You can't just run into a room with guns a-blazing.The game interface is simple (point and shoot) but the game play may be difficult or even frustrating; practice makes perfect though!I play this game with my house-mates and we love every minute. Buy it and host a LAN party; just don't kill each other if you lose. Some people who play this game online play too often (get a life you losers)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unlimited Replay","review":"Okay, this is my favorite game even though i got it more than a year ago, why?Well one reason is it's really fun, fast paced squad based action. It's hard and somtimes easy. And people are always creating new maps almost every day.There are also many modes to play (mods). My favorite mode is called zombie survival. basically one player is turned into a zombie and the other players (both teams) help out to kill the zombie. The zombie only has a knife, but it only has to hit an enemy once to kill/convert it into a zombie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great game which Steam needs to patch","review":"I have 2 computers: a 32 bit and a 64 bit vistas, both Home premium edition. CCS works okay on the 64 bit and also on the 32 bit. However, it crashes on the 32 bit atleast once every five minutes. It crashes once every 30 mins on the 64 bit. Although this game is fun since I played it elsewhere, Valve really needs to patch it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissappointment!","review":"The game itself is fantastic. Very enjoyable when you find a server without hackers. I ordered the game used expecting an awesome deal. It arrived on time, but without the product code! Why would anyone sell a PC game without a product key? I can't even use the game without Steam! All I wanted to do is play some Counter Strike, but I can't, thanks to the irresponsible ways of the seller. Thanks a lot! Now they have my money and I have something useless. Just fantastic. Don't be fooled by the cheap prices that people are selling this game used for. Copies without product keys are useless. Spend $20 on a new copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasted my money","review":"This game has to be played with Steam.

The game is completely multiplayer-only, and the graphics and weapons are more complex on the completely free multiplayer portion of F.E.A.R. Other problems include unimaginative level design by third parties, annoying voice-overs, and a strange astandard default keyboard layout. Personally, I feel like I've wasted the ~$20 I blew on this game, given that I already had a copy of that free game. Probably should have held on to my money and used it to pick up the Orange Box. This game doesn't hold up on its own to warrant blowing any real money on it. It's worth fiddling with if you can get it for free or bundled with a good game, but it certainly wasn't worth $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really Worth It","review":"Simply put, you can buy half life 2,which is cheaper, and get 3 of these games.

The game has always retained the fun factor. HOWEVER, as the community has grown, so has the nuisances. Microphone abusers. TKers. Hackers. You name it. If you can find a clean server where people just want to play the game rather than talk a storm and talk about how they won last night's clan match, then you'll discover an awesome game.Second of all, even though the game is fun, it gets highly repetitive, very quickly. 99% of the servers play either de_dust2, de_dust, or cs_office. Honestly, there are a bunch of great maps out there, but the server admins love to make those maps 24/7. How much office/dust can one possibly play??All in all, it's a fun multiplayer game, if you can avoid the idiots and nuisances.

The molding was relatively easy to perform. It took several weeks to receive the custom trays. Considering the price discount, I honestly cannot take a single star away for the turnaround time.All in all, take your time when making the moldings and follow the whitening schedule (with the proper gel amount) and you should see results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive for negligible results","review":"The kit has some nice touches, like three of everything in case you mess up. The trays to get started immediately are also nice. However, the results were not anything near what I had expected (or noticeable, for that matter).

My son, especially, likes to read with the growly voice of Grumblebunny. Both kids (ages 6 and 8) love that the grouchy bunny won in the end.I, personally, don't like the art as much as they do.

When I heard \\"Slow Down,\\" and saw the video, my first inclination was, \\"was this the Bobby who showed promise from MISTA?\\" It was! Just as nice as his voice is displayed now, so too is the group. It is too bad they don't come back with a single now, but this CD has great cuts. From \\"Lady,\\" to \\"I Think that I should Be.\\" Most of the songs are ballads, but they aren't too played out in 2005. I own 2 copies of the CD...not by choice, but still I won't give one of them away. I also like the song \\"Tears, Scars & Lies,\\" a very slow ballad. what I appreciate most about MISTA is their depth at such a young age. It makes them credible for the future. If you don't already have it, there's no need to cop it for full price...but if you have $5 and it's on sale on Amazon, I say please add it to your collects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awww they were so sweet :tear:","review":"I was really young when this group came out like 8 or 9, but I was definitely moved by Blackberry Molasses.

It is the late afternoon light or the early morning glow, that enters his leica.

It's surrounded by this light that Cartier-Bresson feels most at home, even in Mexico. Mexican notebooks is full of all Cartier-Bresson's hallmarks; real people in real situations. Circumstance and the click of his shutter fixes them in their descisive moment. This is a collection no photojournalist should be without."},{"rating":"2","title":"an honest and delicate look at mexico","review":"this is a very touching and intimate look at everyday life, but Cartier-Brenson's experienced eye has also captured the powerful light that alludes to heat, the mood of poverty, and the history that pervades this country.

The words take on a whole new emotional meaning when you hear them and sing them to your real baby. Lovely and soothing ambient music that you will enjoy and will help baby to sleep. I also found it is nice to use certain tunes as background for baby videos. Linda's singing is angelic and enchanting.This CD, along with Connie Kaldor's \\"Lullabies Bercuse\\" and Nicolette Larson's (can't remember name just now) are my 3 favorite lullaby CD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful but too short","review":"It's a really beautiful lullaby cd.

There are several great covers of some steady classics. I can listen anytime, but it is especially good when I want to chill out and meditate. Every song feels like someone wrapping their arms around me and making me feel good. I would have given five stars except for the inclusion of \\"We Will Rock You\\" which, to my ear, is startlingly noisy and harsh compared to the rest of the tracks. I've left it out on my playlist. Overall, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD Stands the Test of Time!","review":"This CD is excellent. My daughter received it as a baby gift in 1998. Nine years later, she still listens to it every night. She says it helps her calm down to go to sleep. She has listened to it every night for 9 years and for countless naps along the way. And the best part is, none of us are sick of it yet! Many \\"lullaby CDs\\" are so syrupy and sappy that the adults can't stand them and the kids soon tire of them. Not so with this CD!

If you are any kind of a Linda fan, you want to hear some strong belting, some blast it out of the water renditions of pop, rock, country and folk songs with a West Coast feel.This album is strictly for the parents of newborns who are having trouble getting them to sleep. While Ronstadt's singing here is indeed angelic and soothing, it also could easily induce a coma in the average adult. If you like your Linda bold and brassy, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voice lost in the mix, and not like Linda","review":"One problem with this CD is that Linda tries to sing it in a breathy, little-girl voice. That makes her sound like any other singer, not distinctive Linda Ronstadt. The other problem is that her voice is buried beneath the 'background singers' (sometimes Linda herself, multitracking), and the whole sound covered with reverb. So you get this sweet echoey sound that has no character. The Amazon.com sound samples are accurate as to what you will hear, and there is no low bass at all.The songs are mainly covers of early 60's pop before the Beatles. If you have software to raise the center vocal by about 8 dB, the album sounds somewhat better. But it will still put you to sleep.I rate this a two star miss by Linda."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is terrible!","review":"I'm a Linda Ronstadt fan so I thought I would like this CD for my 8 month old son. It was totally not what I expected. This is not children's music. Her rendition of Queen's \\"We will Rock You\\" is down right embarassing to listen to.

I teach music theory (which is similar to math) at the college level, and have been doing so for the last 18 years. This is the worst math book I have ever seen. Where are the brillant proofs of Euclid? This is a hodgepodge of history, so-called music, and diverse topics thrown into one book, that consists of mearly formulaes and prove it yourself theorems. The Pythagorean formula is circular, if you can follow it back far enough. There are no concepts or brillant ideas, only \\"you do it this way\\" as in the old calculus books. The authors are all school teachers, with one college teacher (wow).

In the event that Nate had felt accepted in his previous normal life, the freaks would have no place at all in Home Game. I don't know what to make of the crazy freak related events of Home Game.

For example, if I'm in a certain area, I'd want to visit all of everything that's within that area to avoid traveling back and forth.

Unless you're going to stick to the most basic tourist areas where everything is translated for the gaijin, don't even think about this book.

You go through different levels of a mall and play several mini-games featuring all of the Rugrat characters. Then you win certain items for winning those games and show them off in a fashion show featuring Angelica. Then you get scores from the judges and total them up to go to the next floor. It's great for all girls at all ages, because it's about what girls like best.....tha mall!!!! I personaly think this is a cool game.

First, they only really discuss insertion of the implant through the armpit although this is not the most common insertion. So that really didn't help at all with comparisions. Then, when they discuss the hardening due to scar tissue around the implant, they say that the first treatment is manual compression by the plastic surgeon to break up the scar tissue. Everything else I have read says that most plastic surgeons refuse to do this because of possible damage to the implant and that this can void the warranty.I don't know what they say about any other procedures because I stopped reading after this section and am going to return the book immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Study Guide! I loved the \\"Concept Maps\\".","review":"Any Organic Chem student using the Organic Chemistry: Sructure and Reactivity text will benefit from this supplemental text. The study guide contains solutions to problems in the main text as well as excellent concept maps and additional practice problems. Material is well organized and easy to work through. The study guide provides plenty of practice for building competency in OChem. Speaking from the perspective of a pre-med student, this book helped me focus on the areas of OChem that I needed to work on. Overall, I highly recommend it for all students already using the main Structure and Reactivity text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fentastic work","review":"It is nicely wriiten and subjects are well arrenged.

This video and Lisa Richards' Chillax (funny title, great vid) are great additions to the traveling yogi's video library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible music","review":"The music that accompanies this video could best be described as jazzy. I do not want to listen to jazz music when I practice yoga. Also, the whole video is just a bunch of standard sun salutation sequences with a few super difficult poses (that not even my yoga instructors can do) thrown in. The cover makes it look like you do dancer's pose in this video but you do not. I am in my twenties and my back hurt after doing repetitive camel poses.

There are three other songs. If you like Erasure in terms of \\"Oh L'Amour\\", \\"A Little Respect\\" or \\"Chains of Love\\", then you like this little EP. Erasure fans these days are mainly limited to guys who work at the Gap or 20-something girls who shop at the Gap. Vince Clark is a synth master but the songs are now somewhat tiresome.

Amazon courteously and quickly shipped a replacement but it also arrived with evidence of rough handling, including a sliced edge.

I have two major complaints though: (1) Try finding a supplement that covers D.C. and the territories, and (2) It is proudly made in China. Why??? Dansco albums are made in the U.S. and can be readily updated when the U.S. Mint changes direction half way through a series. I will never understand how the U.S. Mint endorses this product when a domestically made product is available and of archival quality. It's frustrating to say the least.

Archival quality! I have tried some others and this one is the best! What I like the most is that there is a hard thin plastic piece between the coin (front & back)and the page.

You can view each side of the coin and the coin is protected from finger prints, etc. Easy to place coin in the holes and they do not fall out. Buy it - you'll like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in cardboard quality","review":"The quarters are easy to fit. Perhaps those who have difficulty haven't taken out the sliding protective plastic. However, the cardboard cover and pages are much flimsier then expected.

I do like the ability to view both front and back of each quarter and their protective plastic sleeves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"Looking for a state quarter album for me was hard! It was really confusing. This album is great, it has spots for D & P versions of the coins.

But once you figure out there are two plastic covers, take one off, put the coin in and replace, it was easy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't work below 40 feet","review":"I recently took this camera with me on a trip to Jamaica. It worked alright at the surface and down to around 30-40 feet. However, after that the camera would simply turn off.

I've had other flavors of couscous before, but I really enjoyed this broccoli and cheese flavor. Couscous by itself doesn't have much flavor so the additional spices in this flavor package really made a difference. If you've never had couscous before it's basically a very small piece of pasta that's very bland on its own. If you cook it up using beef or chicken broth, it can really perk up the taste and it makes an excellent side dish to accompany your vegetables. Of course if you just buy seasoned couscous like this broccoli and cheese box, you won't have to do anything special...just add hot water and the enclosed spices and you're in business right away! It only takes about one minute to cook up couscous so this stuff is really awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Seat","review":"Le Pera just makes quality stuff, as long as you know what you are buying. If you want a seat for long cross country trips, this one isn't for you.

I got it for my 97 Fatboy so I could take off the big orthopedic tour seat.

I have written only one other half hearted review, but I really felt compelled to save other readers from my $9.99 error. This is not a romance, nor is it erotica, it is just trash. Not trashy, just trash. There is plenty of sex, but not really hot sex. I mean having someone tell you they want to F-you, they can't wait to F-you and then when they get to F-ing, because that's what they do in this book, all of the ramming and cramming just made me writhe in imagined pain. Hated it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"This author, being outside of the government-approved anthropological system, is able to get a behind-the-scenes look at the real, on-going cultures in parts of South America, which continue to practice human sacrifice. He also has done extensive research in human sacrifice; and this book led me to investigate others like it.This author details his own travels and digs at high altitude archaeology. It is a very rivoting book for more reasons than the often too-morbid topic of human sacrifice, because it also shows a side of culture and history in the Andean mountains that is rarely talked about or known.It's an excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much Help","review":"This book is clinical, short, emotionless, outdated, and it reads like a college research paper.

Well written and difficult to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes trying to revolutionize the car sales industry isn't so SMART!","review":"This is a revelatory history of the creation of a new automotive marque, and all the trials & tribulations that went into doing so. While complaints of it being \\"dated\\" are somewhat valid, it is after all attempting to chronicle in detail the history of a product and company that at the time of publication already had more than a decade of history behind it, yet was still a very young company with much room to grow ahead: it is to be expected that some changes have occurred since then! This book gives the owner or fan of SMART cars the necessary background to fully enjoy the marque for what it is: an honest attempt to change the world as we know it! It is important for the potential purchaser to note that this is *not* a book with technical info on model variations or instructions on performance modifications."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart Thinking... a business oriented book","review":"I thought this book was for pleasure reading but turns out to be a business book.

Even though we are in 6th grade they are the best books i ever read and i encourage you to read them too no matter how old you are.

This vehicle met the criteria for an armored reconnaissance vehicle suitable for roving over underdeveloped regions, with the prototype being ready by December 1941.

Personally, I find this to be a good book, but only if you are willing to GO BEYOND Gundam Wing. If you want to learn more about the UC era and the One Year War (not to be confused with Gundam Wing's AFTER COLONY era), go ahead and buy this book. But be warned! If you have no background in Gundam (in its ENTIRETY; not any of this ONLY GUNDAM WING experience), it may be confusing. Keep in mind that Gundam Wing is a totally DIFFERENT universe in comparison to the ORIGINAL KIDOU SENSHI GUNDAM storyline (it was one of 3 alternate universes commisioned by the creators of the original series). Therefore, while they may share some of the same aspects (i.e. the Gundams and the similarities between OZ and Zion), they do not share others, like beam \\"sporks\\" and other fun gimmicks.

In fact, I've seen every Gundam saga except the first one. At first, I concluded that this book and saga are extremely well-drawn with good concepts and an interesting script, but only after twenty minutes, I found it insanely pointless and time wasting. I advise all major Gundam fans, who are greatly fascinated by the world of Gundam, to reconsider before buying this book; but don't let it prevent you from exploring the other Gundam series like 8th MS Team or Gundam Wing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I bought this book, hopeful that it would give me some great suggestions. What I ended up getting was a book that recommended products that the author endorses but do not exist. Case in point, I thought the face-lift-in-a-jar sounded great, so I went to the website that the author owns www.biosynergenics.com, only to find out that the website does not even exist. The book is WAY over priced and there is NO information at all on the web about the author. I even tried to find a site where I could locate the author so that I could order a few of the products she suggested. NOTHING came up.

Of the 5 or so wolf films I have watched this is the best. Dog owners can understand abit more about their domestic pets."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the alpha of wolf documentaries!","review":"This is absolutely the best documentary on wolf behavior I have ever seen. The footage is amazing--I can't believe they were able to capture these beautiful creatures in such an open, natural state. This particular film maker defies tradition and exposes young wolf pups to human care in the wild--they grow up believing the camp is a part of their surroundings, and as a result they act very naturally. The human involvement makes for some touching scenes, such as the baby alpha howling on his lap or the full-grown alpha licking his face in the snow. The film is also well structured, covering the care of the pups to their release from camp, their mating choices, the birth of new cubs and competition for social position. It is truly a beautiful and very enlightening film."},{"rating":"2","title":"not the Big Bad Wolf at my door, for a change!","review":"This video is absolutely worthwhile to both trainers/behaviorists and to the layperson who's interested in wolves, their pack behavior and ranking, and how humans can interact with these beautiful wild animals.I'm a dog trainer and obedience instructor, and saw this when it first aired on television - I was studying training at that time.

This is a MUST see for anyone who loves wolves...especially those like me who have a wolfdog.

The modem weighs next to nothing, and it is very easily transportable. (MUCH more so than a laptop.)The only hitch I've found, is that it is best to make sure that you have completely closed Omnisky, Internet Explorer, and your Inbox before turning it off. Otherwise you may have difficulty connecting the next time you turn on your Jornada. However, if you just close all your apps, then turn the unit off.

The author claims to be an English Major. Due to the numerous typos, grammer, word usage, and other errors, Fordham University English Dept. must be VERY embarrassed.There is definately a Anita Blake knock-off feel, the characters act immature, and the dialogue is often awkward. The author writes a heroine of different looks than herself. But as I read, the descriptions of clothing and make-up would be awful choices for her heroine, but better suited to Ms. Bonnefoux.

This heats up as she's busily getting ready for midterms, doing extra research for a prof, dating a new guy (all-American cutiepie) , oh yeah, and murdered humans and vampires are showing up at an increasing rate.

Despite a few grammatical errors, I devoured (haha) this book within 2 hours. The plot was fast-paced and at times a bit gruesome (hey, it's my first time reading this type of book), yet it does have its share of romance and humor. Holly is a spunky, sarcastic, stubborn, but definitely likeable heroine. Being a student myself, I can totally empathize for her as she bemoans her Calculus class and the midterms...

Probably not many readers will consciously notice the terric writing, though it will be one of the things that will keep them reading.Another point, a lot of the significant people in the industry whom Chaplin and Ruby bring us warmly close to are notoriously hard to approach.

I not even a fan of covered songs, but this is great. With putting their own style into the song, each and every song is a great compliment to the original without ruining or changing it. Since this record, I've picked up several Black Keys records and they are all great. However, this is still the best albums they have.

I went through the other albums and though i have enjoyed them all Chulahoma is special. The newest album Attack & Release is supposed to be a new direction with Danger Mouse production influences throughout. That album is a new interesting direction, but good? More time will tell. It is for sure that the direction Chulahoma took was spot on. A groovey bluesy achingly immaculate tribute to an underground legend in Junior Kimbrough.

If you're going to pay such a small price, compared to a pound of tea elsewhere, then you can assume that the saying you get what you pay for is going probably be true. In my opinion, it is in this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tea, great price!","review":"After much experimenting, I'm a totally devoted fan of Rishi Teas but I make one exception and Numi's Jasmine Pearls is it. Jasmine pearl tea is my favorite tea, hands down, but as any jasmine pearl lover knows, it ain't cheap! This tea is a great value AND tastes good. I defy anyone to find a better deal on GOOD jasmine pearl tea!9-30-09I'm dropping my rating to 3-4 stars. I've been drinking Rishi Tea's version of jasmine pearls recently. I just opened a new bag of Numi's jasmine pearls when the Rishi ran out. The difference in fragrance is dramatic! I can barely discern any jasmine aroma if any when I opened the Numi bag. The Numi tea tastes good, even sweet (did they sneak in a hint of sweetener??) but this is jasmine tea after all. I think I'll bite the bullet and pay the extra $$ in the future for Rishi's jasmine pearl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Price is right!","review":"For the price you really can't beat this.

It may have been good or very good (for the money) at one time. I'm just not sure what decade that was.

Great price per ounce (about half the price that I could find anywhere else). Can be rebrewed up to three times per directions (so it lasts a while). The only downside is you have to buy 1 pound of tea, that's a whole lot. If you can afford it, or split it with someone then this is a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"Not the best tea that I have had, but much better than any other one that I have been able to find in the US. This tea has a lot of Jasmine scent that continues to give through multiple steeps. When the pearls unfurl you can see that the leaves are very fresh. Also the tea is powerful enough that you do not need very many beads per cup.One issue I have is that when steeping there will be little particles that come off. It is not a terribly large amount, however it is more than the better teas. The other issue I have is that when opening and closing this bag to get the tea, you're letting in and out a lot of air, reducing the potency. You should put a certain amount for your daily use into an airtight container to reduce the # of times you open the bag.All in all, this is a very good value and I do recommend it to anyone, and everyone, that enjoys tea. Since it is in bulk, spread the joy by sharing with friends and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Portable A. Lincoln","review":"A fine collection of Lincoln's writings.

John Hannah swearing so much it's like he's paid a thousand dollars per profanity. I can enjoy the occasional bit of porn but I don't like seeing it in tv dramas, it cheapens the whole thing.

You also see how crixus came in existence with the ludus of batiatus and earned his respect from his fellow brothers as he worked his way up the rungs of competitors. The same level of disgusting betrayal and unforgivable deceit follow all of those who look to further their fortune with the gods. One more monumental sight is seeing the great warrior and man, Oenomaus become the new \\"doctore\\" of the house of batiatus.

The first season was excellent, had a story, a plot, great acting,and was based on historical events and characters (yes, there was a Crixus, and yes he did lead with Spartacus until they parted ways). Gods of the Arena felt like the fill-in series it was, almost pointless, and ended the way we already knew it would. It also gave John Hannah an opportunity to shed his likeable character from \\"The Mummy\\" series, and unfortunately it worked. The extensive and continued dropping of the F-Bomb was distracting from what little story we could follow, and was hardly shocking after the first 30 minutes. Just annoying. And yes, their continued use of \\"Apologies\\" was tedius.I look forward to the next season, unfortunatly without Andy Whitfield.

There aren't many films that I'll stop watching purely because of content, but after almost five solid minutes of stylized violence and gore straight from a horror movie, I had more than enough. Yes, the gladiator sport was a bloody one, but it's not something I want to see glorified. It was violence just for the shock value. Still, I tried fast-forwarding through the bloody scenes to get to the talking/plot. But there doesn't seem to be much.

Spureon stood out as a preacher and pastor far above most who ever pastored. Dr.Dummand has given a vivid description of the many faceted sides of the great preacher. When I finished the book I felt like it should be studied rather than just read. You will love the many tidbits of fascinating information about the man and his ministry. Mr. Spurgeon was involved in controversary quite often. The author tells how and why. Spurgeon took a strong stand on the fundamentals of the faith when many others were not as open. There are many paralells to prominent pastors of today. It will especially encourage and strengethen younger pastors. As I read the book two thing struck me. How I wish I had read this 50 years ago.

You will read the good and the bad of Spurgeon for he was just a sinner redeemed by God's grace and you will also find a man passionate for the truth of God's inerrant Word.In short, you will be challenged to pray that God would raise up more Spurgeons not only for the United States but for Great Britain and all the world.

Get this book.","review":"An excellent presentation of the stages of mindfulness meditation as well as the spectrum of development and the spectrum of psychopathology. Authors Ken Wilber, Jack Engler and Daniel P. Brown know what they are talking about.Because levels of meditative development are still not widely known, because so few have ventured deeply into meditation, a book like this isn't understood by many. Someone who hasn't meditated can't believe this is possible, so they dismiss it.If you are a serious long term meditator this book is great. If you've never meditated, or done much contemplative work, this book may not make much sense.A very worthwhile book for any interested in meditative or contemplative development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goth/Metal, wonderfully rendered from a German band","review":"This album is hauntingly beautiful! The guitars provide plenty of grinding crunch, reminicient of \\"Black\\" album Metallica. The vocals, which are a combination of sing/speak, reminded me of En Esch (KMFDM) on some of their softer tracks. However, when the vocals take off, imagine a Bon Scott (AC/DC)/Dave Mustaine (Megadeth) screaming-shrieking hybrid! The majority of the songs are sung/spoke in English, shadowed with a German accent. Two of the songs are rendered in German and one of the songs is a poem spoken in French. Their sound is full and lush with the addition of orchestral backgrounds and classical piano additions. This is a truly wonderful album and it deserves a listen by anyone into Metal or Goth/Metal music. The last track, Valse Bizarre was a real surprise. The music seems to place you on a Carosel and spins you faster and faster. Then, you have about 3 minutes of dead air until it finally resumes again, in a much more restrained tone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Small","review":"Smaller than I expected.

Fine, hate them, say it once, get it over with and then shut-up about it. But no, they go on and on and on about motorcycles, mountain bikes, and everything that does not meet their definition of appropriate recreation.

Spring and Manning endlessly lament the fact that most of these hikes are overcrowded, overused, overloved, trampled beyond all recognition, and yet they publish a \\"new\\" guidebook so that these very places may be abused to a greater extent.

Unfortunately, these experienced hikers share mostly negative outlooks on many of the hikes. The tone is very egotistical, as they slam the Forest Service and other hikers. It would be exhausting to hike with these guys, as they mostly point out the negative aspects and wrongdoings of everybody who isn't in their circle. The book does not spark any excitement to hike these trails...which may be point.And the writing...also exhausting.

I am beyond angry. I emailed, and they did not reply. I would have sent it back if the postage would have been paid by the merchant, as it should have been! Very BAD business. The least they could have done was replied to my email with a reason I got the WRONG fire extinguisher.

The author didn't realize if you're trailing by one run going to the bottom of the ninth inning, you don't win the game when the leadoff man walks, is sacrificed to second for out number one. Gets to third after a deep fly for out number two. The runner scores on a suicide sqeeze bunt, while the batter safely reaches first base. This only ties the game, but the author says Coyotes win.Maybe Minor Leauge baseball has different rules. Who knows?Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as pictured, but ...","review":"I ordered this but received CD-2 Company Part No. 4111R. The bottle is the same, but the labeling is different; for example, it does not say \\"CD-2 Maxx\\", but only \\"Oil Detergent\\". I'm not sure whether the product illustrated is a later or earlier version. I added the product to a car already using full synthetic Mobil 1 Ext. Perf., and was able to tell the engine performance improved right away; it ran \\"tighter\\" and the connection between the gas pedal movement and the delivered engine power was more solid than before. Whether it cleans up sludge or engine internals is too early to tell.OK, I've now used this product for over a year in various cars. In each case, engine response was noticeably improved, even when added to engines with freshly changed oil (even expensive synthetics). MPGs improved around 10 to 20%.

All I see is a bright white light, even in daylight. I'm waiting to hear from Celestron to see if it will have to go back to the shop and be replaced, which will cost a fortune.

I bought the \\"Performance Plus 660\\" a few months ago and was amazed by the finish and ease of use of the case, and the quality of the \\"True Power 330\\" power supply that came with it.I was, however, deceived with the present iteration. Antec reused the hugely successful case and outfitted it with a less than stellar SL300 power supply. While that combination sounds good on paper, I noticed at once some manufacturing defects on the case, most notable as a bad fit of each side panel with the frame. Moreover, the SL300 power supply casing feels cheap and ply esily to pressure, a sure sign that less-than-stellar material and workmanship were used.I am left to wonder whether I stumble across a bad lot, or whether Antec decided to boost his bottom line by cutting corners.

I have owned this cookware for only a month, so I can't speak to possible problems with continued use. So far it's been fine and I see no reason to think the nonstick coating will not last. I was afraid the plastic Circulon handles would be weak, but I now count them a plus. The stylish lids fit securely and two of them will work overtime on your pans. This cookware is fairly thick and anyone who knows to stay away from the highest range setting will have no problems with warping.

When looking for the Meyers web site to email them, I came across some complaints of the exact same nature by people who sent their cookware back to Meyers in hopes that they would make good on the lifetime warrenty and Meyers sent a form letter (!!) saying they obviously misused them and that the warrenty is void.

The 80's were the good old days and we'll never see them again unfortunately, but this cd will give you a sense of some of the good things that happened.This is a great cd but I can't give it five stars because I don't see why \\"Hip To Be Square\\" wasn't included on here.

With great songs like \\"Stuck with You\\" and \\"Power of Love\\", you can't help but wonder why they didn't include other hits like \\"Back in Time\\" or \\"Hip To Be Square\\".

If I'm not mistaken, \\"Trouble in Paradise\\" was one of those earlier hits (it's live here). This is a true collection of good material. It's too bad they didn't re-release some of their earlier stuff because it was great. This CD is sure to please you if you are even a little bit interested in the band.

So what if they lack depth and substance, this band was never about those things. They were about making accessible album oriented pop/rock radio with celebratory/party anthems that men and women could relate to. It's the kind of music you play at the bar and belt out with your friends. Just positive, good times music, which is severely lacking in music today. This band was huge in the 80's, and they sound just as good today. Pick up this album today, along with \\"Sports\\" and \\"Fore!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The News Never Dies","review":"Huey Lewis & The News was one of the most surprising acts of the 1980's.

I felt that it was cut and pasted from every post game newspaper interview that I read last season. I thought that it was put together very quickly and without much thought. Maybe I expected more? Morrissey basically reguritates quotes that were written in the NY newspapers last season. There was little in this book that captivated me to want to read more. He has a chapter about Melky Cabrera and writes about Matsui almost the entire chapter, even though Matsui has his own chapter earlier in the book. I was hoping that he would take us into the inner workings of the New York Yankees and he really does not. If you are a die-hard Yankee fan, you will get nothing from this book that you don't already know. It feels like you are reading old newspaper quotes from the 2006 season.

Although a lot of space is devoted by the author to anticipating & shooting down arguments those who don't agree with her might offer, she does get her points across rather well. She has a lot to say about the fact that lawyers & judges seem to love talking about rights while they have little to say about obligations. Some of the facts she reports are shocking to read & make it very easy to understand why so many people have so little respect for the legal profession. I must confess I had great difficulty in trying to paraphrase Ms Glendon's assertion, maybe because, as Ms Glendon explains, our court decisions entered a different world, so to speak, in the 1960s period.

Here's why:1. The objective is 80 mm, just over 3.1 inches, so it is jsut adequate to bring in the light necessary for a beginning look at the universe. It is adequate for the moon, and beginning views of the larger planets. The planets will appear as small disks. One will be able to see Saturn's rings, and Jupiter's moons, but the images will be very small. Some deep sky objects will be visible, but faints and fuzzy.2. The mount will vibrate when touched, which will cause the image in the eyepiece to \\"shiver\\", which is very frustrating to the observer.If additional funds are available, I'd opt for a larger scope with a better mount.

Why is our culture so obsessed with leaving children alone at night, crying and throwing up with fear, until they learn that no one is going to come and help them?

Since then however he has slept in his crib and wakes up once per night to breastfeed and often sleeps through the entire night - without harsh \\"sleep training\\" methods.

During that time we sold and bought a new house, my husband start his traveling again, both of our brothers were married, etc. But enough was enough so after reading five books on children's sleep this week Ferber once again struck a chord and made sense, especially where it concerned preschoolers.

It was worth every penny! (The shipping cost way more than the book). Even if you have serious doubts about \\"cry it out\\" - and we did - Ferber's summary of the sleep research is incredibly helpful so you understand why the baby isn't sleeping (and why you're having trouble yourself, even when the baby does sleep).We decided to go ahead and use his techniques and they did work, although it took a few nights. Weaning off of night feedings turned out to be easier and quicker than getting him to self-soothe, but eventually it all fell into place.

I wanted to see about our oldest's sleep problem, when our 5 month old started waking up about every 1-2 hours. We weren't sleeping at all. So, we used the Ferber method to get him on schedule. And it worked exactly as he described it. In 2 nights he was back on a schedule and sleeping through the night. It has also helped me understand and help our teenager daughter's problem to fall asleep and stay asleep all night. Then out of no where one of my other sons started sleepwalking. I was terrified until I read about the cause and what I could do to help him. To say I have gotten my moneys worth out of this book, is an understatment. This is a must have book for parents.

I was on the brink of sanity and needed some concrete help about how to change her sleep habits. This book is well-written, organized and researched, and Dr Ferber is much more mild than I expected given his reputation. His plan of \\"controlled crying\\" can be adapted according to parents' and children's needs and temperaments.

There's a whole storyline of a toddler getting inadvertently high on several drugs, which I thought was humorless, not a prude, just dont think a child getting drugs is funny. This movie would have gotten 3 stars from me as overall enjoyable but a little heavy on the friendship monologues. The 4th Star however goes to Neil Patrick Harris! He was only in the movie for 10 minutes but I laughed the hardest when he was on screen. His on-screen persona of a guy who's a slimeball pretending to be gay is still hilarious.

With that in mind, John Cho and Kal Penn have taken up the mantle of the aforementioned duo and given audiences three movies of varying success, the latest of which I just saw. A Very Harold & Kumar Christmas finds our titular tokers as somewhat estranged friends, Harold having stopped smoking marijuana since getting married and Kumar having let himself go after his girlfriend dumped him. Harold, however, has promised a perfect Christmas to Mr. Perez, his father-in-law, and when Kumar accidentally burns down Mr. Perez's tree, he and Harold are again caught up in wild hijinks.

It takes place in the future opposed to 15 minutes into the future. A poorly written film that lacked jokes and laughter.

This one has awesome 3D effects and very cool jokes and plot, but there is a fine line where religion jokes become offensive, and I think they crossed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harold & Kumar grow up","review":"This 3rd installment of Harold & Kumar adventures seems to have abandoned its original roots. The first two films were pure, carefree stoner comedies, while the 3rd was more like a coming-of-age tale in which the heroes often question their goofy, juvenile behavior and reflect on the possibility of becoming responsible family men. If the H & K franchise is going to bring such mawkish and shopworn concepts into the series, then this better be the final chapter. Amusingly irreverent movies such as Harold & Kumar's are better off leaving out the preachy life lesson of social conformity. As for the primary storyline, H and K accidentally destroy a one-of-a-kind christmas tree belonging to Harold's father inlaw. The duo sets out to find a replica before Harold's wife and inlaws get home. The search for the perfect Christmas tree in order to save Christmas...Almost sounds like the plot to a Charlie Brown holiday special, but with weed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumped the Shark","review":"Okay the first Harold and Kumar was great! The second one was okay, but this one was just lame. Every 20 minutes or so I'd chuckle at something stupid that Kumar said and that was about it.The performances that both actors gave was pretty bland, almost like they didn't even care about the movie they were making. The only good parts of this movie were Danny Trejo and Neil Patrick Harris. They actually TRIED to give good performances and they seemed to actually give a rip about this movie. Every other actor just phoned in their performances.Plus did I really need to see Kumar's penis in clamation? And on top of that did I really need to see Harold's penis stuck to a metal pole?I really hope this is the last one of these movies that Hollywood makes. Seriously, what are they gonna call the next one, \\"Harold and Kumar: Still Milking It?\\"If you're bored and you want something out of the Redbox, it's worth a dollar to rent it, but not worth 25 bucks to own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"its a must buy for a comedy...","review":"great film,, good humor without good overboard... saw it oprignally in 3D at the theatre so I knew what to expect but still was a good movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to the series!","review":"It was great to see Harold and Kumar together again.

Some of the chapters are from earlier papers they put together and published on the net, but there's a lot of new materials. A particularly interesting discussion from the authors (Brown is at Xerox Parc, Duguid is a historian at Berkeley) is of Xerox's support system for copier techs called \\"Eureka\\". This is kind of like a \\"frequently asked questions\\" or \\"innovative solutions to problems\\" database, with a couple key human touches that (they claim) cause people who are otherwise busy doing real work to contribute to and update it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use makes the tool...","review":"This book is great on reflections about the use of information technology and knowledge building.

It is chock full of unexamined philosophical pretensions that anyone even remotely schooled in philosophy let alone educational theory would shudder before. This is a book of jargon for people that want philosophy without tears. Fundamental distinctions between cognition, learning, information, knowledge etc. are just thrown out onto the page like onions chipped into a frying pan. Unabashed by history, the book blithely sails past whole continents of philosophical work. The work seems torn between recommending more online interaction (information retrieval) and less of it with a few chants about the importance social contact slipped in as a chorus. Overall it fails by trying to be all things to all people while never offering an proper critique of technology and its social impact. Can't afford to offend the multinationals here. Possibly goood journalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blather by Academic Gearheads","review":"It's hard to fathom how such highly educated individuals, with access to tools, lots of time, and presumably intelligent colleagues, could come up with such a shallow analysis. They are pretty highbrow about it all too. Their storytelling is rehash. You could do better reading any technology business magazine and using your own interpretations of how technology changes will change our behavior. Your guess is probably better than what little you would find here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but no cigar","review":"In reality exists a muddled world, ignoring (at their own risks) the dynamics of how people create ideas, disseminate those ideas, and recreate their own social and business fabrics. In reality, the short sound bite is king, and mapping and leveraging this dynamic is too 'deep' for most. Too bad for the species.Sharing pithy stories of human foibles of this ilk, along with a couple of successes and so-called technical how-to's, is always a nice read for a story in Wired. But very little of this tomb will help leverage the sentiency of the populace.Perhaps the long priestly robes at PARC are hiding something far more dubious than just career paths. I have heard both of these gentlemen speak, and speak well (with pointed antidotes and metaphors) they do. But someone should have given them a reality read, and stopped them from drinking their own kool-aid.I was expecting a whole lot more from both, and was sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still timely in 2009","review":"This is, broadly speaking, the story of Silicon Valley in the late '90s: The utopian promises it failed to keep, and the smaller ones it did. The book maps out the absurd (in hindsight) optimism of the period, fleshing it out with enlightening anecdotes and explaining what went wrong.This was required for a graduate-level course I took just this year, and despite its age, the book is still fresh, lively and insightful. I'd recommend this to anyone, especially to those trying to manage, launch or just survive in a 21st-century tech company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aimlessly meandering attempt at tech prose","review":"I was excited to read this book by a colleague I know and had great respect for. Unfortunately, I'm now looking through my library of hundreds of business books to find one I enjoyed less. Can't find one. The Social Life of Information, from what I gather, attempts to put a human face on the concept and use of information. For what purpose, I'm still not sure. I found the book to be an overly-prosaic and aimlessly meandering series of anecdotes, trite quotes, random observations, goofy metaphors (e.g. Popeye chasing a baby???) and other people's research loosely related to information, but not woven together in the least. It was neither entertaining nor informative. As far as business books go, it is completely devoid of anything predictive or prescriptive--leaving the reader terribly wanting for something tangible to chew on or an action to take. Bummer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Enough","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I like the authors. I like their prior work. I think it's just that I'm just the wrong reader. Well, not exactly that either. The book seems to have two parts. Chapters 1-3 are very gentle, lay introductions to some of the rhetoric of the information / commuication age. These chapters also offer an interesting view of the history of the naiscent information age. Chapters 4 - 8 are much more compelling, discussing knowledge and education and organizations, with liberal use of real world organizations and experiences as illustrations. From chapter 6 on, it's fairly brilliant, offering a new ways of thinking about KM and intellectual property (sticky and leaky knowledge), and education as an enterprise. (The sections on the future and role of higher ed. are must reading, and I'm not going to give it away here.) It does remain very readable, however, and that should count for a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vital piece of the electronic marketing puzzle","review":"If you are trying to assemble a comprehensive view of electronic marketing, this book contains critical pieces. Other than Moore's Law, few recent predictions have actually foretold events in this field. Alongside books about the possibilities of e-marketing--exploiting our ability to collect, sort and distribute information--this book highlights the limits of pure information, and points to contrary social forces. Especially for people with a layman's background in technology, I think this book is a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"totally functional","review":"This is just what is says it is, a plain pastry tube.

The content of DFP's work is very nice and mellow - even though a couple of tracks (like \\"Okinawa Love\\") leave me perplexed. I'd give it 4 stars.Now, the technical... Contrary to what's advertised on this website, it is not an \\"Audio CD\\" - as in \\"internationally adopted CD standard originally by Philips\\" JVC released a crippled non-standard version in the guise of \\"copy protection\\"! The package says it does not play on Macs, and not on DVD players of certain (?) regions (I can't read Japanese).

Shame on JVC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A biased review","review":"I'm admittedly biased, as my web site is mentioned in this book, and I'm mentioned by name a few times in the chapter on \\"Slash and Other Stories,\\" but this is a really good book. It's a respectful, honest, and entertaining look at Star Wars fandom today. It covers everything from group viewings, to arguments over what constitutes canon, to fanfic, to fan films, and more. I had to skip the \\"Speculation\\" chapter because after only two paragraphs, I'd gotten some pretty huge honking spoilers on Ep 2, but I'll go back and read it on May 17th. The author himself is a fan, so that most likely contributes to the respectful, fun tone of this book. It's not complete by any means, and there are some major omissions that caused me to only give this a four star rating instead of a five, but still, Star Wars fans looking to read a good analysis of our culture should definitely check this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Pointless","review":"I won't critize the author for writing this book, as his heart is clearly in it and he definitely knows a lot about what he's writing. But I don't think many Star Wars fans will find this book terribly interesting. It's like reading a book written about visiting a webpage... kinda pointless.Anyone who's in the target demo for this book (hardcore SW fans and the fan fiction community) will probably already know everything in this book. And anyone else (casual SW fans, non-Sw fans) should go nowhere near this.If you like reading copy and paste jobs of e-mails and posts sent to the author by SW fans, than you'll like the book. But then again, you can save your money and just do that for free on the Internet, can't you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy item.","review":"I hated making hibiscus or hawthorne tea from loose tea, and often avoided making it.

However, she contradicts this statement by mentioning the mizuage and mirare, all of which mentioning geisha selling their bodies. She also makes many assumptions of the Japanese culture and character, but it seems that she bases all of these off of few accounts rather than vast research. There is also very little emphasis placed on what kinds of geisha she is talking about, because the geisha of Gion Kobu, would never associate themselves with such scandalous and degrading practices.Although it gives facts on history and such, it is greatly cumbersome in identifying the practices of geisha of different locations and classes. Approached most certainly with a Western interpretation, it just seems like a novel with a double entente that contradicts itself. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms Downer should have named the book after herself","review":"Because it was. After she gained the trust of the women, she was unkind to them.

But when I got near the end and saw a picture of little Maddie on her knees praying to God for forgiveness...well, that's just a few steps too far for me.

The author's witty take and unexpected commentary on the sometimes mundane, sometimes absurd, and sometimes unbelievable will have you wanting more. He wonderfully describes the daily curiosities we all share with best friends, old roommates and even exes-life's idiosyncrasies we take for granted such as the condiment area at Roy Rogers, the plastic dividers in any Grocery Store that separate your sundries, or Jared of the Subway Diet fame.Mr. Camlek's entertaining and, at times, hilarious observations make for an enjoyable read and fun book for all family members. A great gift for anyone who likes to read about the oddities of human behavior and pop culture.Philip B.NYC"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE END OF THE LINE","review":"New Vocalist Hart proved that he could fill the Bad company vocal shoes with his debut cd, \\"Company of Strangers\\", which was one of their best cds ever, now Hart and Company is back with another great cd.

Its not that Robert Hart's original songs on this album are bad, although some tend to cross over into Michael Bolton territory, but it is the horrendous cover songs on this album. Hart makes a mockery of \\"Shooting Star\\". \\"Don't you know know\\"? it sounds pretty lame.

Tragedy strikes when their red kayak turns over in the bay and causes a tragic accident. Brady, who is on the rescue team and friendly with the family, investigates the cause of the accident, and he doesn't like what he finds.This book is full of suspense and will keep you hooked from page 1 through the end of the story.

Unfortunately for him, this book was the required summer reading for his 7th grade class. He unhappily slogged through it, but didn't enjoy it. After reading a few chapters myself, I have to agree. Although a well-written book, the underlying message is too similar to On My Honor, Sounder, Old Yeller, etc. (all of which my kids have had to read at some point). A kid causes the death of another kid, or a beloved dog dies, and the protagonist (usually a boy) has to learn to come to terms with death and/or the consequences of his actions. Give kids a break! Only make them read ONE book of this type; the message gets across the first time!

When it became clear he wasn't going to have it, he decided that his own stuff was so good that if he released it solo, people would take notice. Well, his solo material IS splendid. Jason's brand of 60's influenced pop is the remedy for the mediocre three chord rock permeating today's Top 40 airwaves. The bad news is, few people have heard this album. And that's an awful shame because 'Author Unknown' is immaculate. If you live for melody and smart songwriting, you'll make it a priority to own this immediately. Plus, you'll never let anyone else borrow this record - probably because you won't ever see it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, love it.","review":"At work, we have a CD player that 7 of us - of varying ages and intersts - listen to all day.

As for the rest of us lucky enough to discover the lost art of melodic pop, we have people like Jason Falkner to provide us with amazing songs like these (be sure and check out his 2nd solo cd as well!)you'll be humming in your head long after the cd's over. 5 stars does'nt seem nearly enough for lost-in-the-shuffle gems like this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotonous and unlistenable - I threw it away","review":"Up till now, I have not been disappointed buying CDs based on the reviews from Amazonians.

It's not the genre - I like the Bellybutton CD, and think that Cotton Mather's latest is incredible -- I just couldn't bear this particular CD.

They are not like normal hose fabrics...they are molded to ONE leg and don't stretch and reconform to fit your leg. They are meant for someone very tall and skinny. Also, the heal/foot is built in and is for someone with a huge foot. If your foot isn't huge, there will be a big bump sticking out behind your ankle where the heal should be.

We also bought it to be used as a bonding experience.This game made bonding worse. It relies more on the speed of your clicking icons/answers than it does using your brain. I dominated her because of my experience with the wiimote versus her first experience with a console system.

I would say kids can compete with adults at about age 10. My kids are 9 and 11. My 11-year-old whips my tail and gets gold and platinum medals. My 9-year-old mainly gets silver medals. It's a little harder for him, and he is somewhat reluctant to play because his older sister is doing better than him. These are my family dynamics.The game has easy, medium, and hard levels.

My 9 year old won't play it anymore after playing it twice. I find that my ability to play varies widely from day to day and I don't think it is my brain function.

We've only played it a few times. I can see how the games could be fun and beneficial. Overall, we really dislike the game. It's annoying because there's a lot of time wasted waiting for the game character to make some haughty or rude comment. I've yet to see any worth reading. If a teacher treated kids this way- they'd be fired. My daughter cringes when the character comes on the screen. Even in the practice mode, the screen character could make a crack about how she must be half asleep. After a game, it can make comments about how the other team members must be disappointed in her. There are gentler ways to criticize. How about just \\"That wasn't very good, but just keep trying- you'll do better next time.\\"? I wish there was a way to turn off the comments- then we'd all enjoy the games much more.

I am happy that she enjoys the games, some of which test memory, analysis skills, and visual recognition.As for myself, an adult, the game is amusing in small doses. There come points in which I am unsure as to how to improve my overall score - for some games it easier than others. I had the DS Big Brain Academy as well, and I prefer the Wii version. My daughter also enjoyed the DS version, too.If you have a young child and would like them to play a game on the Wii, I recommend this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Variety","review":"This game is fun, but it lacks enough multiplayer activities, there's only one mode that allows the use of two remotes. There are only 15 minigames to play and none are really that great. For a DS game this might be acceptable, but on the Wii, for $50 I would expect much more variety in the minigames. There isn't really much to do in this game, but it's cool how it ranks your brain in 5 different categories. Overall, I would not suggest it because there is not enough to keep you occupied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fun","review":"This game was not very fun, it was kinda boring and too much reading.

Great for all ages so the whole family can play. My daughter and I enjoyed it so much we couldn't stop playing. The graphics and visuals are generic enough so this game won't become outdated in a year or two. We highly recommend it to families looking for good, clean, mentally stimulating entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun, decent brain challenges.","review":"The game is good for all ages, even for my daughter who is 5yrs old. The different mini games provide enough levels of challenges to keep even a moderately intelligent person thinking. It is a good buy to give you, and/or your family hours of fun. I only have a few quibbles about the game, which is why i gave it a 4 out of 5. None of the issues i had with the game would have stopped me from buying it in the first place though."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FUN !!","review":"We have had so much fun with this game. We are both over 50, and have no children. When we have company we play this with them and have a great time.

Also, some of them have appeared in other games like Wii play. It looks like the game producer just tried to cram as many activies as possible into this DVD. Then they used it as a selling point. That tactic fails beause most of the games are not entertaining at all.I'm glad I borrowed it from my friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"With the hype surrounding this release, I had expected a higher-quality product. Although the Wii is not known for its graphics, Big Brain Academy falls so far below the graphics standard that (excluding the motion controls) this could have been an early 90s release. The areas within the game do become progressively harder...challenging even for adults. However, thinking of the potential this game could have had and that it is not a first generation release, I wouldn't recommend purchasing this product. You will have much more fun with Wii Play or Mario Party 8 if these types of games are up your alley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This is absolutely awful. Game is quite boring and lacks the ability to save your profile. This means every time you have to power up you have to register a profile.

WII Word coach is the only good one that they sell as far as I can tell so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed with Big Brain!!!","review":"The thought behind the game was with good intention I am sure. The fact that the children are being graded and reminded that their brains haven't grown since their last \\"test\\" I believe to be terrible. I am really glad we rented the game instead of buying it. I have three very competitive children and for them to be graded and compare themseleves against each other (reminder:it is only a game!) does not quite create positive self esteem and harmony in our home. Fun educational games presented in a very poor manner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Horror--Little Occult","review":"Mix in a little supernatural, a lot of guns (big guns!) and a lot of violence.

It also cannot draw fuel into the line."},{"rating":"1","title":"If your class requires this book, run!!","review":"I took a class called \\"Feminist Film Theory\\" and this was required reading. I love movies and discussing philosophy and feminism and social movements and all, but if I had known how awful a read this would be I would have dropped the class and saved myself the hassle.I can't complain about the price; it was about half what the campus bookstore was charging and it was in excellent condition. The book itself made me want to tear my hair out. It's a collection of essays by different authors and reading it was like wading through mental quicksand.After one reading assignment my professor (who chose the book!) told us he wouldn't blame us if everyone had come in with a baggie full of ashes that used to be their textbook. So, yeah, I would only recommend this for someone who enjoys convoluted cinematic name dropping. Not a leisure read, and that's coming from someone who read the unabridged Le Miserable for fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shop for price !","review":"Good apparent quality, prompt vendor service, not unreasonable (reseller) price...but, after ordering, I did find better price from (claimed) manufacturer.

It was like being back in mid-19th century America. It seemed to make the era come alive with real personalities and real historical character. To understand the complexities of this genious and his time, this book is a must. It seemed to be refreshingly candid and forth-right without the usual bias one expects on the subject.

When I was teaching (see \\"My Calvin Seminary Story\\") a course related to American culture I searched far and wide for something very readable that gives the background of life as we know it today. These chapters explore every facet of American culture from religion and race to sexuality and slavery and social status. The arts, politics, and the idea of democracy are also featured. This book is not just for historians. It's for anyone interested in American culture and it would make a great supplemental text in courses on American history and culture--or for a course like the one I taught, The Gospel and American Culture.

Since he could not stop sinning he jumped at the chance to leave town, FAST, and travel to Lizard Flats.

I have played with light 16 gram darts and the heavier 20 gram darts and have not had one dart bounce out so far. Plus, the colors on the board are very bright which is a plus and the led lights used for cricket are easy to see from a distance. The only complaint I have about this dartboard is the bulls eye that rotates when a heavier dart hits it. Not sure I understand why they added this to the board but they should remove that in their future boards. It kind of changes the game when you hit the bulls eye and it moves but otherwise, this is an awesome board."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lotta fun!","review":"This has been by far the best electronic board I have ever played on.

If you looked at my board you would think it had never been used. It was a great dart board, or so I thought. However, the unit stop working, the game selector button stopped working so you cannot start a new game. Since it's off warranty I disassembled the unit and discovered that all the power wires (4) were pinched between the screw mount points and the back of the board. This lead so the wires tugging on the main circuit board as darts were thrown and that has cause the mainboard power tracers to crack and fail.

I got the feeling that during his visit here people were just putting him on, he was falling for it and put it in this book. This book reminds me of \\"The Solace of Fierce Landscapes\\" by Belden Lane who was also not a desert resident, from St Lewis, but trying to write a meaningful book about the desert. You need to live in the deseret for a long, long time before it 'happens' to you, and for most people it never does. To think you are going to go on vacation and then write a meaningful book about the desert is completely missing the point.

It's really a shame; there's a lot to like in this book, and I would suggest reading it...but the usually astute Shoumatoff has set himself up as a typical, loose cannon travel writer, coming to some dubious conclusions about places he only knows as a short-sided visitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppily written, error prone.","review":"My bigest complaint is that the book is FULL of factual errors.The author repeatedly makes reference to \\"vegas\\" as the roofbeams in adobe houses- those beams are \\"vigas\\".

It seems the author makes all his judgments and conclusions about New Mexico from his visits to Albuquerque and Santa Fe (yeah, we call it Santa Fake also). I'm sure he would not be happy if I made judgments about New York state from a year visit to New York City! It is obvious that he was a tourista, he didn't stay long enough to find the true flavor of the desert.As a confession, I didn't finish the book.

For some bizarre reason she spends endless paragraphs throughout this book discussing the features and merits of the cars driven by every character and this peculiar digression completely detracts from the book. The rest of the series is equally as odd and it got to the point as I was reading, that I kept wondering to myself, \\"so how is she going to get in the details on the car\\" and it became a self guessing game.

Kinnaman tries to cover this up by adding a phrase here and there to sentences, but the book is essentially the same. This begs the question, are the Server and the Server in the Enterprise exams so similar that one can write the same book as a study guide for both? The reason I gave this book one star, even though it may sufficiently prepare you for the Server exam, is that I think either Kinnaman or the publisher (or both) was (were) dishonest in not coming out with a Server/Enterprise combination book, that simply included the few chapters that don't appear in both books into one study guide. He (They) are trying to rip you off.PS: Can someone write another review that lists the chapters that differ between the Server and the Server in the Enterprise books?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for MCSE preparation","review":"I bought this book after reading Patrick Neal's Windows 98:Exam 70-098, which is excellent.

In fact, not even the town of Roswell seem to exist. It certainly doesn't show up on my map of New Hampshire. The so-called UFO crash in Roswell was a BARN OWL. I mean, that should be obvious. It flew. So do owls. It crashed. So do owls. It scared the living daylights out of some rednecks. So do owls. The \\"alien bodies\\" retrieved were also owls. I mean, look at the eyes. They are big, green and glow at night. Just like the eyes of the New Hampshire subspecies of Barnie Owl. Case closed. The so-called Patterson-Gimli movie of the JFK assassination also shows a Barn Owl. So why did the federal gov classify the Roswell barn owl crash? The explanation is obvious: the anti-owl faction of the East Coast establishment wants to repeal the Endangered Species Act. They hate owls. Don't ask me why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on the History Channel","review":"Don't waste your time on this over-hyped DVD. I really expected something with more intelligence and integrity coming from the History Channel. Basically, one witness was revealed, his story was either bogus or proved to be a dead-end. End of story as far as this History Channel DVD goes. They concluded Roswell was a hoax based on one person's testimony. Very poorly done. Whether you believe or not, the point is this was very shoddy work and not worth the money or time. Next time, I'll pay more attention to how other viewers have rated items. Look for more credible investigators/scientists to explore both sides of the story in an intelligent fashion. I wasn't looking for an answer as to whether or notRoswell really was the site of a UFO crash, but was at least hoping to garner some new details and probably create some more questions and theories of my own.

Chris went to the junk yard to see if he could buy a bike. He got one cheap because his got stolen. That night he saw a warlock riding his bike. The next day he met this girl, Muffin. She didn't have a bike so Chris took her to the junk yard and asked Mr.Bullen to sell a bike to Muffin for a cheap price. Mr Bullen said no at first, but ended up selling her one anyway.

The main reason is that the GR-DVM90U is about the same price, and there are two features that are well worth the upgrade to the 90U. The first is the memory card for digital stills. The 80U doesn't have it -- digital stills are stored on the Mini-DV cassette. This is incredibly inconvenient. The second feature is a flash for digital stills. It makes a huge difference, and I have taken some pretty good quality stills with my new 90U. If you already have a digital camera, and don't want to use this camcorder for stills, the 80U is OK.

It does not attempt to be a live show, but stands on it's own. The compositions in general are more mellow and contemplative than usual, but that's it's strength. While it does not have much in the way of Phish's trademark Zappa-esque musical humor, Billy Breathes has a very musically mature sound that proves that there's no musical \\"zone\\" these guys can't go to and thrive in.

Don't be mistaken, however; they are a great band with an abundance of talent. I am still growing in my appreciation of Phish.

As always, if you are just getting into Phish I would reccomend one of their live offerings first to really get a taste of where the band shines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't know where to start with Phish? Right here...","review":"Here's the slow and skinny. Phish have a large collection of studio albums, and to the new listeners, they may pick up an album like \\"Junta\\", full of crazy lyrics, and long orchestrated pieces, and decide \\"Hey, this is too weird for me.\\" That's too bad, because if you pick up \\"Billy Breathes\\" first, you'll be hooked. This CD is the ultimate introduction to Phish. Great songs like Free, Character Zero, and Taste provide a solid backbone for this album, which is expanded with songs such as the fan favourite Waste, and the Page McConnell (the piano player) showcase, Cars, Trucks, Buses. While not overall Phish's best album, this album is the best introduction for a new fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"great service","review":"very fast service. Perfect product. Mint condition.

Bottom line though is that it took my enjoyment of this band to an entirely new plane. Thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, they can jam. But lookey here!","review":"Ok. So they've released a bunch of jam albums. Great. But I've got news for the people who just want to hear Phish jam: they've released a bunch of jam albums. Would Phish be pure genious if they weren't willing to try something new? Well, they did. And it works. Billy Breaths IS a 5 star cd whether you like loud stuff or soft stuff or in-between stuff. The songs are great. And as a rule--if the songs on the album are great, the album is great. Because, what is an album? Right."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dud that critics love","review":"There are a couple of bright moments on this disc, but one warning sign is that critics LOVE this disc. It is very flat overall, none of the dynamic, over the top imaginative hooks that we've come to love and expect from Phish. Billy Breathes has repetitive, boring melodies that anybody with a guitar and a dime could come up with. Gone are the epics. Gone is the humor. If you feel that you don't dig older Phish (Junta, Lawn Boy, Picture of Nectar), then try starting with The Story of the Ghost, there is a lot more substance to it. Billy Breathes is not really breathing at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera!","review":"I received my camera about 2 months ago and I love it. It is everything I hoped for and more.

The only time the image quality (both still and video) is acceptable is outdoors in bright daylight. I have had much problems downloading still images to computer. I was working on a windows NT station and on a win95. I got it to work once but was never able to repeat it. I am a computer professional. It could be I have a defective cable but frankly I do not have so much time to deal with tech support and repairs and replacement. When I buy a product like this I just want it to work out of the box. Other issues are that it comes with no lens cap and that the battery that it comes with has a very short life (less than a hour).

I have updated my computer to windows 2000, and am unable to use my computer to download the pictures. I have even written to Japan and find JVC does not bother to answer. I went to the store to find out if the most up to date camera is able to be used on windows 2000,the salesman was very helpful, he had not been aware of the problem and offered to give me a copy of the software if it was compatible with 2000 but, no luck, the software goes only as far as 98. Apparently the driver is different. JVC Canada could only tell me to go back to windows 98. That is not good enough. I have been a JVC customer for over 25 years, I have the TV, and VHS from them and this is my third camera from them, but this is the last thing I will ever buy from JVC. What they call customer service, just does not measure up. By the way I love the camera.

The sad thing is that Im not sure that was the authors intention. The book is just hilarious because of the authors infantile perception of crime and punishment.

Unfortunately, there is nothing in this novel to sustain such a comparison. The villain, Allander Atlasia, is on the contrary, a boring, sterotypical killer like those in many, many books of this genre. He has none of the panache of Hannibal Lecter. More troubling though, is the protagonist, Jade Marlow. The surname is evocative of 'Hearts of Darkness' and suggests a deeply troubled, complex, dark type of hero. Well this Marlow is definetly troubled, he fails to involve the reader as he behaves like a jerk througout the entire novel. There is nothing redeeming about his unemotive, robot-like behavior. The plot involves Marlow chasing after Atlasia upon his escape from prison. The end of the novel is both predictable and unfulfilling. There are much better examples of this genre and this is a book best avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"This definitely is NOT comperable to Silence of the Lambs","review":"I can't believe that I read the same book as the other reviewers. Gregg A. Hurwitz is definitely not Thomas Harris. The book starts out promising and slowly degenerates into a parody of what a good serial killer/suspense book should be. Allandar Atlasia is initially an interesting villain but he is never totally fleshed out. Jade Marlow's the famed tracker gets boring fast once his character gets involved with agent Travers. The chemistry between the two is almost non-existent. The best characters are Atlasia's parents, and it is with them I felt the most empathy. There were too many one-dimensional characters in this book that are never fleshed out, and the story behind the story of Atlasia's twisted behaviour is never fully revealed. I felt this book was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"try another provider AND another brand","review":"This looks like a price ripoff from the previous review (plus shipping!).For a 250v 5amp fuse try cooper bussman fuses from Amazon.

Her rich descriptions of both the characters and their environments enable the reader to easily picture their worlds. More importantly, however, the reader is easily and instantly drawn into Esperanza's inner turmoil as she grapples with a budding sensuality that contradicts her conservative Mexican upbringing. The novel deals with these issues in a light-hearted manner, and while many women will undoubtedly identify with Esperanza, they will also be amused by some of the outrageous decisions she makes. The story and the writing style combine many characteristics seen in Isabel Allende, Alice Hoffman, Julia Alvarez - I eagerly await more of Escandon's novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating journey!","review":"When Esperanza begins her journey searching for her daughter, she brings more than her box of saints.

This was a complete waste of time, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER AGAIN","review":"SURPRISE THAT MR HOLMES WOULD BACK THIS BOOK I HATE SHORT STORIES IT DESIRE U TO WANT MORE IT LEAVES U HANGING !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"The only reason I am giving this 2 stars because there were some ok story stories in this book. I am wishing that there was less authors in this book way to many and some was to short to even get the full view of the story until it was over.But, It has opened me up to finding other authors that I never read. Overall OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended: just statistical/frequency data","review":"If you are a teacher, student or a writer seeking guidance, this is not the book which I would suggest, as it's really not prescriptive at all. It's chock full of frequency data wrt various grammatical constructs. It's like reading the census data, if you know what I mean. You'll be left out in netherspace, to basically extract the rules by yourself.

I am a conservative but had to set it aside and recycle it to Goodwill."},{"rating":"1","title":"I looked and I looked","review":"I was really excited to read Senator Santorum's book. I knew he was going to explain how I didn't need to work, we could raise our family with only one income - and I found where he said that.But I thought he would give concrete, how-to examples, like how he bought a house in a low income district that he never lived in with his family so his kids could get an education in a great school district and he could avoid paying property taxes. That a budget tip I could use!My husband and I would also like to avoid paying taxes we owe but we can't aford two houses to do it.So, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dribble","review":"Being a professor of Philosophy I was amazed about how little evidence was put into any of the claims made in the book. With such bold statements; Santorum speaks as if his words are fact. He seemingly denies all intellectual thought of any sort in this book, hitting every intellectual fallacy of argument while accomplishing nothing but making me feel bad for anyone who thinks this is a wonderful piece of literature. On Page 18 he states, \\"Over 90 percent of the Elite news media voted for Kerry in 2004.\\" Now that sentence had no backing from any polling center, there was no evidence, no footnote, nothing. Just numbers that he felt appropriate to use. If you are looking to show a class how to compose a terrible philosophical paper, please recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The religious counter-attack against the Enlightenment","review":"American Theocracy may be a better book to examine to understand the rise of right wing extremism in the fundamentalist community.Rick Santorum is opposed to contraceptives AND to abortions, but also want to cut funding for children in poverty, housing assistance, medical care, etc.And let's not forget that \\"BLA\\" people are welfare dependents.Santorum has his finger on the pulse of America -- in the 1800's.A sad day for America when someone so stupid can be considered a leader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excremental","review":"I do think this book will be a valuable edition for a historian trying to piece together the fall of American power in the 21st Century. Pennsylvania gave us Benjamin Franklin and this?If Santorum actually believed any part of his made to order religio-fascist text--which is blatant hypocrisy and doublespeak as cynically written as any screed from Hearst--he would require inpatient mental therapy. The truth is that this is a modern day Elmer Gantry without public speaking skills or the tent fire. It is an apology for a culture of selfish excess disguised as a religious tome--as fake as the stained glass look of the cover. Santorum and his ilk are finally awakening the ire of America with their crude excesses, destructive policies and untruths, but unfortunately the call came in Mid-Apocalypse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This book would merit a zero, if one were available. One of the reasons that Rick Santorum is \\"Public Enemy #1 to the hard left,\\" as one reviewer put it, is the especially nasty and personal way he attacks those who disagree with him. Fortuntely, it seems that Pennsylvania voters (if polls are to be believed) have had enough of this nutjob, and in 2006 will send him to oblivion, where he belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to be white and use political influence to get what you want","review":"Santorums 15 minutes are about up and he is now backpedaling from Bush and all his nutty ideas as fast as he can.

This book, like its author, is a giant Santorum.The title of the book itself is contradictory: \\"Conservatism and the Common Good.\\" There's no such thing. Conservatives are all about looking out for themselves, not for the common good.Conservatives are sick, twisted, immoral people--and they want to forcibly impose their sick, twisted, and immoral theology/ideology on everyone else, even if it means killing fellow Americans. Santorum's book proves it.By the way, I'm voting for Santorum in my state's primary. I hope Santorum gets the GOP nomination. It will ensure that President Obama gets a second term. That will be what's best for America, even though conservatives don't know it. But conservatives don't know lots of things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Self-Serving Conservative Screed","review":"Studies show that strong families make our society stronger? Alert the media! Santorum's ode to the obvious is seriously and thoroughly undercut by his refusal to admit that the word \\"family\\" can be defined as anything other than a man, a woman, and their children. The book is purposely and unnecessarily divisive, which confirms Santorum's Neo-Con ideology, and insulting to millions of people who live in other than traditional circumstances. What's more, his self-serving, small-minded insinuations that Conservatives value families more than do Liberals or Progressives underline the true purpose of this political hackery. It Takes A Moron to think this is anything more than a stump speech."},{"rating":"2","title":"getting our country back on track","review":"\\"it takes a family\\" is very hard to put down. senator rick santorum and current president candidate shows how the the family is being threatened and what can be done to defend it and shows how it is one of the things that holds this country together. this is truly a great book and has some great common since solutions to awnser the many questians that trouble our country. also recamended everyday graces by karen santorum and letters to gabriel by karen santorum"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pah-Leez... What was he thinking?...","review":"A friend gave me this book, and I did manage to get through it. There were a couple of parts in the book that would give you the impression that Senator Santorum actually means well.When most politicians try to get a law passed or to defend their barbaric position on social issues, they say we \\"must do it for the children\\". When I finished this book, I had a feeling that the senator wrote this book for two reasons.1. To use his definition of \\"Family\\" and of course \\"The Children\\" to further his cause, and justify the Right's intolerance of others.2. I feel like he named his book that particular title to make a jab at Hillary Clinton's book, \\"It Takes a Village\\" (which I have not read).Perhaps I am wrong, but I still did not enjoy the book. You can find used copies on eBay at a bargain, and read it for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't learn anything from it that I didn't already know.","review":"From page 1 to page 464, there was nothing new presented.

Buy it if you don't trust me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't take seriously","review":"It is one thing to be fiscally conservative, but religion and conservatism do not go together well. Santorum is one of the many examples of that. There is a reason why church and state are supposed to be separate, and people like Santorum don't care about that. Santorum believes that the ideal family consists of one mom and dad. And of course, that family has to fit in HIS narrowly-defined idea of what constitutes a family.It is true that a family with two parents is often more stable emotionally and financially, but some families with a mom and dad are pretty screwed up, and some single-parent or same-sex couple families are AWESOME. Santorum says a lot of weird things, and it's sad that many agree with him on his closed-minded ways. I would take conservatives like Mr. Frothy seriously if they left religion out of politics."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real howler!","review":"This book is downright hilarious. Santorum is so ignorant, it's outrageous. If you want a good laugh, borrow it, don't buy it. Rick's stupidity has finally done him in though.

But the issues are blown so out of proportion and some claims are so outrageous that it made me laugh. This is supposed to be a serious book. But if you don't believe in Rick Santorum's cause, this book is very funny. I rank it on the same comedy level as John Stewart's book Earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"In this book Senator Santorum simply pushes the growing view that liberals are evil and that conservatives are godly. It is a disgusting use of emotional phrases in an attempt to prove how the poor conservatives who control all branches of the government are proscuted by the evil liberals, particulauly in the media. Do yourself a favor and DON'T read this book of lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Santorum excludes many or most Americans","review":"It is interesting to read views not my own, and dialogue is central to the way our democracy works. However, this book is insensitive to the variety of cultural and family experiences in our country, and this book advocates actions and recommendations that trample on basic, fundamental, Constitutional rights.It is ironic that the far-right view in current politics in the U.S.A., while broadly using the words \\"freedom\\" and \\"democracy\\" as touchstones, seek to rein in freedoms in a wide swath of areas of personal, community, and even global life. We are supposed to follow a particular dogma, and call it freedom. This destroys the foundations of our Constitution, and the foundations on which our founding political philosophers created our currently-challenged Nation.

They are nice and crunchy which she likes. You don't have any idea how hard it is to find a crunchy treat that she is not allergic to. Most of the treats are soft and chewy which is okay but I wanted her to have some crunchy ones to help keep her teeth clean.

The 'teaspoon' of information I'm referring to was when Dr. Sproul talked about how important it is to be honest when talking to your spouse about what you really mean or think. His example given was being honest about what you really would like to have when receiving or giving Christmas presents to each other. There was nothing about sharing time and activities, talking with each other as bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh, or how to become each others' best friend, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Wheels: A Collector's Guide","review":"I was walking in the mall one day and stopped in a book-store.I was looking around and saw this book.I Looked through it and bought it.It was great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummie!","review":"This bar is very good.

Jody starts catching badly and he is starting to think he can't play. Jody solved this problem by talking to Mr. Baruth. Mr. Baruth tells him not to care about what his teammates think.

I had seen the video for \\"Spirit of '76\\" and have a friend who used to be really into them. I looked at some of the song titles and they sounded so drugged-out weird I just decided to get it.Man, what a trip! This album is one of the most beautiful and strange I've ever heard. The only other thing that comes close is \\"Sgt. Pepper\\". Honestly! If you don't believe me, listen to it!And I don't think I've EVER heard anything so eclectic. This is real diversity. Another fascinating thing about Ween is that you often can't tell if they're kidding or not. Especially on tunes like \\"the Mollusk\\" and \\"Mutilated Lips\\".One thing that almost no reviews have mentioned is the last track, \\"She Wanted to Leave\\". This is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. Haunting.Feed a 17-year old Beethoven some acid and this is what he might have come up with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing monster of an album","review":"I consider Ween's The Mollusk their best album and creative peak to date. It has the perfect blend of everything Ween is about - the brown sound weirdness, the incredible melodies, humor, amazing guitar playing, and songs that are just catchy as hell. There's not a bad track on here. My favorite songs include The Mollusk, Johnny On The Spot, Mutilated Lips, The Golden Eel, Buckingham Green, Blarney Stone, and Ocean Man."},{"rating":"2","title":"The reigning kings of intelligent song parody","review":"Tim Buckley and Richard Thompson knew how to drag a barge of emotional force inside their finely crafted tunes, and Ween know it's not easy to deliver a effective parody of folk-prog. But inside their silly lyrics is a situational humor that builds in appreciation listen after listen. Who else could deliver the line \\"Go fetch me ... white milk from the maiden's breast that babe ere never known\\" and make it seem important? Who else can make you both sympathize and snicker when the bewildered captain loses his love in \\"She Wanted to Leave?\\" When it's all said and done, this is about as creative as the genre has sounded in over 25 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ay, yay, yay....

Ween has come along way since God Ween Satan (though that's a fine album, too). After everyone thought that Ween had gone country, they release The Mollusk and blow them all away. There are more serious songs on this one, but they all totally kick ass!

But the big flaw are the pictures. As another reviewer wrote, there as just too many mistakes. Mixing the Diablo for a Countach is simply ...! Didn't the author see the final print? The book has a strange lay-out. Thanks to the format half of the page has text, the other half is plain-blank. Enough blank space for many more pictures. That's the book's other picture-problem: There aren't many. No pictures, except one, of prototypes. There is also far too much attention for the Audi-age, with a whole chapter about the Gallardo. This section has loads of Gallardo-pictures, but all of them are factory-photo's I already saw in various car-magazines. Almost no attention for the lm002 either. You do need to buy another Lamborghini photo-book to get the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"There are lots of incorrect captions in this book that annoyed me very much!

The title of the book is somewhat misleading, as it deals more with leadership and communication, than with changing the behavior or personalities of individuals. Thus, if you are looking for a self-help book, a book on personal change, or a text on psychotherapies, then this is the wrong book for you. The book is more appropriate for political leaders, corporate leaders, or new supervisors, looking for some non-traditional ideas on the leadership process and on how to influence others. It may take some work to convert the ideas offered here into practice, but Gardner's book should prove interesting to those looking for some creative concepts that are not found in the typical business text on leadership."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money or time","review":"I see other comments that are similar to my opinion. I thought this book was a total waste of time. Self-indulgent, rambling ideas that seemed there only to demonstrate how much the author believes he is brilliant. I can't believe he has so many books and university endorsements. It is rare for me to dislike a book, but this one made me angry. I read the entire thing, so I gave it a fair chance.

He then teaches us how to align these levers in order to effect the perception and behavior of others. Gardner uses examples on all levels, from the mass influence of a political campaign to influencing the thoughts of individuals.Naturally mastering this ability can greatly increase our chances of climbing the corporate ladder or landing the job and salary we desire in the first place.

Gardner spends the first few chapters seemingly laying a foundation for what's to come, then squanders it with essentially a bunch of anecdotes. It really seems less like an integrated, well-researched theory than \\"My opinion, by a famous psychologist.\\" Quite often it feels as though he's stretching his \\"7 factors for changing minds\\" to fit his anecdotes. It also feels as though he's casting around for stories to throw in. \\"Oh, hey, I had a friend who changed people's minds! Why don't I include him?\\" And so he does. I had the distinct impression, as other readers seem to, that he wrote this book under duress, or because he and Harvard Business Publishing thought there might be a willing market.

Sadly, it was difficult to get beyond Mr. Gardner's entrenched political bias shown (reflected in the minds of many Harvard professors) in his illustrations in one chapter after another. We've all heard it before: George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan as simple-minded, latter stage former prime minister Margaret Thatcher as arrogant. If I wanted a book on politics, well that's another matter. How about Mr. Gardner changing his own mind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Changing minds with one point of view","review":"I found the first 50 pages or so to be intriguing, after that it became a grind to endure. Mr. Gardner makes very indirect references to the impact of the media on the vignettes that he recounts, yet seemingly asserts that the individuals involved acted in a vacuum.The author credits Bill Clinton with single handedly coming up with \\"mend it, don't end it\\" for welfare, yet does not explain how the Republican congress of 94 had any part in this course of action.Darwin is treated as an infallible truth, yet Mr. Gardner does not address the lack of transitional forms, the various \\"truths\\" that are allowed to exist, like the stages of the human embryo [fish, primate with tail] and the lack of any new species.The author does have some interesting ideas, yet the simplistic characterization of the people or ideas that he analyzes [see the part on George Bush] fails to allow us, the readers, to form a realistic idea of the forces acting on them.So how do I change minds?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Changing Minds is very disappointing - average to very poor writing, poor development of ideas, ideas that have been shown to be weak or invalid constructs, and very little substance.

The author argues that this process happens gradually in ways that can be actively and powerfully influenced.

For even the most casual fan just about all if not all of the songs will be familier to you. What I would add to all this is my recommendation if you want just one Doors album to add to your music collection then this might be the one to get. I find the recording quality to be very good and while there are other great songs that the group put out I think the best of the best are on here. Yeah there are other CDs out there that are greatest hit collection of The Doors and they are very good. If you got the money and can spend a little more then I say go for those albums.

The Doors released a record called \\"13\\" way back while they were still around (I believe they released it in '70.) It included their hit singles up till then. Since that time they have put out quite a few \\"Best of\\"s and \\"Greatest Hits\\"s packages. Along comes this, a single disc. Keep in mind that the 2CD package \\"Best of\\" is still in print. But no, The Doors make it a point to re-release the Greatest Hits, throwing an enhancement on and a new cover to entice the thirsty new fan. Elektra records is pretty shameless. And it continues on the boxset, which features a \\"Band Favorites\\" which is a kind of Greatest Hits. Here's a simple equation for the Doors and Elektra: rare, unedited, undoctored releases = happy fans = more $. But why should they bother when they can continue to make $$$ off the same old stuff?

Don't advertise something that is not there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good DOORS compilation","review":"This particular GREATEST HITS collection is an ideal album.The DOORS were one of THE most inconsistent bands in history-- for proof, compare MORRISON CAFE to their debut album, or stack up THE SOFT PARADE against STRANGE DAYS. The former are drivelbound, the latter are generally good quality.The in-concert \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" is excellent, and Morrison's thoughts afterward chillingly prescient. The edited version here of \\"The End\\" is really ALL you need of this overhyped dabble into Freudian psychology. As for the rest of this set: solid material-- worth owning.

It is missing so many of their hits (peace frog, alambama song, backdoor man, the wasp, spanish caravan) the list goes on. If you want a cheap single disc collection of the doors' best stuff then get the very best of the doors (which isnt that great either.) Otherwise go with legacy, that is by far the best doors compilation out there. Even if you dont even know the doors that well and u only know a few of their songs, this is still not the right choice. The worst part about this album is the version of \\"The End\\" that is inlcuded. The only reason i didnt give it 1 star is because any cd that is all doors songs will be great.

The book is full of flowery anecdotes detailing his travels through Lebanon and India. I could hardly read through the descriptive paragraphs in order to read what he had experienced while traveling with Dr. Ian Stevenson. This book seemed more like a fiction novel than a \\"Scientific Evidence of Past Lives\\". I was very disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Lebenon and India, not enough reincarnation.","review":"It seems the author was more interested in telling of the conditions in India and Lebenon than telling the storys of the children's lives and prior lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Scenic' Taxi Ride","review":"The title of this book promises \\"compelling evidence\\" but what it offers instead is only \\"compelling writing.\\" For all of Tom Shroder's self-proclaimed healthy skepticism he really offers the reader nothing but second and third-hand stories that are all easily explainable and full of gaping holes. The fact that many of these cases come from cultures that believe in reincarnation (i.e. the social norm says reincarnation is an everyday event) should warn the reader that what follows may well be tainted and skewed data. Hardly a scientific work, Old Souls, is just another pseudo-science [take-off]. Admittedly, Shroder's writing style is punchy and journalistic, taking the reader along for an interesting ride. After a few chapters though it gets \\"old\\" and the \\"souls\\" all appear to be (perhaps well-intentioned) con artists taking two white guys in a foreign country for an endless series of \\"scenic\\" taxi rides that never actually go anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I believe in reincarnation. The stories here sound true to me. The varieties of cases are interesting to read about. A lot of disbelievers trash on them because most of these people are from the \\"third world\\" countries. Spirit and soul are things that science have no way of proving yet. And how much prove is prove? I don't see Christians needing a lot of proof. Furthermore, if you can accept soul going to hell or heaven eventually, how hard is it to believe that soul sometimes wonder around in heaven, purgaory, or come back again as in reincarnation?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Souls: Compelling Evidence from Children Who Remember Past Lives","review":"Very interesting book with a lot of good stories.

Lots of anecdotes; little actual evidence. When a bunch of stories comprise a valid new theory, let me know, so I can submit the world of Mother Goose. Psuedoscience at its worst.

While I cannot say this book PROVES the theory of reincarnation, it certainly is thought provoking and suggests something greater than we fully understand is taking place. I don't believe the intent was to prove, but rather to provoke further thought and exploration.The book is a wonderful travel log of an exploration into reincarnation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointing evaluation of the evidence","review":"The author learned of the research of Ian Stevenson, M.D. and decided to accompany him to evaluate the subjects first hand. The book spends more time describing the details of the trips and the surroundings the author found himself in than on describing the subjects themselves. In support of the evidence of reincarnation the author concludes that the subjects are truthful and the evidence cannot be explained by any other explanation than reincarnation, but it is much more interesting to read the evidence in the several books that Ian Stevenson has written about his case studies."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit redundant","review":"There was a lot information in this book to disseminate.

Very provocative and rang true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illuminating","review":"This book is about a skeptical journalist who finds himself on a most revelatory venture when he accompanies Ian Stevenson, noted reincarnation researcher, on trips to investigate cases.He openly acknowledges his skepticism at the outset, and slowly reveals how he became convinced that there is something going on in the area of reincarnation studies. Ian Stevenson is very cautious and methodical, rejecting any cases that have even a hint of taint of the subjects. Under his exacting criteria, he still finds some cases that simply cannot be explained away as products of hoax, inadvertent communication of information, or the great catchall, \\"coincidence\\" or \\"lucky guesses.\\"I appreciated how Mr. Shroder revealed his skepticism and came to an understanding that there is a lot more going on in the universe than what can be explained through traditional approaches to reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"the subtitle should be:","review":"\\"my personal exploration of reincarnation cases.\\" the number of pages spent discussing actual cases is few. the author spends much more time working through his own doubts on the subject and describing the scenery of the countries he visited. it is not badly written, but you will only througholy enjoy it if you are looking for a travel guide, an autobiography, and some information on reincarnation."},{"rating":"1","title":"old souls","review":"Boring!

He is not convinced by these stories and is actually there to find evidence in order to support his skeptical views. Doctor Ian Stevenson, author of \\"Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation\\", is very humble and kind to let this guy follow him around and double check his research.

Even after I took the plastic off, the container was greasy.

Not much more of an impression than that upon two recent close listenings. I think the strongest numbers by far are to be found on the first half of the record. The most disappointing fact for me was that most of the songs sounded quite similar. However, it still one of the more consistently 'alternative' pieces of recorded music to come out this year. I am not sure if that is praise for Grubbs or a lamentation for the paltry amount of good recordings to come out this year.

The author has several excellent characters in the book, the best is Demon, a lean, mean, negro killing machine, who I would have liked to have read more about in the book. The author appeared to put a lot of thought into the book but seemed to have a lot of difficulty with expressing his ideas and quite simply, the book lacked the energy that it needed to make it the extraordinary story that I had expected it to be. The book, eventhough filled with several twists and turns, I think, is very predictable, and the ending went just as I had expected. In short, the author does have skills, but unfortunetly, this is not the novel that they are best displayed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hood Book???","review":"I'm really tired of our people having a limited imagination when it comes to writing.

Historical accuracy withstanding, this should have been a bit darker, given the period of which it represents. But given some lush greens and deep blue waters under sunny skies; not happening.It seems to have been more of a vehicle to test the \\"leading hero\\" of Colin Firth. I do enjoy watching him, but this just wasn't the right one for him. To be fair, while he is excellent in English period films, he can hold his own in modern ones, too.

For me, this movie is marvelous!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat silly but not terrible","review":"I had expected better based on the previews. It was an interesting spin on the idea of a Roman genesis for the Arthurian legend but there was some silliness along the way. Things started going downhill with the introduction of the warrior-chick from Byzantium (yeah, she's hot but not very believable). Then they walk all the way to Britian through Gaul (followed, of course by the bad guys). Etc, etc.Overall the plot is weak and predictable. No acting or dialogue to get excited about. There are some cool fight-scenes, in spite of super-chick. It was a stretch but TLL did make an interesting connection between Rome and King Arthur.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star wars in Britainia","review":"Luke, Leia, Obi Wan, Han Solo, and Darth Vader--they are all here, but with different names.

The acting is good, nice little bits of humor, fairly good chemistry between actors, and an excellent musical soundtrack -- a nice diversion when one needs it.It's staying in my movie library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal Fiasco","review":"For anyone who loves great history blended with gripping drama and action, I suggest that you gouge your eyes out with a stylus before watching this festering turd. This film manages to to treat both the Fall of the Roman Empire and the Arthurian legend with equally sloppy disdain. History and logic take a backseat in this alleged historical drama. Colin Firth and Kevin McKidd flail helplessly about in this mishmash of a mess. For God's sake, the invading hordes are reduced to a handful of ruffians who take Rome by walking in the back door and saying \\"boo\\". The research on this film is so shoddy that McKidd's character is actually given a woman's name. Firth's frustration with the utter crappiness of this fiasco is apparent in every scene. In the name of sanity, please do not watch this film for any reason. You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why watch it? Firth and Kingsley and no other reason at all","review":"Colin Firth and Ben Kingsley could read a dictionary and keep me entertained but their being cast in this dreadful movie cut it really close. The movie is and will always remain a dreadful waste of the $2.99 I spent renting it.Dull because of possibly one of the worst scripts I have ever been witness to. Honestly, this is a dreadful movie that must have paid some of the very popular cast members quite a bit for them to appear in a movie based on the really horrid script. Perhaps they all got together and tied one on and signed a contract to appear in this mess while inebriated.......I dont know.Incredibly poor movie. While watching it I experience my first desire to kill a young male actor in my entire life. Perhaps the kid will get into something more suitable for him, like child prostitution.This really was and always will be a purely dreadful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many previews","review":"I am giving one star to this because an anti-smoking ad and no less than four lengthy previews are too much to have to sit through just to get a chance to watch a movie, particularly when one has paid $19.99 to have it at one's command, on DVD!While the previews were in progress, I could discover no way to advance the DVD to the principal menu. Outrageous, and not deserving of one dime of the consumer's money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooo.","review":"Ugh! I'm just so disappointed with this movie and the performance of one of my favorite actors, Colin Firth. It was almost as if Colin didn't want the role, but HAD to take the role and throughout the movie seemed simply annoyed at having to do anything at all that resembling acting.Then you have the storyline, predictable and overdone. \\"You've seen the story of King Arthur, and then saw it retold, but here's the real real REAL story folks, the one that we reveal in all its glory!\\" BLAH! I think my disappointment turned into anger when I felt my intelligence being insulted by the revealing of \\"Escaliber\\" and nope, that's not a typo, \\"Escaliber.\\" I suppose we've gotten it wrong all these many years.The only performance that kept me from slitting my wrists was that of Ben Kingsley and even that of Peter Mullan who's performance in Tristan and Isolde came through once more for this film.So, that's about it. Sorry, the movie drained me of all energy. It was just a blech moment prolonged!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This one plays fast and loose with history...","review":"...but remains entertaining. We had just seen \\"Iron Man\\" at the theater earlier in the day (a phenomenal film) and were still in a movie mood, so we dropped by Blockbuster to see what was out.\\"The Last Legion\\" caught our eye and seemed right for our mood so we took a shot.While I winced at the references to \\"the gods\\" (at the time this film was ostensibly taking place - 432 A.D. - the Holy Church of Rome was well established) this film was still fun and shot beautifully. I felt like my eyeballs would pop at it's sumptuousness, as it looks that good on an HDTV.I'd give it two and a half stars if I could figure out how to get half a star to light up on Amazon's rating system.While it's no \\"Troy - Director's Cut\\", \\"The Last Legion\\" isn't wasted time."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the heck?","review":"Well, this was a really interesting idea with lots of potential. Good actors, great settings, cool costumes and a neat story but this movie fails completely. The acting is rather stiff, the whole story is told far too quickly without a lot of detail, and you don't really care who wins, though I found myself rooting for the Goths. This would have been a fantastic movie done in the same way 20yrs ago but by todays standards the movie lacks a great deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"the last legion","review":"I wasn't very impressed with this movie.

I don't know what the director was thinking trying to mix in the humor (so called) and the lame attempt at romance with the action. Ugh, it was painful to watch. Colin Firth should never do another movie like this again. I would have preferred Colin Ferral for that part. At least he is more believable in the role of a Roman guard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good movie at all, worst than King Arthur a few year ago","review":"Boo, indeed. How in hell a group of traveling warriors walk on scorched lands, snow treacherous mountain paths, high sea and all, across Europe on foot then braved the high sea to Britain with no support for the basic necessities, such as food, clothes... Oh, by the way, did I mention that the beautiful female fighter always looks her best with full make-up and clothes, armors which tailored to fit her gorgeous figure. Where were they from? Her own personal purse?The story is contrived, dialogue is mundane, acting is so so, I would recommended 1/2 star for this...good thing I borrowed this from the local library, phew!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel sorry for Colin and Ben..","review":"This is one BORING STORYLINE with a plot that meanders through rubbish! I cannot understand why Colin Firth and Ben Kingsley, both great actors, accepted these silly roles. In my opinion they have have severely compromised their reputations by appearing in this last LEPER [not legion, because this movie is like a disease, that worsens as the scenes progress] film.Somebody ought to tell ashwarya rai that she needs to leave hollywood alone and go back to dazzling her devotees in bollywood. ash cannot cope with western roles. she does deliver her lines in an effective manner. was the director too spellbound by her beauty that he could not see all the flaws in her wooden performance. the woman should stick to the world of modelling and dancing around trees in bollywood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Legion last great stand","review":"I enjoyed this movie from the start to the end. The cast was great Colin Firth and Ben Kingsley brought their charactors to life. The battle scenes were great. This is a movie that I recommend to those who like a wonderful adventure and great people that you will enjoy to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Lesson: Ignore The Critics","review":"I rented \\"The Last Legion\\" from Netflix and was surprisingly pleased. This was a movie I sat down with my family and enjoyed from beginning to end. If you like Arthurian legends and sword and magic this well flavored movie will fill the bill. As soon as it was finished I got on line and bought a copy at a bargain price."},{"rating":"1","title":"a misuse of Ben Kingsley","review":"The movie ienptly portrays an Arthurian myth. Ben Kingsley must be immensely embarrassed. Poor editing, poor character development, poor storyline development, poor script, miscasting. Characters (actors) are misused in scenses throughout, particulary Kingsley's when he flip flops between mysterious sorcerer and mere house magician. The movie also suffers from a jumpy inconsistent plot development. Throughout, you are constantly wondering how did you get from one scene to another, since there are absent lead in elements to make the connections. Its Huh? How did we get here? Shortly after the start of the movie, scenes become decreasingly believable. Sad really, because the basic story premise could have made for an exciting inspiring movie. The actors didn't fail here. This is a failure of production and direction. This film may become a classic clunker for future film school critique."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hideous Historical Action Movie","review":"I bought this movie when it first came out and , based on what I saw in the trailers, expected a great action movie. I was sorely disappointed.A weak plot that starts in Italy and wanders over to Britain, with no purpose other than to put another spin on the Arthur legend is the largest of this film's problems, but poor acting and a low budget don't help either. In fact, the \\"Last Legion\\" portrayed in this movie never number more than a dozen or so, and the final confrontation is far from epic as the cover would lead you to believe.For a much better take on a \\"historical\\" Arthur legend, I recommend the recent \\"King Arthur\\" movie with Clive Owen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even of comedic value...","review":"This film had many first rate actors but unfortunately they were either misdirected or miscast. The movie was not bad enough to be comical, but just bad enough to lose everyone's attention. Colin Firth as a roughneck legion commander was sadly unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Movie","review":"I saw the reviews when the movie first came out in the theaters and avoided it because of those reviews. I recently saw Bride and Prejudice and was stricken with how wonderful Ashwara Rai looked (with her piercing gray eyes) and I looked to see what other movies she had made.This is a movie that you shouldn't take too seriously. It does touch on some actual history (the Western Roman Empire did fall and the Goths did sack Rome) but the movie is more fun to watch as a swashbuckler kind of film. There is some good humor involved and I thought that the action sequences were very good (if you watch the special features you can see how they choreographied some of the fight scenes). I did not have high expectations for this movie based on professional reviews when the movie came out. So I was very pleasantly surprised when I finally saw this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This is the 4th or 5th racing instructional book I've read. Carl does a good job of explaining the different techniques in racing. I also picked up a few new things! The diagrams are professional and easy to understand. The side-comments by other racing experts also adds a lot of \\"realism\\" to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything under 1 roof","review":"I read \\"Going Faster\\" from cover to cover before participating in a 3 day Skip Barber Racing School program at Laguna Seca Raceway (Monterey, CA). This book is not only one of the most informative accounts on the techniques of both fast driving and competition racing, but is an enjoyable read as well. The content has it all, from basic car control, to much more complex technical information regarding car setup, and physics of a race car. I found this book to be both informative AND inspiring, which speaks volumes in itself. Regardless of whether you are an armchair racer, gamer, autocrosser, club racer, or pro, this book offers something for everyone. I have also read many of the other standards on auto racing (Bob Bondurant's guide to high performance racing, and Carrol Smith's \\"Drive to Win\\"), and \\"Going Faster\\" offers the best of both worlds. If I had to choose one \\"Bible of Racing,\\" this would most certainly be it! Worth Every Penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great technical information","review":"This book was recommended by several sources on the internet, that's why I bought it. I'm about half way through it and it is a very good source of information on racing. It covers everything from the first time you see a track to developing the line and then corner entry, exit and quite a few things I haven't read yet. I'm sure it will help me to become faster and more consistant."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best, most readable, most up-to-date racing text!","review":"GOING FASTER is simply the best, most readable, and most up-to-date racing textbook around! Although no amount of classroom instruction, principles or theory will ever replace seat time and on-track experience when it comes to developing racing skills, a book like this is a great way to enhance and help assess what you're doing (or not doing) out on the track. Plus its balance between a scientific approach and conversational language and anecdotes from well established drivers make it the most readable \\"how to\\" racing book I've ever read. Good for the beginner and seasoned \\"expert\\" alike. Congratulations to Carl Lopez on a fine job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped me post a new pesonal best lap at Laguna Seca","review":"I am an amateur racer competing in SCCA regional racing.I found GOING FASTER to be a very useful textbook. The organization is excellent, allowing me to skip some basic information and go directly to the areas which concerned me the most. The clear an detailed description of exactly how a racing car is driven through corners helped me analize my own driving and improve my performance.The description of each aspect of racing starts with a technical foundation and then builds to a description of how to do it in the car. I am an engineer by traning, so this combination of a theroetical treatment with practiacl advice is excellent for me.I found the descrption of how things are in racing to be right on, and I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to try racing, as well as to the racer who wants to improve his or her perforamnce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the Most Complete Racing Instruction Book","review":"I think I must have bought almost every book there is on racing instruction over the years, and this book definitely ranks in the top three. It is incredibly complete and easy to understand.

If you were like me and cant understand how you could write 278 pages just on driving, your in for a real treat. This book is a racers bible. Teaches you the fastest way through a turn, how to find out how much side load your tires can withstand, how to run in someones draft, how to avoid accidents, what driving line to use in the rain,passing, lowering lap times, diffent ways to shift gears, deal with oversteer and understeer. I can go on and on. This book has improved my overall driving as an everyday daily driver. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their racing or just improve your overall driving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best racing book I've encountered","review":"I bought this book prior to attending the Skip Barber Racing School, and it was the perfect preparation. The book goes into far more detail than the actual school has time for, so by internalizing it before attending the school, you are well prepared to put the theories into practice.If the book has any flaw at all, it is that it treats race car driving like something that can be approached completely mathematically. When you're in a real car, instinct, courage, and judgment still count for a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great information","review":"I think this is a really good book for the novice driver, who wants to understand how to drive high performance cars on a track. very informative and good graphic illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!!","review":"Focus on the Family always has great story lines.

I was totally blown away that a Fender Stratocaster could be used in a setting or set a mood like this project Russ and Steve did. I first heard Up On the Roof and was blown away by it... and had to have this album. I suggest you also pick up Duo Life the second release from this duo...

The people who wrote those reviews likely had their headphones plugged into the \\"line in\\" jack rather than the headphone jack (I encountered this the first time I used it, but then realized my error).If you're looking for a general-use player, then this is your best bet... if you're looking to run or exercise with it, you may be better off shelling out the extra bucks to get a \\"sportier\\" player with a strap and more anti-skip protection.All in all, an incredible value for only $40, in my opinion"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I absolutely loved my RioVolt100. So I tried this one, after I dropped my other player.I read the reviews, and didn't believe customer support could be that bad. But they were hopeless. I asked about the features of the machine and may as well been asking about a model they didn't even manufacturer. I purchased it after giving up on technical support being able to list the features. I had to send it back.It will not to allow you to program tracks. Too bad.I highly recommend going with the iRiver 150, which costs less and has many more features.But I'm sure this is a fine player if it has the features you want.

I wish I could buy a remote, but alas, Rio's website offers no such item. Nor does it offer any AC adapter.My advice, if you only have a hundred bucks, get a RioVolt.

It's dark, athmospheric, with multiple layers of sounds and weird samples, yet this never overshadows the sheer beauty of Lourau's melodies. It's a gambit in that he scraped his former Groove Gang to get into this (thankfully keeping Magik Malik whose flute works wonders in the electronic environment), but all his usual world music influences are still here. If you like it (and you will), try also another french guy's take on te style: Booster's \\"loop in release\\" (Blue note), although this one is a little bit on the lighter side of things.

Some of the various stories here from other people involved I've heard before but he William Shatner doesn't draw it out word for word so it's diffferent enough in those instances when he does quote people that it's not boring and feeling re-hashed. I just can't believe at the end of the book, he talks with his cast mates and he didn't seem to have any idea until he wrote this book that he was revilved by some and mildly tolerated by others within the cast-I thought he had learned that at a convention from some fans in the bathroom.

It starts out with a little piglet who has lost his mother, a terrifying concept for a child. Yes, other children's books deal with this subject including one of my favorites \\"Are You My Mother?\\" but in that book the mother has gone off to look for food for her child; there is no such reasoning here. The creepiness begins on the piglet's encounter with a duck while he's looking for his mother - the duck (a stranger) wants to cuddle with him. This set off immediate alarm bells about messages I don't want to teach my child about strangers. The pig continues to encounter strangers who make offers that made me feel very uncomfortable for my child to be ok with. Unfortunately children don't learn from this book that strangers who make such offers AREN'T ok.

She sings them just fine, thanks, we don't need nor want any impersonators. If this artist is trying to break into the music business maybe she should, oh, I don't know, GET HER OWN SONGS AND IDENTITY.

She sings so FAST and carelessly, I have to wonder how she got a recording contract in the first place. It sounds basically like she dubbed over an instrumental version of Tori's music with her own voice.

It was cheap, so I decided to give it a go, together with the Kate Bush tribute this band did (no, it's not by various artists, it's a band, with a singer called Jemma Price). I only give this album two stars, because it lacks originality. The songs are still great, as they're Tori's, but I feel, if you do a cover, create an alternate version, something (completely) different from the original. This band stays so close to the original version - why bother buying this, then? And the vocals are, well, terrible at points! Some tracks sound like they've been recorded only once - false notes and all. This album may be cheap, but spend the extra few dollars to buy Under The Pink - that's value for money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gwen Stiffani is a Tori fan?","review":"It truly sounds like NO DOUBT decided to cover Tori...and no, they can't pull it off. When you get the opportunity to record your own album, you should do just that. The whole idea of an unknown somebody making an entire cd of Tori's songs (not changing them in the slightest) sort of bugs me, and probably frightens Tori. I close by saying...STAY AWAY unless you feel like laughing, of course."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Waitress\\" can sing? Isnt she dead?","review":"I suspect that although Tori thought she killed the waitress, she has infact survived all these years and has been planning revenge. How? By making this horrible CD.This \\"woman\\".... whoever she is, must absolutely be planning a public appology to Tori Amos and her legion of angry fans who are slowly creeping at her door. And I must admit I do feel sorry for her, heck wouldnt you if you realized what a joke this name will go to on her next attempt to cover yet another female singer?I will stop now because I am being mean...... but that didn't stop HER.Perhaps Mr.Zebra and Jupiter will plot a little \\"revenge\\" on their own. (laughs evily)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good a year","review":"I was very disappointed with this album. While I have to agree with other reviewers that the songs are competantly played and sung, pale imitations of the original are all they are. \\"Impersonations of Tori Amos\\" rather than \\"A tribute to Tori Amos\\" may have been a better subtitle. This may sound negative, but having bought tribute albums before and finding that cover versions tend to fall into two catagories, either the truly marvellous or the truly monsterous, I was really looking forward to listening to this album with an open mind. However, all I found were karaoke covers. However competant, this album is conpletely devoid of imagination and originality. Sorry to be so harsh but an album of Tori covers could have been wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAUTION - Thin Ice","review":"Jemma Price has a wonderful voice and she obviously loves Tori Amos, but this is not a CD for Tori fans. Some fans may find it interesting, but on the whole proabably will not like it. For being made and/or released this year, it is a poor collection of Tori's wide range of songs. To be a true tribute, I would expect a at least one Y Kant Tori Read song, a few songs from each album, and a rarity or b-side. This CD is definately good for people who like Tori's songs but are not looking to invest in all of her many albums. It is more a collection of early songs and not a tribute to the wonderful singer/songwriter that so many have adored for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was terrible","review":"I wasn't aware that this wasn't some collection of actual Tori songs when I ordered it... I'm unbelievably disappointed.... I mean, if she was going to do Tori songs... she could at least have added her own personal twist to the songs rather than trying to identically copy(insulting) Tori. I think this cd should only be for the extreme collectors who already have everything and anything else that Tori's on; and you just want this to sit on the shelf to say you have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds like Tori's voice and piano skills have a twin!","review":"I was unsure if this even existed, but i ordered it and was quite pleased to find that it is a cd of tori covers by one artist who sounds like tori. if you're not really listening closely, youd even think you were listening to tori. and as i always say, if it looks like a tori and sounds like a tori its worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!!!!","review":"this is such a great representation of babyshambles. it is unedited and real. they are so great! this concert has a lot of libertine songs, along with some great babyshambles songs from their first album. dot allison makes an appearance. it's a lot of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recomended","review":"I bought this primarily to use for running. The sound quality was nothing to brag about with the headphones provided. However when I used my old headphones I was very impressed with the sound. The FM reception is a joke but it's good enough to use in a gym that broadcasts the TV audio through FM. My big problem is that the unit will shut down or reboot itself in the middle of a workout. At first I thought maybe the battery was low or loose but replacing it didn't help. Customer service was useless so this unit is going back. It's a shame because the unit has all the features I want for a good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Static?","review":"I received this product as a contest prize from work and immediately tore the package open and started playing with it. I had previously been using a RIO One, with no problems, and was looking forward to see how Sonic Blue's products had improved.As with the Rio One the menu's are very easy to navigate through and give such easy explanation that I didn't have to read the manual. I did the Firmware update just because. The software has been easy to use and overall I've not had any problems. Since I ride a mountain bike, the plastic case and armband keep this product from getting a 5 star rating. I'm always apprehensive about it falling out of the armband, but the mishaps I've had don't ever affect it. Also, if you turn the backlight off the static on the tuner goes away."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the price, its a good buy.","review":"With all the negative reviews, it is not all that bad. After considering all other MP3 players, I decided to get the RIO for its features. Initially I was not impress with the sound, but after changing the ear phone to PANASONIC HV297S, it sounds great. I am very please with it now. One needs to understand that digital sound is the same or similar no matter which machine it uses, the difference is on the delivering device, which is the ear phone. A good ear phone will sound good on any decent MP3 player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overpriced for the quality!!!!","review":"Bought it today, taking it back tomorrow. The FM reception is not bad, but all the static noise created when you turn the volume up or down makes this device worthless.The sound, even with higher quality headphones, is very very marginal at best.DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT. You will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really for sports","review":"I purchased this MP3 player for use on my long runs. Although I liked the size and sound quality, the limitations of this device quickly became apparent.1. It is not really designed for sports. It is not moisture proof. I am not looking to immerse the device in water, it should have been at least sweatproof.2. The device's software is not 100% stable. The software crashed on me. No hardware reset, the solution? software reset (reload firmware) - only available on the PC, not Macintosh. On the Macintosh, you can upgrade the firmware, but not reset the firmware.3. Not durable. After two weeks of use and without dropping it, one of the buttons became stuck in the pressed position. I tried to fix it, but ended up breaking the unit. So, the only time that I did drop it was in the trash.I am going to purchase a good sports FM radio and wait a year or so until a REAL sports flash MP3 hits the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR MOTORCYCLES","review":"I bought this unit to use while riding long trips on my bike. Mistake. The unit speakers do not fit into the ear canal well enough to stay in place with a helmet on. The unit itself is not very well made. The plastic case isn't very strong and a short fall from by belt to the parking lot did it in. Battery cover won't fit properly and case separated. You would expect for [this much money]something a little more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice concept poor directions/help/durability","review":"It took a few weeks of trying to understand some guy from India on the phone to figure out that their software stinks. I then used Real One to download the music. That worked good for six months. Then the on/off switch decided to go off all the time. I would recommend another company. I got my brother a newer model and he hasn't figured out why he can't download onto it yet. It keeps telling him the there is no storage. He even went to an Ivy league school!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much work","review":"My brief affair with this player lasted about a week, then we broke up. I wasn't interested in a high maintenance relationship.It all started on the download. I couldn't get the software to install properly, and the single sheet of instructions provided was NOT helpful. ...The software seemed easy enough and I enjoyed the player for a while but was constantly readjusting the ear peices to get better sound. After a trip to the gym, I knew I'd take it back as the ear peices were awful.Perhaps this player would better suit a Mac user for an easier download, and perhaps the ear plugs could be replaced, but I wasn't ready to invest anymore in this bumpy ride..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great !!","review":"I'm not sure about people that said its horrible... But this works fine. I use it to work out and lift weights.

On the plus side it has great sound and the battery life is pretty good, it also supports low bitrate files which is why I bought it.Hope my little review helps with your buying decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indestructible!","review":"I'm very pleased with my purchase. I got the Rio Sport 8 months ago and have put it through the wringer - literally. I've run 8 miles in the rain, dropped it on the sidewalk more times than I can count, brought it with me in the sauna, and finally last month I forgot to check my workout clothes and ran it through the wash. Boy was i mad at myself - I literally poured water out of the casing - but I let it dry overnight, put in a new battery, and it was as good as new. Earphones have seen better days, though, so we bought a new pair and a memory upgrade. 64 Mb is good for roughly 45 minutes of music, which was fine originally, but I find myself running longer and needing more music to run to. The upgrade is working great. Only gripe about the software is that I can't organize the songs once they're in the player. Great sound and in a neat package. Well worth the price - paid 100$ at Best Buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best mp3 player..........well almost.","review":"this mp3 player is extremely well put together. the only thing that is messed up is the radio, the radio is a complete joke, it is practically impossible to get the signal and it is always static. this mp3 player is perfact to any one that wants a cheap mp3 player that can hold alot of songs and has a stop watch an alot of other cool stuff. everything else is perfect but the radio is the thing that brought the points down. befor you buy this one, make sure you look at the red and silver one also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not what I expected","review":"The item is very nice, but it has given me a lot of trouble. The FM radio reception is terrible and the music keeps on pausing, jumping, very frequently. I contacted customer service, they said I should download a different program than the one included with the MP3 which is a hassle, it just sholdn't happen. After I downloaded the new program, the radio reception was exactly the same and even though the frequency of pauses and interruptions in the music was la lot lower, it didn't dissappear completely. It seem its not very good quality equipment, no for paying [this price]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crashes and Poor Reception","review":"The sound quality drops off when running or even walking.It dropped off so badly that very often it would stop all together (crashes).The FM reception also needs improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"All I got was the player","review":"All I got was the player.

They just stop working. Customer service is a disaster. It took me three days and conversations with three people for them to agree to replace one of my non-working players. Then, I got a call from a fourth person saying they had to charge me. Two other people didn't return my calls over two days, and in the end, it took me five days, conversations with six people, and a total of two hours to get the problem resolved, and even then, I still have to pay to get them to fix their non-working product. Avoid this company as poor product reliability combined with unhelpful time-consuming customer service is a disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Nice","review":"I recently recieved the Rio MP3 player and so far so good. The only MINOR downfalls were that the radio hardly works, but hey i didn't buy it to listen to the radio! and the earphones aren't the greatest because they start to hurt after awhile, and the case makes it kind of hard to handle the buttons and it's hard to get the MP3 player out of the case, but other than that, it's a great MP3 player for people who are buying their 1st MP3 player.Also, very very fast shipping, faster than they said it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try again Rio.","review":"This player sounds like a great deal: expandable, radio included, perfect for the gym. BUT once you get it out of the box the honeymoon is over. The buttons aren't as solid feeling as they should be. The menu isn't that great, and like many have said before the radio is a joke unless you live very close to the towers. Sound quality is ok, but the real nightmare began when I connected it to my computer (win98). I installed the driver, and the Rio music management software. But once I connected the player, it flipped from recognizing the device, to not recognizing it every 5 seconds. The help line, which is a long distance number-on hold for 40 minutes-ended up telling me that my computer was the problem. Long story short, I returned it the next day and got the Nike psa 64. It works perfectly. Guess it's not my computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, although a few flaws","review":"What I like: Compact size. MP3 sound quality is good. Add a cheap 256Mb flash card, and get many hours of music on it. Fairly rugged -- I've dropped it a number of times, and it's still working fine (cross fingers). FM radio is passable for very strong signals. Bundled ear plugs are perhaps the first that actually fit my ears, and sound half-decent (but see below).What could be improved. FM reception not great -- don't buy this for the radio. Unlike the rest of the unit, the ear plugs are not water-resistant. If you use this while working out, they will soon soak up the sweat and sound like garbage. The menu controls on the front are prone to being accidentally pressed. I wish they made them recessed and a little more fool-proof. Would prefer to directly drop files on this via Win XP, rather than forced to use their software. Some MP3's freeze the controls. The only way to recover is to power down and up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"I purchased this MP3 player as my first one and I wish I hadn't. First off, the sound quality is horrible, I hear the backup vocals better than the lead vocals. I made every adjustment possible to equalizer but it still sounded like [that]. To make matter worse, the songs would pause themselves every 3 or 4 seconds. And finally, the FM reception is really, really bad. I definately would not recomend this player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong CD, but OK.","review":"Amazon sent me this CD which was listed as a Flip Wilson CD.

The beauty of it is that one can pick it up, turn to just about any page, and find material worth re-reading. If you are interested in rockclimbing and how it developed over time, this is the book for you. My only complaint--besides the terrible binding--is that it only addresses the period ending in 1971; I wish someone would write s comparable book about Yosemite climbing in the 70s and 80s, when the standards shot through the roof. John Long's _Rock Jocks, Wall Rats, and Hang Dogs_ covers the later period, but it isn't nearly as informative, or well-written, as Roper's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy duty salsa ....","review":"Bonilla really comes along with some great salsa here....not at all in the romantic vain, frequently associated which Puerto Rican Salseros.

Great sounding shaker, especially for live applications with a full band. It's quite loud, so I wouldn't recommend it for acoustic acts. My only complaint would be that it's not indestructable. Specifically, with my first one, at a fireside jam, someone was shaking it against a metal firepit and one of the end-caps came off and the contents of the shaker went everywhere. Can't blame the shaker too much though as that's not how it was designed to be player.

This book is NOT the classic Bushido; it is a translation of the Hagakure.The Japanese martial philosophy book, Hagakure: The Way of the Samurai, by Yamamoto Tsunetomo, is NOT the same book as the equally classic Japanese martial philosophy book, Bushido: The Soul of Japan, by Inazo Nitob��.

Is an Oscar worthy interpretation of the passionate,conflictive and intense life of one of the greatest singers ever, a life marked with success but as well with tragedies,sorrows and pain.Cotillard became La Piaf herself.She brought to the screen a convinced and a high class performance which is riveting excellent critics among movie experts worldwide,considering this,one of the most sincere and brilliant roles for a leading actress in years.Worth seen movie for those who love high quality drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE","review":"This web page states the DVD has English subtitles. I received my copy and it does not have subtitles, English or any other. The DVD is very good and will be a good purchase if you speak French. I tried it on three different DVD players and they all agree, no subtitles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incoherent.","review":"This was a film in search of an editor, which it never found. I hated the format. There was no flow with the insensible going back and forth. It made her story incomprehensible to anyone who is not familiar with her biography. It is hard to imagine that even as a young woman, she moved like an arthritic spider monkey. Perhaps the director wanted us to feel as befuddled by alcohol and drugs as Edith was for much of her adult life. It detracted from the music, and left me feeling hungover. Maybe that was the point, though I'd never watch it again. I know there are many who found this film to be magnificent. But then they probably think Amy Whino-house is a genus, too. I guess I've never had enough narcotics in my system to see their brilliance. I expected to understand why she was so loved, but came away empty-handed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Product Sent!","review":"Was sent and charged for a DVD when I ordered a CD!

DON'T ORDER FROM THIS SELLER!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flashbacks!","review":"This could have been a great movie. Great acting and great cinematography. Unfortunately, the excessive use of flashbacks makes this movie choppy and confusing. It was as though the editor had just discovered flashbacks and wanted to use as many as possible. The movie was so depressing and the editing so poor that I found myself wishing that Edith would hurry up and die so that the movie would be over and I wouldn't have to see another flashback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing performance","review":"I don't always like watching movies with subtitles, but I was intrigued that the Best Actress Oscar went to a foreign film, which is highly unusual. It was worth the gamble. Marion Cotillard gives one of the most amazing performances I've ever seen. Well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant music","review":"Ok, so film is in French. The acting and the music is brilliant. Tells the story of Edith Piaf so well. I thought the acting was bang on and the music is fantastic. This is one time you need to get over fear of reading sub titles and just sit back and enjoy a lovely time watch a film that will move you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The performance is the movie","review":"I really thought I'd love this movie...but I almost gave it one star (I couldn't bear to, because of Marion Cotillard's amazing performance). My problem was that I found Piaf, as portrayed in this movie, to be completely unlikable and unsympathetic (yes, she had reasons for being like she was; no, it didn't make it more pleasant to watch). Because I found Piaf unlikeable, the movie dragged for me. In real life, would you actually want to spend 10 seconds in this person's company?"},{"rating":"2","title":"McCain dazzlement","review":"My wife and I like the singing of Edith Piaf. When the DVD of a movie about Ms. Piaf came available, we bought it.As we watched the performance, we sat in our chairs with our mouth agape. The acting is so superb as to whisk you back to Paris of the '30's with a young woman sining in the streets and dazzling her audiences.Marion Cotillard won an Academy Award for this part and I know why. She is more than spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous performance by an academy award winner","review":"To be honest I knew nothing about Edith Piaf. I wanted to watch a movie where the female lead won an academy award for her role to try and determine for myself why she won. La Vie en Rose was tremendous! I enjoyed the movie very much and agree wholeheartedly that Marion Cotillard deserved this award. I found the life of Edith Piaf to be fascinating and can understand why the French revere her so. I have recommended this movie to many of my friends and look forward to viewing it again myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Piaf through rose colored glasses","review":"La Vie en rose is a tour de force for Marion Cotillard who incarnates a vision of Edith Piaf as victim and heroine. Cotillard's performance may well become legendary for its precision and depth. My only critique is of the scenario which romantizes Piaf's life and leaves out some of the controversies which came with her rise to stardom."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing career, tragic life","review":"This is a mesmerizing biopic of a great singer's life. Cotillard so utterly transforms herself that there is no other word than astonishing: though sometimes with the flower of youth, she ages horribly with drugs, alcohol, and arthritis. The film flits from age to age, offering glimpses of her extraordinary luck and setbacks, all with the talent of her voice as constant. I was completely absorbed into her life events, Paris of both the lower and upper classes, and her career and deterioration. Totally believable with perfect casting of outstanding actors.Though I have never listened to her music, this film brought me into exactly what she had to say in her own way. The music is wonderful as is the evocation of the times.Warmly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emporer's New Clothes:La Vie's good reviews","review":"There's always this kind of film that channel's certain people's effusive praise. I think they could have written it in Irdu and people will still rave. Over what? Unremarkable singing WITHOUT subtitles for the song; so unless you know French you get uninteresting melody w/o understanding and nothing exceptional in delivery. Her eyes remind one of a sad and spaced out bulldog; the dialogue uninspired. The \\"real\\" Piaf voice is from old recordings better left untouched.The back-and-forth time-line quickly lost its welcome as its irrelevance to anything except confusing teh viewer became apparent. An \\"art film\\" one is encouraged to \\"see\\" into deeply which held nothing for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too generous!","review":"This is probaly the worst movie I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing! I was dragged to this cinematic disaster by my father, who insisted it was going to be good, this however was not true. First of all it was French (what more do I have to say). Second of all this thing (I refuse to call this a movie) has subtitles the whole movie long which was very distracting. Plus this thing kept going from past to present making it very difficult to follow. The only thing I left the theatre with was the constant grading repetition of the name \\"MARCEL!\\"DO NOT FORCE YOUR CHILDREN TO VIEW THIS MUDDLE OF A FILM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"La Vie en Rose DVD","review":"Wonderful movie. The movie has such an impact that it stays with you for days. Inspiring, sad and funny. I treasure this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR US USERS.

It can't be played by US DVD/Bluray Players. Be careful! Don't make your same mistake. It took me $9.45 with USPS fist class to send it back to Italy. eBay seems doing better on this issue.

Her parents abandoned her when she was a child. Lived with her grandmother who ran a prostition network. Had to live and sing in the streets in order to make some money. Was abused by those who wanted to take advantage of her singing talent in order to make some money. Deeply fell in love with a married man, who later died in a plane, which deeply broke her heart. Suffered from liver cancer that finally caused her death.In this movie we all really relate to Edith. We admire so much her passion for singing. We feel pity for her because of all the suffering she went through in her life. Even after she got famous and rich, she still wasn't happy.Her song \\"Non je ne regrette rien\\" reflets her life and how she feels about it.Wonderful movie. Marion Cotillard did a great job playing the role of Edith Piaf."},{"rating":"1","title":"La Vie En Rose","review":"I am glad I watched this DVD and I certainly agree with the Academy's choice of Marion Cotillard for the Best Actress award, however, I cannot say I will watch the movie again. It was too disjointed, jumping from one stage of Edith Piaf's life to another. I believe the story of this phenomenal life could have been given better treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful what you buy","review":"Be careful if you by the DVD; since the one I purchased did not play in the US.

The reality of her life is oftentimes very depressing, but supports her reason to be. Acting was suberb...enough for best actress Oscar. Music is quintessential \\" Little Sparrow\\"Paris scenes are worthwhile on their own. I have given this to Francophiles for gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now That\`s what I call A great Performance!","review":"This is a great Movie, Great Music, One of the best Performance ever Remember, I\`m sure that she\`s gonna be a winner of an Oscar and a Golden Globe, And is good to know the history of one of the greatest voices that exist in these world. Edith Piaf"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tour de force","review":"Miss Cotillard's performance is simply the finest and most astonishing that I have ever witnessed in my life. She richly deserved her Academy Award win and I eagerly look forward to the body of work that she is going to create over the coming years."},{"rating":"2","title":"La Vie en Rose","review":"This is certainly not for the fainthearted or the easily offended but it is a rewarding, if at times difficult, watch. There appears to be no sugar coating of Edith's early life on the streets and in the brothels or her later alchohol and drug abuse. However, her music soars above her tarnished private life and the acting is absolutely wonderful. I feel overall it is much more satisfying than the normal \\"sanitised\\" biographies of famous people and proves that in spite of all the mud sometimes gold can shine through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Foreign Film","review":"You will love, you will cry, you will relate. Wonderful acting with Piaf's greatest numbers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't mention the war.....,","review":"What a silly film. I think I blanked out when Piaf dies.

Barrett"},{"rating":"1","title":"Addicts Don't Amuse Me","review":"Well, you can't deny she was a great popular singer. I certainly don't. Like Billy Holiday, she possessed that special voice, that sorrowful gaze, the special loneliness that made her art very appealing. When the life story is told, however, one is asked to sympathize with her as a person, not only as a singer. For me, this was difficult. I certainly recognize her personal despair, I have compassion, but finally I found her a torment to others and began to sympathize more with them than with her. Many have an infinite patience with these types of demanding, erratic geniuses, but I don't. Thank God she found people willing to put up with her. I would have fled. The movie seemed long because I felt restless as I watched her destroy everything around her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor","review":"La Vie en Rose is one of the most unforgetable films one can view, and if you rent it from Netflix, it comes with English sub-titles. HOWEVER, since AMAZON does not advise buyers that they sell copies WITH NO ENGLISH SUB-TITLES, unless you've already seen the film, you have no idea what's being said. The buyer then has to go through additional expense returning the DVD and hopefully getting a refund.I think AMAZON should include information (no sub-titles) next to descriptions of foreign films they sell. After all, this is AMERICA, and most of us speak ENGLISH, not French."},{"rating":"1","title":"non-working DVD","review":"I actually rate this DVD (La vie en rose)0 stars, because it was severely defective!

So, They said that they will replace the unit with a Triton 300. The Triton unit is worth about $149.00 I paid over $250,00 for the Exporist 210. Plus you have to pay extra for the case, cables, Map hardware which came with the 210 unit package. The 210 unit has 22MB memory the Triton has 10MB.

In open country you can get an accuracy of about 6 feet. Even in heavily wooded areas you can get within 30 feet or so and you VERY rarely lose signal.My buddy has a Garmin etrex and a Delorme PN40 and my Magellan is more accurate than both of his units.You can mark your routes, favorite spots, whatever you want. Geocaching software is fairly good although time consuming to enter all of the info.The only drawbacks are when you find a geocache you can't delete it or mark it as found until you get home and attach the unit to your computer.The USB interface is hard to connect to the unit.And the unit is not in color or topo.Other than that the Explorist 210 is the geocachers dream.

Three years ago, when I had a problem with the Roadmate, I called technical support and the problem was resolved in 3 seconds. With the Explorist, I called technical support and the technician spoke with such a heavy Indian accent that I could not understand him and he could not understand me. After an hour or so on the phone, I gave up and called back two days later. Another technician with an equally heavy and incomprehensible Indian accent responded to my second call. I asked him if the Magellan technical support group was in India, and he laughed and said yes. (That was one of the few statements I understood.) After a long time, with lots of \\"I'm sorry, what did you say?\\" on both sides of the call, the problem was resolved, but it took forever and was extremely frustrating. I don't think I would buy another Magellan product after this experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Options Available","review":"I owned one of these and it failed after < 1 year off of extremely light use. The buttons would no longer respond unless you used a pencil to depress. As with any product there will be lemons. I only mention should this be a trend with this product. My real issue with the product is the 'awful' software. Making it work with Vista was maddening. My second complaint has to do with the menus / OS of the GPS. The interface is not intuitive and makes you not want to use. I am no GPS expert but I can say my Delorme Pn-20 is 10X the GPS of the Magellan and it includes complete topo and street maps with the cost of the device. Additionally, the pn-20 is very intuitive (basically you don't need the manual). The explorist is an older generation GPS.

The unit eats batteries like Popeye eats spinach. Even when the unit is turned off the batteries are rapidly consumed. The software is incredibly slow. Accessing track information, for example, typically requires about one minute (I've timed it several times), whereas other receivers retrieve this information almost instantly. The case with user controls is nicely designed which, unfortunately, does not compensate for the undesirable qualities of the unit. Beyond this receiver, Magellan's support is horrible. Magellan could improve its support by simply not offering it at all. That way, you wouldn't waste your time asking for help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice GPS really bad software","review":"I bought this thing and tried it, it's a really nice GPS for the price, a bit frail it seemed, otherwise OK.Good reception outside and in the car, no signal indoors however.

I installed it anyway. It would not work, it would not recognize the GPS, it would not connect...after one evening of failed attempts I decided to return it.

The holes on it don't line up with the switches on the player. The on/off switch is pathetic. The battery cover is flimsy. The overall quality is very poor. My unit split along a seam for no apparent reason and became virtually unusable after only 4 months. A mp3 player designed as a \\"sport\\" model should be more robust than that.

Love the MP3, though radio reception is poor compared to other armband radios on the market I've used. The fancy display is a waste as you can't see it on your arm. Controls are not as good as the Nike. But, I went through 3 Nike's rather quickly - they didn't take to running and sweat so well. I use an armband 2 hours daily for running / exercise. The Rio headphones wire broke quick and I replaced it with a good set of waterproof kind. In July the MP# player started pausing by itself or dropping to the menu or even off. Rio customer assistance told me to update the firmware which I did - to no avail. Guess I'm out of luck again. Will someone please make a quality armband mp3/radio for running!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little Mp3 player","review":"This is my first Mp3 player that I've owned, and works better than expected.

I will not bore you with the details of my experiences, but I will tell you that I have reported them to the BBB, and have taken the time to write this review, in other words it is that bad.

Got this as an xmas gift from my husband (I recommended this specific player) and boy was it a mistake! It worked for about 1 week (5 hours of play) and stopped ('USB Connected' screen wouldn't go away) - reloaded the firmware as the website suggests. Worked for a week and went back to the same problem. Tried replacing the battery - again worked for about 4 days. Now even replacing batteries doesn't help. I have an email to their customer support, but from what I've read in these other reviews, I'm probably not going to be too successful. I can only guess from reading the incredibly mixed reviews for this product that when you buy it, it's basically a crap shoot. Hope that if you do buy it, you'll end up being one of the people giving this product 5 stars!

She had a new one shipped out to me after I sent in their faulty product at my own expense.Their customer service correspondance was largely ineffectual and very time-consuming. The entire process took me about half a year to complete, so you can imagine I was quite dismayed when the REPLACEMENT PLAYER I received ALSO CRASHED in the same manner, not two weeks after I received it.This was my worse internet shopping experience to date, and I warn you against dealing with this company and its products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heed the support warnings, PLEASE!!","review":"The folks here who are warning you about RIO support are dead on - I had the same experience.

These folks DO NOT stand behind their product, beyond 90 days at least.Check RIO's their web site for their warranty information - their warranties only go to 90 days from proof of purchase. I don't know about you, but when I lay out cash like this I expect more. Don't waste your money here.

I love it, but I don't like to take it running, too heavy, and if I drop it, oh no! So I bought this hunk of red plastic. It is definitely lightweight. But the buttons activate at the slightest touch, on a Windows machine it randomly connects via the USB cable or doesn't. It *DOES* work with iTunes, but only if you convert your songs to MP3 or WMA (which you cannot do with purchased music - protected AAC). The little carry case that comes with it *SEEMS* like a good idea. However, it's nearly impossible to remove it (I am afraid of tearing the player in half doing so), and it's so poorly desgined that I can't really push the buttons while it's in the case. AND, if I don't use the case, the battery/storage cover keeps falling off. Don't waste your money. If you can afford the iPod mini - go for it. Otherwise look elsewhere for your lightweight and compact sport digital music player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What You Want","review":"I have had nothing but trouble with my Rio Sport. First of all the internal memeory dosent really hold that many songs. You might get 33 songs on it and it will be full. I purchased another 128MB stick and that lets me get another 33 songs on it.I have gone through one battery after another it just eats them up. The power button has had a mind of its own and doesn't want to turn on sometimes and other times wont shut off. Then the internal memory just wont play on mine. I have 33 songs on it and it can only find the songs that I have on my memory stick and when I connect it to the software it shows full but no songs on there to delete. So I have an internal memory that is useless.Get a player that costs more and holds more songs because after you get the memory stick to add you will end up spending more and still end up with less music. The headphones that come with it are also worthless and uncomfortable so you will buy new ones of those also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radio is useless","review":"The Mp3's play ok, but I found that the backlight actually produces a buzzing noise with the radio. So when you are switching stations, the backlight comes on and you hear a high pitch buzzing sound until the light goes off. I guess that doesn't matter much since the RADIO DOESN'T PICK UP A SINGLE STATION unless you are stading outside in line of sight to a FM radio station antenna.The radio is totally useless in my gym. It won't even pick up the FM broadcast for the TV's in my gym. I'm seling mine.

It still worked a little, but i counldnt get the battery out because it was jammed. When the battery ran out, I decided to call Rio.After three phone calls and waiting on hold forever, I finally got through. After an hour of explaining what happened, they finally told me to mail my player back for a replacement. I did, and one month later I received a 64MB MP3 player instead of the 128MB MP3 player I had sent in and paid for. I needed it for jogging, though, so I decided to keep it.

While others claimed to be compatable, this one was far beyond the rest. I had problems deleting programs from the other two, but with this one it was so easy!! It comes with a itunes CD to upload the program if it is not already on your Mac. You can also download itunes on mac.com for PC's or Mac. This program makes it simple, you simply drag the files into the rio folder that pops up and then arrange them. If you want to delete songs, you click on it and hit delete. That simple. The screen is great, it illuminates vibrant blue and scrolls the song and artist, along with the album. The earphones are alright, the sound is decent, and the size and weight is awesome, it is so small and light and super durable. It also comes with a great belt clip and armband. For around 100 bucks this is a great deal, esspecially if you have a Mac."},{"rating":"2","title":"My husband says buy this!","review":"I bought the S35S for my husband, a runner. He tells everyone he knows that this is the best gift he has ever received, but he's easy!!! It comes with 128 MB but can be upgraded to 512 MB with a firmware download from the sonicblue.com site. I bought an extra 256MB for $ so just keep looking for good buys. The radio reception is the only drawback, but chances are you aren't buying this for the radio! Songs are very easy to download, the sound is terrific, the menu lists the song, artist and time of the song you are listening to and the random play makes it even better. It's light enough to stay clipped to his nylon running shorts and he hasn't had any problems with the clip as other reviewers mention. We take it with us everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"I ordered this MP3 player a little over two weeks ago - and I am returning it today. I am an Industrial Engineer and my roommate is an Industrial Designer - and both of us agree that the plastic case that holds this player is one of the worst designs we have ever seen. I literally pulled off a fingernail trying to seperate the case from the player, not to mention that the buttons on the top of the player don't line up with the cutouts of the case, or that you can't dock with the USB cable unless you remove the player. I previously had an Apple IPod, but traded it for an MP3 player I could \\"go running with.\\" Big mistake - I will definitely do my homework next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better choices","review":"As my third MP3 player, I chose carefully, looking for excellent features on my runs. Unfortunately, I chose poorly. The clip broke quickly, making the poor-fitting case a moot point. Rio will not replace the case or the clip and you cannot buy a replacement. The capacity is excellent with the option of adding more memory a real plus. Battery life was reasonable. Sadly, the played completely stopped working after a few months. In a world where many companies have difficult customer relations, Rio stands out from the crowd in being particularly unhelpful. Though this player had promise, there are better choices.

They sound good and the software is easy to use.However - I would not buy this item again. The supplied sleeve to carry the player on your belt or in the supplied arm strap is not cut properly to access the buttons properly. The arm strap is not well designed to hold the player - the player will actually flip out with repeated arm movements(runners beware). Then, God forbid you drop the thing at all it will fall apart. It is not durable and the design creates situations where it will fall. I've had mine less than 6 months and have not used it very much. After it popped out of it's strap a couple of times, the unit began to separate at it's seem. There is no way for a consumer to attempt to put it back together properly. Too bad.

I'm listening to it in the gym and can hear outside noise even with volume at full on this thing. The plastic case that holds it does not fit the player. That means that the buttons on the thing are barely accesable. The radio part of it is garbage and can't really be used. It's like tuning into a distant AM station.

The installation software is easy to use, as is the music transfer program. The player itself is small and sleek, while the backlight is a fluorescent blue that makes me feel like this was a Christmas gift from Spock.

It holds anywhere from 15-22 songs, which is fine for me. I use a Mac, and I can't complain about how simple it is to get songs on and off with ease through iTunes.The first thing I noticed when I got this out of the package was how cheap it felt. Compared to my friends Nike player by Phillips, this seemed light and plasticy, rather than rubbery and solid. Whatever, it worked so who cares. Anyway, now four months later, it shuts off on me once and a while, and I have to give it a smack to start it up again. It could be because it has fallen once or twice while running, but as a \\"sport\\" model, it should be designed for a little jarring here and there. Anyway, I can sense this baby is on its last legs, so I'll be in the market for a new one - not another Rio! ..., they should build something a little more solid and it should last longer than 4 months!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised sound quality.","review":"Pleasantly surprised with the sound quality in such a small and light device. Earbuds just so so. (Use my own superior earbuds, so it's okay.) The FM tuner reception is not that good, that's why the four stars. Bought this manufacturer-refurbished for about $50. Spend an additional $27 for an SD 512 mb flash memory(512 mb works in the external memory slot!). The software works well with my Windows XP/Windows Media 10. For less than $80 I get 640 mb of total memory, more than enough for what I need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product AND company","review":"A friend of mine and I both bought this product. The radio does not work and the headphones slip out of your ears if you happen to sweat when you workout. My friend and I both use ours for running Once it started to rain and mine got wet and it started jumping from song to song and then just shut down. After it dried out it worked again but just recently I was running and it just died again.This time it keeps looking for the USB port and I cannot change the display or get it to work at all.My friends display is broken and it now looks like a creased line through the middle. She can no longer view the menu. She is in the process of working with customer service and it has been a total nightmare. She called and got an RMA number and sent it in with the RMA number. One week later she received it back in the mail with a note that she needs an RMA number!!This product only seems to last about 6 months and is definitely not for anyone active!

She suggested I use a friends computer to upload the new firmware and music. Yeah that is a great idea. How can they market this as new technology if it doesn't even support USB 2.0.

The online support said to fix this: download the latest firmware (ok, did that), and if it still 'locks up', reset the player by turning it off, taking the battery out, putting the battery back in, and turnin it back on! ARE YOU KIDDING ME! Real technical solution. Well I had to do that every time I wanted to skip songs or change volume. Then it just quit powering on all together!I plan on getting another brand of MP3 player around 128MB built in with expandability or a Mini Disk player. Taking it back to Best Buy!

One of H.A.D.'s greatest attributes is its uniqueness. What other band can pull off having all four members sing lead vocals (even the drummer!) on at least one track? I'd like to compare them to another band, but I can't. The songs are witty, irreverant, serious, and ultimately, smile-inducing. Their music style varies so much, they can't be lumped into any one category. I'd just classify them as \\"amazing\\".

Even his own wife said he looked silly in his underwear and hit him on the head. But the children he hated helped him pull up his pants and held them up with chewing gum. From then on, he was nice to children. What? I found that a little inappropriate.

The light, airy melodies that he has the ability to create cause havoc... in a good way.... with the two and three hundred bpm breaks....Not counting the sung 'Milkman' song, which is tortured for its own devices.... (which after you've gotten this album you'll learn) listening to this album is like watching an overwhelmingly brilliant man play games with you, the listener. Slidewhistles, kazoos and chimes. Hmm.

It's a daily devotional to take you through a year, and each day's message is precious.I haven't read all of the devotions yet, but I am looking forward to using this during my own daily devotions. Her words are full of grace and truth, as she points your mind to Scripture and your heart to heaven. She concludes each short devotional with a prayer that has put my heart's cry succinctly and eloquently. I love the verses she's chosen to write each devotional around as well - they speak to real life.All that to say, this is a beautiful book. I look forward to reading the rest of it, and I would encourage you to enjoy it as well!(I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding devotional","review":"Another great spot-on book by Kay Arthur.

I have gone back and bought several more to gift others with. It is a real treasure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Feels good in your hands!","review":"This is the type of book I love to hold in my hands. It is of smaller size, a hardcover, pleasing colors to the eye, plus has a ribbon book mark to hold your place.I at times find myself lacking time to be in the Word of God...devotionals such as this one helps me get through such times. Giving me bits and pieces of the Word to hold me off until I can get my Bible out.Kay Arthur is known as one of America's best-known Bible teachers. Along with her husband, Jack, she is the co-CEO and cofounder of Precept Ministries International. She has authored more than 120 books and inductive studies.This devotional has been adapted from one of her best-selling Lord series titled As Silver Refined.I received this book for free from the publisher through the Waterbrook Multnomah book review program in exchange for a book review.

As many have suggested, Jimmy Little has just enhanced and given new life to some already excellent work. Recently inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Hall of Fame, Jimmy's voice is the most soothing and comforting sound you are ever likely to experience.

We have a 6 & 7 year old and thought they might possibly be too old to enjoy the CD. I played it in the morning to get them motivated to get ready for school and it worked! They both drifted in the room when \\"You Gotta Eat Your Fruits\\" came on and were quite energized! They have since listened to the entire CD several times and love it. I hesitate to mention our favorite songs because they are all equally \\"perfect\\"!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the Beastie Boys!","review":"This DVD was awesome!

But even if you don't care for the music, Beastie Boys DVD Anthology - Criterion Collection is a must see for any DVD fan. There are enough video angles, song remixes and audio commentary tracks (which is the most disappointing aspect of this release...it is basically the guys sayin' silly things) to keep you busy for at least a month. The song remixes and a cappella versions are especially fun to listen to. I've had the DVD since Christmas and haven't even come close to seeing the entire thing! Much love to MCA for putting such special care into this DVD. It's fabulous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like MTV vids and remix beats...","review":"Basically you get a good selection of videos that you could have seen in from 1989 to 1998 or so on MTV or VH1. There's other goofy camera things to look at while you listen to the same songs. Then you can listen to the same songs over and over again with a different beat. It's 2 discs and each disc runs normally about 30 minutes a piece. I guess it's worth the money if that's what you want but it's kind of boring after watching it once. I think the original beats with the original videos are the most entertaining. When I bought it I thought it would be longer or just better because of all the hyped up talk on here about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the Licensed To Ill Songs?","review":"There is absolutely no reason for leaving \\"Fight For Your Right\\", \\"No Sleep Till Brooklyn\\", \\"Brass Monkey\\" or other BB hits off this. What's next? A Prince anthology with nothing off \\"Purple Rain\\"? A Madonna boxset that leaves out \\"Like A Virgin\\"? Paul McCartney renouncing \\"Yesterday\\"?Criterion does movie releases so well (OK they had to re-release \\"Charade\\" because the first version wasn't anamorphic) that one has to wonder what the heck happened here. It's insane to think someone actually approved the final version of this product - who cares about 45 different versions of \\"Shadrach\\" if the LTI songs are MIA? Get Solid Gold Hits instead - that CD/DVD set has the stuff that made the Beasties famous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice to have the videos available, but extravagent","review":"Their music is great, the videos aren't the most amazing thing I've ever seen. I listen to the b-boys quite a bit, but I don't find a video dvd to have much replay value."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Moustache on the Mona Lisa","review":"In my opinion, these DVDs were ruined by the decision to censor their lyrics. While I don't need to hear every f**k and s**t, the generally poor methods of editing them out completely disrupt the flow of the music. Shame on Criterion and the Beastie Boys for choosing market share over freedom of expression."},{"rating":"2","title":"so close!","review":"This collection would have been perfect...had it not been censored. The use of \\"vulgar\\" language in the BBoys is sparse to begin with, but where it does occur, i would like to hear it. There should be a separate uncensored release, or one with choice of censored or uncensored versions of the songs. Otherwise this collection is sonically and visually superb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing DVD loaded with features","review":"If you are just getting a DVD player for Christmas, it would be both good and bad to get this as one of your first DVD's; good because it's got so many extra goodies on it, like multiple camera angles, audio tracks, remixes, and so-forth, it is a great way to see first-hand what the DVD medium is capable of and what your new DVD player can do; bad because it raises the bar so high that you'll wish every DVD that was released was as carefully and lovingly put together as this one, and sadly, that's just not the case.Leave it to the Beastie Boys, pioneers in hip hop (\\"Paul's Boutique\\" still sounds years ahead of it's time), pioneers in video, and now pioneers in DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"Great sound and video quality, amost every all yoy need for the perfect collection of beastie video, my only \\"down\\" was the exclution of geanial videos like jimmy james, time for living, root down (live in tibetean freedom concert\\", so wacha want (assassings mix).I expect a re-edition with the new videos and \\"all\\" of the videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why?","review":"This dvd kick's butt!!! there alot are of bonus feature's to keep you entertained for hours. the reason I gave it a 4 out of five is because for some reason they left out the video's from the liscence to ill cd.

The sound quality was really good but it got progressivly worse as the unit ran. After three songs it was fuzzy and unbearable.

The software supplied by Sonic Blue is amazingly bad, klunky, and amatuerish.1) You cannot sample the middle of a song from your library that you are considering moving to the device - you can only start from the begining.2) the interface is klugy - you have to move your mouse from one end of the screen to the other ALL the time.3) Large libraries are re-read by the software every time you move up in the directory hierarchy. That means that after I've selected file 'X' for transfer and move out of that album directory, the software has to re-catalog all 400 albums in my library, and I start again at the top of the list in the 'A' section - and thus have to scroll back down every time.4) I could go on and on, but I'll just pray I can find better software!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!

It holds 2 hours of music but I quickly added a 128MB MMC card to put 4+ hours on it. The controls are easy to get to even while in the case. The clip is strong. It is light-weight. Being solid state, it is skip-proof.The only negatives are the earphones and the fact that as of this date they have not gotten their software certified to run with Windows XP so it could, possibly, crash your operating system. Without the certification uncertainty, I would have given this product 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"An mp3 player that delivers","review":"This mp3 player gives you everything that you need. The controls and menu system were well thought out and easy to use. The music manager software is easy to use and I did not have any problems connecting to the device. (Win 2k, 512MB) Battery life is excellent at @ 20+ hrs on a single AA battery! It comes with a rechargable battery but I have not used it yet. I'd rather just use the standard batteries and not get caught needing to recharge the battery. The headphones are good, but definitely upgrade if you are wanting to get a higher quality sound. The FM tuner works great and I get a clear reception. This is my first mp3 player and I am not disappointed. After spending hours upon hours of reading reviews and looking at prices, I am glad that I made this purchase and I would highly recommend this mp3 player to anyone. You may want to consider buying the additional memory card if you want lots of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific thriller for middle school girls","review":"This is a terrific thriller, especially for middle school girls.

Now I have a much better understanding of propane, electrical, and water system, etc. It offers all the basic information to do your repairs. Provided a minimal general mechanic knowledge the book does the job. The only shadow is the number of sketch and plans is a bit low and information is not specific to any RV model. It is a general book, so I do not think we should expect such detail for each vehicule model. It does not offer step by step description of repairs, so you have to know a bit. On the other hand I will keep the book in my RV for all repair. This is a recommended book for every RV owner book. It could be quite useful to fully understand what the RV repairman had done/is doing/will do to your vehicule."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is There an Editor in the House?","review":"Overwritten, confusing, and sloppily edited. Full of misspellings, omitted or duplicated words. RV owners are often confronted with an incomplete, generic owner's manual, which contradicts the separate component manuals to which it refers the owner. I was hoping this book would serve as a quick-start introduction to understanding and maintaining my diesel pusher motorhome, and make it easier to wade through these manuals. No such luck. Yes, the information is there, but the presentation is so amateurish that the book loses credibility. If you don't believe me, read the first sentence of the chapter on RV electrical systems. It's rare that an author can be redundant and contradictory at the same time, but Mr. Bunzer achieved it. I received this book as a gift, and it's still annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE--Not Original Recordings","review":"Just another time I've gotten burned.

Is it as disappointing as the Amazon review? I don't believe so. I find it a notch below Black Elvis, and a couple below Dr. Dooom. The production is much closer to Dooom, however.Credit must be given for \\"I Don't Believe You.\\" But, this album seems to folow Keith's \\"I'm gonna put out an album every couple a weeks just like No Limit\\" mantra, and seems to suffer accordingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kool Keith does it again","review":"You have to be a Kool Keith fan to like this one.

It is amazingly disapointing, not only does it feature the played out word mother... over 700 times it also appers to be a hate cd aimed at some fake rapper. Kool keith shouldn't worry that his styles get bitten he should just do the best he can and take his game to the next level. Of which this cd is not.

No","review":"I was very afraid to hear this album, since Black Elvis is not really what every Kool Keith fan would want again. I like this album better then Dr. Dooom, but not as good as Sex Style and Dr. Octagon. If you are a die hard fan like me, you definately like this album. Ok, the beats ain't as great as it was some time ago, but his lyrics are still the best (from east to west :-)) He curses more in the first track then on all the previous albums together and it seems that he is more mad at some rappers then before. That is what this album is about I guess. Dissing all the wack rappers, who shouldn't be famous.To all the real fans, buy it, IT IS WORTH YOUR MONEY!Greetz, Geoffrey"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keith, What are you doing?","review":"First of all, I write this review as a HUGE Kool Keith fan. I own every one of his solo albums, and almost every collaboration he has worked on. THIS ALBUM IS AWFUL. Keith shows none of his trademark originality and style. The albums sounds like a bitter, drunken ramble about how much he hates other rappers and music execs. His rhymes are weak, and some of the choruses are almost painful to listen to. The beats sound like they were made on a child's beat box toy, and Keith's constant whining gets old FAST. What a disappointment. Keith's best work to date: a tie between Black Elvis and Masters of Illusion, with runners-up nod to Doc Oc. Spare yourself the headache and check one of those out instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"I am one of the biggest Kool Keith fans around. But for one reason or another this album didn't move me. Nor was I feelin much of it except the track, \\"I don't believe you\\".

Have no fear thou.....if ya aint got Keith's latest release MASTERS OF ILLUSION I suggest you get it! a underground classiac. Im tired of all those dre and puff-daddy #!$@ -riders.

This album should make you laugh and think at the same time.

The only problem is that everytime you restart your PDA, it needs to be reset (the GPS connection) needs to be reset thru the tools->GPS options->Auto detect.Its a 5min process, but it works great after that.I would say, if you have the patience, its not a bad product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tortured gem","review":"David Torn was an odd fit on the winham hill label.

I bought with the townhouse shower curtain hooks and it looks really great. The pictures do not do it justice AT ALL but neither does seeing it in the package in person.

The memory is only 64 mb and it held about only 14 songs for me so I bought a 128 mb card. Then one day I turned it on and it said upgrader on it. Sometimes I'd have to bang it to get it to start working again like I think some other lady said on another review. It sounds like there is a spring loose inside. I tried to update the firmware but it doesn't work. Well anyways, for the first almost year I had been using this, it has been working fine but now I can't even get it to play my songs. I would suggest getting the Rio Karma or another brand of mp3 player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good player ...","review":"This is a great little player for [for the price].

I mean, sure, 64 megs of memory isn't huge, but it still holds a suffient amount of music (about an hour). The sound is clear and the battery life is fantastic (about 20 hours). As for MP3 players like the iPod...ok, if you feel like transfering 400 CDs onto one device, thats the one to use. but if you dont have 500$ or 400 CDs, this the Rio is the one for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but alot of technical difficulties","review":"I like this little thing but the play button went wack and turned into the fast forward button so i had to pop the plastic button thing out and touch the sensors it looks so weird. When i bought it i thought that 64mg would be enough memory but it wasnt i always had to delete my songs all the time just to get another song on it. But i love the software that comes with it, its so easy to use, but i reccomend that you bye something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"memory's a joke -- don't believe the hype","review":"I'm a realy beginner with this stuff, so I bought this one, because it was cheap, or, \\"affordable.\\" I thought seventy bucks was worth, as the package states, \\"2 hours'\\" worth of music. Well, this thing holds at best, an hour's worth, and that's if you save your files as WMA, not MP3, which are a lot bigger. It doesn't seem to recognize WAV files, only mp3s and WAM. So if you only have mp3s in your computer, you'll be lucky enough to fit eight or nine of them on here, which is certainly not two hours of music.I think it's a waste -- who the hecks wants to carry around ten songs around all day for seventy bucks, that's what cd players are for! -- and I'm going to sell this thing on ebay for as much as I can get and buy the ipod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap MP3 player=Bad Qulaity","review":"I was very excited when I opened the box only to be severely disapointed. The player, which comes with useless software, has only enough memory for about ten songs. The headphones broke about a week after the box had been opened.

It took me about ten minutes to load the software, read the manual, and understand how to load the music and manipulate the display. Like everyone else has said the earphones that come with it suck and they hurt but if you use sony earphones the sound is incredible. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good for what it is","review":"I got this as a gift for Christmas, and with just a little fussing, it was up and running with all the proper software installed in less than an hour, tops. I use a G4 Mac, and already had a few hundred songs loaded from my CDs into my computer, so choosing the 10-20 songs permitted memory-wise was my biggest problem. The sound is good, the weight is feather-like, and it's the size of a small cigarette pack (not the king size). No. it's not an iPod, but it's a helluva lot cheaper. I go to work, empty the Rio, refill it and listen to different songs on the way home. Get home, refill it with different songs for my commute to work. Not bad. My biggest complaint is trying to track down the memory expansion... The instructions are very vague about installing or even locating what kind of MMC I need... Otherwise, this is pretty good and reasonably priced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design!","review":"My first MP3 player and I'm glad I got it free because I would have returned it. My biggest complaint is the power on/off button. The switch is recessed and it takes quite a bit of effort to turn the unit on and off. Long finger nails would help here. Also there is not an easy way to search/organize songs that I know of. Bookmarks don't really help. So if you plan to add additional memory, finding a song could prove to be a frustrating experience. On the good side, iTunes4 recognizes both the internal memory and the expanded 256MB SD memory after the firmware upgrade. Download speed is decent with USB. The included padded case is useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"no customer support","review":"I bought a RIO600. It never worked. I have been trying to resolve this problem for two months. ABSOLUTELY NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT!!! BUYER BEWARE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"Instead of being a fascinating account of a crucial period in the history of the Christians and Druzes in Mount Lebanon and Syria, the book appears to be an obvious attempt at demonizing the victims and justifying the massacres. It is disappointing that so much bias was camouflaged as an objective interpretation of historical events. On several occasions, the book gives the impression that the author's interpretations of events constitute the ultimate truth. At times, this is done without taking into consideration even the interpretations of the people whom the book uses as references. The only beneficial part of the book is the extensive bibliography, otherwise very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rich in trivial details ,the book lacks depth on Lebanon","review":"The research is thorough, but the reader is lost in trivial details. There is an effort by the author to clarify the ottoman role in the massacre. This comes across as a feeble apologist stand. In some chapters the book reads like a newspaper article."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs of the Humpback Whale","review":"This book was written in 1992 and was reissued after the author had other successful books. I found the book to be confusing, trite, thin story line, and mostly predictable. I can see why the book didn't sell well when it was first written. The story is about a man whose whole life is the study of humpback whales while ignoring his wife and daughter. His wife and daughter leave him and drive across the country to stay with a brother. The story relates the sad childhood of the wife and her brother. While away the wife falls in love with an apple farmer, the daughter falls in love with the farmer's helper, and the husband finds them with the brother. Daughter's boyfriend falls and dies and a sad ending for all. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I had read the reviews before I bought the book","review":"I usually enjoy Jodi's books so much that I picked this one up without reading any reviews. That was a big mistake. I could not even finish it. It is very hard to really like any of the characters. It is written in a mixed up way. One chapter someone dies and in the next chapter that person is alive. I tried to find out what the impact was, but I had to give up. I just did not care enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok...","review":"Its an ok book. Definitely not for everyone. Can be very boring at times. Took me a long time to get through.

It jumped around too much for me (in time and from character to character perspectives). I also did not like Jane or Oliver, the main characters, I don't know why exactly, but I just did not. I loved her daughter, brother, and everyone else. That being said, it did keep me reading until the end of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful characterizations; sad and hopeless story","review":"I have very mixed feelings about this book. On the positive side, Jodi Picoult writes with such brilliant imagery. Her descriptions of the scenery and towns Jane and Rebecca drove through on there cross-country journey were so vivid and enthralling, especially the Grand Canyon scenes. On the other hand, while presenting the story in five voices is unique and gives an interesting prospective, I found this particular presentating confusing to follow. Many of Rebecca's chapters were written in reverse, so she was a few days ahead of everyone else. As well, there was a lot of repetition as each character told the same story from their viewpoint. My main issue with this story is that the issues weren't resolved in the end, and all the characters seemed to be worse off than when the story began. So the journey was pointless, and it left a trail of destruction, including a senseless tragedy, behind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I rarely write reviews for books, but I felt compelled to write a review for this book, as it was so disappointing. I have only read one other book by Jodi (The Pact) which I thoroughly enjoyed. However, the same cannot be said for this book, in fact I felt cheated for even reading the book. I felt the style of the book, in that five characters told the story, contributed to a lack of depth in the characters. Consequently, I cared little for any of the characters and ended up skipping any chapter written by Oliver. Rebecca was the most interesting character and I actually felt some emotion during her story. The other characters and story lines were wooden and I was not at all engaged by the main characters pilgramage or emotional awakening. In summary, a very disappointing story, lacking depth and emotion and the style of the \\"five voices\\" provided a disjointed read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am afraid this book did not appeal to me at all and I did not read more","review":"I am afraid this book did not appeal to me and I only read the first few chapters before I put it aside.

I had also read a couple of her other books, which I found tedious, but this one I am only reading to the end, because I refuse to lay any book aside without finishing it.I read fiction strictly for relaxation and recreation, and this book fails me in both areas. I don't mind a moderate amount of \\"flash back\\" but this book has the reader flipping as if on a trampoline.....many times not knowing who the characters are or WHERE they are. I would be hard put at any given time to recite the basic story line to someone.I never thought I would \\"pan\\" a book, but I'm afraid I just have :-( I have an author friend, who says she welcomes bad reviews as well as good ones, so I hope Ms Picoult feels the same.Charlie Hall, editor of Just a Word"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expect from Jodi Picoult","review":"I expected a lot from this book as I have read several other books by Jodi Picoult but I was disappointed. It took me a long time to get interested in the characters and then, once I did, I didn't like many of them very much. I struggled to even finish reading it once I realized how it would inevitably end. Definitely not my favorite novel of Picoult's, who I actually admire very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't grab me","review":"This book failed to grab me and I couldn't finish it. The premise of the different view points was interesting, but I din't hear distinct styles for all these protagonists, it was like they all spoke with one voice.

I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs of the Humpback Whale","review":"If this was the first Jodi Picoult book that I read, I would never read another. That being said, I found that this book could not keep my interest. I am thankful to my younger sister for recommending Salem Falls and Plain Truth for me to read. She had told me that she had found a wonderful new author for me to try. I am glad I listened to her. I am also glad that I read this book, for it made me appreciate the growth of a very special author.

I thought the story sounded interesting and the idea of the five perspectives was interesting to me...well, I couldn't even finish this book. I usually become very involved in the stories I'm reading and often read late into the night and this book did NOTHING for me...it was work to get through a few chapters at a time. As I said before, I thought the idea of the following the different characters from chapter to chapter would be interesting...and it wasn't. It made the book very choppy and hard to follow...especially considering that the girl's story was written from the end to the beginning. Because of the lack of flow, I found myself completely disconnected from all the characters and I really didn't care about what happened to any of them...which is why I didn't finish the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT STORY","review":"Picoult is one of my favorite authors. This is her first book.

While I appreciate eclectic styles, I still found the mix of country, skiffle, bluegrass,jigs,blues and reels a rather jarring listen.

Since Magix is based in Germany, don't expect tech support... but, if you show patience, you will be rewarded with a stupendous software suite. From video enhancement to sixteen mixing tracks, this is literally like owning a production house. Magix is the company to watch, offering everything Ulead and Abode is selling at a mere fraction of the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Tech issues","review":"One of the best editing programs but BEWARE if you plan on making home movies over 20 min. you will more than likely run into crashes...I have used this program on two computers, one is a $3000 machine with a 4400 processor...still crashes."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for the price!","review":"I have tried them all almost, ulead, pinnacle,sony vegas, but for some reason i keep coming back to magix. Its easy to use it you have the time gives you more then enough effects has both storyboard and timeline view, and is super cheap! The only thing is that if you have an AMD cpu like me you need to download a patch from there web page and it can be hard to find. other wise its pretty solid and rarely crashes. For the price its a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for beginners, but NOT worth the trouble in the long run","review":"I bought this for my Youtube channell, at first it was okay, but installing it was a major pain in the ass. rendering with it freezes your PC 90% of the time, and when it's not frozen, you'll be compleatly unable to look at your desktop. Rendering in SD is about all it can do, because understanding the book they send with it is mostly for the music program. All in all. it's okay-ish for beginners, or people who dont mind the verous problems. but if your serous about this hobby, job whatever. Get a better program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stat away from this product.","review":"Try using the editor under Windows XP OS. I had to reinstall Movie Editor Pro 10 three times. After the thrid time I took the software off my system."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like a toy","review":"While this is good for a quick pickup of crumbs, anything larger is not going to be picked up. I use it on my hardwood floors and on a couple of floor mats. It does not pick up lint on the floor mats very well. It's very flimsy, so I don't expect it to last long. The cord wrap doesn't really hold well (the cord just falls off). You will need an old toothbrush to clean the filter, but it's not hard to do. I wanted a small vacuum with a cord, not battery operated and they are not easy to find. By the way, the cord is pretty small (I had to add an extension cord). So I'm still looking for the ideal small vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good vac for quick pickup-deserves 4 stars","review":"This is a complete revision of an earlier review in which I complained about noise and hard-to-access dust cup - would now give it 4 stars but apparently am not allowed to change my initial rating during an \\"edit\\". Once I learned to press the release completely, I find the dust cup easy to access. It does a good job of picking up cat hairs and bits/pieces from the carpet surface and hardwood; the dust cup holds a much larger quantity than I would have expected from a vacuum this size. So lightweight - easy to grab out of a closet and give the house a once over. Would have given it 5 stars if it were not so noisy - I use earplugs when running it. People who seem to expect this vacuum to substitute for a full-size on carpet aren't being reasonable - this one does a great job for what it is intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product for Dog Hair and Hardwoods","review":"Very light, long cord, and plenty of power to pick up dog hair and other light items. This is not for someone who wants a full fledged vacuum. My only complaint is that it's made of cheap plastic and will most likely crack/break if dropped."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars at best","review":"It will pick up animal hair off wood floors. Has no effect on carpet, whatsoever. Has all the power of a $10 drugstore dust vacuum. Way underpowered.Product, not much. Amazon was as always, excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"Bought this for kitchen crumbs. Had to sweep after every use. Clogged terribly. My son used to clean a studio apartment with brand new carpet and had to unclog the thing multiple times (the carpet wasn't 8ft x 8ft). We ended up using a dust buster on the carpet with better results. It was delegated to the trash within a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few more feet on the power cord and it would be 5 stars!","review":"This is an awesome product. It's very powerful yet very lightweight. I have a 4 year old and he can vacuum his own room now! My ONLY gripe is that the cord is shorter than I would like it to be but that is easily fixed with an extension cord. I own a house cleaning service and I have used it on every type of floor you could name. It isn't something I would recommend for a carpet that needs a thorough deep clean, but it is ideal for routine cleans, spot cleaning and especially hard surface floors that don't require the kind of suction that a carpet might. The handle retracts and the floor attachment comes off and you've got a hand held vac that works great under couch cushions and removes those nasty little dead bugs from windowsills and tracks. I will be purchasing several more for my business. Love it! Love it! Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Regretting this purchase","review":"I really, really wanted to like this product. It does have some great features, but the fact is that it doesn't pick much up, and I don't really need a vacuum that doesn't vacuum. It did actually pick up dog hair quite well, which was nice; however, it left most everything else. I'd end up sweeping after I vacuumed, since I never have ONLY dog hair on the floor. I know this isn't a regular vacuum--I have one of those--I got this for quick clean-ups, and it just doesn't cut it. I've since bought a more powerful stick in the $55-$60 range, and it's such a pleasure to have it accomplish what I bought it for! Learned the hard way on this one...you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy!","review":"I guess this works alright, but it is so incredibly noisy that I turn it off before the job is done. I would not recommend it for those with sensitive ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"so glad I found this vacuum","review":"After returning a worthless Bissell Featherweight stick vacuum, I purchased this Eureka and couldn't be happier. I use it to pick up cat hair and litter from hardwood floors and area rugs -- it works great. It has a surprising amount of suction, easily converts to a hand vac, is very lightweight, and has a collapsible handle to take up less storage space. The cord is a bit short but that is easily remedied with an extension cord. It is much quicker and easier to use this stick vac than to drag out my 21-lb Dyson and lug it around the house.I recommend this Eureka highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it says extremely well.","review":"This is a great product for quick clean-ups. It performs very well on all surfaces picking up any loose debris. Very lightweight and easy to maneuver. Also, the dust cup is pretty easy to remove. I would recommend this product. The only thing that has been an issue is the short electrical cord. It is only about 15 feet, and is not retractable. So you will need an extension cord or you will be plugging in to multiple outlets to complete a larger job. Overall though, I would buy it again. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never even got to use IT!","review":"I got this vacuum today and put it together and i couldnt even use it because where you open to take the dust cup out and empty it wouldNOT STAY CLOSED so without it closed you cant vacuum.I didnt know buying a NEW vacuum i would have to use duct tape to keep it together! NOT HAPPY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot recommend","review":"I was so hoping this would be 'the one', portable, light weight, taking up little storage space. Mine (new) arrived in a box with the parts not secured within the box and obviously parts were missing. The seller tried to charge me to return the product even though I did not receive the entire product. Because of that fact, I was unwilling to try to purchase again. Amazon helped with resolution to see that I was refunded, but it should not have come to that. What parts were there, I can only comment that the handle seemed very light weight (like hollow aluminum)."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANTOnline is an unreliable vendor.","review":"I ordered in time for delivery by Christmas. 5 days after the item was supposed to ship, I received an email (which happened just 2 days before Christmas) stating that my order had been canceled. No further explanation than this was provided. When I called Amazon to inquire about why the order had been canceled, they were finally able -- after a little under 15 minutes of searching -- to determine that ANTOnline does not have the item in stock even though they still list 8 available on their website. Needless to say, my wife won't be receiving one of the 2 items she requested for Christmas this year... all because ANTOnline is incapable of updating the availability of their products on their website.

I DO NOT recommend using the vendor ANTOnline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does exactly what i needed!","review":"i use this for my cmas light display and it works perfectly! has preprogramed chase and strobe effects built in, when not using dmx. i have several led light strands and after minor rewiring of the strand they worked great from 100% bright down to 30%. 30% dim to zero is off when using led lighting.2nd year update: I have ordered more of these for a total of six.

Great action story that will make you think.","review":"The story has a couple of surprise turns to it. Action runs through the movie while at the same time you get to see an angle of the Muslim culture that does not get into the daily news. A muslim leader who lives in NYC is identified by the Turkish secret service as a wanted terrorist in Turkey. So the Turkish police put a call out to the FBI to apprehend the muslim leader. Then all of the action begins as the Turkish secret police along with the FBI try to apprehend and hold the leader until they can get him deported to Turkey. Then the surprise turns in the story begin. Watch it! You will find that the time spent watching the movie will be worth your while. And don't forget when it comes to enforcing purity of any religion, purity has already been destoyed and all that we are left with is hate clothed in self right-ness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The acting was disappointing. why would glover be found in such a movie??

Tons of cheap animations in the movie that I could do better on my desktop PC...I don't know what to say, I'm astonished that Amazon added such a movie and that they even charge for it...makes me thinking about changing to Netflix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased brainwash right out of the heart of hell","review":"The whole movie, I'm thinking \\"This movie was written by Muslims.\\" I no sooner saw the first credit that my suspicions were affirmed. It is a post-9/11 stream of thought to infiltrate the American mind with the seed of confusion, that we Christians serve the same God, that we are just like the Muslim, and that the Muslim terrorist is not following the will of the satanic Koran. The sad part is that they are successful. Make no mistake, we do NOT serve the same God. They serve the Moon God, who was worshiped before and during the time of Muhammed, the \\"prophet\\" of Allah. Compare the Bible and the Koran; they describe two completely different Gods. Those not trained in Biblical truth WILL be swayed by propaganda such as this waste of film. What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not love it more!","review":"I am a professional nanny of over 12 years and have read almost every \\"it\\" book on how to raise children. This book, along with \\"Because I said So,\\" another Rosemond title, is pretty close to being the most amazing book I have ever read. I have seen what happens when children are over indulged, given too much attention and given a status that they have not earned and it's not pretty! I am so sick of spending time with children who act like the world owes them something and also like they should enjoy the same rights as adults. That simply is not reality and we do children an injustice to allow them to behave that way. How does that prepare them for the real world? Anyways, the book is great, full of good stuff and wonderful question and answer sections at the end of each chapter. Any parent or caregiver would benefit from reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing new","review":"I waited anxiously for the newest John Rosemond book and was very disappointed. It seems to be the same information as his books Raising a Non-Violent Child and Parent Power. I read nothing new.

These are designed specifically for Monster speakers but can work for just about any type of bookshelf speaker. I use them for my Polk speakers. The stands are built very well and are quite easy to assemble. There are two long bags included which can be put in the stalk of the stands and filled with sand(not included) which helps weigh them down more. This is helpful for me because I have a cat who like to jump on and off my speakers. These stands are worth far more than the $30 price tag and Abes of Maine ships them quickly. They also come in black but the price tag for those are $300 (Monster THX SL-STAND 200 BK Select Certified Speaker Stands (Piano Black)!!! The only difference is the color."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Apparently Amazon is now the place to share your design opinion even though you don't own the product. Nice. How about next time you comment on something you own? And secondly (And you would know this if you OWNED the product) the GPS receiver is sitting in a bluetooth sled. The sled can be removed and you can hardwire the receiver and use it as a standard GPS mouse.Anyhow, I've had this product for about 3 months now. Works GREAT with my PDA and mapopolis. I couldn't ask for better battery life, I get on average about 6-7 hours of use before needing a recharge.

Great quality with no dead moss.Ok, this will require your attention.Before you buy this, as well as any type of green moss, you have to make sure it is either kept near by the water or just being sprinkled 3-4 times a day (at least in NYC). It WILL take some time for the moss to get rooted and used to your soil. Too High/Low PH might kill it. While adapting, the moss will partially get brown, it's ok.

This is not the case. The seat is too high for our 11 month old (average size) to even reach the floor. When secured in for the first time, he gently leaned to one side and fell over. Actually, I think he would be much safer without the belt---then a child might just fall off, instead of falling hard with the whole toy to the floor. After the fall, I decided to only let him use it when we pushed him, but that is no good either. The push bar in the back bends (not a solid piece) and is extremely difficult to manuver. The stickers were falling off right out of the box too and this item does not easily go together! The foot rest (not practical at all to use by the way) is extremely hard to snap in. Overall, not a good product. Try the Kettler little bikes---they are nice for older kids.

I was pleasantly surprised when I actually loved the rest of the album as well. He has a great mix of music which makes it hard to put him in any one type of genre.Take songs like \\"Chariot\\" and \\"Meaning\\" in which he delivers the lyrics with such heartful yearning. Other songs that I enjoy are \\"Chemical Party\\", \\"Crush\\", and \\"I Don't Wanna Be\\" which have a heavier sound. I really can't pick out one song that I like the best because there are so many. You can definitely here the influence of Stevie Wonder in his songs. Gavin DeGraw's voice at times reminds me of a young Stevie Wonder, yet he has a sound all his own.I think Gavin DeGraw is one of the best new artists in the music business today. It's refreshing to hear true soul coming back into music. I wish there were more Gavin DeGraw's out there.

It is the definition of insipid, and exactly what any big chain store needs to keep its customers shopping happy, and thus spending dough. In other words, this music is a blessing for any corporate chain store that wants something inoffensive to bolster the customer shopping experience. It is highly recommended that one doesn't expose themselves to this music voluntarily though. To do so would expose you to a propaganda that is detrimental to the one's world view in small, and the world at large.

Gavin's powerful vocals prove worthy of attention, obviously stemming from his background in opera. The piano skills follow close behind, with Gavin's double 'shot' of musical power dubbing him the next \\"Elton John,\\" \\"Billy Joel,\\" and the \\"next big thing.\\" This young singer is strong on and off stage, and before you would ever rate him as an artist, seeing him live should seal the deal.

In a time when so many musicians are selling out to mainstream pop, DeGraw manages to keep a unique sound while remaining universally appealing. The tracks range from stirring piano ballads (Belief, More Than Anyone) to edgy rock (Chemical Party, I Don't Want to Be) and everything in between. I keep listening to the album trying to guess what the next single will be but I can't-they are all just so good. His voice even reminds me a little of Stevie Wonder on certain tracks. (More Than Anyone) Bottom line-go get this album, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Warming Up","review":"The first time I ever heard of Gavin Degraw was on a rainy monday night in NYC. It was after work, and a couple of us girls from \\"Freds\\" found our way into a club called \\"Wilsons\\". I couldn't believe how many young people at a bar stood quietly, and listened to this boy sing Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\" to perfection. We were all in awe, sharing a moment that I can only compare to the time my brother took his girlfriend to a concert many years before, and came home so excited about the opening act. A man he was sure would become a star...that legend was Stevie Ray Vaughn. I came home that night and every Monday night scince knowing I heard someone who would capture our attention for many years to come. This kid is just getting warmed up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get enough of GAVIN","review":"I adore this music, it makes me so happy, every single song!

I bought the cd when it first came out and it hasn't come out of my cd since. I've even picked up a couple more of Chariot to give as gifts this Christmas. Gavin's honesty in his lyrics prove that he has an amazing talent as songwriting as well as singing and of course playing the piano. If you haven't heard him yet now's the time.

Gavin's album takes full marks, 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gavin DeGraw- Chariot","review":"Many other reviews state that this CD is \\"missing something\\" or is \\"too much like other artists\\", but I don't believe either of these opinions. Every track on this record is original and has something different to offer. Yes, it is true that I was, as many others were, lured in by the catchy and overplayed singles, but this is one of those few instances where I've actually ended up listening to and liking all of the songs on this CD. The rock stylings along with heartfelt piano melodies are one of the finer attributes of the songs, while the thoughtful lyrics add to the emotion and experience.This album is among my favorites and has been ever since I got it. I highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a GREAT CD!","review":"I really liked Gavin DeGraw when I first heard him on the radio, however, as with most CD's, I expected to be disappointed with a good portion of the CD. To my surprise, I absolutely love this CD. With the exception of ONE song, I love every other song. If you liked his first songs, \\"I don't wanna be\\" and \\"Chariot\\", you'll LOVE this CD too!

Well, she let me borrow her Stripped CD one night, and I was blown away. I went out and bought it the next day! =) I find myself belting out the lyrics as I am driving through town, I'm sure I've scared a few people by now, but I don't care! I love this CD!

There is not one song on here that isn't worth listening to and I definitely recommend this CD to EVERYONE!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Undeniable Talent","review":"\\"Oh, this is the start of something good. Don't you agree?\\" Well, I certainly do. Gavin DeGraw's new 2 cd set Chariot Stripped is riveting. From \\"Follow Throuh\\" to the classic \\"A Change is Gonna Come,\\" Gavin's soulful voice will captivate you. His lyrics are raw and genuine, making a connection with the heart. This is a cd you will fall in love with; I know I did. I listen to Chariot Stripped every day, sometimes 3 and 4 times a day. Buy the cd. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gavin, you arrested my mind...","review":"Wow! Great melodies, great tunes, great music...all in one. I haven't felt amazed like this in a while.

The only thing better is seeing him live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gavin is AMAZING","review":"I absolutely love this CD! I saw the Chariot music video on TV and bought the CD. It's been love ever since! My favorites are now Just Friends and Crush, which have both been stuck in my head for weeks now. He writes all of his own songs-that kind of talent is a dying breed.

An engaging and overwhelmingly satisfying listening experience. Can't wait to hear more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising","review":"I had really enjoyed the single \\"I Don't Wanna Be\\" and it prompted me to go out and get the album. Boy was I shocked, it might be the second best album I've heard from this year. I can't stop listening to it, very loving and emotional. With hints of rock, pop, R&B;, it just pulls at your heart with the melodies. The lyrics in fact don't stand out, rather become easily blended within the piano playing and rest of the music, making each rising chorus all the more powerful.Personally I enjoyed \\"Follow Through\\"'s playfulness, \\"Chariot\\"'s uplifting ability, \\"I Don't Wanna Be\\"'s defiance and \\"More Than Anyone\\" the most with its emotional cries. You'll definitely want to pick it up, as it is instantly addicting and something that will keep popping up to the top of your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such amazing range","review":"Gavin DeGraw's album is great.

I put it in and listened to it the entire way through. It wasn't until the long silence after the last song that I realized I had listened to the whole CD in one sitting. For me, it's one of those rare continuous play albums. You don't have to skip any songs or only listen to half the album. Gavin DeGraw wrote all of the songs by himself, he does all the vocals, piano, and keyboards for the CD. The songs are very mellow. This is an amazing debut...I think we're going to hear much more from Gavin DeGraw in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW GAVIN","review":"He is so talented, i got the chance to see him live and he is so astounding. the cd is wonderful mix of heart and intelect, great delivery and it seems as though gavin has music in his veins. original and inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful lyrics accompanied by a powerful voice","review":"For those who have been tracking DeGraw's path to fame since the beginning, <i>Chariot</i> lives up to expectations. DeGraw's ability to tap into the listener's deepest emotions with songs such as \\"Just Friends,\\" and \\"[nice to meet you] Anyway,\\" is a talent that most song-writers are lacking nowadays. In all, \\"refreshing,\\" would be one word to describe this man's first album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chariot","review":"This CD is amazing. Gavin has an amazing voice and a ton of talent.

The bonus CD is very good too, although I prefer the original recording, personally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing","review":"I bought Chariot after hearing \\"I Don't Want to Be\\" and \\"Chariot\\" on the radio. After I listened to it once I fell in love. I left it in my car CD player for a couple months. I've had the CD for over a year now and can still listen to it over and over again without skipping a single song.Gavin DeGraw is so amazingly talented. I recently saw him in concert.

He is such a nice guy, not many musicians would do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double disc for a great price!!","review":"This is a great buy!

He was awesome and the Stripped CD really shows what a great artist he is.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh C'mon","review":"Okay to start, I'm not doubting that Gavin Degraw is quite the talented musician, but OH C'MON! I was reading reviews of people on here and I bet about 3/4 of them are girls who just watch MTV and don't know any good music besides this. For example, one person said this \\"Another plus about Gavin is that in concert he sounds just as the CD with a little more \\"umph\\" to his songs. He will change notes around, hold out notes longer in concerts, but it sounds beautiful\\" I'M PRETTY SURE THAT ALMOST EVERY ARTIST DOES THAT LIVE (well if they have talent...so I guess all you MTV girls do have something to get excited over, because almost all the music on MTV sucks except for like 1/100 songs). Again, I am not doubting this CD is quite good, it's just, he's not a god. He does have quite the good voice but he needs to bring out more talent in the music, it's just too poppy for me..I give it 3 1/2 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Great First Album! - Gavin DeGraw - Chariot","review":"Before I bought the album, I was really skeptical about it. I thought this was going to be only one of those album with only 1 hit, the song \\"I Don't Wanna Be\\" which is featured on the tv show One Tree Hill introduction. However, I was pleasently surprised to see it was more than that. He had other fantastic songs, like \\"Chariot,\\" and \\"Follow through,\\" which captures your heart and has a fantastic beat and you could really relate to the song. Most of the songs you can bear to listen, unlike most CD's you only like 2 or 3 songs. Also, I believe Gavin wrote all his own songs, so he just didn't sing words some Recording company gave him. I really recommend this CD to everyone who loves listening to alternative music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chariot a shadow of Stripped","review":"Do like I did... Buy this album and throw away Chariot. Stripped is amazing while the regular album is lacking and could be a demo for Stripped. The songs on Stripped sound how they were meant to be heard. It's almost as if Chariot was a practice session for Stripped which is fulled with so much more emotion and perfect melodies. Stripped is good enough to play all the way through. Some standouts include \\"(Nice to meet you) Anyway\\", \\"Meaning\\", \\"Chariot\\" and \\"Follow Through\\". \\"I don't want to be\\" is better on Chariot but not much. Looking forward to Gavin's next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chariot (STRIPPED) = best pop record of all time","review":"Well it sucks that Amazon doesn't sell the digital copy of Chariot (Stripped) b/c it is the greatest thing ever. Seriously. His cover of Change Gonna Come... I've listened to it about 1000 times and get chills every time he hits that note.... you'll know what Im talking about when you hear it. So yea... get this record, but I would actually suggest going out to best buy and getting the physical copy with stripped in it b/c it will change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful Is Right","review":"Beautifully done song.

HIS VIDEOS seem to emit more emotion than the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Fab. guy!!!","review":"Gavin DeGraw is the next big thing, his cd Chariot is the best. Just to think he is not just a singer he writes and plays his own music. If you have yet to purchase his cd, you should it is money well spent.

Unfortunately (besides the song \\"I don't want to be\\") its pretty much the same cookie cutter, crappy accoustic, John Mayer type, cheesy kind of \\"rock\\". If you like hanging out at coffee shops and the mall then this will probably be right up your alley. If you like real rock music don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Fabulous. Awesome. Any word you can think of along these lines is fitting to describe this cd and artist. Gavin DeGraw's Chariot is an album you can connect with. You can sense the passion that goes into this music. Gavin does lead vocals, and plays the piano and guitar creating a unique unclassifiable I like to call piano rock. Whatever genre, it is a sound you are bound to love. This cd is absolutely worth every penny and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely NOT \\"Over-rated\\"","review":"what can i say about gavin degraw that hasn't already been said? i've read a lot of the other reviews on this site and i have to agree wholeheartedly with every single one of them. i listen to my gavin cd at least once a week because his soulful sound and inspiring lyrics give me such a great escape from my hectic life. i first heard and saw gavin perform on last call w/ carson daly and it was love at first sight( for his music, i mean. though, he's not bad to look at either, lol). i knew from that moment that i had to go out and buy his cd, and i wasn't the least bit disappointed. from \\"follow through\\" to \\"i don't wanna be\\" (which happens to be one of my favorites on the cd), every single song is flawless and you'll have them stuck in your head all day long, which isn't a bad thing in my opinion. so go out and buy it and i promise, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't live up to the single, but still great young singer/songwriter!","review":"How can you really top Gavin's hit single \\"I DON'T WANNA BE\\"? Along with KELLY CLARKSON's \\"SINCE YOU'VE BEEN GONE,\\" it's easily one of the top pop-rock songs of 2005-05, where the addictive chorus, raw arrangements, plaintive vocals, and perfect pop songcraft all come crashing together. While the album CHARIOT doesn't match this one song, surprisingly, Gavin offers up at least a handful of great introspective tracks, from JUST FRIENDS to FOLLOW-THROUGH to the title track, etc. I am not surprised Gavin was signed to J Records, as CLIVE DAVIS always knows how to sign stellar singer-songwriters. Unlike a lot of pre-fab/calculated dross masquerading as music, it's highly refreshing to hear AUTHENTIC talent this unvarnished, especially on the cool BONUS acoustic disc. I look forward to see what Gavin delivers next...and how many other pop wannabees can you say that about?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"O my crush, I've got a crush. \\"(Gavin!!)","review":"I had no idea who Gavin DeGraw was until 2 months ago when a friend bought me the cd.

Last night I just saw him in concert in St. Petersburg..can we say amazing? Not only did he sing songs from his album but he sang Lets Get It On and was so amazing at it. Hearing his voice and watching him sing makes me melt. Want a new obsession? ..Buy Gavin DeGraw's cd. I promise, you will LOVE it (and thats an understatement)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is MOST DEFINATELY the best CD everrrr","review":"Okay so you know when you go buy a CD... and you listen through all the songs and you think \\"Well that was a waste of 15 bucks\\" because the only good song on the whole album is the one of those songs that you love but you are quickly getting sick of because its over-played on the radio.. yeah well this CD is definately NOT one of those CDs! I heard \\"More Than Anyone\\" on TV and I fell in love with it so I went and bought the CD and every single song on there I fell in love with. Seriously. It's not one of those CDs where you are continually skipping all the crappy tracks. I can listen through the whole entire thing and not touch the CD player. And the greatest thing about it all is that I'm still not sick of it, and let me tell you I have played that album over and over and over and I'm still crazy about it! I highly highly HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this to anyone with a good music taste. I promise you, you'll love it!=D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album of 2003","review":"I was so excited to see that Gavin made it on to One Tree Hill and performed his song but then I completely forgot what this ment. Gavin was one of the industry's best kept secrets and everyone on here was writing great reviews about what a great treasure this album was. However know that people know him they are going to flood his album with 1 star reviews when the openly admit they haven't even heard the album.Please believe me when I say this album is brilliant. The lyrics are fantastic and Gavin is a truly gifted vocalist and I'm honored to have such an amazing album in my collection. Forget the stupid reviews others have written this album is a guaranteed satisfaction and is one of the best records u will ever hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"***Bright New Star***","review":"This is definitely a feel good CD! I am an avid music listener and have been my entire life. I have an extensive music collection of over 600 CD's and I can honestly say that I can count on one hand the number of CD's that are truly enjoyable from beginning to end, and now \\"Chariot\\" is one of them. I haven't been this excited about a new artist in a while. Musicians of his caliber give me hope for the future of music. From track 1 to track 11 this is a sensational collection of songs. There is so much soul in his voice it gives me chills every time! Although I was not lucky enough to catch him performing in clubs in the early days, I count myself as one of the lucky ones who have found him and his music now! I look forward to hearing more from him and watching him develop into a BIG star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adore this CD","review":"I randomly picked up this CD and fell in love with it. The lyrics are simplistic and yet hard hitting at the same time. The musical score of each song is awesome. It's nice to find a cd that I can actually listen through and enjoy each song. Gavin sings about such relatable subjects, and you find yourself &quot;dedicating&quot; each song to someone you know in your life. I hope that the general public realizes what an amazing cd this is.. I'd love to see this guy go far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST HAVE","review":"I saw Gavin DeGraw at a Maroon 5 concert in Portland. I never heard of him until I read the poster with his name, but as soon as he came on stage, he is one guy i'll never forget. He sang his songs with such a prescence that can't be described. His songs were so sensual and he had so much feeling, reminding me of a Ben Harper type musician. I went out and bought his CD and fell in love with him and his voice. This CD mesmerized me with his vocal skills and lyrics. You not only have to buy his CD, but you have to see him perform live, you won't be dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"I came across this cd on Amazon. I had never heard of Gavin Degraw. I am hooked on this cd. Every song is great. I was pleasantly surprised when Degraw opened for the Barenaked Ladies at a recent concert....he sounds even better live. Very talented artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down with DeGraw!!!","review":"I can say a million great things about this album...but mainly I wanna say AWESOME! It's not very often that an artist writes ALL of the songs on the album, especially his FIRST one! Every word that comes out of his mouth is heartfelt and true. I bought one copy the day it came out, and a few more the next day so that everywhere I go, I will have it. Yes, it is THAT GOOD! He has a wonderful, unique voice, and his work on that piano of his is absolutely amazing! If you don't already have one, buy it, and if you have one, go get more! Oh yea, go see him in concert, too!!! Thanx!~Shari"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something real and different","review":"Gavin DeGraw is incredibly talented.

I definitely recommend that you check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!","review":"This talented young singer/songwriter, will go places. I highly recomend this cd, it shows the raw talent of this young man. I wouldn't be surprised if he won a grammy. This is an excellent cd, and i hope everyone buys it. Two thumbs up!!( and if i had more, it would most definintely be more!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chariot Stripped A+","review":"This is music and an artist you wont find just anywhere. Gavin DeGraw's album Chariot and Chariot Stripped changed my life. He can sing a song and make you believe every word of it. This has everything you could want in music. Good words, good vocals, good music. Very close to perfect. Trust me Gavin DeGraw is a legend in the making. My favorite on this album is Change is Gonna Come. He does a tremendous encore of the original by Sam Cooke. When I first heard this, I was in the car and almost wrecked because my whole body just went in chills. If you want good music, this is where its at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome live performer a must have in your collection!!","review":"The cd doesn't even do him any justice comparing to actually seeing him live. But if you can't make it to a concert near you this is definitly a must have in your collection. And if you like Gavin i'll also recommend Michael Tolcher's \\"I am\\" cd who is on tour with him this summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing album!","review":"This album is probably one of the best I've heard from an upcoming artist who definitely knows his stuff! I highly recommend this album for someone who is constantly searching for good, new music =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I fell in love with Gavin the first time I put the cd in the player. I have since grown to love him even more, especially after seeing him live. Great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"Chariot is an amazing CD by a truly amazing artist. Gavin's voice is beautiful. There isn't a single bad song on the CD. It's really that great. Gavin DeGraw is a truly unique and wonderful talent that you don't get to hear very often. I give it 11 out of 10. It's brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"Just about every song on this album ROCKS. Love his lyrics and the sweet melodies. Favorite songs on this album are \\"Follow Through\\", \\"Just Friends\\", \\"Chariot\\", and \\"More Than Anyone\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"i don't even have the albulm and i know its a beast","review":"i don't even own the fricken albulm and i can just tell its awesome. as soon as i heard i dont wanna be i knew this kid was goin to be awesome, so i made 1 of my friends buy it. trust me. buy the cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good as it Gets","review":"I've had the privilege of seeing Gavin DeGraw live, and what you hear on the album is what you hear live. He is that good.I'll try to forgive the somewhat cheezy video made for \\"Follow Through,\\" because the song is wonderful. This guy can sing and play the piano with such abandon.Although, the first two songs may be the commercial hits, you need to hear the whole album to understand that when Gavin DeGraw croons \\"Give Me your Strength,\\" he's giving it his all.\\"Chemical Party\\" is fun and cleverly written. \\"Crush\\" takes you back to every single crush you've ever had. \\"More than That\\"is one of my favorites, because of the soulful intro. \\"Nice to Meet You Anyway,\\" is great because I love the meaning behind the song. I could go on, but I recommend that you buy this album yourself. If you are disappointed, I would be interested in knowing why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing up and coming star..","review":"This is definately the best CD I have bought in a long while. All of his songs have their own feeling to them, and they straddle a few different genres of music. His music is one of a kind. I'd say if you like Jack Johnson, John Mayer, Howie Day, or anyone like them, you will love this CD! He is a dynamic new artist, and will without a doubt be a big star very soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Debut","review":"Having seen his progression over the years, Gavin continues to impress. His voice strong, lyrics meaningful and production impressive, he has nowhere to go but up. Buy this album and you will not be disappointed, and if you like the album, catch him live, his interaction and stage presence will convince you that he will be a star...and soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gavin DeGraw is definitely a rising star","review":"The \\"Chariot\\" album is good, as a stand-alone piece. But the acoustic version of the album, \\"Stripped\\" is by far a throw-back to the days of pre-MTV, before image ruled everything, and when it was only about the music. The songs are lyrically meaningful, the musicality of the album is dead on and DeGraw's vocals are not only thoughtful, but soulful.I've had the fortune of seeing DeGraw live and this album captures that spirit.I'm hoping this sets a trend for pop music, because let's face it, for the past 8-10 years, it has become something that didn't necessarily require talent.DeGraw is a raw, shining star in a music landscape that has generally been dull and glossed over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Amazing...","review":"I first saw and heard Gavin DeGraw when his video for \\"Follow Through\\" first came out. I loved the song and the fact that here was this young guy playing the piano IN the video. So, for months, I would hear the song on the radio and finally had enough and had to find out who this guy was. Once I did...I have never gone back. I immediately went out and bought \\"Chariot-Stripped\\" and now I have a copy on my computer, one in my CD player and one in my system in my living room. Gavin really impresses me and I am going to see him in a few days and am SOOOO excited!!!!!! The talent of this man is truly amazing and I really could go on and on, but I am sure if you are a fan already...then you know how great he is. Writing his own songs and playing his own music...inviting us in for a more intimate look with \\"Stripped\\"...what an awesome gift! We love you Gavin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!","review":"I stumbled this CD in Virgin Record and decided to buy it because I'd seen Gavin on Last Call w/ Carson Daly recently. This is absolutely my best CD purchase ever! The lyrics, music, and Gavin's soulful voice come together beautifully. Several songs really affected me (i.e. Follow Through, Belief, and More than Anyone) in a deep way. I refused to take this CD out of my stereo for weeks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get enough of this CD","review":"I own most of Gavin's music and can listen to it continually -- but this is the CD I go back to the most often and never tire of. (Given that it was released eight years ago and I'm just commenting on it now says something.) It's a treat to hear both the full studio recordings and the stripped down versions (which are like being at a live performance). I love the gutsy, \\"garage band\\" feel of the stripped versions -- especially on \\"Chemical Party\\" and \\"I Don't Wanna Be.\\"Gavin has a versatile voice. Depending on the song, it takes on a different timbre and communicates a wide range of emotions. There aren't many singer-songwriters who can interpret a song like he can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd","review":"I think i will download this cd because i dont feel like paying for it but when its all said and done this cd it great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best New Artist","review":"Thousands of Gavin DeGraw fans have been waiting for July 22nd for SO LONG! I have seen Gavin live in the NYC area a half dozen times now. If you are searching for the next best thing - Gavin DeGraw is your man. You instantly get hooked on his soothing voice and exceptional lyrics.I can't wait to see him next week in NYC at Irving Plaza.With such poor music hitting the stores these days, it is refreshing not to skip songs on this CD and listen straight through.Trust me this CD is worth every penny and you will want to catch him live this summer!Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my current favorites","review":"I saw Gavin Degraw live before his CD was released. I really wanted to get the CD, but I worried that it would pale in comparison to his live performance. However, this CD really lived up to my expectations. Degraw has a very gritty voice--somewhat of an acquired taste--but once you get used to it, you really fall in love with the songs. There has been a tendency to lump him together with artists like John Mayer, but he has a very unique sound and voice. My personal favorite songs on this album are Overrated, Nice to Meet you Anyway, Follow Through, and More Than Anyone. Of course, no CD is without its low points. Personally, I always skip Chemical Party when it comes on. The song just doesn't do it for me. Other than that, Chariot is a great album and I expect bright things in Gavin Degraw's future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's My Fan Sign?","review":"I got this cd as a present from one of my relatives. At first I was put off by it because of the fact giddy little school girls on TRL were just gushing over his music. But Gavin Degraw has too great of a voice to be overlooked. If you're like me, you'll enjoy his nice soulful voice with meaningful lyrics. Otherwise you should just stick with Hillary Duff and rest of the snot nosed punks they feature in Tiger Beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite artist!!","review":"Wow the first time i heard this guy i got chills down my spine. now, every time i listen to him, i still get those chills. his musical talent is flawless and when he sings, he puts his voice out there like no other, which is so hard to find in guys nowadays. i went out and bought his cd immediately and there is not one song on this cd that i do not like. gavin degraw is an extremely gifted and spectacular kind of person, and i am so excited to hear more and more about him in the future!! two very enthusiastic thumbs up! cheers to you gavin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great great great","review":"I actually seen Gaven Degraw at House of Blues open for SIster Hazel and it was by far the best show i have ever been to. He is definitley a rising star as we speak. If you watch &quot;WB&quot; at all his song opens the new hit show &quot;one tree hill&quot;. Definitely a great great group and fun to go and see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth your while...","review":"It took a few listens, but it hooked me after about 3 rounds through. I found myself suddenly humming tunes from this album, and dying to hear them again. While maybe not THE most original, his music is very catchy and he's got a great voice and interesting lyrics (listen close to the entire meaning, not just a few lines). This is a great CD for a relaxing drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality.","review":"I've always loved the songs I had heard on the radio and I can't beleive I didn't buy this sooner. While Gavin may not be #1 in the charts he deserves the rave reviews he gets. He is an original, not cookie-cutter artist. Great blend of upbeat and low-key songs. Well written and proformed. Gavin went for quality here-This cd doest have the filler songs you will skip over like so many of the mainstream \\"artists\\" out there. If you just want fun but shallow music-this cd isn't for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"the emotion comes through","review":"Gavin's voice conveys SO much feeling. I find myself belting out his songs wherever I am listening to them. I highly recommend Chariot to lovers of heartfelt songwriting. Chariot Stripped showcases an even deeper level of Gavin's talent for tweeking his own work thanks to touring. I personally cannot wait to see him live!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant debut","review":"I actually got an advanced copy of this CD back in May, it was only four songs long, but I kept listening to them over and over again. I'm a big fan of singer/songwriters. Rufus Wainwright, John Mayer, Jason Mraz, Amiee Mann -these are great writers of songs and they sing them with a passion you can't get from pop music. This album is wonderful in many ways, from begining to end, with Follow Through, Just Friends and Chariot easy to sing along with. When I met him at a recent House of Blues concert here in Chicago, I was as giddy as a school girl. He signed my CD's and his smile will melt any girl (or gay boy's) heart. Not since Rufus Wainwright's debut album have I found a CD that I thought was this good. I proudly wear my Gavin DeGraw T-shirt and tell people to buy this album, you'll not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best New Artist","review":"This is a really great CD. I saw Gavin live on tour with Jason Mraz a few weeks before the release and i went the next day to pre order Chariot. He has a great stage presence and his voice and songwriting abilities will take him far in the music industry. His music is like a mixture of pete yorn, jason mraz, and rufus wainwright, with a touch of elton john's instrumental arrangement. its difficult to describe and i would recommend this cd to anyone who likes great songwriting and incredible raw talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING debut album!","review":"Gavin Degraw's debut album, CHARIOT, is the best debut album of 2003, let alone the last few years. I haven't heard this strong of a debut in a very long time. Gavin's mix of piano ballads and all out in your face rock makes for an amazing CD that should strike the fancy of any music fan. Every song has something to offer, a rare find in today's music industry. Stand out tracks include \\"Chariot,\\" \\"Chemical Party,\\" \\"Nice To Meet You Anyway,\\" ad \\"I Don't Wanna Be.\\" Degraw has a knack for writing insightful lyrics and delivering them in a way that makes you really understand where he is coming from. Degraw's voice could make even the worst song sound like an Italian Aria. His vocal prowess is his greatest strength, but he is amazing at playing piano. All around, this CD is definitely one of the best albums I've ever heard and it is just a matter of time until everyone is singing the praised of the absurdly talented Gavin Degraw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gavin doesn't have to be anything other than Stripped","review":"Gavin Degraw's Chariot Stripped is a soulful remastering of his already exceptional debut album. The most gratifying aspect of listening to this CD is that the listener can actually hear the love Gavin has for his craft in his voice. You can almost feel the pleasureable pain he experiences while hitting the strongest notes. Chariot Stripped showcases Gavin's talent as a live performer; anyone who has never seen him live will certainly be compelled to immediately check his tour schedule. I could not have asked for anything more out of this CD. It cements Gavin as one of, if not my absolute, favorite artists. Well done, Mr. DeGraw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great up & comer!!!","review":"I bought this CD after hearing just 2 songs from his CD -- \\"Follow Through\\" & \\"Just Friends\\". I am SO glad that I did buy the CD because I found an artist that writes & performs music for all ages. This CD has an influence (in my opinion) of rock, pop, jazz, and folk. I found myself comparing him to John Mayer but what John does for the guitar, Gavin does for the piano. If my gut feeling is right, he will be as big as John which is a good thing since this world needs great singer/songwriters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait till he grows up!","review":"Undoubtedly, this is one of the most entertaining CDs I've acquired in a long time. Degraw's musical style is fresh and unencumbered by bravado or fake glitz. Something about the combination of his music and voice envelopes you and carries you right into his lyrics...and that's where the trouble lies. Because most of his message tends to reach to the core of who we are and what we know, one cannot overlook the worn and tired metaphors that litter this otherwise exceptional CD. Like a previous writer pointed out, we've already heard about a love that \\"fits like a glove.\\" Additionally, in the first cut, Follow Through, the phrase \\"I haven't felt like this in so many moons...\\" feels like a brick wall just as you begin to settle in and realize that he has put into words your own feelings.Aside from that, though, this is definitely a great CD. With a little maturity, and maybe a helpful thesaurus, I'm confident Degraw's lyics will soon match his other impressive talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Singer / Songwriter Genre","review":"Back in the 70's when I was growing up I listened to singers who were also songwriters, like Jim Croce, Harry Chapin, and James Taylor. Then in the 80's and 90's this genre of singers died out, replaced with the slick sound of songs that were written by producers trying to manufacture a certain sound. Now it seems the singer/songwriter genre is making a comeback with a whole list of performers from John Mayer and Josh Kelley to Jason Mraz and Jack Johnson. I really like this style of alternative-folk rock. Gavin Degraw fits right in to this category. I love his sound and his approach. The whole album is wonderful. I especially liked the track \\"Follow Through\\". I think this song could be a huge radio hit for Gavin. I recommend this album highly, especially to anyone who is a fan of John Mayer or Jason Mraz. I will be listening to this album for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Chariot Indeed","review":"Gavin Degraw is an amazing artist!!!!. I wish I could give him 10 stars. He is the type that does not come around very often. He writes his own lyrics...that are not just \\"catchy but true to life. From his song about the beauty of life called Chariot to the comical Chemical Party. He is a great musician, who is great live. His performances capture the whole crowd. He has over 200 reviews on amazon alone and the critics have to admit he is a freash face in music. People pick up and listen to his cd....by the time you finish you will be a Gavin Degraw fan for life :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chariot","review":"When my friend recommended for me to listen to Follow Through because this guy is the best male singer of this generation, I was kind of sketchy because of how people over-react. Most of the music out today is about sex, so how could this be different? After listening to Follow Through, I was thankful to realize that Gavin DeGraw can find better topics to write aobut than sex.A few months later I hear I Don't Want to Be and Chariot for the first time, and I was more than impressed. I listened to the rest of his album and was very pleased with his wide range of songs and stunning, soulful voice. I love More than Anyone very much and I appreciate that he doesn't say anything like \\"I want your body\\". All of his songs are different than anything out there (and that's good)! Gavin DeGraw is a unique person with a very unique voice and just could be the best male singer of this generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gavin DeGraw - Chariot","review":"Well, not really good actually. There are only a few songs that worth listening. They are Chariot, Follow Through and I Don't Wanna Be. The rest just didn't work for me. They just arent catchy at all. However, if you're a fan of Gavin, Then buy this album. 'Cause i bet he put lots of effort into it, and being a bad album to me doesn't mean a bad one to you. So guys, you may give it a try.

The fanfare that Sargent uses to introduce the work is quite frankly the most interesting part of the entire piece, and I say this as a devotee of Handel's choral works. Dull, dull dull. Give me Gardiner's rendition anyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great compliation - but please note....","review":"The European release has an additional 5 tracks so it might be worth checking out Amazon.co.uk for that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"an american tourist in peru","review":"This is a superficial and at times naive account by a yet another starry eyed, eager and willing \\"shaman's apprentice\\". Elizabeth Jenkins worked as an English teacher in Cuzco when she met a \\"fourth level\\" shaman, Juan Nunez, who showed her around Peru. Juan immediately initiated her into the fourth level herself. The apparent ease and efficiency of this \\"initiation\\" process has, if i am allowed to be slightly cynical, allowed Elizabeth and Juan to create a major business catering to those who are looking to get something for nothing. About 20 times a year, Juan initiates yet another group of wide eyed tourists, and both E. and J. lead initiation workshops all over the world, including the US.This book will be of interest to people who are inclined towards safe \\"spiritual adventures\\". I would not recommend it to people who are looking for more resources on shamanic \\"technology\\", initiation or peruvian beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful and disturbing","review":"This is an amazing body of work, and one might think it was done in the 1920's as the style is sort of the flapper mode. Irina chronicles her daughter as she grows from a young child to a young women. It is disturbing as one cannot look at the pictures of Eva as a young child and not think of the tragedy of Jon Benet. Eva as a little child is made up as a siren with a combination of innocence and provocation. That combination is what makes this such a compelling body of work, but also perhaps disturbing. More than one photo seemed to have some white specks, either from dust on the negative or a problem in printing. The composition and settings show a fine eye for photography and this is a wonderful collection. There is a lushness to the settings and a great variety. In the shots where Eva is looking directly at the camera, she appears to be looking right through the viewer. One will not forget these great shots."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a pile.","review":"Don't buy this. You will hate yourself for it.

Tyler served in the foreign service himself (a milieu I grew up in), and his description of the diplomatic life is perhaps the best I've read. Most of the book is spent in the Congo, and Tyler does an excellent job showing how Hugh Mathews is totally affected by his travels through the back country. He is outsider to the stuffy suited men who mostly stay in within the safe confines of embassy life. His life is given meaning through a frenetic affair with the wife of the embassy's consul. When she leaves, he drifts through a few empty years in Sudan and Washington, going through the motions. He gains a second chance at the end, with plausibly subdued results.

I don't know why Charlize Theron is even shown on the cover, she's not in it much.The movie is a low budget sleeper. It doesn't have enough of a plot to go anywhere. It drags on and on. The characters are boring. I also have a problem with child actors who smoke. I don't care if its for a role or not, it is unacceptable!Don't even waste your time renting this dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I completely dig this flick. It was emotionally exhausting but real. This is the side to life that most are lucky enough not to have to live with or see. In the days now of feel good movies and happy endings, this really cut to the chase that not every movie is given a happy ending. For the end of this movie, I wasn't real thrilled with where it ended off with either as some have so eloquently mentioned, however the meat of the story was just outstanding to me. I loved it so much I bought it. I think it's not a movie for some but for me, I found it to be exceptional."},{"rating":"1","title":"I fell asleep","review":"Maybe not the best review because I didn't actually watch the full thing.

I like Tara and James very much. James is really good in the movies(although he is stupid when he is confront his dad!). It broke my heart when I saw Tara was beaten by her grandfather.Overall the film is really good and I would rate 5 stars originally. But the scene that Tara smoke is not comfortable to me. How come the film director made the young actress(only 12 years old!) to smoke? And I don't think this scene is really important to the film. So I rate this film 4 stars only."},{"rating":"2","title":"We'll Miss You, Luna","review":"For some crazy ass reason, many Luna fans think Pup Tent sub-par, but it is actually a melodic and introspective album that deserves the highest praise. Beautiful View, Beggar's Bliss, Pup Tent, and Ihop are among the highlights of a CD that you will not regret buying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"Turns out this is a small (paperback novel size) book from a British \\"artist\\". Over 200 pages of his dull British quips, and primitive drawings of people who I guess are famous in England but I didnt recognize most of them so how could I know if they were good caricatures or not? Im guessing not. He thinks he's hillarious in his writing and cartoons.. My copy was old and dingy and pencil lines throughout..hopefully it helped someone in the past.. I would say I found two pages to be informative regarding getting published..but thats it."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first impression was Yuk!","review":"At first glance I felt that this book was a real waste of my money. I am trying to improve my caricaturing skills and this book was more about cartooning than caricaturing. It was instructional when it came to exageration of details and a few other neccessary pointers, but did it teach me how to caricature anyone? Not anyone I know! It's good reading if you want to know about the author and general information about the history of caricaturing, and so forth. If you want to learn how to draw caricatures, as I do, then I don't think this book will help you very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"Sorry but this book is just NOT worth the money.

I just watched this movie and was astounded by the large number and wide variety of bad ideas packed into it. I didn't know a movie could have this much action and yet be so boring. It's 85 minutes long, but it seemed like 85 hours. I didn't know that such bad actors could get star billing. You learn something new every day.

But it was no mere head-to-head talkie. The music was astonishingly good, the suspenseful action lent a continuing air of suspension and tension that gave you the creeps, and the script was a twist if Nietzsche meets the Twilight Zone. The babes were hot and sassy and the relationships complicated like the taste a well aged wine. If you don't like this movie, you probably don't like to have fun with horror and should seek your thrills in more somber chillers. The clown! William Burns brought levels of sophistication to his role. His character was a spiritual man, you see. The story's message might offend the devoutly religious. Too bad. Hidden talent showed up in this yarn. The girl band coulda been a contender. The lead actress in the movie leaves you begging for more. Literally."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD","review":"NOW, I LOVE BAD HORROR MOVIES. I REALLY LIKE FULL MOON MOVIES. SO, I WAS VERY EXCITED TO SEE THIS. MISTAKE.

They only had three people onstage, and were kinda tuneful and pop, maybe like Crowded House or Squeeze, but in the studio they obviously were let run riot, they have great arrangements, lots of backing vocals and *lots* of instruments. Very Beatlish.

They were always entertaining and a frequent topic of discussion among the members of the construction crew that I was the foreman of. When one came on the radio, we competed to determine what the \\"rest of the story\\" would be. While we would occasionally get one right, the vast majority of the time we were nowhere close.There are 101 entries in this book and I found all of them well worth reading.

It is one of those rare books, easy, entertaining and educational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent stories!","review":"I literally had to cover up the ending to each story with a piece of paper, so I wouldn't jump to find out who or what the story was about.

I buy it to give away, because I am not giving up my copies. I would read the stories to my students when we had a little time left at the end of a class period and the students would always come back to class wanting to discuss the story and beg for another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have book for high-tech marketing staff","review":"This is a great guide to success in the high-tech marketplace. Although it predates Geoff Moore's model, it is completely complementary to Moore. Unlike Moore, Davidow goes into much more depth in terms of appropriate marketing activities. This is a useful book for all marketers, executives, engineers, and financial decision makers. It accurately portrays the dangers of making marketing decisions with an engineering mindframe instead of using business concepts.Davidow's personal experience at Intel was invaluable in making compelling case studies."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive High-Tech Marketing Guide","review":"When this book was written, it broke new ground about the importance of crafting, marketing and selling \\"whole solutions.\\" In an industry of constant technology innovations (and discontinuities, to steal a phrase from a follow-on editor), that is the only way to survive. This book is a must read, and really sets the stage for Geoffrey Moore's first book \\"Crossing the Chasm,\\" another required reading for the student of high-technology marketing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book.","review":"very good book. Highly recommended, especially for people interested to learn more about Marketing High Technology products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks Substance","review":"William Davidow has great organization in this book, but beyond the big picture, it lacks real substance. I could have taken this book, created an outline from just the chapter and section headings, and got as much out of it as I did reading the whole thing.I recommend this book to the beginner in technology and marketing, but not to anyone with any real experience in either."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pretty package with no substance","review":"The publisher deserves credit for putting together an attractive little book. The short quotes sprinkled through out are pithy and to the point, while the decorative illustrations are pretty. Those illustrations, however are the flowery type you find in Asian poetry books and have little to do with Wabi Sabi. Gold's exposition on the subject is simplistic to the point of being juvenile. Wabi Sabi is a complex topic and requires more depth. While new to the subject, I have already found two better books. Lennox Tierney includes photographs of items which actually illustrate the principles of Wabi Sabi in Wabi Sabi A New Look at Japanese Design. Wabi Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers by Leonard Koren Porvides a better foundation for understanding than Gold's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant But Hollow","review":"For those already aware of Buddhist or New Age principles, this book might serve as a pleasant reinforcement. If you seek a deeper truth, you'll be disappointed by the cooing stories of the author's grandmother. The ideas, like accepting what is and living in the moment, are sound in my experience, but the presentation strikes me as infantile. A luxurious use of ink and space make for an attractive book, suitable for a coffee table or waiting room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"Keep this book out in the open, like a ribbon you've tied around a tree, as a constant reminder of the \\"little things\\" that make all the difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Wabi Sabi?","review":"If you are looking for serious insight into the concept of Wabi Sabi there is no need to buy this book. After living in Japan for 15 years and a casual student of Zen I decided to take a look at Wabi Sabi and this was one of the books I picked up. It soon ended up in the rubbish. It is a sappy story of a boy getting comfort from his grandmother in the wake of a divorce.Curious about its author I googled \\"Taro Gold\\" and found he is no more than a kid, a former child \\"talent\\" and model, current pretty boy, J-Pop wannabe, yoga instructor and spoiled rich kid. Will give the kid credit for actually writing and publishing books which is more than most people do in a lifetime (probably with the help of his wealthy family of whom he speaks of in an interview linked to his website) but, again, there is no Wabi Sabi here and that is what you have come here looking for, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its not what you think","review":"This is a book you will want to give to grandma.

This books shows how it's done.The second half sags a little, putting US generals, and Bush's cabinet on trial, it's tedious. But you can skip those chapters.However, this is as close as you're going to get as a secular guide on how to be moral, and stand against the persecution of others. Also, people who anger us, it gives us the choice to take the high road, by showing the worst consequences of our actions."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lucifer Effect","review":"Scary! The Lucifer Effect is a frightening story of the Stanford Prison Experiment and how quickly average people can assume roles so different from their usual selves. Although the Stanford Prison Experiment had to terminate early for humane reasons, one can certainly see how these concepts apply in situations such as at Abu Ghraib prison and during the Holocost.Anyone working in a prison or jail setting should read this book! Anyone who intends to conduct experimentation using human subjects should read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, But You Have to Get Into It","review":"This is a great read in the studies of human psychology.

I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the studies of human character."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK SCIENCE","review":"None of the 'guards' had training or experiences as guards, and none of the 'prisoners' had any experiences as prisoners; everyone was acting how they imagined prisoners and guards should act.The book is a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"behaviorism","review":"If people understood the principles of reinforcement and punishment, there should be no surprise that people can be taught new behaviors in a short amount of time.

Very boring for a psych book. I think the writer's head got a little too big from the attention he received from his prison experiment and he goes through every excruciating detail of it in this enormous book. I frankly think that his experiment was a sham in that he began it under false presumtions. False presumtions = false results. Since his life's work has largely been dedicated to the results of this experiment, it must say sadly, it's been a life wasted. Furthermore, this guy gets people believing that this experiment is something groundbreaking and should compel the prisons to change. Although prisons need to change in many areas, this author does not have any more of a clue than your average citizen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Capacity for angel and devil in humans","review":"Its a good scientific study of how people have both the capacity for angelic and demonic behavior. How we like to think that bad people or good people are so very different from most of us, but are not. It shares the thesis of novels like America's Keenest City. It is an interesting field.As the poster below asked, I too, have always wondered about the people who refused to behave badly in the two notorious experiments from that era. This and the Milgram.I think that would be an interesting study of itself. What gives some the courage to stand up to unrighteous authority."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a reprint of old study combined with political slant","review":"I ordered this based on a quick view of the description. Unfortunately the book is merely a republishing of a decades-old study on prisoner treatment combined with some new chapters where the author takes the opportunity to vent his political spleen in areas he's otherwise unqualified for. I won't bother you with details, but let it suffice that in a table of heroes at the end of the book, he lists \\"The prophet Mohammed\\" as a social \\"hero\\". (a definition at best debatable in what is supposed to be a scientific study). He also mostly uses liberal icons for examples of heroes, including many others who are definitely non-heroic to anyone who does not share his political bent.The book is a rip-off as it's already been published. It's like reading what you think is a new book by Mark Twain only to find out it's really just Tom Sawyer with Twain's political philosophies tacked on at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Dr. Zimbardo's account of the Stanford Prison Experiment is very interesting and applied across a variety of circumstances.

I am studying wheelocks Latin and it helps to have lingua Latina on the side to anchor what I've read. Although I'm using lingua Latina as a supplement it would definitely stand alone as a latin course. I personally Think that having some knowledge of what you are studying is a help however, ie to know the names of the Latin cases. Consider pairing Lingua Latina with Wheelocks, or even just look up \\"Latin by the DowlIng method\\" to have a little bit more concrete understanding.As far as the \\"Illustrata\\" version of lingua Latina, it is certainly a nicer printing and binding and the images are full color. In the regular version of Lingua Latina Familia Romana all the same illustrations are printed but they are black and white line drawings (compared to the same drawings colored in in \\"Illustrata\\")Hope this helps!God bless"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book for learning latin through observation of context.","review":"If you want to be challenged to observe the Latin language and to learn it by figuring it out like a puzzle, this is the book for you. Best for those who are willing to let go of total certainty to figure out meanings based on the clues given in the context without the aid of English translations. The format is set up to take you from simple sentences whose meanings are easily communicated through images and repetition, to increasingly more difficult sentences structures. The story that is used as the base of teaching observation and understand of the language weaves in a fantastic cultural piece.Lingua Latina mimics total immersion as much as is possible with a book-based approach. Fantastic if you are interested in actually learning the language and not just translating to English."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adults are not children","review":"The Natural Approach has a lot to say for it. But it makes a fatal assumption: adults learn the same way as children.Fact: Adults already have a lifetime of experiences children do not have.Fact: Anybody learning a second or third language as an adult will initially associate the new language with those languages already known.When I used this method in a university class, the first thing all of the students did was to go out to the bookstores and buy grammar texts and a Latin-English dictionary.This is not a textbook that makes a good primary text. However, this book would be an excellent second book for a Latin language class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bueno, para comenzar...","review":"Para el que busque introducirse en el estudio del lat��n, es una buena opci��n.

First off, the lack of understanding the author creates when it comes to the grammar is beyond frustrating. When I took Latin using this book, it was the end of the 1st semester when I learned that there were things like Nominative, Accusative, Genitive, etc. It was frustrating enough not knowing what these words meant in English, but in Latin...forget it.

Sent them back and am still waiting on a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed!","review":"I was looking for something to replace my cheap, small carabiner that I was using to hold my keys. I wanted something that made it easy to take my keys on and off, but also one that didn't pop open unexpectedly. I thought the carabiner was my way to go until I lost my mailbox key. I'm very pleased with my Lucky Line Key Ring - small, secure, and easy to use. Highly recommend. I'll probably buy more in the future for add-on gifts. Fast shipping too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucky Line 71101 Key Ring","review":"I found this to be a good product at a reasonable price and it shipped on time, Job well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comes apart too often","review":"Pros:It's easy to open and close.It's blue, which is a nice color.Cons:It's easy to open and close. So easy, in fact, that the thing can come open by itself. At first, this won't happen too often, but it seems to get worse as time goes by. After a few months, you may find that spilling your keys all over the place will become a daily occurrence. It did for me, anyway, and let me tell you: hunting around on the ground at night in a dark parking lot trying to find where all your keys went gets old pretty quickly.My recommendation is to get the 81101 model instead; while opening it is slightly trickier (but not that bad, once you get used to it), it's *far* more secure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont expect the color you want and wont last for more than a couple of months","review":"This is now the 2nd order I have placed for these after the first one I go just broke. The stock photo shows blue, but apparently they come in \\"assorted\\" colors and now for the second time in a row Amazon sent me a pink one. The first one I had lasted about 4 months and it broke at the \\"locking\\" point. The wire simply came out of male metal part of the clip. However for $3.48 I figured I would give it a 2nd chance. Will keep you posted..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"My old keyring started to fall apart after years of good use and I found this to be a good replacement. The design is a little different from most other keyrings I've seen and tried, but not in a bad way. It just works. Keys stay in place. Move around freely and don't get snagged anywhere. Easy enough to get them on and off if needed (have to be careful others don't fall off when you do this as the keyring kind of wants to straighten out when unhooked, but using two hands and just being careful solves this problem). Good price, does the job, and seems like it's going to last quite a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Key Ring","review":"This key ring is great. It lays flat in your pocket. It's just so easy to add or remove individual keys, something I do fairly often for work with multiple different company cars. It feels strong. It's fairly stiff. The closure is a little difficult at first, but after you learn how to use it a few times, it's easy. My co-workers like it, and I'll probably order a few more to pass out to all of them too. This is one of those little things that really does shine. Five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product, simple over 81101","review":"This is a great product for keeping a bunch of keys or anything that could be looped through. The construction is very sturdy, in fact it's the strong wire that keeps the lock in position by exerting pull on it. Opening to separate the keys is very easy. This model is much more easy to operate than the other that Lucky Line has to offer (81101). I have both of them. With 81101 one has to make a weird 8 shaped twist to open or close. With some practice one could do so, but is definitely a problem when it's loaded with keys. This is definitely a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not secure enough","review":"I really love this key chain most of the time, it is slimmer and easy to get keys on and off.The problem with this keychain is that it has come unclasped a couple times on me when pulling my keys out of my pocket and my keys flew all over the ground, luckily I recovered them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"wish it came in a different color","review":"i bought this ring after looking at numerous reviews. so thanks to the positive reviewers, you won out! the design is functional, havent really had any issues with this besides opening the link and forgetting everything is going to fall off lol. other than that i love it--just wish it came in more colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"It is small and strong. feels good. fun to play with...

Looks like a hair tie. The item is quite stiff (in a good way). Highly recommended. Wish I could pick a color, though.

Over the years, the latch has been improved to the ball and slot type used now. They're easy to open when you need to, and rarely, if ever open when you don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"Serious upgrade from the standard key-ring that most people use on their key-chains. A key-chain is a core element of many people's EDC containing several key items (home key, car key, multi-tool, small Swiss army knife,and flash-lite, all on a large carabiner), however this usually changes depending on where you go and what you do on any given day. For example if I am called in for jury duty I will need to remove nearly all of these items for they are not permitted in a court house. With this lucky line you can easily take items on and off your key-chain without having to pry apart a cumbersome metal ring."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I purchased this CD as a present for my wife, who is a major Jonilover. I saw her for the first time at Bethel,NY (Day in the Garden), and it sent chills down my spine. Unfortunately, this recording was extremely boring, both from a jazz perspective ( I'm a jazz drummer), and from a Joni perspective. I found that Joni herself is more \\"jazzier\\" than \\"Jazz Takes\\" will ever be. I've heard jazz interpretations of so-called popular music that were much better than this i.e. Joshua Redman- Timeless Tales (which incidentally covers Joni's \\"I Had a King\\" from her really early recordings. Stick to the real article here! Incidentally, both my wife and I agreed that this recording wasn't good enough to keep, and sold it to a local used CD store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Bad, Interpretation","review":"This is an extremely lathargic and unspired CD. Joni Mitchell music is taken here VERY literally, which doesn't fare well, even in this particular jazz setting. The arrangements are extremely simplistic (except \\"Edith and the Kingpin\\" but the meter here is way too slow to the point of non-recognition of the material on which it is based), and the playing is strangely pedestrian and uninspired. And sparse -- like there were only two or three instruments in the room. And Thomas Chapin's flute solo on \\"Coyote\\" has a lot of \\"wrong\\" notes in it. The whole effort is kinda Joni Paint by Number music. A must, I'm afraid, to avoid.However, all is not lost in this peculiar sub-genre. For a truly inspired jazz interpretation of a great composer, check out \\"Color and Light: Jazz Sketches of Sondheim\\". It's just terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"great music","review":"all i can say is listen to samples, and hear it for yourself.... it would be nice to have more of this type of music..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of Karunesh","review":"When I first bought Zen Breakfast I was very pleased, great music for studying, reading or just chilling out. I was so satisfied that I bought two more disks from Karunesh, those were \\"Joy of Life\\" and \\"Call of The Mystic\\". They were great too. Actually my favorite is Joy of Life. I've been studying for a very demanding exam this past 6 months, the only thing that gets me studying is Karunesh...I was so happy with my studying music that I decided to buy another disk from them, it was Nirvana Cafe... total disaster, horrible instruments kept disturbing my mind while studying. So I decided to just erase it from my playlist.I totally recommend Karunesh, it's the best, but not Nirvana Cafe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Karunesh--Back to his old Self !!","review":"The first time I heard this album I thought now thats more like it!! This took me back to his first album. Songs that move and change and when they do that, you find yourself humming along. This music is why I buy New age in the first place.....because it is MUSIC!! This album has taken me along way since I first heard Karunesh 6 years ago when his song Dawnlight was played on my local cable systems DMX digital music. I knew then I would like his music very much. This album gets 5 stars and deserves them. This album has replaced Colors of Light as my favorite Karunesh album. VERY highly suggest fan get this one today!! Now I could tell you something about each song as other seem to do, but my music tastes are just that....MINE.

However, I do think there is a quality difference. When I opened my printer to check what cartridges I needed to buy, I noticed yellow ink in the gears and covering parts of the inside of my printer. My first thought was - this is a mess. My second thought was - Is this why I need to replace the cartridge already? I have no idea how much ink leaked out, but it should not happen at all. I had a Canon black cartridge, which seems to have outlived its Rhinotek color counterpart, even though I mostly print in black only. Given that Canon cartridges are marginally more expensive, I'll stick with them from now on. Sometimes saving a buck costs you more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love in the first degree","review":"I have now read all of his series books and what a read.

With this release, the first Greatest Hits package, Motorhead showed the world that they were not going away quietly with the departure of Fast Eddie Clarke and Philthy Animal Taylor. Not only were all the hits from the classic lineup featured, but four new songs were recorded as well.

Prior to reading this book, I was bouncing from temp job to temp job with only a vague idea of 'winning resume'.I knew how to write a CV, but apparently did not know what made other types shine. When I had to leave my current job because of money issues, I knew that I could not afford to remain in the dark any longer. I had to get a resume writing guide and study it closely.This book readily stood out from other titles which I flipped through. It showed me that a resume only needs to have stuff which is directly related to the position which I am applying to.Because I am a visual learner, I appreciated the endless parade of sample resumes in this book; resumes should be both personal and professional.

For one, the video's go out of sequence to the stories, and I felt like they did more talking and less videos. This is probably the best TNA DVD that I have watched, but it is nowhere near the quality of a WWE DVD Documentary.

You'll occasionally get some completely irrelevant story that only the most die-hard fans of... perhaps Jeff Jarrett, would appreciate, such as Dixie Carter talking about how she used to live next to Jeff Jarrett and he hit on her, and how when she went to TNA to apply for the job, she saw Jeff Jarrett and said she knew him when they lived next to each other.The rest of the stories are very brief, and barely covered.

The prime focus is on the men and women involved. And on the great city of Moscow with all its dark corners and teeming population. I like the odd ball mix of personalities, from the highly ethical and likable Porfiry Rostnikov to the ardent nationalist Emil Karpo. And I like that it's far on the police procedural side of the spectrum. All the Inspector Rostnikov books I've read have been about a 4 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly your pink drumming bunny","review":"Bought this one about 8 months ago to replace an older headset. I primarily used them to play WoW and to listen to music on the computer. When I lead my raids I need my raiders to hear me clearly and this headset worked to fill my needs for a time. Both the inbound and outbound sound worked great up until the headset it the 6 month mark. First the mic started getting really quiet, forcing me to turn up my outbound to max and my raiders to amplify me over Ventrillo. A week after that the microphone would either not catch any sound at all or only produce high pitched screeching when I talked.The comfy earphones still work for my medium sized head, but the mic is now dead.PROS: Nice Sound, Comfy Fit for Extended Periods of UseCONS: Short Microphone Lifespan"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"they call this a kareoke cd, IT IS NOT!!!!

I would think that something should be durable enough to last more than 3 times. I had someone look at it (more money) and they could not get it to work either. What a waste of money!!

It was also lightweight thereby not subtracting substantially from my carry-on weight allowance.So far it has made it to multiple local and international flights and has fit well into the overhead bins, even when not sideways, though you may need to turn it upside down so that wheels face up for the smaller bins. Sideways you can fit it very easily, but some airlines recommend against this position as it may leave less room for other customers with similar carry-on suitcases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old music on a newer medium","review":"I've loved this song since I was a little kid and just had to have a copy of my very own. There seems to be a number of publishers who have this song for sale but I doubt any one version is any better than another. It was recorded late 30s or early 40s so the sound quality is what it was then. As I understand it the music is based on an opera tune.

Reading online comments prepared me and made the installation easy. I used a step ladder shimmed with phone books to hold the liftgate fully open.

After finding the required Torx size installation went very smoothly."},{"rating":"2","title":"With my wife's help... we did it ourselves!","review":"I needed to purchase a special tool to install this, I selected the Torx 40 8\\" handle with T-Grip. I propped up the liftgate and removed the old supports. I pre-aligned the replacement in position by turning the cylinder so the mounting screw would line up with the hole in the liftgate and secured the lower Torx head screws into the Jeep chassis. After aligning and partially installing both sides, I asked my wife to assist by fully extending the liftgate's travel. This allowed the new supports to be in the correct position to secure the Torx screws into the liftgate. That's it! I wish every DIY job was this simple!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strongarm Jeep Liftgate Lift Review","review":"Works great. Took just a few minutes to install.

Almost have your car lifted by the lifgate.If you do not, and just \\"open\\" the liftgate, the struts are almost a 1/4 inch too long to allow for the screws to match the holes.

Mine arrived broken which is not surprising because the magnifier part of the product is just cheap, thin plastic film with wavy lines in it to produce the magnification. One could easily punch a finger through it using very light pressure. The frame is extremely light weight plastic and the legs would not open completely. When I opened the package, a very strong odor of what smelled like mold hit my nose. I am allergic to molds and my fingers and face started itching immediately. I admit to a certain amount of accountability here since I should have been smart enough to stay away from a \\"As Seen on TV\\" product but the glowing description roped me in since it looked as though the product would fill the bill for my close in craft work. Wrong. This product has an even poorer quality then I would have expected.

(See Assassin's Handbook,). I'm excited to introduce all kinds of witches into my game. My only complaint then is the book is too short.

The second hand sticks, and even moves backwards sometimes, when between the 6 and 8 on the watch face - causing the watch to constantly loose time at the rate of 12 to 15 seconds per minute. This, oviously, makes the watch useless, and the one-year warantee is equally useless. I replaced the battery, but that didn't help. Very disappointing for a watch from a company that did, at one time, make more reliable watches.

My favorite part is the section on identifying photographs and believe me, once you read that section you'll never look at a picture in quite the same way again. The only thing is, I want to spend all my genealogy time looking at the boxes of old pictures family members have give me. (smile)But that's a good thing, and learning to examine, not just look at the pictures has taught me to see more in them, and also transfer the same skills to examining records.

She surveys ancient Mesopotamia through the examination of 10 ancient city sites, from Eridu to Babylon. Naturally this narrative device is a springboard for digressions into the culture as best we can know (or guess) at it. Leick does stints as a tour guide, if I recall the author bio correctly, & it shows in her writing, which is accessible if a bit repetitive when she wants to make a point. She also attends to the different archaelogists who've dug up Mesopotamia and their biases, hypotheses, etc.; she takes a similar approach with contemporary scholarly debates, \\"teaching the conflicts\\" as it were. This & Roux's \\"Ancient Iraq\\" seem to be the two best books for us lay readers in the past 40 years or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot. It's a book that manages to be both scholarly and readable as it introduces the archaeology and history of various cities around Mesopotamia.

This book also shows how much more investigative work there is to be done in that region of the world.A good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"Did not have full funtion of controls....Magix did not help, said product too old. this is a 2000 version. save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no.

This is a different band entirely. For those of us into the genre of Death/Black Metal, continue on. Second off, this CD is near GODLY! The music is very fast with some slow mellow parts thrown into to keep us off balance. The violin fits perfectly with the music in both fast and slow parts. Clean vocals? Forget it! Nothing but great death metal screams here. The best way that I can compare this album to others is imagine Dark Tranquility or In Flames with violins. The music is very melodic, and fast. Buy buy buy. Definately worth the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"I thought this book was barely worth more than the paper it was written on. The \\"world-famous author who is using a fake name\\" could have done so much more with it. There was an interesting twist where the main character (who can have any woman he wants, of course) accidentally sleeps with both a mother and a daughter. I thought he could have taken that and ran with it. The main character is killed far too abruptly. We never find out exactly why he hates America so much. I thought the information on Sarin was interesting, if scary, and I thought it was uncanny that the book was about Bush and terrorism and religion. All in all, very flat read, but I have to admit, I finished it. Realistically, though, Sonny had a brickish personality and probably couldn't get any woman, no matter how attractive.

It is notoriously difficult to get locals to discuss spirits as it is considered extreme bad luck to discuss hauntings. I believe it is this obstacle that is at the root of the size of the book and that the stories are so short. It is difficult to flesh out a story if you are unable to convince anyone to give you more information. Miss Hitchcock needs to be applauded for respecting the local Okinawans beliefs regarding the afterlife while managing to obtain the information she was in search of for this book.

If your partner has a true sex addiction, this book seems juvenile and rediculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent help","review":"Insightful, informative and spot on! This book helped me not feel so alone and isolated and explained many of the feelings of guilt and insecurity I was having. \\"Living with your husbands secret wars\\" helped me to understand my role and took the \\"I'm not good enough\\" monkey off my back. HIGHLY recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off the Mark","review":"I was totally disapointed with this book. After reading lots of reviews for this, as well as other books on this topic, I decided I'd have to take a chance with it. I guess I shouldn't have. The majority of the book was about support groups; finding and/or starting one for (you the reader) having spouses with sexual addictions... This book seemed to be more geared towards actual physical unfaithfulness such as sex with prostitutes, random sexual affairs, etc. If you are looking for a book on pornography and internet affair issues, I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for wives of husbands who want to change","review":"I read this book for a friend and it was nowhere near as good as Breaking Free (by Russ Willingham) that my husband and I read to address the same problem. From what I gathered, Marsha Means has never herself experienced sexual betrayal, just the fear of it. She has some basic info on codependency in the book, but I would argue that the wife chapter in Breaking Free is just as practical without all the scary stories with no resolution. If your husband wants to change, read Breaking Free together and leave this one on the shelf. You might find yourself loving your husband through his not-so-secret wars, not just living with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for partner's of sexual addicts","review":"This book was one of the few I had found that address sexual addiction from the woman's point of view. It addresses the discovery of the addiction and how to get help for yourself and for the addict. There are a lot of references in the directory and there is also a chapter on how to begin group therapy for the woman. Great book-very enlightening!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Numi's Bouquet Tea Set","review":"The tea is not quite what I expected. The \\"flowers\\" are already opened. Other teas of this type that I have had, have been tightly rolled up and expanded in the hot water to form the flower. That was a let down. The tea its self did have a good flavor. As for the pot, the lid has no catch so you have to try to hold it on when you pour, or it falls off (usually into the cup and splashes). The pot gets VERY HOT and is hard to hold - especially the lid. On the whole, I was very disappointed with this set. I would not recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED","review":"Based on the mostly positive reviews, I purchased it. Well, believe the negative reviews. The cheap (think dollar store) glass teapot WITHOUT strainer holds 18 ounces. Since I just received this yesterday, I only used one flower which failed to bloom and the tea flavor was not impressive. The concept is unique, but way too pricey for what you get. As for the bamboo box, it is pretty but not really sufficiently sturdy to store anything except very light weight items."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lid broke, but very nice otherwise.","review":"I bought this as a gift for Mother's day. My mom's really into boxes and loved the boxes it came in. She also enjoyed the tea, though a couple were too exotic for her. The main problem is that the pot is very fragile. My mom is always extremely careful with things, so the fact that she managed to break the lid when cleaning it means something. Overall it was still a successful gift though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item never received after 1 month","review":"The item looks great but we never received it.

They told me it wouldnt be shipped till the 26 but would arrive before Jan, 1st. This was after Amazon said if items ordered will get to their destination before Xmas. First LIE. Then on Dec 30, I receive a email saying they are out of stock and would NOT be able to ship this item at all. One day before it was to arrive. This leaves me without a gift and no possibility for replacement in time. This is just too much sloppy handling of accounts. I am VERY UNHAPPY and you should be very very careful with this company.

I purchased the Numi's Bouquest Bamboo Gift Set with clear tea pot and flowering teas. I described the flowering teas before putting them in the teapot and conversation was great as the flowers opened up to make tea. It was part of the event that I know our guests talked about the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful present","review":"This tea set is so nice, even my Irish \\"grandma\\" loved it. Very different way to brew your tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice tea","review":"A great opportunity to test out different teas that please your pallet. This set of tea would make a really nice gift to yourself or to others and the neat part is that you can buy additional, individual teas without buying the whole set again.. If you like exotic flowers and tea you will love this. I bought this set as a gift for my mother in law cause we both enjoy tea. We tried the jade jewel first and it was wonderful. The flower was very pretty and the tea itself was very relaxing. Now I have to buy one for me to try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect gift for a tea lover or anyone who likes fancy looking presents","review":"I got this gift set for my mother in law last year. She loved it, mainly because of its fancy packaging, multiple items in the box and the mysterious teas. But, I dont know if she used it or not. See, she is a regular black tea drinker, so most of these flowering teas might have been alien to her.So I think this might be an ideal gift for a tea lover who likes to explore or someone who likes natural/organic food products in general.I am definitely buying one for myself next time, just coz I love tea pots.Oh.. the sticker on top holds fast to the bamboo...and hard to get out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tea set","review":"I absolutely love this tea set and the variety of tea flowers! Granted it is a small pot, but perfect for one typical size cup of tea (as in standard coffee cup). Plus each tea flower can be used 3-4 more times/steeps and if you want to get the full use of each, but cannot drink it all, it makes great iced tea! The one downside would have to be the storage box it comes in and the matching tea flower box. I wish when you removed the labels from the box, that the entire label came off. Such a beautiful and decorative addition, just a shame that glue and paper stay stuck to it! Regardless, at $12.50 which is what I paid for it a year ago, it's a great set. If I didn't still have the pot, I would purchase again in a heartbeat!!! Thanks:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice teaset","review":"I have had this set for a while now and enjoy the teas very much. The box is very handsome and I am wondering what I can put in it. I enjoy tea very much and this is a unique set. The flavors are very good and soothing. When I want some tea that satisfies me I use this pot. I love teas and this set is especially nice. I would buy it as a gift for someone I care about. Makes about six cups from each bud. The pot is very durable. It has hit the floor at least five times and never developed as much as a crack."},{"rating":"2","title":"bamboo gift set","review":"I purchased two of these.one for myself,and one for my Daughter.we just love them.the tea is not only good,but its a very cute set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice package, nice product","review":"Bought 2 of these for gifts, ended up keeping one for myself. The teapot is fragile, be careful when using and cleaning, or it will easily break. It does showcase the flowering action of the various teas nicely.The variety in this package is nice, bound to be some in here that everyone will like, and probably a few ya won't. But it's a decent price point to sample and find the ones you do like, then buy more of those teas.Some flower and transform quite spectacularly, others not so much. And pretty much all the teas are subtle in their flavors.This make a great gift, and as mentioned before, a great way to sample a few different flavors to see what you will like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moments of Beauty as Liquid Meditation","review":"Beauty is sometimes taken for granted. Today's humanity can often be blind to the ever available healing and grandiosity of Nature in daily living and a have a feeling of disconnectedness. There are things one can do to bring our attention back to simplicity and joy without struggle. Making time for herbal teas is one of them.....but having an herbal tea in your own glass pot while witnessing the unfolding of medicinal flowers before your eyes and literally drinking this fragrant Manna from Mother Nature, is healing.....is beauty with the sublime.....it is instant reconnection of one's essence to The Great Oneness. As Numi creators say...it is a \\"liquid meditaion\\"..... into the realms of the ineffable Beauty of Peace.I highly recommend it for anyone who wishes this on a daily basis.May you walk in Beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising.

This tea set is allright, and the idea to have the flowering tea is kind of cool, (There are better tasting flowering tea in the market such as Harney & Sons.) however. the bamboo box that contain the tea set is poorly made. The orange paint on the box will come off on your fingers when you touch it, and you need to be careful not to get splinters when you are openning the box. If they can package it better it would have been a really cool gift. I originally bought it as Xmas gift to give to a friend, but the quality is not as good as my expectation so I decided to keep it. The flowering tea looks cool but don't expect too much on the taste.

I was very excited for her to receive the Numi flowering tea set with bamboo basket because she is an avid tea drinker. _After_ ordering I was informed that this item was on backorder and would not arrive until the week following Mother's Day (May 13). It did not arrive until May 25th. I saw it this weekend and was very disappointed with the quality of the tea flowers (a big mushy ugly mess in the tiny teapot provided) and with the bamboo box it was sent in (very cheap). This was surprising to me considering how much I paid and the quality I associate with the Numi brand normally. Don't buy this if you're expecting a beautiful and lavish gift set. It's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excited at first, disappointed later","review":"Well, beautiful packaging....first one we did was ok, the Starlight Rose....but the Dragon Lily? The bloom was black. I gave away 5 of these as gifts. I hope that they don't have the same disappointing problem.The photo of what the Dragon Lily should look like was not at all what it was. I followed the directions to the T. We got a shriveled black flower, not a beautiful full red bloom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Gift","review":"I purchased as a gift for someone I work with who'd gone above and beyond in helping with our project.

It is very unique with the flowering bulbs.

This review is for Numi Tea Bamboo Flowering Tea Gift Set Frustration-Free Packaging I got this gift box of Nami flowering tea leaves for Christmas. Sat down to my first cup this morning. No labels on the flowers so I decided to choose the darkest leaves as it might be the best morning tea. After pouring water over it a horrible smell came off of it. I had to pour it down the sink."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!","review":"Are negative stars possible!!!! Moldy on the outside and the insides. Looked like some sort of insect eggs as well. AWFUL.

What you get is a cheaply made, garish box that is stuffed with a lot of cardboard shred. This all comes packed inside an outer cardboard box. Somewhere in the middle of all this cheesy packaging is a Dollar Store quality glass teapot and a small box of flowering tea. I am embarassed to give this as a gift. I took the tea out of the box and put it in a small gift bag. I will recycle as much of the pile of packaging junk as possible. A complete waste of money and even though it is mostly packaging, Amazon calls it \\"grocery\\" and I cannot return it. Please don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible weak tea","review":"I only paid $12.50 when they had this for a daily special but it wasn't even worth that. Maybe the tea was old, that is why it was so cheap. The flowering teas don't flower and float at the top. Nothing like the picture. The leaves soak up the water and puff out and fall apart. But that I can live with. The tea is completely tasteless. Just like drinking hot water. I have tasted many teas, bags and loose leaf and nothing as bad as these. But the little glass teapot is cute. And it IS tiny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Flowers, Horrid Flavor.","review":"The flowers were great. They know how to deliver there. The pot is very small though.

I haven't consumed the tea (as they are gifts) but I can say that I was impressed with the packaging. The case that they come in is unique and looks handmade. I opened one of the boxes (there are toggles on the sides of the box) and the tea also comes in a similar looking package.I am a little concerned that amazon (as well as the numi website) lists this product as kosher (as one of the recipients keeps kosher) but I couldn't find any ingredient information listed so I'm not sure... I hope it's not a huge deal to the recipient (as I've seen them drink coffee here at work from the office coffeepot.)When I was on the numi website I was impressed to see that amazon sells this product for LESS than they do.

The clear glass teapot is the perfect vessel through which to see the tea flowers open. The whole process is a peaceful, Zen-like experience. I've tried three of the teas so far, and each has been aromatic, gentle tasting, and even the removed flower (saved for more steeping) is attractive to sight and touch. (Oolong is my favorite).

She talked about it for a good 20 minutes. \\"Super Cool Present. I Loooove It!\\" The description doesn't say the tea comes in another lidded bamboo box. I read the reviews complaining about this set referring to it as not being 'perfect tea'. Anyone who has made their own herbal teas would know that. I don't think the idea is to obtain a 'perfect cup of tea' with this set, but to explore the colors, textures and scents of tea. May help someone understand the 'nature of tea' and where it comes from. Plants. Herbs. Nature. To me, that has been the side of tea that keeps me exploring and learning about it since I was a teen.

When I got this in the mail I was very excited. The boxes that they come in are really cute and I don't want to throw them out! I made my first batch exactly according to the directions because I was afraid of ruining the flowering part (even though I drink tea daily).Parts of the \\"flowers\\" tend to break off and float around in the jar I've noticed with every one that I brew. It's a little daunting at first, but you can remove them -- it just sometimes messes things up.

There are so many better rappers who have a million times the talent that Missy Elliot has and are so much more creative. Honestly, and the lyrics are awful, only a couple of the beats are okay, but after listening to Missy Elliot's annoying voice, then you will be very frustrated like I was that I bought this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supa dupa garbage.","review":"What a thought provoking and creative album title.I wonder how long it took her to come up with that name?I cant believe the trendy garbage people listen to these days.All the songs sound the same and have the same pointless lyrics to them.She cant produce,rap write or do much of anything of value.I saw this trash at tower records and it was just collecting dust.Save your money and dont buy any of her worthless junk ever again.Listen to some real artists like black sabbath,judas priest or iron maiden.Dont forget to vote for my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for all tastes","review":"Although this album was much hyped in many divergent sectors, I wish to warn that it ain't for all tastes! To my mind it's way over-produced and too poppy. If you like solid rap like A Tribe Called Quest or Ice Cube and don't like contemporary Urban R & B, or whatever it's called these days, you probably won't like this. If you like \\"Can't Stand the Rain\\" or anything else you've heard off of this album, you'll probably like it a lot. It's consistent, and does very well on its own terms. Unfortunately those terms are not mine. The only tracks I like are, ironically, Busta Ryhmes' \\"Intro\\" and \\"Outro.\\" And it's not that I don't like women rappers or pop--what I've heard of Lauryn Hill's album I've been impressed with and can't get out of my head (and I like her work with the Fugees)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon, you need to check your \\"sounds that changed the...\\"","review":"To have this CD on your list of \\"sounds that changed the world,\\" and to be missing yet so many others... is disgraceful.

To have Missy and DJ Shadow up there, The Score twice, yet to miss true history is irresponsible.Some artists that are missing from your list.** SUGARHILL GANG, Run DMC, Eric B & Rakim, EPMD, Gangstar, Tribe Called Quest, Ultra MCs, (you want a femme? try) Queen Latifah,Digable Planets, MC Solaar (you SAID the world), Pharcyde, etc. Those are artists that truly changed sound around the world in this genre (the LPs should be obvious, since in almost all cases it's the debut)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"from many tracks on the record you could be forgiven for assuming you're hearing a track off a minimalist techno album with an inconseqeuntial possibly uncredited guest vocalist rather than a track off an album released under the name of a vocalist who is supposed to be taken as a vibrant personality. the vocals are so multitracked that they lose all humanity as well as make it difficult to make out much of what is being rapped/sung. the beats are generic at best, offering nothing memorable or hinting at the energetic grooves Timbaland would make his name with on later albums. the lyrically sparse lead single being based around a chorus hook covered off an old Tina Turner hit is a perfectly fitting representation of this album's complete lack of substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supa Dupa Wack","review":"Whoever said, Missy was the female B.I.G must of been on speed. Every time I hear Missy on a track, she be coming wack. She never said anything close to tight. The beats way be phat and her videos may be vivid, but that don't cancel out the fact that she can't rap. Rappers like Missy, Timbaland, and Magoo can only spit wack s@#&. They need to take Hip Hop 101, and study the essence of real hip hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supa Dupa Missy","review":"I remember this album when I was 10 years old. I love this album and it is timeless. The album fully unveiled her rapping and singing talent. The album is a funky,jungle tinged slow-ride one minute,a simmering cauldron of cranked-up rhythms and underground beats the next. The multi-talented Elliott's laid back singing style lulls you along the groove on some tracks,while Misdemeanor's nervy raps help to punctuate others. Her sense of when to converge style complements Timbaland's easy-on-the-trigger/heavy-on-the-bass perfectly, lighting up the record with pinball snatched of self-styled sond effects. The CD is suitably peppered with snippets of both their personalilites,with her laying on her ambient beep beep's,and hee ha's,for good measure. This album has been certified Platinum. Remember,this was 1997-1998."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Debut (And Record) For \\"97","review":"Missy's debut album is the best record of '97.

The image was grainy, but what was most annoying, is that the audio track skips, and acts like a badly scratched (or too often recorded!) CD/DVD. There is NO continuity to this film, and watching it is an exercise in utter frustration.I feel, even now, a year or more later, USED by the vendor peddling this product. With the marvelous transfer to VHS and DVD of the 'major' Durbin films, I expected that quality here. I have been sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A ho hummer!","review":"I was looking forward to watching this movie because it stars Gene Kelly in a dramatic role and the beautiful singer, Deanna Durbin. Unfortunately, it was not what I expected. I thought it would be a nice Christmas movie judging from its title \\"Christmas Holiday\\". It had nothing whatsoever to do with Christmas! The story was rather morbid and not that interesting. No wonder Deanna Durbin retired soon after this one and that Gene Kelly went back to his extraordinary dancing roles. Even Deanna's singing couldn't save this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't turn off completely","review":"I like the single spray pattern (multiple spray options that are never used was not needed) and the large pause button is a plus for arthritic hands but ---- in the off position it still sprays about 25%.

It discusses exactly what the title suggests: women and the law. However the book goes even further that that: it delves into issues affecting all women such as motherhood and the role of feminism in general. The author states she will analyze women in the law while focusing mainly on Harvard grads working in large law firms--supposedly because they have the greatest ability to affect the greatest change. I, personally, don't believe this assumption to be correct, but it doesn't affect the impact of this book. The author, herself, seems to dismiss her premise later on as she discusses the impacts of women in many other areas of law including governmental offices and politics in general. Buy this book if you are looking for some dissecting of the role of women in a patriarchicial legal system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read for Women in the Legal Field","review":"Mona Harrington not only asks, but analyzes the right questions about women lawyers.

No inspiration, No enthusiasm, just like the record company forced them to do the yearly album, so they came to \`One more day at the office\`.Ridiculous words (and I don\`t expect them to be Jim Morrison), and the music ... Like ELP at their worst ... Bombastic with no inspiration and no enthusiasm (I wrote it before' didn't I?).Save your money, buy something else from DT, anything else but not this CD.I gave them 2 stars just because they are DT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kevin out, harmony off.","review":"The lack that Kevin Moore makes to the Dream Theater is unbelieveble. The feature of the band, who made it to be considered one of the best ones of the world, was the junction between technique and harmony. Without Moore, the both of them had decayed deeply. It's a pity, therefore they're all good instrumentists. It only lacks exactly a good arranjer. So, COME BACK, KEVIN MOORE, AND BRING THE I&W INSPIRATION AGAIN!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of talent","review":"THis band is amazing, only virtuosos there, but their kind of \\"rock\\" is incredibly boring in this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional","review":"This album, while sacrificing technical virtuosity, is Dream Theater's most emotionally charged work yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"FALLING TO SLEEP","review":"ZZZ...You Not Me...ZZZ...Lines In The Sand...ZZZ...Peruvian Skies...ZZZ...Hollow Years...ZZZ, and i'm still tried. This is a very weak effort by a band that has potential to be really HEAVY. I mean, it sounds like the band is playing it safe, making every song sound like it's formatted to be a radio jingle. That's good for a song or two, but not an entire album. You just have to leter rip. All those songs mentioned above are good and accessable but not acceptable by a band that can crank out metal and prog like no one else can. Sorry boys, this one's a yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"DT's rock-prog duality at it's worst","review":"2 1/2Rightfully one of their weaker reviewed disc, the modern progressive rock behemoths's 4th studio felt like a conscious step backwards in the songwriting department, essentially dumbing down the complex and melodic metal that made the group interesting to begin with in favor of a more accessible sound. Always reliable in length at least, this release sounds stale, and nearly deadened with seemingly ancient 90's rock production cliches; the solidly mediocre onslaught is truly put in it's pathetic perspective up against the instrumental transcendence behind \\"Hells Kitchen\\" and a segment of the final blatant and futile attempt at your epic album medley closer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good music by amazing musicians","review":"Very good cd...played by amazing musicians, very heavy sometimes, quite soft and commercial on some songs but overall, a very good album to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome!!!","review":"Falling Into Infinity proves that Dream Theater is still the best band in the world. They are the only \\"new\\" music group that I like that is out now. All the other new bands do a bunch of Alternative crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, not better, just different","review":"Dream Theater's newest release promises that \\"progressive\\" is indeed what this band intends to deliver upon. Progressive rock to me is a changing style and that is what this newest album reflects. Not as hard-core as \\"Awake\\" and not as heart-felt as \\"Images and Words\\", this album explores different ideas from the band, from guitarist John Petrucci's father to the media-crazed 90's. Compositionally the music is indisputably Dream Theater with all the requisite time changes and structure in place. As far as style is concerned, the songs differ from earlier Dream Theater work by being immediately appealing but lacking that mysterious quality that makes you want to listen to their songs over and over to find something you never knew was there. All in all, a reasonable purchase if you are a fan of the band, but for people new to Dream Theater, you might want to grab a copy of \\"Images and Words\\" instead and see how that strikes you."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Dream Theater. It's automatically good.","review":"Probably their most controversial album to date. The band, while still progressive, has gone in a more streamlined direction. Not as crunchy as Awake, which may disappoint many fans, but nevertheless a great listen. New Millenium and Lines In The Sand are the highlights of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good work","review":"In Falling Into Infinity, Dream Theater somewhat leave some of the sometimes too much obsessive progressive influences to make a more ordinary (even though not commercial at all) album. The result is, as all past Dream Theater works, great, and songs such as Peruvian Skies, Hollow Years and Anna Lee are simply great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a fantastic voyage with Dream Theater!!!","review":"With all the junk being churned out on the radio, Dream Theater comes to the rescue once again and proves that there are musicians out there who hone their craft and come together with their band to produce a fine, fine album. DT's maturity can be heard throughout their albums; on this one they focus more on producing whole songs, and are musically more under control, and they can really range though a gamit of emotional musical styles (even within a song). Probably their best yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"An underrated masterpiece","review":"Falling into infinity is a decent album from DT.though it may not be as good as Images and words and Awake and some of their live albums,but this album should be there in every collection of progressive rosk music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fair album... but shouldn't we expect more from DT?","review":"This album is basically standard-fair rock songs that are drawn out to excrutiating and repetitive length.

I mean the influx of 3rd party \\"hitmaker\\" songwriters and just the overall lameness of this album make it one to pass on. Big DT fans (Despite what you may be thinking, I DO consider myself one) will want it for the two numbers mentioned above (which makes it ALMOST worth the price of the CD)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream Theater rocks and this album proves it.","review":"I was very impressed with this album.

So it wasn't their fault for changing direction on this CD. Don't complain if it sounds different. I like this album for that very reason. There is some \\"bluesy\\" influence in \\"Lines in the Sand\\" and straight ahead hard-rock in \\"Burning My Soul\\". \\"New Millenium\\" is just a great song, especially Portnoy's drum parts. LaBries vocals are more laid back and raw. I like his vocals all the time but here he sounds even better. \\"Take Away My Pain\\" -excellent guitar solo, very emotional. \\"Anna Lee\\"....\\"Let it Be\\" meets \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\"-great song and solos. All of DREAM THEATER's stuff is great and this is a good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most meaningful cd you'll hear","review":"This is one of those bands that people really only hear about by word of mouth, but once you start listening to them (and especially if you start with this album!) you'll always be a fan. Their lyrics are poetic and their images are amazing--you can get a million meanings out of each song, but still feel the simple emotions of the music. This album is a great blend of soft and hard rock and it contains all of their best as far as I'm concerned. Definately a great deal if you wanna sit back and enjoy some real rock in the classic tradition, but with a definate twist!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dream Theater sells out","review":"To say that Dream Theater sold out is melodramatic, but instead of making their music more radio friendly, the band released a rock album that could have been written by just about anyone. That isn't to say that it doesn't have its highlights, but if you want to hear Dream Theater at its best, stick with Images and Words or Awake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indoctrinate you child with FUN LIES!!!!!","review":"The people who wrote the bible did not understand Fossils, dinosaurs, earth history, the rotation of the earth around the sun, the fact that the world never flooded, the impossibility to sustain life with that amount of h2o's effect on the air, the other things that should have been in the commandments (preserving the earth, those shall not have slaves, oppress women, stone people, etc) ... anyway i could go on, but this is some follower's idea of how to twist the facts to fit a book that monks, shepperds, carpenters, etc. wrote hundreds of years ago.

I particularly appreciated Sergei's emphasis on safety and this tips on how to harvest edibles in without incident!I have already made several recipes from that Sergei mentions in the dvd from wild edibles and have been impressed with how delicious they turned out.Bottom line:If you are interested in saving money of food bills, added health benefits, and learning more about edible weeds, this Dvd is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good resource for Wild Edibles info","review":"I am quite disappointed in the sparcity of NEW information offered on this DVD - particularily on Wild Edibles. I feel I got the 'bait and switch' on this purchase, as I expected MUCH more information on Wild Edibles. Instead it's primarily a rehash of the Boutenko family's health restoration story and their shared enthusiasm for, dedication to and promotion of consuming greens, eating raw and drinking smoothies. I appreciate the contributions the Boutenko's have made on these subjects, but I would not recomend the purchase of this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weissenberg rarities","review":"It's not usual this piano concerto played by Weissenberg.

He also returns to his piano, which is kind of rare for his newer stuff. But except for \\"Table Top Joe\\" and \\"Kommienezuspadt\\" the album is incredibly downbeat and rather tragic. However, the first track \\"Alice\\" is one of my favorite Waits song that i've heard. In short, this is a great album for when your in that mood. Great from beginning to end, and the last song \\"Fawn\\" is almost happy in its saddness, with no lyrics, just mostly strings, and alot of beauty. But this album is not for everyone, so give it a good sample before purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrically and melodically haunting","review":"Alice has a very haunting quality to it...perhaps not for the more mainstream fans, but the more \\"off the grid\\" fans will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodic Masterpiece","review":"In Alice, Waits melodies \\"impose continuity upon the disjointed\\" (Menuhin). Most of the collection focuses on melody and it here that Waits excels and offers contrasts to both his earlier and later work.Alice (the title song), Lost in the Harbor, Fish and Bird are good examples of genius in melody. Without goint quant on you, if you take a one-octave chromatic scale (12 notes) and look at the possible combinations of notes in an eight note bar -- well, think around 20 million.Waits has done a beautiful job of extracting continuity from the disjointed in his choices of melody in \\"Alice\\" - melodies that are familiar without being known, and superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geniusy work, with geniosity and genusolutio.","review":"Fish cakes. Flattest and wounded.This CD is exceptionally brilliant art.Barking, walleyed, cold souped and wet socked.Timeless, nausea-tinged, gorgeous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Poet without a Voice ?","review":"In response to the reviewer who called Tom Waits, a poet without a voice, one man's junk is another man's treasure. What you object to about Tom's voice is what I am drawn to. To me, Wait's voice is a gorgeous concrete mixer, soulful and singular in it's beauty. Regarding pleasant sounding voices, Lou Reed, Dylan, Gordon Gano (of the Violent Femmes) all have technically poor voices but their music works because of brilliant writing and the uniqueness of those voices. For me, technique is for 11-year-old baton twirlers. I listen to music to feel and technique and pleasant voices don't always make me feel. As for Alice, the other reviewers have said it well; I just had to comment on what I view as one of the most interesting and moving voices of the past century. Tom's voice may not be that accessible but what is infinitely more perplexing is why millions of people would by a Phil Collins record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom at his Best !!!!","review":"I just want to say that this Tom Waits masterpiece blew me away. I did have to listen to it more then once early on to really absorb the material on Alice but I usually do the same with all of Tom's works. Some of my favorite tunes on Alice (in my opinion) are 'Fish & Bird', 'I'm Still Here', 'Flowers Grave' and 'Lost in the Harbour'. Get your hands on a copy of Alice you will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden age of Tom Waits","review":"I have to say, I love Tom Waits' voice, but I haven't always been nuts about his songs. Some have been great, nail-your-heart-to-the-wall killers, but too many have been incomprehensible, to me at least. I'm probably just dense when it comes to poetry, but I just don't get a lot of the songs on albums like \\"Rain Dogs\\".For simpletons like me, I think Waits has entered into a golden age. \\"The Mule Variations\\" was loaded with songs that I could mostly understand, and \\"Alice\\" is even better. Do I listen to it more than \\"Rain Dogs\\"? You bet. I sit on the back porch, pour a drink, light a cigar and sink into the album. It is gorgeous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you can think of is true","review":"I like this on better than 'The Alice demos' You would think they'd be the same though; wrong.For some reason this this sounds, more alive to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A devante garde opinion","review":"Waits has all the appeal of a guy sharpening a saw while singing from the bottom of a well. Music, it would seem as a minimum, should be pleasing to the ear. I listened to this CD once -- beginning to end. I'll never be tempted to again. I'll give him two stars because he is original and now and then he creates a pleasant moment or a clever lyric. It takes a special kind of a person to appreciate Tom Waits -- and I'm not sure whether that is a compliment or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"oompa loompa jive","review":"German Expressionism meets lullabyes in the worst way. Stileted, boring. Waits rehashes his own melodies and adds some rather uninspired lyrics.

His presentation of subject matter is logically organized and concise, which makes reading the material enjoyable. He makes an effective case against the \\"random walk\\" theory without spending half the book on it. Instead, he reviews specific trading techniques in detail. Yet you do not need a mathematics degree in order to implement them. The most valuable part of the book is the detailed list of market-timing resources, which include newsletters, advisors, web sites, software, etc. I have personally dealt with some of these individuals, and find his comments about them to be fair and insightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wade Bowen is incredible.","review":"If you haven't enjoyed Wade Bowen, you are really missing out.

I would think that that would be a good thing to know before anyone buys it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABUSE...How could the author think this is love?","review":"So I read a review about this book and I think it is right. The guy in the book is nothing, but abusive. Why is it that the female lead can only think things are her fault? She folds extremely easily and is not confident in the least! When there is a scare about his life all I could think was: \\"Yes! he should die!\\" I would have strangled him myself if I could have!Please don't waste your money on this!!! This is not romantic. There are bouts of jealousy, but they seem more like obsession and abuse. I did not see love I saw abuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD by Lila McCann","review":"Lila McCann has a beautiful voice and she sings the songs on this album perfectly. However, I must agree with a previous reviewer when I say that the subject content of some of the songs was too mature for a girl only 14 years old. Overall, though, this CD is a sold, wonderful country album to add to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review is about how good she is","review":"Lila is a wonderful singer.

Lila is a fresh young voice, it also helps that my mother and her mother have been friends for decades! I cannot wait until her new CD is released in FEB!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I think Lila is off to a good start!","review":"I think Lila McCann is a fantastic country singer. What I like about her is she offers songs of her age level which is good because it opens up a window to teenage country listeners to identify with her music. Lila is an extremely talented country singer and I hope she stays in the buisiness a long time to come. Her album as a whole is great! Some are toe-tappers while others are sad and slow. My personal favorites from the album were: I Wanna Fall in Love, Almost Over You, Already Somebody's Lover, and Yippy Ky Yay. I would reccomend this album to all country listeners. The only tracks I didn't care for are 8 and 9 but, the rest I loved. Lila is a real charmer and has a softness to her voice. I think she'll make it to the top. Great job Lila and keep up the good work. Don't ever lose being yourself.

The opening piece is challenging to rock listeners, being an extended jazzy meditiation. It does build ever so slowly and evolves into a powerful prog piece, perhaps not too different from some of Gong's efforts. The dreamy pop-psych aspect of the group presents a welcome contrast to the firey instrumental intensity and Hazy Paradise is a perfect transition after the title track.I think the musicianship is a definite step up from their earlier work; there is an intuitive sensitivity and maturity replacing some of the youthful vigor of the first cds. Dominoes is a wonderful closer, a subtle Barrett cover that is likely not known by the legion of Pink Floyd fans. Balance is the key here, they can go to extemes in either the frantic chanting or sweet new-age meaderings, but here is the best of both sides in a fluid whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghost is Awesome!","review":"Imagine for a moment that Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull and Neil Gaimon all had a drunken orgy while in Japan.

Fortunately, I bought it used, so It didn't cost very much, because this record is very ugly.

I've never been to Texas, but right here in Northern Michigan. I can find Bill Crider's world of insane, inane, and very funny small town residents. And trust me, they go nuts over high school football. In rural Texas, two murders keep Sheriff Dan Rhodes at the center of politics, drugs, and gambling that surround a winning team. But as the sheriff discovers, these murders aren't about people, they are about football. And a winning team. And keeping The Boys in the playoffs. Not only is \\"Winning Can Be Murder\\" an excellent mystery novel--well constructed and populated with delightful characters, it is a comment on social values of a small town. Throughout the action, a variety of small town dignitaries exhort Sheriff Dan to solve the murders so the team won't be distracted from winning the playoffs. He does, and the town will never be the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comic Portrait of the Real East Texas","review":"Crider knows East Texas--especially small towns. From the outset of this story the reader can delight at this caricature of small towns all over the USA. When the high school football playoffs are at stake in Blacklin County, murder is called in the huddle. Of course the huddle takes place at the local greasy spoon over cups of bad coffee. Not only does Crider win us with his characteristic down-home wit, but he manages to give us a laughable picture of the way smalltime sports have taken over the hearts and minds of small towns everywhere. WINNING CAN BE MURDER is one of the most readable Sheriff Dan Rhodes mysteries yet. If you like good clean murder, read Crider.

I had just installed an old Linksys wireless router for a friend, but decided to get a Netgear router since it was on sale. The old Linksys router had a lot more configuration options than this router. Out of the box, it doesn't offer the ability to switch off broadcasting the SSID. You have to upgrade the firmware to be able to do that. Even then, you can't turn the wireless radio off, like you can with the Linksys. For security-conscious folks, turning off wireless when you're not using it is like locking your door when you leave home.So, compared to the Linksys router, the Netgear is definitely lacking. The range on this router also does not seem as good as I what I had with the older Linksys router."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money down the toilet.....","review":"Bought 2 of these pieces of junk with one montht difference, one for me and one for for my sister's place.

For me, the setup was effortless (unplug the old router and plug the new one in).This router has some of the same features my old router had - a DHCP server, port forwarding, etc. However, it does lack a built in firewall, but to me that is not a big deal since I always used a software firewall anyway.

Comcast confirmed this is a problem with some routers. I didn't believe it at first, but after a week of troubleshooting I believe it now.

The router can't handle it (refuses the connection immediately), you have to use a public web proxy or muck up DNS just to see your own site ! Netgear support confirmed this problem but have been dead silent since I asked them when they intend to fix it. Likely they do not.If you can get this router cheap and are strapped for cash, go for it, but be prepared for troubles if you ever want to run a public server through it. If you're looking for reliable home networking products without any misfeatures, stick with Linksys. There's a reason Netgear is giving rebates and the retail stores are dumping inventory.

Unplugged it for the night, and it worked the next day... for an hour or so. Basically, something inside is overheating. I have to leave it unplugged for several hours before it will work again.

It took me 3 full days of work plus several support calls and I could never get the thing working properly, and configuration was darn near impossible. We went to the store this afternoon, returned the old router and replaced it with this Netgear model. That was an hour ago.

This is a terrible way to try and fix the problem, and leaves you with a continually stalling network, which is upsetting if you like to do things like stream internet radio. Also, with WEP enabled, file sharing is incredibly slow, to the point of being useless.

When they send you a replacement, it is a refurbished one which someone else had sent in to Netgear with problems and obviously that has problems too."},{"rating":"1","title":"142 out of 682 reviews gave the product one star!!!","review":"Given my 1-star rating, it has an astonishing 21% dissatisfaction rate. What else need to be said about it? Really not much, but I do want to share my own experience.This is no doubt the hardward I have had most problems, and hence frustrations, with. After I had given up the router (I am now connecting to my DSL modem directly), I decided to come here and see what other people have to say about it. With little surprise, I found out a lot of them experienced the same.When it works, it may work great for a quite a while. However, it may stop working all a sudden, or when you have to restart it (power outrage, moving etc.). Several times, I had struggled but managed to reset the network; this time, it completely died on me, without responding even to wired connection.I give up, seriously. It has consumed way more time and effort than what a piece of $30 hardware really should. I am shopping for a new router, and will never buy anything from Netgear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable connections - buy something else","review":"Connections are extremely unreliable - will break every 15-30 minutes and won't reconnect till you reboot the router (despite having set all the properties). My older Belkin router never gave me any problems and I have switched back to my older router. Plus, customer service sucks : they will just give you some vanilla suggestions - such as go to this URL and upgrade the router and you will get the same response all the time (and the URLs dont work some of the times)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"All I can say about this router its not build to last more than 5 or 6 months, and then the wireless feature died all the sudden.

When I first got it, I couldn't have the wireless part turned on if I wanted to get to the Internet. Customer service was useless the first few times, and then they led me through this absurdly complicated procedure to do a special reset on the router. Now the reouter occasionally just dies on me, requiring me to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to work again. It's phenominally unreliable.Finally, their free support is limited to 90 days. In other words, if you have a problem after that time, even if it's a problem with the router, you have to pay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Net Gear Router is great","review":"This router is great!

Also, there is no built in print server.

It took a minute or two. It was extremely easy to setup and is working very well.I havent tried its wireless capability yet.I am happy with the MR814 and would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealiable - tech support a hassle","review":"Judging by the other user comments, I guess some people are lucky and don't have a problem with this router. I am not one of them. It worked great when it actually worked properly, but I found the proformance to be inconsistent and the router often dropped packets. Their tech help is in India so you have to wait about an hour to get through and then the help, although friendly, was difficult to understand. I ended up calling three times and finally felt I had wasted enough time on the phone with them and sent it back for a refund. Life is to short to spend holding on the phone. I can not recommend this product if you need a reliable connection.

Which probably accounts for the wide range of ratings you see in the 400 customer comments. Except for those that didn't get their rebates which means they paid even more for an inferior product.

At a distance of 80 to 90 feet through the house the MA311 gets a 30% signal at best, and the MA401 gets 0% and will not connect to router. Tech support stepped me though a few things. But ended up telling me it's too far away from the base station, and that it was not really designed to function in a 2-Story Environment. I have limited experience with this type of networking but it seems that with a claim of 500 feet max range, an 80 foot distance should be working much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to install and Signal is Strong","review":"Netgear MR814 is a well designed and nice looking product. The installation is easy and without any extra configuration. Just plug and play, then it works.I purchased it because it comes with one WAN port and four RJ45 ports. I just need to buy a wireless card for one of my laptops which is far away from the Router, the other one still can be connected with a network cable. I can save my money like this way. There is no problem with my two laptops running XP at all. The signal of wireless connection is strong enough.It took 10 minutes to setup everything. The only thing I need to do is interconnecting the Cable Modem and Router with a RJ45 cable, and makes the wires look neat. That's it. So simple.

It turns out that the router worked for a short period of time before I started noticing dropped connections. I thought it might be my aging Cisco 350 NIC, but then used it on networks at work and during a couple of trips I took. It was soon after that I realized the router wasn't responding at all. Looking at the \\"Internet\\" or WAN port on the switch it was connected to, I realized that the actual jack is faulty, as well as the wireless portion losing signal. This is a very poor router and I wouldn't recommend it. I've heard many other customers have the same kinds of problems. I recommend searching for a Linksys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dependable product","review":"I bought this because of the endless problems with my Linksys BEFW11P1 (which seems to be discontinued - rightly so). This one worked right out of the box - and never stopped working.The only problem I had was getting my DSL provider to assign it an IP address, because the Linksys has no way of releasing it, only renewing. But the Netgear is great - it allows you to release the IP address and it even let me mimick the MAC address from the Linksys router temporarily, enough to convince my ISP's DHCP server to release the IP address and bind it to the new box's MAC address. Also the signal seems much better than the Linksys's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleek and Functional, Yet Still a Wise Choice","review":"If you want one of the most easiest routers to set up, then I suggest you buy this great Netgear product. The router even looks good. It is silver metallic and has a nice silver grill detail on the back of it where the 4 port 10/100 intgegrated switch is located. Even the network status lights look hip with their small and minamalist design. Now to the important part. This was my first time setting up any sort of network, and after doing it, I find it very rewarding and easy with this router. After hooking up my cable connection to the uplink port, then hooking up my computer and my Xbox (with Xbox Live online gaming service) to the switch, I turned it off. Then I set up 2 more wireless computers on to it. After all was done, the router saw all of the computers and gave me options to configure it now.

But transfer speeds of 3 kbs just don't cut it (doesn't matter how close I am to the router). Signal is nice and strong, but transfer sucks (WEP on or off).Hooking up to the router with a wired connection works just fine.. but that kind of defeats the whole purpose of wireless, doesn't it?Oh yeah, and even though it says \\"Mac OS compatible\\", it doesn't pass Appletalk traffic.

In order for me to verify that it was the router, I disconnected the router and used my old wired router, I did not have the disconnect issue.

On an associated issue: I also purchased a wireless PC Card (netgear model MA401)for a laptop (also running ME). I made one call to Netgear support (an embarrassingly simple oversight on my part during the setup), and the laptop was communicating on line with the wireless router in 10 minutes.

Furthermore, the router will shut down its wireless component every 1.5 days so that you have to manually reboot the thing to get it working again. No amount of upgrading the firmware helped. Netgear support was completely useless.If you are looking for a wireless router, buy the Linksys WRT54G/GS and then go to www.sveasoft.com to install their custom firmware.

I have a 2 year old gateway router that had a 5 year warranty that stopped working one day so I called their tech support. The tech support person told me that since the product is over 90 days old and they do not manufacture it anymore, then I would have to contact their pay tech support line to get an RMA. If they are able to fix the problem over the phone line, then they will charge me, otherwise they will offer me an RMA number for a return. So basically you have to pay to use their warranty.

I tried to configure my new router to allow me to act as a server for several different games. The online documentation is very sparse, as is the KB on the Netgear site. I sent a question to their support staff, asking for expanded documentation on port-forwarding. After getting a canned e-mail response asking for my serial number (which I had already provided), I was told that this question \\"fell outside of the scope of support\\", and I would have to pay $28.95 (or $1.95/min) for \\"Premium Support\\".

The router gets overloaded and stops routing any time I send heavy UDP traffic through it over my 1.5Mbit ADSL WAN.Services especially likely to trigger this are UDP-based services such as some file sharing services (like Overnet) or game servers (like Half-Life/Counter-strike).I have applied the latest firmware from Netgear to no avail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap and it works","review":"I haven't read the other reviews for this router, but I've been using mine for a few weeks with no problems.

The admin pages are clear and straightforward, though too be honest, I haven't tried out any of the more complicated functionality. The 802.11g version was an option, but I didn't need that speed, particularly since my internet provider has a top speed of 2 to 3 MB/sec, and 802.11b is good enough, and I don't intend to serve lots of video wirelessly. Admin pages are pretty easy too -- instead of having to remember the IP address of the router to login, the router automatically routes \\"www.routerlogin.net\\" to its admin pages.

I haven't taken it outside yet for a distance check."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm an idiot, and if I can do it...","review":"...then you can, too.I successfully networked a mac powerbook and a windows laptop, and I now have high-speed internet everywhere in my apartment. Now, I realize that this is what this piece of equipment is supposed to do, but frankly, I was amazed that I was able to figure it out. Because I don't \\"get\\" technology, and I had no idea what I was doing, that's why.So, either it was sheer dumb luck, it's a lot easier to network a mac and a pc to each other, or this equipment is way better than anything else out there. All I know is that if I could figure it out, than you can too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Wireless Range & Security","review":"Bought this Router from Ebay.com. I have MR814 ver.1.I like the version 1 better than version 2.Beware!! MR814v2 has a smaller body and undetachable antennawhile Version 1 is bigger and has detachable antenna.Better Range than Linksys Wireless Router. I place thisRouter on the second floor on my house. I got 50% signalfrom the first floor. A cousin of mine has the Linksysversion. He similarly places the router on the 2nd floor.He got no/low signal from the first floor.I like the security: Disable Broadcast, URL address blocking,Access Filter. Pretty secure for a small office. Keepupdating your Firmware, maybe you can WPA encryption for free.To summarize, low price, excellent range, good security.I take out1 star because of NETGEAR MR814v2, which I think NETGEAR tried to reduce the quality of Version 1 for the sakeof their profit margin."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great read","review":"This book is really interesting and fun. To me it was so good and easy to read that I did not want to put it down. It just sucks you in. This book has been called \\"a great american classic\\" but I do not agree. Even though it's a great read and has a good plot and great characters, I would not call it one of the great classics. I especially liked how the author explained about the characters. This book may start out slow for some readers, but keep with it, it only gets better. I really enjoyed this book. I recomend it to anyone looking for a fun and easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I was getting the actual book","review":"I'm sure the review is lovely, I just thought I was getting the actual book. It was listed right there with the other \\"Great Gatsby\\" books."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Used Than Advertised","review":"This item came from one of Amazon's third party vendors. That vendor claimed the book was in Good condition. Obviously there is a broad definition of the word Good. This book should have been rated fair to poor. At least it had all the pages, but there is writing in the book, highlighting, stained pages (water spill?) and other detractors. On the back cover it even said Very Good, I only hope they meant the story and not the condition.So beware of purchasing used books from some of these vendors, they use condition descriptions very loosly."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst of the so called \\"classics\\"","review":"This book should be pulled from high school curriculum as it really has no redeeming value. Basically if the Fitzgerald name was not associated with it, it would be out of print today.Who really wants to read about a bunch of rich whiners from the Jazz era who smoke and drink too much, have extramarital affairs which result in murder all while using every large word in Websters dictionary to add color to a very unsuccessful writers attempt at literature.Please note that Mr. Fitzgerald's fame was very short lived.Is this really the content we want our young people to become motivated by?Teachers like to use it because curriculum is easy to find and they don't have to really do any real work in creating lesson plans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Flat","review":"I don't know if its just me, but I did not like this book too much. It feels empty- missing something almost. Perhaps it is Nick. He seems to be without a personality. He's just there. The story might as well be told in third person for crying out loud. I like protagonists with personality. Also, the author is quite sexist and racist and that is unacceptable.I did give it two stars becuase to the author's credit, it was a tidy little book and not a sprawing mess. But then, it was too tidy and neat. After finishing it, I thought, \\"so what?\\" It did not particularly dazzle me and enlighten me, and I was not entertained. It is, all in all, a hollow book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Not the real book, just a commentary","review":"I thought this was the real Great Gatsby book with additional commentary, but it is primarily a commentary with little of the original text.This version does not include the complete text of the book like some of the other editions do.The commentary is okay, but not as helpful as some other study guides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Careful! You May Be Disappointed.","review":"I love Guster. I was excited to hear this CD. It's most valuable for the four non-album tracks. The remix of Satellite is sort of interesting if you are a big fan of that song. Their version of \\"Two of Us\\" is fine, although if you've listened to the Beatles' version as many times as I have, you'll notice that Guster changed the rhythm.I also love the song \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\". I was excited to hear Guster perform it and it was my main reason for buying this disc. So I'm sorry to say that the main reason I'm writing a review is to warn people that this version is TERRIBLE. It's not even close to the whole song, but the worst thing about it is that the singer either can't sing or isn't trying. I understand it's supposed to be charming, and maybe if you were at the show it is. That's fine. But it should have been labeled \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart (Terrible version)\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Awful Dr. Orloff (DVD)","review":"This movie reminds me some what of Lugosi's \\"Human Monster\\", but it really doesn't measure up. Somewhat atmospheric, but there really isn't much entertainment value here. If you find dubbed audio tracks distracting, then forget this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Relatively Useless","review":"IMHO, this book left much to be desired as it's examples rely exclusively on the fictious website contained on the accompanying CD. It does not go into any details of FrontPage 2000, merely glosses over the \\"high\\" points in it's 275 pages. While it may be beneficial to some users, I cannot recommend this publication to anybody who wants to construct a serious website.I'm off to order another title concerning FrontPage 2000, which I hope will be much more beneficial than this \\"Step by Step\\" publication."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],N={key:0},R={key:1};function B(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",R,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(x,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-b8cb7d99"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/9.md","filePath":"library/9.md"}'),W={name:"library/9.md"},L=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{G as __pageData,L as default};
