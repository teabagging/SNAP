Tros is an iconic, larger-than-life hero. If you like tales of \\"high adventure\\" and political intrigue, or are a fan of Robert E. Howard (who was inspired by Mundy's works), but are looking for something more substantive than a Hyborian Hack & Slash tale, then the Tros stories are definitely for you.There are a few slow parts throughout the books, where you're thinking, \\"C'mon Tros. Enough talk! Just kill someone for Zeus' sake!\\" Tros is far more patient and subtle than his Cimmerian literary heir, but overall these are a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"It \\"grew\\" on me.","review":"I bought this CD mostly because I heard a few Arias sung by Ms. Gheorghiu and liked her singing enough that I thought I'd give this work a try. This piece is well performed however, it goes from soft to loud and startled me a few times so it can be a little strange adjusting the volume to compensate. As for Ms. Gheorghiu, I wasn't sure what to think of her voice at first in this because I am newer to this genre (I'm a heavy metal \\"convert\\") but hey, I'm trying! Anyway, her voice and the music has grown on me and I think she \\"plays the part well.\\" This composition is not meant to be used in a liturgy...not ever!...and I don't know what Verdi's ideal performance of this would be, but I say she fits the part because the Requiem Mass this is based off of is actually a Mass offered for the holy souls in purgarty that they may have repose into heaven. So, I'd say her darker voice is perhaps the perfect way to express a soul praying to be \\"liberated.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance","review":"I mostly agree with others reviewers. The recording is great, sound is clear (although it's a live performance) and has a great range from pianissimo to full power.The choir is (are, actually, there are three of them!) fantastic, I didn't put 5 stars only for the bass: he'is not at the same level as the others singers, if you look for a ghiaurov or tallvela replacement look somewhere else.Anyway, this is probably the best recording I have ever listened to, wheighting al the pros and cons.Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not fantastic","review":"This is the first recording of this work that I listened to. I was so moved that I acquired several more to see what the difference was and there really is quite a difference. Although I find everything about this recording to be as perfect as it can be sung, what I feel is missing is warmth and passion. I listened to the old Leontyne Price with Ellias, Bjorling and Tozzi and I find it more passionate and moving - at least for me. The classic recording with Zinka Milanov is, well, just that, a classic. Although Zinka has some glitches in it, it is still an incredible performance far different than I have heard or will hear again. Please don't get me wrong on this, I loved this performance of the work - I just found it not as exciting or as warm. I mean, who can beat Price in her exquisit younger days. When she hits the B flat at the end, she nails it and it spins and has energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abbado falls short, again","review":"Abbado had an earlier Verdi Requiem from La Scala that suffered from being underpowered, and this one is similar. It's odd that he can't catch on to the pasionately operatic spirit of this work. Certainly one expects him to, but by halfway through I lost interest entirely. Alagna doesn't rival the best tenor soloists with his grainy voice and blaring manner. His wife Gheorghiu is much better but a bit remote and chilly when she should be warm and reverent. The chorus and orchestra sound fine, but that's not enough in a work that has received great readings from Toscanini, De Sabata, Giulini, Reiner, Karajan, and Fricsay, just to mention a few."},{"rating":"2","title":"another winner from Abbado and Ericson","review":"The performance is amazing. The colors and dynamics are wonderful, as was expected from groups that have been influenced by Eric Ericson's work. And maestro Abbado is always thrilling. One hopes that he recovers quickly from is illness again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Movie, Great Soundtrack","review":"Under The Cherry Moon was Prince's second movie and in a word it's awful. But the soundtrack album, Parade, is anything but. It continues Prince's streak and contains some great songs. \\"Kiss\\" is an immediate classic, with it's skittering guitar riff and Prince singing in a high falsetto, the song shimmies out of your speakers. It became his third number one single. While that is the highlight of the album, other good songs abound including the strangely titled \\"Anotherloverholenyohead\\", the swinging \\"Girls & Boys\\", \\"Christopher Tracy's Parade\\", \\"New Position\\" and \\"Sometimes It Snows In April\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nevermind the movie.","review":"The reason why this was one of Prince's more underrated CDs is becasue (almost) everyone think 'Under the Cherry Moon' ... To me, it was alright. But never under estimate Parade because of that movie. This is a fun CD to listen to, not the best, but worth listening to. I like the catchy drums in 'Life would be so nice' and \\"Christopher Tracy's parade\\". I also liked Girl and Boys and I Wonder U. And I'll never forget about Mountain and Anotherloverholenyohead, my favorite two songs on the CD. Casual Prince fans should at least have this album, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hits and a LOT of Filler","review":"There are few songs as wonderful as \\"Kiss\\" ... certainly none appear on the rest of Parade. AnotherLoverHoleInYoHead comes close with a light Steely Dan approach, and New Position is rubber-band-snappingly good.

Well in my opinion \\"Parade\\" is one Prince album I will always play and love, even today (2000). I sure wish he'd remaster / re-release this with all the b-sides and outtakes. \\"I Wonder U\\" is one of the strangest, most incredible ideas he's recorded. If \\"Around The World in a Day\\" was Beatle-esque, \\"Parade\\" was Pet Sounds meshed with French film soundtracks, and the result is extraordinary.

All togeather, this project is a mix of funk, ballads and mid-range tempo jams that are sure to please and even contains a beautiful instrumental track that, once again, showcases the musical talent of Prince and the Revoloution/Parade.

It is also a 'preview' for Sign because of it's incredibly diverse musical textures. But, it is not as good as 'Sign' is.

A great read for anyone considering product design in any industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside the Magic of Innovation","review":"Prior to this one, the only books I've read in under two days were by J. K. Rowling (I'm over 30, mind you). Its hard to beat Rowling on her story-telling ability, but Kelley comes close in his vivid, engaging and living stories of that magical world called IDEO. This book is a business book, but it is unlike any I've read. It is based on the FACTS and real life experience of a company that is out there living and doing what they preach (and the preaching is so clearly secondary). This was a great read--the writing flows well, and is very conversational. Not every company can be IDEO, but one can dream..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Innovation by Management ?","review":"Book seems to present a wholly \\"management\\" perspective to the Art of Design Innovation. Unfortunately, the author seems so caught up in his rose tinted view of events that most of the process and effort (read \\"real work\\") so necessary for successful Product Innovation hardly gets an honest mention. Is it any wonder that lots of people out there relate so well with Scott Adams' long-suffering Dilbert The Engineer cartoon character?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Art of Innovation: Lessons in Creativity from IDEO","review":"This book was inspirational to me because of the many examples of executing an idea. Since the examples were varied in application and product fields, it motivated me to review ideas that I have and encouraged me to risk launching some of them into the public waters.I bought this book for a few friends of mine because it contains ignitable information. One young friend just graduated college and the other is a seasoned architect whom has stories of his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"IDEO may be great, but this book isn't...","review":"Tom Kelley is vastly more impressed with himself and his company than I am. The only reason the book doesn't get one star is because it does contain some useful information. The useful information is about one-fourth of the book, can be found elsewhere, and probably should be. The other three-fourths is endless self-congratulation and pointless anecdotes. Any ideas he presents are given with no real suggestions for implementation. If you have no background (absolutely NONE) in product design or are just curious about IDEO, it might be worth a read. Otherwise, buy something with real content instead of recycled management bromides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Innovation","review":"This is an entertaining and accessible read. Tom Kelley lets us in on the IDEO philosophy and approach to innovation in product and service design. While there are more appropriate alternatives for studying the mechanics of new product development such as Cooper's \\"Winning at New Products, Accelerating the Process from Idea to Launch\\", this book addresses the often-misunderstood need to create a culture of innovation. IDEO has figured out how to accelerate learning during the \\"fuzzy front end\\" of new product development. A great book for inspiring anyone involved in the new product development process.Kelly includes memorable labels such as the seven brainstorming steps,1. Sharpen the Focus2. Playful Rules3. Number Your Ideas4. Build and Jump5. The Space Remembers6. Stretch Your Mental Muscles7. Get PhysicalHe also includes wonderful examples and stories. The production quality is what you would expect from a design group-great photos and layout. Even the paper feels good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Art of Innovation","review":"Thanks Tom! We're just starting a new technology business and we're wanting and needing to create the sort of culture that you have at Ideo. Our industry is dynamic, so if we're not dynamic then we will not succeed. For us that means innovate - deliver true value to our customers - learn - innovate - deliver more value to our customers, in a continuous cycle. You have given us some practical ideas about how we can ingrain innovation into our culture as we grow. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"There is just one or two (not new) interesting concepts in this book and on top of it, the author could have captured them all in a few pages only. There was not really a good reason to write a this book except for letting us know how incredible IDEO is.In comparison, \\"Ten faces of Innovation\\" is much more informative. Both books are easy to read and entertaining, but lack pragmatic advice. If you have to choose one of them, read \\"ten faces\\" only."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's more than just design","review":"I am a great fan of Ideo and how they have allowed innovation to come out of the basement. The book is excellent, if you learn from examples then this book has the learning you need. If you think you know something about the topic of innovation, then this book is for you because it takes you to another level of understanding. If you are a control person wanting to hid under sheep clothing this book is not for you.A great book for the texture of innovation from one of the masters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A (somewhat dated) infomercial for IDEO","review":"I got to about the halfway point of the audio version and then couldn't get any further.I am impressed with what IDEO has accomplished, and if I were looking for a history of the firm this would be it. As general advice for someone managing innovation, though, it's at best something to skim through for the high points, which could be summarized in two or three pages.Also, many of the suggestions that might have been new in 2001 are \\"old hat\\" in 2009. That fact may actually be a testament to the success of the firm and its methods, but it does make the book less practical for a reader picking it up today.One thing I did come away curious about was how the firm and its clients have dealt with the economic downturn, which affects us all and which calls for creative solutions to all kinds of problems. Perhaps they will come out with a second edition that includes stories from the crisis period..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in Theory","review":"...but so is Cold Fusion.Kelley and IDEO have a great culture for a start-up that has morphed along with their growth. At 300 pages, there isn't much new that is not coverd in the first third of the book.Though it sounds like a great place to work (IDEO), Kelley doesn't really make the case for how an established entity that has a less inviting culture can overcome their environment and obstacles He suggests how it should be (or could be), but not practicle ways to get from points A to B (though he might say I don't think innovatively enough).As others have mentioned here - IDEO has has some great successes, but much of the book reads like a pat on their own back and a list of all their achievements more than it is a management guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"For anyone designing this is a MUST READ!","review":"I bought this book because the synopsis led me to believe it would be a good read and might help me with my design work. I wasn't disappointed. I read it in one week on my spare time - and I don't like to read that much! The information was clear, well written and made me take a new look at design of everything around me. Of course, that could make me a cynic really quickly as I began to see the flaws in various designs and processes. That's a good thing! I would recommend this to anyone interested in or working in design. It has some interesting stories along the way that help frame (or unframe) your thinking about design. GOOD STUFF!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wow of Innovation from a Pioneer on the Frontlines","review":"A beautifully written book that weaves a beautiful tapestry about the process, spirit and culture of real innovators. Lots of people talk about results and proudly display outcomes. Kelley shares his insights on not only how IDEO does it, but how anyone, with an ounce of courage, a spark of creativity and the passion to break out of the box, can do it too. Throughout the book, Kelley's your friend and mentor. By the end, innovation is your partner and passion.Finally, a business book that brings it down to reality AND up to a profound level of inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Long Pat on the Back","review":"The amount of practical information that you can reduce to two pieces of paper. The rest of the book is spent telling us how wonderful IDEO is.

Philip Anderson warns about this in his timeless classic \\"Basic Notions.\\" This book uses QFT in canonical picture (bootstraps), no mention of path integrals. I started out in HEP, so I got trained fairly well in path integrals, some may find this a barrier with the book. Luttinger theory is the most modern topic touched on, applications to materials science.

Lair of the Lion has what could have been an interesting plot and story line. This book might have been so much more. The prose is just awful and makes a potentially great story into drivel. The dialogue alone is over the top sappy, beyond romantic fantasy and destroys any believability of the characters. The character's personalities are fragmented and disjointed to where they don't seem real. The hero's eyes \\"blazed\\" on almost every page. No one, absolutely no one, says the things she has them say. I was very disappointed and her editor did her no favors sending this to print without major revision. I really did like the plot and wish this could be rewritten to make this a better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christine Feehan Rules!!!","review":"Everything I have read written by Christine Feehan is incredible, including Lair of the Lion! The female lead character's courage and determination was inspiring. The male lead character's need for love, acceptance, and companionship was heart wrenching! The romance delicious. Full of intriguing twists and turns, this is a must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I'm a bit disappointed in Christine's book \\"Lair of the Lion\\". How many accidents can one person endure? The curse? What era did this book take place? Secret passages, lions, spirits? The content was boring. However, Christine does a great job in description of the Don DeMarco. This book did nothing for me. I must admit, Christine should stick with the Vampire stories. She's great at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"First off, let me start by saying that I had read an excerpt from this book a few months before it was actually released. The beginning seemed so good that I pre-ordered the book and checked my mail box every day eagerly awaiting its arrival. However, when the book finally arrived I was left wishing I could send it back. The first parts of the book started off so well, but after that everything just diminished. I give the book one star because the sex scenes did indeed sizzle, but this book is a definite testimony that great sex scenes don't make the book.The plot was extremely weak. This whole re-write thing of beauty and the beast was tired and boring. Secondly, the curse left a lot to be desired. The constant peril of the heroine became silly by 6 chapter. The hero seemed whiny and tiresome. Overall, the book was boring.... It took me nearly 3 weeks to finally finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book.","review":"I have read most of Christina Feehans books and enjoyed each of them immensely. This book by far is one of the worst reads I've suffered through in a long time. In fact, I wouldn't have finished the book except I wanted to find out what the malevolent spirit was."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Feehan book Ever!","review":"I am a big Feehan fan, however this book was just bad. I forced myself to read past the first few chapters and it just got worse. It was juvenile at best and did not showcase her truly wonderful writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have bought almost all of Christine Feehan's book, and she's usually right on the money with mixing horror and romance. However, this was just a bad idea from the start. Similar to The Scarletti Curse (another disappointing endeavour), we have a male character who lives in a castle somewhere, and who has an ancient curse that makes everyone hate him. But, then his curse turns out to be something just silly. Lions in the winter in Italy?And, why is it that this curse is so bad? He can turn into a lion. In most books, that would be considered a superpower, not a curse.And, finally, the climax of the book (the breaking of the curse) left me cold. It actually made me giggle when I imagined it.Stick to vamps, Christine. That's where your true talent lies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lair of the Lion","review":"I like most everything by Christine Feehan, but especially loved this one. I couldn't hardly put it down.

I rated it 3 stars only because it's a Christine Feehan novel, and it was good as a suspense novel, but terrible as a romance novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved Lair of the Lion","review":"Was different enough from the Carpathian series, yet still full of curses, angst, and emotion. Loved how headstrong and powerful Isabella was. Liked that I didn't guess the villian (solve the mystery) until it was revealed.Another great Feehan book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time or money!","review":"The story starts out alright, however, takes a noise dive quickly thereafter!

Hopefully her next book will prove it so!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Couldn't Finished It.","review":"I absolutely love Ms. Feehan's Dark Series, and that's why I bought this one. But I just couldn't finish it. Maybe I'll change the rating later...if I ever pick it up again and can finish it, but it's one of the few I had to put down after a while. It didn't hold my interest long enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"OOO La La!","review":"Christine, you have written a masterpiece - don't believe what the negative reviewers have said about your book.I was mesmerized by this intriguing story of love, betrayal, lust, and revenge. Yes, the story did drag on and on a little, and she did wrap a lot of loose ends in the last few pages, but these novels are always about the journey. Personally, this book was very good, it kept me interested, and I had a hard time putting it down. I just fell in love with Isabella. She was such a beauty in a very dark place, and she was strong, assertive, bold, audacious, and she did it all with grace. All I can say is \\"bring a box of kleenex with you when you read this book, even if (especially if) you expect to read in public. Isabella is a true heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monotonous","review":"Engaging characters and great descriptions, but the plot was monotonous and very repetitive. Every chapter revolved around the same scenario. Heroine is stalked by something/someone, heroine \\"feels\\" an evil presence, heroine is injured/terrorized/trapped in some fashion, hero rushes to the rescue and saves the day.Taken individually each chapter is great, but when the same thing happens over and over again it just gets boring..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grrrrrr or should I say meow?","review":"This a beauty and the beast story without much plot or action and absolutely no characterization. On the other hand, once the sex scenes start, they're lusty and frequent, but unforunately not very original.Probably the most irritating aspect of the book is Feehan's use of italicized Italian words. signora, famiglia, palazzo, aristocratizla, cara....If we are to assume that the characters are speaking Italian, why then would some of their words be in Italian and most in English? Endearments would be one thing, but if I have to read the words 'mio fratelleo' one more time I am going to growl.I gave it one star because I had to force myself to finish it. And had it been a library book, I would have just taken it back.I enjoy fantasy plots, but the requisite word here is PLOT, something LAIR OF THE LION lacks.I used to look forward to Christine Feehan's books. But this is my last one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too silly! A real wallbanger.","review":"I am a BIG fan of the \\"Dark\\" books, but this so-called \\"Gothic\\" cannot compare. It takes more than just putting a woman in a long gown and throwing in four or five Italian words to create a sense of time or place.Lacking a believable world, the characters range from silly to frankly fantastical. There is no tension or suspense or mystery.A BIG disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feehan's Version of Beauty & The Beast","review":"Christine has done it again!

Isabella has spent all to get to the Don for help, what will she give him for his help? He will only take the greatest gift she has to give.I loved the book because it shows that love does conquer evil. Even breaking generational curses. This book is one that will hold your interest from beginning to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!!","review":"After the fantastic Carpathian 'Dark' series, I anxiously awaited this newest book, The Lair of the Lion. I was disappointed, to be truthful. It's Beauty & the Beast all over again with some Italian words and phrases thrown in to confuse you. Instead of her father, Beauty has to save her brother. While the Carpathian stories made you believe there could actually be some of these people in existence, I didn't believe in the people in this story, and what's worse, I didn't really care about them and their problems. Sorry, Ms. Feehan, the book really wasn't worth waiting for. Please go back to Byron and Dayan and give us their stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe","review":"What utter tripe.

And most assuredly, Lair of the Lion is a keeper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring-Save Your Money","review":"This book was a big disappointment as well as a waste of time and money. I have read the entire Dark Series which was interesting as well as exciting and very difficult to put down. Lair of the Lion was just the opposite dull, boring and I had to make myself continue to read. There wasn't much chemistry between the main characters and I did not care about them or their problems. Also, the evil presence should have been more fully developed. I hope Ms. Feehan's next book will be written with the flair and style that I have come to love an expect. This book was rated two stars because I finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lair of the Lion - Another great book by Christine Feehan!","review":"Christine Feehan once more writes a great page-turner.I love her \\"Dark\\" series and \\"The Scarletti Curse\\". Her hero/love interests are dark, the heroines light. She holds true to this formula in \\"Lair of the Lion\\". If you have read her books before, (and liked them) you will enjoy this book.Isabella Venaducci needs the powerful don Nicolai DeMarko to help her rescue her brother from imprisonment by a rivialdon. The don DeMarko agrees to help her, but she must marry him to gain his aid. DeMarko has the power to communicate with animals. Isabella can \\"sence\\" strong emotions, both positive and negitive. There are sparks between the two. Ms. Feehancan sure write some steamy scenes! She doesn't fail to do so in this novel.To say much more might ruin the plot, so I say read and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"This book was a read disappointment.

I hated the way within minutes of their first time, he withdrew his offer of marriage and told her he would only take her as a mistress and he would take another bride. Could not believe Nicoli would be so heartless to Isabel. I kept hoping she would get away from that jerk. That ruined the book for me. It made the heroince feel used and betrayed. The ending was also not developed enough, no epilogue. Just a final call for the priest did not make up for the humiliation from his withdrawal of marriage.Although I did not like \\"Lair of the Lion\\" I have loved and read and re-read all other Feehan works and have the entire collection of everything she has written. She has real talent and I am anxiously looking forward to her next releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lair of the Lion","review":"I buy my Kindle books based on the publication date.

It sets up easy and fast and blends in pretty well. Take-down can be a litle confusing and it usually takes me a couple of tries to get it to pack down correctly to fit in the backpack. The backpack is a good feature and makes it really easy to carry. One thing I did not like is the \\"shoot through\\" mesh. This is misleading because on the inside of the blind it clearly states that you should not shoot a firearm or mechanical broadhead through the mesh, so basically you can use a broadhead arrow. I don't use this blind for bow hunting, so that was a big disappointment. The mesh does work really well for concealment though and I am thinking about ordering the optional Total Scent Control for this blind.

Keeps the wind and rain off of you and really helps control your scent being released. I've hunted from tree stands, etc. but these ground blinds have proved to be my best locations to hunt from.

One is they arent very fun unless you get a PREDATOR and Queen. Two is that that in my taste I like the hive alien that you would see in the movie Aliens, but that doesnt really manner.

Sometimes I prefer not to show my knife, which means I don't use the clip and just let the knife lay at the bottom of the pocket. I've found that the Pacific Salt is a bit too heavy and big for carry without the clip, as it falls to a horizontal position and becomes uncomfortable and visually obvious. The Salt I is noticeably lighter, and small enough that it carries much nicer at the bottom of a pocket. The Salt 1 is great for delicate tasks, due to both its shorter and thinner (2.5mm) blade as compared to the Pacific Salt.

It would seem that Mr. Epperson took his journal notes and hodgepodged them into a book. He does present material that leads the reader to believe that Free-Masonry is not entirely about old men doing charitable acts and marching in parades. But, it seems that many of his arguments are reaching and almost vindictive.

According to the masons, if you really want to know the \\"secret\\" all you have to do is look for it.

Do world changing events like our Civil War and Communism have roots that can be traced to Solomons Temple and earlier? What do Albert Pike and the KKK have in common with Karl Marx? Where is the New World order going from here? Is there room for Christianity in worldwide governance? You probably know the answers to these questions already or you wouldn\\"t be actively seeking for the real TRUTH. Epperson has the courage to come forward with the facts about a secret organization that is said to ordain kings and shape governments. The book is well written rife with footnotes and references.

Unfortunately, this book let me down. The \\"New World Order\\" was a 1940's invention of Orwell of 'Animal Farm' fame. While 'Animal Farm' stands as an ironic political satire, readers of 'New World Order' are just too slow to catch the pun. This book falls into the 'New World Order' mold. It repeats the same old Pike, Hall, etc., while failing to digest any of the source material whatsoever. Sad. I would suggest starting with Manley P.

This is difficult but rewarding reading, and a section I think I will be returning to.The final chapters, discussing the future of mankind, environmental issues, and the nature of consciousness, are almost entirely derivative, consisting of rehashed thoughts of others rather than original concepts or explanations.Still the book is well worth it just for the understanding of how life might have come to be and how it developed into what it is today.

Plus sticks better then the wax so no problem with it falling off as installing toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed after 3 Months!","review":"Used this Wax Free Toilet Seal for a new toilet installation in August 2012. Three months later, at the end of November, I come home to see that the “seal�?had separated from the toilet causing water to leak with each flush. I then replaced this piece of junk with a traditional $1.99 wax seal.Stick with what has worked for decades: get a wax ring."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEVER USE A WAX RING AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This product is so far superior to a wax ring. I have used about 10 of them in different properties that I have owned. I have 4 in my current house. It forms a great worry-free seal. It will not collapse like a wax ring. It also solves any floor height issues created by thick stone or tile floors. Wax rings are officially obsolete!!!!!!!!!!!!I recommend lubricating the seal with hair conditioner or lotion before setting the toilet so that it slides into the flange easily. The adhesive on the top of seal that sticks the seal to the toilet is probably sufficient but I also add a bead of silicone around to the seal after pressing it onto the bottom of the toilet. I then let that set up for a few hours before setting the toilet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wax Free May be the Way!","review":"Installed new hardwood floor in the downstairs half bath which raised the toilet about 1/2 inch above the flange. I installed the extra thick reinforced wax ring to compensate. It didn't, the resulting slow leak went undetected for several weeks until the hardwood began to warp and creak. Had to pull up the hardwood and replace, also the swelling hardwood put enough pressure on the flange bolts that they cracked the pvc flange. My choice was cut the pvc pipe from below and replace the flange and level it to the new hardwood or drill through the subfloor, get longer flange bolts and try the waxless seal. I chose the later. Installation was easy and it created a seal in the pipe below the cracked flange. No leak after one month of use, my only concern is how long the adhesive seal will stick on the toilet horn??? So far so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for about a year, then started leaking","review":"I was very excited about this product because I hate dealing with wax rings. We installed it in a new bathroom with a new toilet, so there was no wax residue anywhere. The flange was even with the floor which isn't ideal, but should have been fine according to the manufacturer. The seal worked well for a year, then started leaking. I was hoping to have a long term solution, but it ended up being worse than wax. It was worth a try, but failed far too quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waxing nostalgic","review":"Why would anyone use a wax ring ever again? It's so last century. With the Fernco waxless you will be able to move your toilet around during installation and beyond and never have a wax blowout leak. It's cheap too. Take the toilet out for whatever reason and pop back in. The glue on the ring, in my estimation, will never release. Its make a positive gas seal. This is my second toilet with the Fernco. I'll never go back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wax Ring Killer","review":"I'm sold! No more wax rings. This is the only way that I want to install toilets. I had to install my new toilet bowl twice. The first time I realized my flange bolts were too short. No problem. I just pulled off the bowl from the flange (rubber seal stayed on bottom of toilet bowl perfectly), replaced the short bolts with new longer ones, then placed toilet bowl back over flange. No mess and no leaks afterward! With wax ring I would have to get another wax ring before reinstalling, clean off the old messy wax ring before installing the new one. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"SEAL THE PORCELAIN GOD","review":"the seal is better than beeswax. i found some good tips online, put some clalk around the base seal to seal it extra tight to the toilet and put drinking straws on the base bolts for a easy line up for finding 3 holes at one time . you can feel it go in the hole. and if you put it on and it still skinks, clean it real good and put some bleach it, and let it sit in there it will smell and look good . i like it better than wax .YOU CAN DO IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"This book is AWESOME!!I love it, it is very educational!I used it to write a presentation on Techno Textiles, and I got so much info out of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Install and Helped with Pinch Flats","review":"I put this on right over my existing strip because I was getting a lot of pinch flats.

With a $19.95 price and $9.00 to ship [although $7.75 for shipping was listed], it turns out to be $3.62 for each ounce, adding up to $57.89 for a pound. Then they charge a 15% return fee.

My initial reaction was \\"this player is amazing\\", but after careful viewing of some DVD's I've seen a million times, I discovered that the Denon is guilty of detail removal- images containing subtle color shifts (sunsets, fade-in/outs, ets) will show terrible thresholding errors. A check of another player/TV setup yielded the same errors. I ended up replacing the unit with a Sony DVP-NS90V, which was also cheaper. My conclusion: if your TV can handle HDMI, make sure to do a real world demo of the player you want. Any flaws in the chain from DVD to player to TV will be ruthlessly revealed by today's premium TV's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fushigi Yugi music rocks!!!","review":"This CD is a soundtrack of some of the songs that were written to go with Fushigi Yugi.

Whoa... was I disappointed. Everything seems to be just a set up for a physical gag - which they are both known for. And the story is utterly ridiculous, defying any real believability. But Ball really liked Carol and I suspect just to work with her and promote her on her show was the goal here. Burnett is game and goofy as you would expect, and Lucy seems to enjoy the audiences reaction to her. Surely the execs at CBS must have viewed this wondering if Carol could handle her own show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute book","review":"It's a cute book. My son loves it.

The story itself could have been told in no more than 50 pages (perhaps even less) all in all.Problem is, this is no porn, though some sex scenes are explicit enough, so that the result is simply boring.This is most absurd because the author seems to know perfectly well what she is doing: the writing is neat, characterization accurate and fairly consistent; action scenes, the few that there are, are well developped. How a skilled writer could decide to write a novel about nothing simply escapes my understanding.Another flaw, more linked to my personal point view, is that the author, a woman, simply fails to catch the difference between a woman and a gay man: Neal is a lovable character but he seems to think and act like a woman, surely not like a gay man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decidedly helpful, after digestion","review":"After a long while of chewing on Crow's hundreds of proper names and knot of labyrinthine politics, I can now reflect upon the text with 20/20 hindsight and testify to its utility.

If you too are new to the material, it is probably best to forget about the names and focus on the general motions.

It's got the Y&D: The Prequel theme, Love Struck, the brilliant 'It's not a rule' the theme from Time & Tide, and the acoustic version of 'Bad Habit' among others. It also comes with a great selection of photos of Nic, taken by Nic. It's a great album if you're just in the mood for listening to some Nic because it's got a cross section of his work.

I've reread it many times over since I bought it, and have found it as compelling the 50th time as the first. The way in which Peck gives life to Martin and John, and the parents (lovers, stepparents, exlovers, etc) Bea and Henry in successive stories, changing histories, including other pasts, and including his own life in the story telling, gave me a way to describe a post-modern story to my friends; one in which a non-linear story line could advance a set of characters as well as be self-aware of itself.

Though this story is not part of his main narrative, he shows that the NVN Air Force fought hard, learned from their mistakes, and tried to make the best use possible from their MiGs and SAMs. Two points Michell never makes : first, any NVN pilot who successfully bailed out would land in his home country and would be able to get back into a cockpit; US pilots could only do so if they were rescued, a very complex operation that might involve additional losses. Second, if any NVN pilot did decide to go beyond the GCI-controlled airspace, they might be tempted to defect. Possible? Couldn't rule it out : NVN ground troops defected, and a couple of North Korean pilots have done so over the years.

David Astels' book gave me a chance to get a little down and dirty with the technique and some of its associated frameworks.Maybe too dirty? As others have said, the source code in Part III of the book doesn't do what the book describes; you need to go to Mr. Astels' web site and get updated source code.I found the coverage of Java frameworks (in part II) to be very helpful; it expanded my understanding of what TDD techniques can be used."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First TTD book, and a great one","review":"This was my first book on TDD, and I thought it did a great job of explaining the concept and working through it step-by-step.

HOWEVER, I find myself wishing for a 5.1 DTS mix, or even a Dolby. Don't get me wrong, the sound is passable, but it's basically the CD track. They seem to have boosted the low end considearbly, and I find myself turning down the subwoofer a bit on some tracks. I guess I'm a bit of an audio enthusiast, but that's the way it is.

A piece of the earbud popped off and broke after a few weeks, so I had to get a warranty service to get them replaced. Sony shipped me back the wrong color, so I had to ship those back to get the right color. Those broke in two weeks. I was very careful with both pairs...they just broke.

Sound quality is the best I have ever heard from very small phones. The bass quality is so exquisite that I had to turn down the volume to protect my eardrums. I love the neck chain style. The ear buds take a little getting used to. It is quintessential that the proper buds are used. The buds need to fit snugly into the ear to feel the bass. The only problem I have with this fantastic device is the cable. The connector is a bit heavy and pulls on the left phone while walking. A shirt clip should fix this problem.

I enjoy falling asleep to soft music and the small size of these ear buds is ideal for that. I found them comfortable to wear even with my head lying on top of the ear buds. I found the wiring to be somewhat cheap in construction and the lower frequency to be the quality of that of less expensive models. I am not as concerned with the lower frequency issue while I am falling asleep, but I would definitely recommend other ear pieces for daily music listening.

The first week they were great sound-wise, though I found they fell out rather easily when the cord was jogged on my work commute.

My wife spent $50 at the Mac store for these (Christmas presnt) but they sounded so incredibly BAD! We exchanged them for the same model, hoping it was a fluke. Nope... the new pair suck just as much! Just to give you an idea... there was very little discernable difference between any of the EQ settings on my iPod. I tried Bass Boost, Trebble Reducer... practically nothing! Just teeny-tiny-tinny sound. And I really didn't find them very comfortable. I am going back to the store tomorrow and will probably just get my money back. Absolutely DO NOT BUY THESE! I don't understand how Sony could've put these on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sound is good, everything else sucks","review":"These earphones do sound good and they are cheap. However, the design is horrid. The earbuds wont stick in your ears, and they hurt when you jam them in. They will fall out constantly. The cord is ridiculos, either way too long with the extension, or way too short with out. The cord is also uneven, with a weird silver sony logo which hangs by your cheek. Also, the cord is very cheap and thin. Will probably break in a few months. The design team should all loose their jobs, because these suck big time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect if you only have one ear!","review":"I have purchased two pairs of these earphones and both have ended up with sound coming from only one ear within about 90 days. Don't worry both times it was just after the warranty expired. Why did I purchase a second pair? I don't know. They are also terrible for working out. If you don't hold the cord while running you will hear a nice thumping noise every time the cord hits your body. It's a great unwanted bass line. I highly recommend not wasting your money on this product. You will be using your Apple earphones in a matter of weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst I've Ever Used","review":"These earbuds are absolutely the worst I've ever used.

They're junk, period."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like these headphone at all!","review":"I will say that the sound the headphone's produce is top quality, which can be directly attributed to its bud-style design BUT the headphones were completely awkward. I did not like how the left ear cord was so much shorter than the right ear and I disliked having to use an extension piece while working out. They are definitely a high maintenance piece of equipment for something that should be fairly simplistic to use. Begrudgingly, I am back to using the original iPod earphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fontopia headphones - not good","review":"I purchased these headphones becuase they were rated as good for working out and running. I do not agree. They have great sound, however the cord is too short and the extention piece knocks around when you run with them. I wear my ipod attached to my shorts, so the cord needs to be long enough to reach my waist from my ears. These are NOT the headphones for this purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, bad quality!!! Two pairs shorted out!!","review":"I came across these headphones when I first bought my MP3 player and fell in love with them. They do a great job of blocking outside noise and allow you to listen to your music at lower volumes. I honestly heard things in songs I never had before. The sound quality is great!However, my first pair of headphones shorted in the right channel. I bought another pair and a few months later another short, this time from the left channel. Luckily my MP3 player has two audio outs, but it's ridiculous that these are so fragile. After paying ~$80 on two headphones I am extremely disappointed. Buyer beware!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best buds I've ever owned","review":"I have had many ear buds over the years and these are by far the best I've ever owned. I've read 30+ audio books while doing yard work and my cord hasn't shorted out yet even with all the tugging and pulling while working..the plugs even stay in my ears all night if I fall asleep listening to a book...I know it's just a matter of time before I'll cut my cord with the clippers and have to replace them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Sound Imaging with Detailed Bass","review":"I've tried many earbud type units and have found the Sony to be the best I've used. I'm a musician and I pay attention to details in recordings and have found that overall, these earbuds provide faithful reproduction.The bass is much better than the standard iPod buds but isn't boomy like the Koss Spark Plug, instead it's clearly detailed and specific. My biggest gripe with these was that I occasionally found the highs to be a bit intense but found that after using the unit for about two weeks, the drivers seemed to break in and the sound rounded out nicely.Last thing - I find them to be the most comfortable I've used. I go to sleep every night wearing them and since I sleep on my side, it's always been a challenge to find a pair that is comfortable with your ear against the pillow. These are perfect for that. And I can remove the cord extension and keep my Nano in my front pocket...the cord length is just right for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, new ear bud design","review":"There are a great replacement for any stock ear bud you might get with your media player. The last pair I bought broke in about a month, but this new set has a redesigned ear bud and I don't think they will be breaking anytime soon. Very comfortable in-ear headphone. I use mine at the gym and on the Metro. They block out the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound, but flimsy wires","review":"This is my second pair of these buds.

They have great bass response and block most outside noise. My only complaint is the cord length. It comes with an extension but that only makes them to long. The cord is perfect if you are using these with an MP3 armband."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Ear Will Die","review":"Love the sound these put out, they are by far the best pair of earbuds I've ever had.HOWEVER, one ear invariably dies. I use mine every day on the bus to/from work and after about three years I am on my seventh pair. Another pair just died this morning; no more sound from the left ear. Due to the \\"molded\\" nature of the earbuds themselves you can't really open them up and check connections easily.Makes me think I should just pony up a couple hundred bucks for a nice pair of Shures or something similar with a good warranty instead of throwing money down the drain on these great sounding but poorly constructed headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony forgot the bass!","review":"I bought these for my iPod Touch the other day and was disappointed by the weak bass that these ear phones produce. I had to set the EQ to \\"Bass Booster\\" just to get a better response from the thing. Don't waste your money on these since they will fail in providing a full range of sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"sony earphones","review":"I wanted these in black but the white ones were ten bucks cheaper, they're comfortable and they sound good, the bass is there and i have no complaints whatsoever"},{"rating":"2","title":"Work great... until they don't work (if you know what I mean)","review":"Well, I've had these for about 4 years and just recently the right bud just doesn't want to pump the volume out as it used to. I can hear just a bit coming out of it but I've tried everything to fix them and it won't get louder. I'm up for another pair I guess!Otherwise, I love it for the short cord option where I plug my mp3 player on my left arm. Works great and the music is very clear. Like others, the bass is not the best but then again I don't need to be blasted on that part when running. I would recommend these as I'm getting another pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable with great sound","review":"I was looking for a set of headphones with a long cord and happened upon these through some searches. They have a nice long cord, and fit well in the ear and unlike other ear-buds, these are actually comfortable and you can wear them for long periods of time. These headphones have great sound and cut out any external noise that you get from other ear-bud type headphones. Great quality from Sony - I recommend them highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible sound!!! Makes me long for tin cans and string.","review":"I am so disappointed with the sound quality of these headphones. I cannot wear the ipod nano buds, because they are too big for my ears. So, I thought these $50 Sony buds would be great! I thought, oh la la, how fancy, different sizes...WRONG! Tinny with reverb. The ones that came with my ipod sound much better even when I'm just holding them up to my ears. Don't waste your money. If you do buy them, try these alternative (and better) uses: glue scrubbies on them, and use them to clean between your bathroom tiles...or, use the cord as a self-defense weapon if needed...or, get artsy and fashion a groovy necklace by braiding the cord and using the buds as pendants. All three would be better than listening to the crap that comes out of these headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre sound, mixed ergonomics","review":"I bought these in a pinch while traveling after I inadvertently left my Bose ear buds behind.The good:- They stay in my ears very snugly (something I can't say about the Bose pair)- The cord, while thin, resists tangling (again, unlike the Bose pair)- The price: they're relatively inexpensiveThe bad:- Biased toward the treble frequencies to the point of having a shrill, ice-pick sound. At times, this becomes downright uncomfortable- Weak bass, to put it mildly.- Weird design doesn't provide a symmetrical Y-split: the lead to the right ear is considerably longer. The result is that even a slight tug on the main part of the cord tends to pull the left bud out of your ear.I wouldn't buy these again, even at the low price. Stock iPod buds from Apple are only a little more and have much better sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Annoyed","review":"One I opened the packaging and tried these out, I felt like punching something. The left channel is considerably less in volume than the right one - a switch in sides proves this. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away!!! :-(","review":"What a mistake to purchase this headphone. I thought of this as an upgarde to my SONY MDRE828LP headphones I have been using for more than a year on my iPod. I should not have bothered wasting my money. These are absolutely awful sounding and awkward to wear. The bass is virtually non-existant and the sound is flat as bread. The assymetrical wiring configuration for the right and left side with a fixed connection point is a joke. It feels like someone is pulling on the short end of the wire when you wear the headphone. The earpiece feels comfortable to wear but I could not put it on more then 5 minutes since the sound was so bad. My old headphone sounds a whole lot better all of a sudden! ...Don't bother considering this headphone over other options, even the ones who are lot cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy!","review":"I bought these awhile ago when my iPod earplugs stopped working. I was initially happy with these. However the wire on the Left and Right side are different lengths.

I've tried everything to adjust them properly to my ears, but it's just a bad design.

I was using them with a Sandisk M250 player, and the factory supplied ones, and my cheapie Sennheiser over-the-ear headpohnes sound infinitely better.I experimented around with different size ear pieces and trying to place them in my ear differently, with no success. I tried them on an FM radio I also own, and they seemed no better there.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"these are the UPGRADED version!","review":"the previous model Sony MDR-EX71SL had a problem with the case(didnt keep the wires from getting tangled) and the cord(the insulation was too fragile). in this model, sony fixed those issues. the case has a different design that keeps the cord from getting tangled and the cord is made of a more sturdy material.as far as i am concerned, these headphones are perfect now. good job sony!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, horrible wiring","review":"I'll admit it, these are the best sounding bud style headphones I've ever used. What I didn't like was the fact that the wiring basically rotted on me, for lack of a better word. Before I knew it, there were entire lengths of cable that were exposed when the shielding began to deteriorate. And this wasn't even three months after I purchased them that this began to happen.The headphones still worked but it becomes a bit of a drag when you're listening to headphones that look like something you fished out of the garbage. Not only that, I know at least three other people that this happened to as well, so I know this isn't an isolated thing.If they haven't fixed the wire issue, I suggest you go with something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I mainly use these for listening to audio while I sleep.In the summer I have 2 fans running an these do a good job of blocking the noise so I can hear the music.they don't look high-end but they sound like it!clear highs, even mids, just the right amount of bass in the soundThe now new non-Y-cord design isn't problem depending on what side you place them."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!","review":"For those people who would like a good pair of earphones, these are the ones. They are not uncomfortable as earphones usually are, you can keep them on forever! The sound quality is also amazing. Some of the reviews are right: the further inside your ear, the better you will have bass. However, isn't that what we all do with earphones anyways? At least these ones are comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"good sound, short life","review":"Have owned two pair. Positive: very comfortable good sound. Negative: very fragile, they pull apart, fall apart, what have you. Both sets came undone where the two earcords meet, one set the cord developed bare spots which I had to cover with tape. The other pair, the earbud trim disintegrated when I tried to replace the rubber ear pad (these fall off easily by the way). Neutral: you need higher volumes to drive them than most similar headphones. For $15 or $20 good throwaway deal, but not economical to pay more for so short a useful life."},{"rating":"1","title":"good sound, cord length too short","review":"I like these headphones for sound but the basic cord length is just a tad too short for use at the gym (to plug into the machines) or for use with a shuffle if you want to clip it to your pocket. The extension cord makes it too long and inconvenient.

No more extra two feet of wasted cord to get in the way. The new hard case is a little big, but sturdy, and protects the phones nicely when they end up at the bottom of my briefcase.I would've preferred the black ones; too bad they weren't available when I bought mine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value for Money","review":"Bought this item a month ago and find it really a great value for the money.

They last about a year with everyday office use. I have had 1 set which I bought a long time ago, black with the rubber deteriorating away I bought a new set. The black set lasted for a few years, and were great. Three white pairs followed with the same problem on all of them with a much shorter life span. The first set started to short out on one ear bud, I had to try and wiggle the cord to get both ear buds working. I figured this was something I did and bought another pair. The same thing happened to the next pair, I was reluctant to buy another set, but it appeared they redesigned the product where the buds split. This final pair has done the exact same thing, one ear bud shorts out. I unfortunately will have to try another brand. Be cautious if you are buying for everyday use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a year","review":"The headphones sound great and are comfortable as they come with three sizes of ear buds. This is my second pair of headphones over two years. I have come across the same problem as some of my friends, they only last about a year. At a price of around $25, I'm fine with buying a new set each year. Overall, sounds great until one ear goes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality headphones!","review":"These headphones are absolutely phenomenal.

They have fantastic sound and rich bass that sound great on my white MP3 player. The sound isolation is superb due to the three sizes of ear fittings.After a year and a half though, the cords rotted. The cables deteriorated, exposed the wiring and short-circuited. It is an extreme disappointment that these great sounding phones would break, but the cables just fell apart.

They have stood the test of time for me and that is about all you can ask for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Love the headphones.

The first one lasted 9 months before it collapsed. The second one lasted 4 months before the right side stopped working.

Good, rich sound! Very comfortable ear buds and a few different sized cushions.The only detracting quality would be the new cord design whereby one side is shorter than the other and the cord is meant to go behind your neck...Um, don't really care for that style, but maybe it'll grow on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"boy, do I feel dumb","review":"I paid fifty dollars for these at the Apple store on the recommendation of a friend. I agree with the reviewer who noted that the extension makes the cord too long. Unless you have an armband, without the extension it is way too short to be much good. One of the reasons I bought the headphones was that I thought the sound quality would be far superior to the ones that came with my Nana. Wrong. The quality is unbelievably tinny. I am amazed how much better the default headphones sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am very unhappy","review":"I am so unhappy. I ordered my headphones and did not get them. I sent a request to have it resent. I noticed that somehow it was going to an old address and I let them know that it was wrong. The billing was correct but the shipping was wrong. I got an email saying he was resending it but it was again to the wrong address. I sent a request to correct it immediately but it still never came. I sent another email telling them I had not received my items and wanted my money back. This has been over a month now and I still do not have my items or my money back.

That's what you get when you buy online instead of a real store like CC which has unbelievable good service."},{"rating":"1","title":"good sound, and that's about it.","review":"I bought these headphones for my iPod to replace my broken original iPod headphones. What a mistake. The left and right cords after the \\"splitter\\" are wonkey and unequal (the left is about 6\\" long the right is abotu 14\\") so if (God forbid) you drop you iPod your left ear is in for quite a rip, compared to \\"normal\\" headpones where the jolt would be spread evenly. The encluded extesion cord is nice but, why not just make the cord longer to begin with? That's just one more bulky connector I have to wrap around my iPod when not in use. If you want a nice sounding head phones these are ok at best, but it's not worth your $50 for the hassle of the horrible ergonomics. DO NOT BUY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Durable At All","review":"These have a good sound, no complaints, for the price range they are easily the best in audio quality I have heard.I have to rate this one star because in my opinion Sony has definitely implemented too short of a planned obsolence lifecycle for this product.I only use them in two environments - sitting at my computer and because I am a hobbyist concert taper I will occasionally use them when recording a show just for a sanity check to make sure I am not getting cable static or other artifacts that would not show on my meters.I do not exercise or jog with them or anything like that. Use while sitting and just carrying around is not exactly a lot of wear and tear. My third pair in less than a year just died. Always the same thing - one of the connections inside the bud construction starts to get static and within hours they are shot. That is not coincidence.Although I love the sound, sorry I will not buy another Sony earbud product of any kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony MDR-EX71SLA","review":"I had heard from others that the design on these was poor but I bought them anyway. Trust me in that you will be dissapointed in every way. The cord is way to short and won't reach your ears and when you put on the extension it is way to long and gets in the way and is too heavy. The left ear cord is way to short and the right ear cord is way too long which is a seperate problem than the cord being too short or long. I am surprised that Sony's design team let this pass. Stay away, trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubber Disintegrates","review":"Do not sweat when you wear these. If you live in Florida do not buy these. The thin rubber covering the wire from the earbud to the junction of the left-right cords will not withstand human sweat. It then deteriorates upon friction with head, hair, skin, clothes, you name it. Worth maybe $10 because you WILL have to replace them. However, MasterCard will honor a replacement if you have Gold or Platinum. It is part of the guarantee. It will not take even one year for any amount of normal perspiration to disintegrate the rubber on these Sonys. Buy them only if you are planning to do the warranty service through your credit card. Sony warranty is useless. Amazon of course is nonexistent after 30 days. On the upside, they are very comfortable and have a number of ear sizes. Moot points. Put your money on higher quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"a cultural, lovely doll.","review":"this doll was a wonderful thing, for me to see in a store. it really teaches kids about other cultures, and other places in the world. it really made me think of england, and other beautiful places in the universe. i do not have this lovely doll, but i named her rose pinkette. i think its a lovely name for a lovely doll."},{"rating":"2","title":"English Princess","review":"I am an adult collector who is collecting the Princesses of the World.

Even the little ramp you can buy separately is only about 8 inches long and doesn't really make the beans do too much. They just sort of slide down the ramp. Big whoop. My son, age 5, thought they were neat for about 10 minutes. Also, if you think about it, they cost about a buck a bean. If you saw them sold individually, you probably wouldn't be willing to shell out $1 for one.

There is no scandal mongering about the 'merchants of death' or military - industrial complex here, although those lobbies are present. Unlike 90% of other popular commentators on the problem, he goes beyong the politically convenient, politically partisan, single cause diagnosis to show how hollywood, domestic politics (red vs blue), the post-vietnam army reform agenda and other factors have turned the US from a historically anti-militarist nation into the most heavily armed state on the planet. Bacevich's \\"multivariate\\" diagnosis unfortunately implies there is no quick, single pill, cure either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough and surprising","review":"Andrew Bacevich's \\"The New American Militarism\\" is a wide-ranging and well-written discussion of the events leading up to our culture of glorification of the military and the current ideas about the use of pre-emptive force.Among other topics, Bacevich provided a good review of Neocons and Conservative Christians and how their ideas steered US policy towards a more militaristic stance. He also discusses how the US dependence on foreign petroleum has influenced our policy in the Middle East.He finishes by offering \\"ten fundamental principles\\" outlining how we might stand down from the dangers inherent in our hyper-militarism.On the whole, I thought this was an interesting and well-balanced review of recent U.S. military history as it relates to current domestic and foreign policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here we go again.","review":"I do not think military or ex-military people should write about war.

It is very convincing and rings true - there is no sensationalism or dogma - and explains why we are here and why we face difficulties in life.

I've always been curious about afterlife, but stray away from the really kooky stuff. It has to make sense to me. I've read a couple hundred books on religion, paranormal & psychic studies and beliefs. I seem to always return to Newton's studies of life between lives. They make me comfortable about eventually crossing over myself (I'm 60). I feel I'm just a curious 'seeker'of truth.While reading his books I feel I have increased ablilty to give comfort to my patients at a hospital(though I rarely offer my opinion on the subject of life after death unless asked).

What I found instead was a lot of obvious fantasy. The author claims to have a Ph.D., but he doesn't say from where and in what, so you have to assume he bought it from a diploma mill. He says he hypnotized many people who told him about past lives and the spirit life in between, but he never asked for proof that the past lives they claim could have existed. No details that could be verified were mentioned, just stories about bright lights and separate heavens and councils of elders to punish bad people. He writes what people like to hear, but without a shred of evidence it becomes garbage.

Michael answers many questions about the afterlife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful testimony for the existence of life between lives","review":"Of those books on the market that discuss the world of life between lives, Newton's appears the most clinical and objective. He is at his best when providing us excerpts of sessions with clients who share information about LBL. As a hypnotherapist, he does not appear to lead clients to describe their experiences. The result is powerful testimony for the existence of LBL. So, unless Newton is a very talented writer of a provocative work of fiction, both Journey of Souls and Destiny of Souls offer us an intuitive, reassuring way to better understand and appreciate one another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expands on First book","review":"Mr. Newton expands on the work of his first book with plenty of new information. This book, as the first, is written based on information that Michael Newton has gained from hundreds of clients that have experienced life \\"on the other side\\", or in heaven.

That was the final straw in this book, a veritable crock of fertilizer. I finally gave up trying to go along with this book, even as a form of entertainment.

I am very happy with the purchase. However, I have found that after time the ends do get slightly loose and vibrate out over time. This is easily solved by gently squeezing them tighter with pliers again.For the money, these are excellent value and a very good quality audio product that is well shielded. I've had no interference or hum from the cables what-so-ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dregni dissappoints","review":"Like all guitar players, I was excited when this book came out. In fact, I bought it hardcover for $30 at a local bookstore. When I got home, I dove in...more like fell into an overly-comlicated, wordy, and mostly speculated work. I read through so frustrated that a writer could do all this research and then write THIS! Dregni writes in detail about the fierce stares in photographs, and makes baseless hypostheses on characters, yet mulls over other details.Still, this will undoubtedly become the bible for Gypsy Jazz fans because of it's inclusiveness. Don't be fooled by the hype. This is a bad book full of great information."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read so far","review":"Having discovered Djangos music only recently and also having watched a documentary about his life I felt it only fair to read about the man in a biography.So far an unfinished read but none the less a well presented and fascinating book about a quite remarkable man .Im looking forward to the final chapters to see how all works out for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calling All Jazz Lovers...","review":"If you love the genius of Django Reinhardt, this book reveals every important, fascinating detail of the artist's life.

This product holds about 6-8 regular size wrapping paper rolls, gift bags, bows and tissue paper. The little flip part that holds the extras is good for tape, scissors, tags and a few (like 3) bows. The section doesn't hold a lot but it does the trick. You may need more than one depending on how much you'd like to store. I really like this product because I'm able to put a few gifts bags in with the rolls of paper and a sleeve of tissue paper and store in a closet while the rest of my Christmas paper is stored in the garage for seasonal use.

Especially those featuring the vocals of bassist Richard Bona. Metheny doesn't own the sound however and Mike Stern's resume stands on it's own. Stern's sound has a much harder edge to it and the jazz-funk numbers on the album are smokin. \\"These Times\\" is not really a \\"guitar hero\\" album. There are breathtaking solos but there are times that Stern is content to sit back and add color and texture to a song. This is a total band effort. I'm sure the all star supporting cast helped. I would say if you're a Metheny fan, check this out. However, I'm betting that if you know one man, you probably already know the other. Excellent stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diappointed Again","review":"What is it with today's jazz musicians? They have to deviate from what they do best and try to become more mainstream. The first cut leads one to believe that this will be a smokin Stern album form there it goes downhill and fast. The mix of \\"smooth jazz\\" with vocals really bummed me out.

I would say that maybe 25% of the information was useful. Unfortunately, books covering this category seem to be rather scarce, so there are not too many other options."},{"rating":"2","title":"A serious, well-written book","review":"This book uses weather maps as a central motif.

The animation is crisp and stunning and the visuals are breathtaking! This is a story about true endurance of love and the struggle for control between Heaven and Earth. Fans of \\"Oh! My Goddess\\" should definitely add this to their collection. The story is strong and character development is good. The sudden twist toward the end will take you to the edge of your seat . This is a movie that all viewers can enjoy! It's a must to have for your anime library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie!","review":"Ah! My Goddess! is an excellent movie. If you're a fan of the Oh! My Goddess! OAV series, this is a must see. It doesn't even matter if you never have seen the OAV series either. I haven't seen the series, but I still loved the movie. And, living up to the Pioneer tradition, the DVD makes the already beautiful animation even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best I've seen","review":"I thought this was the movie. I loved the animation, and how the story was place in order. Though some of it was quit confousing. Watching made me change my idea on it. At first I thought it was going to be a boring one, but after watching the movie I went on the net to look for the series. One word of advice, watch the series before the movie so you know how Belldandy and Keiichi meet. It will be alot less confouseing. But overall, I loved it; and this is about the only one I love. So if your into fantasy and some action get this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice movie","review":"I enjoyed this move alot. I love the show so I love the movie.

This movie not only captured the sweet and wonderful personality of Belldandy but it also gives you an intirely new look at the life of the kind Goddess before she becaome a Goddess.

This movies is something that the whole family could enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"goddess movie","review":"you can't beat the art work in this movie. the colors and style are very well done. the music is also very well done i really liked the climatic scenes song. the only problem is you need to have some background information on the main characters or the story seems like a book where you don't have the first 100 pages. i suggest either read the manga or watch the anime series before watching the movie to have that background information."},{"rating":"2","title":"No experience with OMG required, movie still great!","review":"I've no experience with the Oh! My Goddess series, except for drawings some fans sent me. The art on the package was enough to sway me to buying the movie, and it's a purchase that I don't regret. The story was easy to follow and kept me interested the entire time. The animation is top notch, and the sound is great. There are moments where the amdient sounds seem to drown the dialog, but that is likely a problem with my system and not the DVD. If you're of fan of extras, the stills in the gallery are awesome, and the pencil board is kewl. I'd say this is a must for any anime collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great animation movie","review":"Many people complain that the story of \\"Ah!

The word masterpiece comes to mind when I think about it. I recently got the chance to get Hidenori Matsubara's autograph (He did the character design for the movie) and along with his signature he did a small sketch of Belldandy. I have got to say that still makes me smile everytime I see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This was a very good movie. I liked it especially because I haven't seen the OVA series and was still able to understand what was going on.

I would tell anyone that likes anime to get this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Film","review":"I bought the Ah! My Goddess movie about a year and a half ago from Amazon.com, and I thought it was wonderful. I first watched it on a late night and I was little tired after it. It can be confusing at times, because the storyline is so complex, but after you watch it a few more times it should all come together. As for the animation, it's top notch. Beautiful work, the stand-out scene for me is when the goddesses sing with their angels at the end of the film. You shouldn't be disappointed, especially if you are an AMG fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You have not seen beauty until you're seen this movie...","review":"There is only one way to describe this movie--jaw-dropping. Visually it is a work of art. The storyline is original, well-explained, and even manages to fit in with the creator's skewed idea of Norse mythology. The voice acting in both versions is top-notch. I wish I could give this more than just five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, however","review":"This is a great movie, don't let my negative tone tell you otherwise. It features beautiful artwork and a story that can teach us all a few lessons. Why didn't I give it 5 stars then? Because in my personal opinion, it kind of violates the whole feel of Oh! My Goddess. It starts out great, there is still the romantic overtones as well as plenty of humor to be found (the scene where Tamiya is in the muscle suit trying to convince people to join the auto club was hilarious!) but that soon stops as Celestine arrives on the scene. After the first half hour there is scarcely a humorous moment to be found, which is different from the oav's where they mixed humor and romance very nicely. Overall, any OMG fan shouldn't be without this, and if you aren't an OMG fan, then I suggest you become one, but I think that this film could have been better if they hadn't strayed too much from the feel of the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Computer Ever","review":"I was too poor to pay for an expensive computer and too impatient to wait for a Dell to be delivered, so I bought a Compaq Presario. It was one of the worst choices I've ever made. The computer is slow, slow, slow--and right after the guarantee expired, everything that could go wrong, did. First, my keyboard started having trouble, and one entire line of the keyboard died: so I had no \`9,' \`o,' \`l' or periods.Then the computer stopped charging. First I thought it was the charger, so I got a new one. Nothing. Then I was told it was the battery. I got a new one. Still not working. So now I have a computer that has no power, all my information is stuck in my dead laptop, and I have made a resolution to never, ever, buy any product from Compaq."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, but need improving","review":"I've searched extensively for a software like this one because it starts you off with the basics, but it is not user friendly. It continually hung up my system and flashed errors. I wish they would do something to improve it in these areas. I would certainly repurchase it if they did. I had to call in a computer tech to get my system back to operating properly. I loved the individual they had introducing the lessons. She made it so clear. This is the type of software I need. Please improve it and send notification. The exercises were exciting and challenging. It's good, but definitely needs improvement. I own other Spanish software, but compared to the way their lessons are set up, this one is best to me. I need to begin with basics, and this one does it; especially when she explains about verb conjugations. It also starts you off with greetings. The others I have don't. They throw you right into nouns and verbs. I like this one of all and pray that you improve it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock Four Rocks","review":"I love this album. I am a baby boomer who grew up with The Beatles and The Byrds. If you like the electric 12-string Rickenbacker sound, this one if a must!

His writing is often quite dark and sinister, but I suppose it's because *he's travelling in Soviet Russia*. Also he tends to go on an on in eyelid-heavying excruciating detail about anything related to art: paintings, sculpture, music, literature, you name it. On the other hand, the book is informative (though not comprehensive), and it is in general a very good read. The experiences, true or not, are remarkable. Thubron's writing and language are also very good... I suspect he'd make a very good fiction writer (no sarcasm intended)."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't tell zoey","review":"dieses buch finde ich sehr gut wie alle anderen bücher auch ich finde es schade das benjamin immer noch blind ist falls jemand mal mit katherine applegate reden sollte soll doch BITTE sagen das sie nicht nach band 28 aufhöhren soll zu schreiben!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FALLEN ANGELS TELLS IT LIKE IT IS","review":"When Fallen Angels Fly gives the reader a hard look at the real world.

The surprisecomes at the end which I'm not going to give away, butI will say, the 'behind the scenes' gives you ahilarious glimpse into how it was made.

This movie tries to be cute by making the plot difficult to follow, but the problem is that the story sucks, and the plot has gaping holes in it and the movie never makes any sense. Some movies are difficult to follow leaving the viewer to make some conclusions on his own like Dario Argento's great \\"Suspiria\\", but this movie just does not make any sense. The acting in this movie is atrocious, the movie doesn't flow well, the script is terrible and there is no atmosphere whatsoever.

And arguably, she had the shortest working life. Her one battle cruise is obviously the stuff of legends. The sinking of the 'Hood' in just a couple of salvos. In turn her getting hit by a torpedo in exactly the place where it would cripple her.This book is one of the 'Anatomy' series by the Naval Institute Press. It has a fairly complete description of the ship. For instance, the three types of armour were classified as KC, Wh, and Ww. KC armour was made by Krupp, was face hardened armour steel containing 0.34% carbon, 3.78% nickel, 0.32% manganese, 0.2% molybdenum and 2.06% chrome.Most of the book, however, is composed of drawings, hundreds of drawings showing every aspect of the ship.

They are correct about one thing: tolerance for everything is unsustainable and, yes, immoral and unethical.However, that does not justify the intolerance of fundamentalist dogma, which promotes intolerance for everything that opposes their narrow view of people and the world. Sustainable tolerance is premised on respect for all people, and an honoring of everyone's worth and dignity.McDowell and his ilk are correct that not everything is tolerable. One thing that is not is the intolerance promoted by this latest under-the-table apologetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliantly made, but distastefully sensual and emotionally excessive","review":"This is a movie I felt was strongly enough distasteful I had to write an Amazon review against it. Alfred Hitchcock himself was notorious for pushing the limits on sexual decency in his movies, and I'm sure would have been more explicit in this movie if he could get away with it at the time. It's said to have the most sensual kiss scene in movie history--it turned my stomach because of the steamy passions of the main characters. It also gripped my attention with suspense, but the extreme melodrama and lack of moral boundaries to the characters was unwholesome and made me almost nauseous. A movie can have all the artistic achievement in the world, which this one does, but if it's a turn-off, then so what? I judge a movie based on whether it has something to offer me besides just emotional excesses--and this one doesn't. This movie is aptly named \\"Notorious\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool Imaginative Book","review":"Bought this book for my 1.5 yr old. He loves looking at the images.

It is about the soldiers themselves, the fighting troops who get their hands dirty doing the actual work.

The problems explained in each chapter do not at all reflect the difficult problems in the end-of-chapter exercises. Also, this book is very weak in explaining vecor addition, which is a very important principle in Physics that is frequently required to do the end of chapter problems. All this, combined with weak illustrations, makes this a TERRIBLE book for anyone interested in learning physics. This book leads me to believe that Beiser is a terrible author.

Also, before reading the book, one should read up on Irish history. I had no idea what the 1916 uprising was and from the book, it is expected that all readers would know what it was about.

The novel is a true treasure, but be warned that, at least initially, it may be difficult to adapt to the rhythm of O'Neill's prose. Once you do, oh, it's heaven. At Swim, Two Boys is a story of love--love for one's country and romantic love. It takes place in Ireland from 1915-1916 and concludes with the Easter uprising in Dublin. In the year leading up to the uprising, two young Irish men, Jim and Doyler, fall in love while all the time being watched over, looked after, pursued by MacMurrough, a man some years their senior. MacMurrough is working towards both a fee Irish nation and a free gay nation and is haunted by voices that plague him through the novel. The story is wonderful, engaging and well-told. The writing is beautiful. Let it amaze you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just love Christine's Dark books!!!","review":"It's so hard for me to pick a favorite of Christine's Dark books because I love them all but this one just may be it!!

I would highly recommend this book as well as all of her other Dark books. Christine is an awesome author!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivated me!","review":"Christine Feehan is unstoppable. I absolutely love her Dark Series as she once again reels me into her Carpathian world. This book had a new twist with a pregnancy being involved in the romance between Dayan and Corinne.

Excellent job!Gina Marie LongUnknown Touch - Werewolf Series, Book One"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Series Rocks!","review":"I never read romance novels, but Feehan's Vampire series is very, very good!

It's got a little more sex in it than I am used to in my vamp books, but her writing skills are phenomenal. I highly reccommend her as an author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Melody","review":"This book was awesome & 1 of my faves in the series. It has a lighter story then most of the other books, but fits in well with the overall plot. Dayan & Corinne are the perfect match for each other & are so loving. Dayan is a true Carpathian male, but is very comfortable showing his softer side. Which was a delightful treat I'm sure wouldn't have worked with any other character. In my opinion Dark Melody was more of a Beautiful Serenade. No true fan of the series will be disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Already","review":"Enough already!! The first 3 were really the best because they were different. Now I am pretty sick of the Carpathian males who are all carbon copies of each other. I think that is why they have problems breeding, these males have all been cloned. The women are the worst though. I don't know about everyone else but I have never met anyone I just wanted to have relations with the very moment I met them. Wouldn't it be nice to get to know each other first, even just a little?? I thought this one might be a little better because the last one, Dark Symphony, was much better than they had been. Then this one, Dark Melody, back to the same old same old.

It was fast moving and kept you guessing till the end. The love scenes and the struggled that the main characters go through are very realistic and one can relate to them. The heart condition, the baby, the first husband's death, the fight for life, love and survival keep the story interesting and moving. It kept your interest even though this is one of many in the series it stands on its own and brings new outlooks into the rest of the series.

I was enjoying about the first 20 pages or so but fell into a drowsy stupor during overly dramatic lengthy descriptions about the two main characters romance. After 40 pages they were hooked on each other without any interesting conflict and the rest of the story is BLAH BLAH BLAH boring. Save your money, get a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic and dull","review":"The Carpathian series is slowly but surely petering out. The characters in this book are carbon copies of prior characters (the brooding, sexy, dark, handsome male paired with a weak-but-strong female) fitted into a predictable story line: meet, face a bit of danger, mate, convert, end. It's as if nothing happens to these couples once they are bonded, to wit, the bit about Tempest and Darius that pops up here. We're told Tempest has only been brought over for two weeks, yet she's fully adjusted to her new life. Sheesh, it took me months to get used to being married, and I didn't have to give up daylight and real food in the process!

The quality varies and I'm afraid this one isn't one of the better ones. (My favorite quote: '...she garnished attention...' What!? She sprinkles it like sprigs of parsley? How about: 'she garnered attention'?) Anyway, I think the stories work out better when the heroine is powerful in some way as in Dark Guardian and Dark Legend. I think this one is comparable to, but somewhat better than, Dark Symphony, one my few non-keepers in this series, and also one in which the heroine had a serious handicap of some kind. Perhaps it precludes interesting conflict when the hero has to coddle the heroine so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"I liked the fact that the storyline was a bit different to the others that I've read, and so many other characters involved.

She has gone rock bottom with this piece of garbage !! There wasn't anything, not one, that I enjoyed in this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Dark Melody is boring, mainly because I kept thinking that I had read entire passages lifted directly from her other books, and while I didn't actually get check book to book; I'm pretty sure that about half of the book was her regular spiel about Carpathinians - much like her last two Dark books. And I'm tired of it. She was one of the most exciting new writers to come out in the last couple of years, and now I don't think I will bother to pick her up again because though her story could be interesting -- her telling of it no longer is. I wish Feehan would take a break so that she could write something original and fresh again rather than giving us the same hero and heroine over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leading Lady is a \\"Mary-Sue\\" !

Although it was a good book, it wasn't as well written and didn't seem to go as smoothly as some of her other books. I wouldn't recomend somebody getting this particular book and judging her writing style on it. Shadow Games or any of her many other Dark books is much better written. Maybe she is getting tired of the characters? Dayan seemed to just go on and on, he was too one dimensional. Still, I give it 4 stars because it is a good book, just not up to Feehan's usual standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"I used to think that the \\"dark\\" series was kinda cute, at least after the first 4 or so.

For starters the fields look as if they were rushed, The sound crackles when engaged in heavy combat. Now for the pros. The enemys can be like 20x bigger than you and you can be fighting up to 8 enemies at once and defeat them all at once, so it gives you a sense of collosal power. Some of the combat gets so heavy with tornado attacks that it is almost impossible to see what you are attacking. The dark tones and dim lighting in the game gives you a sense of mystery and danger.

Would have been real serious if the defect prevented the GF from properly functioning, or if there was an internal short.There's a reason many of the retail home improvement stores have stopped carrying Leviton (too many defective returns)... and why most reputable electricians won't touch the stuff.

She has drawn on the spirit of early girl punk. The ghosts of PJ Harvey and Liz Phair hang over this record. They are not so much ghosts really because they live next door to Waxman in LA. She is THAT connected. This record is a love letter to all men in the world. Dina Waxman is your muse. She is your guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled","review":"Don't be fooled by this meretricious imitation of reasoning. It is arrogant, self-righteous and pretentious. The haughty Haught sets up a straw man he calls \\"you,\\" who is supposedly an \\"evolutionary materialist,\\" he presumes to put thoughts into \\"your\\" head that no rational person would ever really think, and proceeds to amass pages of empty verbiage to discredit his false assumptions. I recognize this smarmy, self-satisfied, aggressive tone from high-flown Republican rhetoric and Fox News, both of which are convinced they have a monopoly on \\"truth\\" (a word Haught uses repeatedly). The Democratic attitude is essentially scientific: I don't know the truth, but here's the best view I can come up with based on the currently available evidence. Maybe that's why the Democrats always seem to be at a loss to counter Republican certainties."},{"rating":"1","title":"big title - little delivery","review":"Mr. Haught's book initially raises great expectations for the reader due to his supposed familiarity with his subject material. But IMHO nothing was delivered. He seems skilled in introduction and critical appraisals. But he has nothing tangible to offer except vacuous prose. I would say the book is worth reading for those interested in what an opposing view to Dawkins or Dennett might entail. In my mind one of Daniel Dennett's footnotes from Darwin's Dangerous Idea nicely sums up such an attempt to offer an alternative view to real darwinism in a criticism of Paul Tillich's theological approach as \\"bombastic redescription.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"tokyo marui clone","review":"i ordered from opa and didnt receive the charger to load the bb's so i have to load them one by one which sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not get what I WANTED!!!!","review":"I ordered a pink Krusell case for my wife who is a one year breasr cancer survivor!

I've heard people complain of bugs in reading an external memory card. I bought a 512 mb memory card and the product had no trouble recognizing the expanded memory. The drag and drop feature is so easy to use. The only reason I gave it four stars was I had to purchase different headphones. The earbud type did not fit in my small ears and were a bit uncomfortable for me. They kept falling out when I jogged. So I bought some RCA clip-on ones and they work great!Also the armband is nice.

Blues and bluegrass overtones set the mood. It is wonderful to see a release such as this. This is not just another country artist. Shannon is the whole musical package. He has one of the the strongest voices that you will ever hear and a fine instrumentalist. While listening to it (his voice, it will tear right through you. The CD is great. MCA-Nashville took someone with an awesome talent and backed him up with some of the finest musicians in the world, Chris Thile, Ron Block, and Jerry Douglas just to mention a few. There is a hidden track that is worth the cost of the CD alone. Think of the other 11 songs as just a bonus. The hidden track lets you hear Shannon's voice in its purest form and reaches to the depths of your soul. If you don't believe how someone can do this through a CD, buy this and bring up track 12 and prepare to be blown away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a NEWCOMER that can sing","review":"Today, country music is coming out with too many newcomers and most of them aren't that great.

I saw him down in Nashville when he was with the Galoots, and it was amazing! If they were to put out a CD I'm sure it would be one of my favorites. Shannon has a voice and a talent for bluegrass music and that's what Nashville should have let him do on his first solo CD.

His voice is incredible, and best of all, he tries not to be like any other aritsts, he is just Shannon, and cutting a great path!

Inadvertently, I think that the author has done too much much to set down rules than to teach about inspiration and creativity.

It was a well-written, far-reaching, grand book that formed a great cohesive work. As such, i figured this book (about a very under-reported time-period in US history) would be a slam-dunk. Not so. It's almost as if Ferling expended so much energy with Leap that he decided to phone this one in. It's incohesive, jumping around with little regard to logical continuity. Yet, even at this, it comes off as a shallow non-scholarly work that is better suited to a magazine article than a book. I was about ready to have Ferling join McCullough & Ellis as authors i would count on to deliver quality consistently. Alas, not quite yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting event, good background","review":"All of the intricacies of the election of 1800 and its characters could be a 600-page book. Ferling has written 200, so he sacrifices depth for a quick read, but does a pretty good job of giving a good outline of what happened and an introduction to the characters involved. This is one of those interesting but overlooked events in American history that people would do well to know more about. It is a quick and easy read and for history buffs, it's a good pick for a lazy day, especially around election season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narration Too Slow","review":"This appears to be a well researched, sophisticated, trenchant analysisof the presidential election of 1800. Many of the historical facts (e.g.,Jefferson's fathering of children with his half-sister-in-law) are interesting,to say the least.However, I have not read the book. I have only listened to the bookon CD. It is a disappointing narration, as the speaker is much toolabored in his delivery. The silences between words are too long byat least half. This slow pace is annoying and deflects attention fromfocusing on the content of the narration. Perhaps Jack Garrett doesa better job on other narrations , but this one is sorely lacking.Actually, this may be a glitch that should have been identified andrectified by the producer. In any event, I recommend a pass on theCD version of this otherwise important book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price watch","review":"Excellent book!!

That's not to say I got nothing out of it, because the information is there. But halfway through the book, I briefly considered putting it down and moving on to something else.

The text, however, is wordy and is not well-suited for those of a picture-book age. There are text boxes to highlight important 'messages,' about kindness, friendship, mood, etc., and the overall impression is that the author is preaching to the reader. Instead of intertwining a story with a subtle message, the text is explicit and overly explanatory. The length of the book (50 pages) is far beyond what a normal toddler/preschooler will enjoy, and there is just way too much text in the story. The book requires tightening. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful illustrations - good intentions - lazy writing","review":"I absolutely love the illustrations in this book.

This final installment of her 5 part children's book series is possibly my favourite. (of course that would be like her saying that she likes either Lola or Rocco better) It's impossible to choose but Lotsa for one has excellent illustrations. While the story is written as human characters, they are picture as animals with some human features. This book is also most interesting for an older audience (I'm 17) this can be seen mostly through puns and such. To the true Madonna fans I would like to point out that the theme and situation are not unlike her grossly underrated film Swept Away. The story of what happens to a person who loses all his money and learns that it really isn't the most important thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for character education","review":"I purchased this book in particular because I own 4 Italian Greyhounds. My oldest is named Madonna because she is so tiny and beautiful and full of grace. It's funny how Madonna-the human wrote a book about an Italian Greyhound- and I say that because the character is Italian. Actually I own all 5 books and am very pleased with her themes. It's a great series to teach good morals for the young and old. I don't care about what people say about the author's past but I am proud of her for living her life to it's fullest. How many of us can really say that and take it to our graves. All of us have had or have skeletons in our closet. She was not afraid to be herself in public and for that I give her great props.

With a refined, technical grace, Slicer embraces multiple, yet divergent paths of life and poetry. There is a crisp intelligence present here, as well as a deep and often breathtaking understanding of the music of language. \\"Philosopher's headache. / Poet's itch.\\" (47), she says, refusing to make a definite discernment between the two, and certainly in this book the philosopher and the poet within Slicer have engaged in a unique and exciting symbiosis."},{"rating":"2","title":"History truth or fiction?","review":"When I ordered the book used, I thought I was getting the current offer. But the published date was 2003. So I don't know how much more is in the current book from Reader's Digest.

Then once you think they might be moving on to something healthy (apples), they cover them in chocolate and M&Ms.; They try to pass it off as teaching good health (they go through the food pyramid), but most of the food they show is candy and desserts. Chocolate covered pretzels, jordan almonds, gum drops. Even for the veggies, they choose cheese-laden onion soup, chicken pot pie with a couple of green beans sticking out, and sweet potato flan. They move on to cheese (macaroni & cheese). They feed their dogs what looks like chocolate cookies (which can kill a dog). None of this makes sense to be showing to kids.Admittedly, it isn't ALL bad food. They squeeze oranges and pomegranates to make juice, and a couple of other healthy things. But overall, this video is worse than a McDonald's advertisement. At least McDonald's has good production values."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The only reason this video gets 1 star from me is because 0 stars is not an option.

Chef Beary Good is just a run of the mill teddy bear, and my daughter found it confusing when it changed outfits. I also think the foods prepared with the fruits and vegetables featured are a bit high-brow for this audience. I mean how many 2-year olds are familiar with Shrimp in Orange Sauce. Maybe orange juice would have been more appropriate.

But how can a Beefheart fan resist the original vision of Bad Chain Puller? The good news is that the rather primitive mix and a predictable light touch of tape hiss does little to distract from the original versions of some of the Captain's great late material. The performances are warm, comfortable and a little more fun.

It left me, a \\"different\\" child of sorts, insanely scared (I even had a few nightmares) that I would be locked in a closet and taunted by my fellow classmates one day. It never happened, though I suppose it could have. Along with some unecessary cursing, it leaves the reader with an overall uneasy feeling.

Although the book captures bullying at its worst, I must say I was disappointed that there was no resolution to the pain and suffering Linda experienced at the hands of her classmates. I found it unrealistic for Linda to then join Wendy in tormenting other students. As for Jill, the tables were turned on her, but she never truly understood the pain she also caused Linda. There were never any apologies or consequences for the action of the students in this book. I had planned to put this book in my classroom library, but I will not due to some of the language used in the text.

Not a good lesson.What are we teaching our children? I gave it one star because it does keep you wanting to read more.Hoping at the turn of every page that these mean girls will be taught a lesson and somehow pay for what they had done.Unfortunately that never happens. My 8yr. old was very disapointed. She just finished Are You There God? It's Me Margaret and Friend or Fiend both by Judy Blume and loved both books. My 8yr daughter loves Judy Blume.

It did not show apologies or comeuppance because that is rarely done in real life--even if the shoe is on the other foot. When Jill does stand up to Wendy and after a while breaks up other friendships by pointing out that Wendy was a user--I felt Jill didn't learn her lesson. Jill just went on and found someone else to be a lunch partner and class trip friend. I felt sorry for Linda because she ended up being alone again at the end of the book.

The word is used by a character that is a student to describe her teacher in the beginning of chapter 4. The book was a nice read up to that point and now I will have to read the rest to see if it is suitable for my daughter to finish. Who has time for that!?

Power struggles, petty childhood cruelty, and surprsingly adult introspection meld into an immediately vivid cast of characters. Unless you're a numbskulled prude who needs to Save The Children from an (extremely mild) potty word appearing in the first part of chapter four (and in the process of pointing out said evil word to the general public, print the same word on a webpage where it can be read by millions of children all over the world), Blubber is an inspiring read for people who actually remember being a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"true stuff peepsils","review":"k people are mean just learn to deal with it ignore it and then tell somebody like an adult its perfectly noemal when people are this age they can be extremly cruel for example girls are mean to girls, boys are mean to boys, girls are mean to boys, or boys are mean to girls (if thats the case something is wrong with that dude) This book shows the problems of s middle school girl or boy i have this problem im not gonna say how old i am but its not fun not at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"No true resolution","review":"I found this book incomplete. It's missing a crucial element: its resolution. True, Jill finds out what Wendy is really like, but no one made up with Linda. I went through some of the things Linda had to go through (thankfully not as severe). It really bugs me that people spent the whole book treating Linda so terribly and no one even tried to make up with her. I thought that, at least after what Jill had been through, she'd want to try to make up with Linda. In the end, she should have decided to try sitting with Linda, instead of Rochelle. Or maybe Linda and Rochelle. I think that would have sent a strong and important lesson to children. Without apologizing to Linda, the book has a gaping hole. The kids learned not to follow Wendy, but not how to make things right with those they hurt while following Wendy."},{"rating":"2","title":"the horrible truth of bullying","review":"Jill is a typical fifth grade girl who finds herself caught up in the cruel bullying of Linda (whom the class dubs \\"Blubber\\") through her fear of the bossy, cool Wendy. There is something about Linda that just makes everyone want to pick on her, according to Jill. Meanwhile, Jill also eggs her mean neighbor on Halloween, because he deserves it. What will happen when Jill finds herself in Linda's place? Will the fifth grade class learn their lesson? Blume perfectly captures the voice, mind, and motivation (a shallow sense of right and wrong, of little true motivation, a lack of empathy or consequence) of fifth graders, along with their characters, and the horrific world of bullying and victimization. Grade: A-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bullying 101","review":"Blubber is a story of fifth grade! It teaches you all the ups and downs from bullying to losing your best friend! The information in this book is real life. Nothing is fake! Since I am in school I think about these things!Blubber is a book of pure intelligence! Jill, Tracy, and Wendy all bully a new girl at their school. They bully Linda to tears! Just because she is fat! But after Jill and Tracy had their fun they learned from the best. Linda started to give them a taste of their own medicine! She showed them what it feels like to be bullied!Jill who was a really popular girl was made fun of! Linda had the nickname of \\"Blubber!\\" But Jill was given the name \\"Big Baby!\\" The story perfectly blends with the fifth grade feeling! Jill was bully and Linda was the victim.

This book has no redeeming qualities. One of the rules in writing children's books is that the main character should be likeable. But the main character was the most horrible, spoiled, rude, rotten bully. She constantly makes fun of an over weight girl in school along with her fellow bullies, puts rotten eggs in a neighbor's mail box, talks back to her parents, etc. Absolutely a horrible character, so it was hard to like the book (and I tried). This book was written in the 1970's, and I was surprised to see the word \\"bitch\\" in the book (the main character called an adult a bitch). I don't believe this is a very good book for a child to read. It might give them ideas on how to be a rotten child. I was surprised this book was even published."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy","review":"We read this book in a book club of 9 year old girls and their moms.

I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frightening","review":"I read this book when I was in 3rd grade. When I first read it, I really liked it. But then as time went on, I suddenly began to wonder: Could the things in this book happen to me? And if it did, how would I handle it? Who would I tell? How could I ever go back to living my life after enduring the cruelty? Yes, it's only a story. But the things that happen in the book (teased because of weight, violence in bathrooms, threats from girls, being degrated, locked in a closet, etc) really do happen. And it happens everyday, to millions of kids. And teachers rarely make it end. And even if they do, the emotional scars aren't healed. And that tension is still in the air when you pass by the bullies. You can almost taste it. I strongly recommend that you DON'T buy this book for your children. It will just make them disturbed, scared, and worried...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Disappointing","review":"I am a big fan of Judy Blume.....or so I thought.

This then raises the question of whether anything in the author's life is relevant enough to be communicated to the world and whether he does so well.Personally, the daily lives of young, self-involved white men are of little interest to Dupont. Good writing interests Dupont, bad writing sometimes amuses him, and mediocre writing always bores him. I'm afraid that this book bored him. The author's content and style have hardly evolved from his earlier work, which also left a lot to be desired. Dupont gives this book a one star rating and advises all but the author's friends and acquaintances not to purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for curly, fine hair","review":"I searched for a conditioner that was good for curly, fine hair. I had read in CurlyGirl that my type of hair needed a conditioner with Shea Butter and Wheat Protein. I took a chance and tried this product and I am extremely happy with the results.

The book does by no means discourage the teaching of science. It argues for a CHANGE in the way science is thaught, and in the reasons behind the way science is thaught.

Throughout the book,the reader is subjected to Lucy's trials and tribulations.Her plights with overeating, weight, husband, cranky boss,pre-teen daughter and lazy college son are so countless,the book starts to feel like a novel adaptation of TheJerry Springer Show. Meier needs to stick to her plot andhow her character's relate to the murder. In the past,Lucy was a warm, humorous character because of herinsecurities and knack for getting into trouble. Here,she comes off more like a complainer who can't stop whining.I really like Leslie Meier writing style and feel she'll writemore good books, The Birthday Party Murder simply isn't oneof them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another waste of money...","review":"This book, like the others in this series that I have read, can hardly be termed \\"murder mysteries.\\" The protagonist, Lucy Stone, never seem to solve the crimes. Instead, she accidnetly blunders into trouble and the murderer then promptly attacks or kidnaps her.Like may readers, a book is as escape for me into another world. Lucy Stone's world is one I do not intend to visit again. Her harried supermom performance, coupled with an inability to say no, makes her such a victim that I end up rooting for the bad guys. Her children are lazy brats who manage to get into all sorts of trouble. Her husband is insecure and selfish. Her friends think nothing of imposing on her.

Anyone who hasn't read anything by Leslie Meier, where have you been? Birthday Party Murder is a great place to start. I have read all of Meier's books, but none of them compare to this one.

Me, I read it out of desperation, being stuck in an English-Void while vacationing in Russia. Needless to say, I felt my IQ diminish rapidly with each painful page to the obvious climatic 'confusion/resolution.'

I bought it for a 10 year old and it never flew. It crashed and broke the wing off instead. It was actually more stressful than enjoyable, and I think SpinMaster should compensate people for having to deal with their defective product. I was suspicious when I opened the box because of the repeated warnings not to return it to the store - which is a sign of a poor product. Don't add any more stress to your life by buying this item. Since it breaks so easily, you may not be able to return it the next day after you realize it's not useful. Buy a stunt kite instead - they don't break as easily and only need some wind to fly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we having fun yet... Not.","review":"I realy wanted to like this plane but just could not. It was not any fun at all and just plain didnt work. In the slighest breeze of a head wind the plane would never turn and would just fly opposite leaving me to run it down 200 yards. The Battery pack recharger takes six C batteries and runs out real quick. After a dozen tries the propellers stopped turnning fast enough to even get it into flight. In the 2 days that I had this product it never, never worked. I would prefer to save the money spent on this type of product and put it towards a different type of remote plane. This was just a big waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY !!!!!","review":"Save your money and time (returning this junk toy to the store) . Make yourself a paper airplane instead - it'll fly for just as long and it will be easier to control ! However, on the positive side, it is a durable toy - it has to be because all it does is crash to the ground! It is also an educational toy - it will teach you an important lesson - buyer beware !!!Bottom line : The plane holds it's charge for approximately one minute . You'll spend more time running around picking the plane up off the ground and trying to get it back in the air before the charge runs out ,than you will spend actually flying the thing !! In my opinion, you'll have more fun playing with a rubber ball !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i hate this plane","review":"i dont like this plane.

Then i threw it again it went right back at me and hit the roof and broke the propeller so i couldnt use it again and could not buy a replacement. Mabey but i got a defective one but i dont think i did. I do not like this plane i wasted my money. If u rreally want a plane get a real rc plane which is what am going to do. DONT BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great toy concept, but it does not work!","review":"I read other online reviews prior to buying. I saw mostly positive responses and only a few negative reviews.

I purchased 2- Radio Controled Air Surfers and they work great, these Air Surfers are an absolute riot. I cannot beleive that people are actually allowed to sell things, like the air hogs, that do not even work for a little while.

The next day i took it out and the batteries must have been used up. For charging a plane once and keeping indoors without the plane on it so there was nothing to drain the batteries it died. And as for charging. It does take forever!. 3 minutes isn't that long but when compared to people saying the max possible flight time to be 3 minutes. think about it. That's not that much. One kid wrote his would only fly for 30 seconds.I would and most likely will go to a local hobby store and buy a real \\"beginner\\" plane that runs on actual rechargable batteries.

This toy was purchased back in mid June. The first launch ended the days fun with a mild crash which broke the propeller. I called Spinmaster Toys in hopes of getting a replacement propeller, only to find replacement parts are not available. I was instructed to exchange the plane where I purchased it. I did this, only to be dissapointed again. The first launch of the second plane also ended in a broken propeller. Again Spinmaster was notified, this time they promised to send the body of the plane including propellers. They told me, I would have to swap the insides.

But when I got it, it was horrible. It hardly ever flew, the SLIGHTEST breeze took it out, and there is NO, altitude control. The faster you go, the higher you go. No inbetween, no ability to slow down (go lower) (unless you press land, in which case the plane starts spiraling down in huge circles. Another down side it that when you do \\"land\\", the engines continue to go, wasting charge, and the plane is VERY fragile. The paint job is gone after a few \\"flights\\", and BY THE WAY, THE ENTIRE PLANE IS MADE OF STYRAFOAM. Yea, thats right... that white light weight, highly fragile stuff. It was a huge dissappointment, I don't reccomend it to anyone, I was in a very big feild the times I \\"flew\\" it, buyt it always managed to stray into the trees, or the parking lot, or some other \\"bad\\" place.

After seeing my son fly it perfect the first time and everytime after they were in shock. I think he had his in the air more than they did (they were always tinkering with stuff while we just flew and flew). He flew it til dusk and we rarely even noticed the charging time as we were talking about the last flight and what we were going to do on the next flight and \\"oh looke it's ready to go again\\". The following day he did manage to hit a metal pole and break off half of a propeller (we were at a different smaller field and didn't see it there) - when I called spinmaster they said no problem we will ship you some for free. This is a wonderful toy and we are already looking at the next step up for him (maybe for xmas)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON\\"T BUY THIS TOY!!!","review":"My son requested this as a Christmas gift, and I purchased it.

The concept on this was good, and I thought it would be simple enough for him to fly. Less than 20 seconds of flying time after several failed attempts, due to a slight wind, was disappointing and aggravating enough for me, no need to tell you how discouraged my son was. He's taken it out only once in the four months he's had it. Wouldn't recommend this toy to anyone, not even my worst enemy.

My advice to you is to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash Prone","review":"This might have been a good toy, if it didn't have a strange tendency to crash.

I flew it for an astounding 80 seconds straight but then the engine cut out and it glided into my neighbor's pool. After getting wet, I suspect that the plane is broken because whenever I charge it now the propeller starts and cuts your fingers.

Arm rest can take a bit to find a comfortable position but works for me. Tuners are easy to get used to and this guitar stays in tune ! The pickup is not a screamer but is plenty adequate to work with. The gig bag is good and the metallic red I bought is a great finish!

I have neck arthritis and other posture issues, so the design is absolutely perfect. However, they seem to have manufacturing bugs they haven't been able to work out for years. I have had 3 and every one has failed within 18 months. I keep the keyboard on my lap when in use, putting it back on my desk when not. Every single one has failed where the wire enters the keyboard, making the keys (not the touchpad, though!) inoperable.

I purchased Surething and making a label takes minutes and looks great. There are hundreds of different backrounds that look great. Also, you do not have to shape the backround to fit a CD like you do with other programs. It is a simple click and go. This program cost a little bit more than other CD labeling progrmas but the money is well worth it. Surething is the only labeling program that allows you to use labels from other makers. This allows you to use labels from other programs that don't come close to the quality of Surething. A must buy!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect CD Labeler","review":"This CD labeler is the highest in quality and I have found it very easy to use with almost no complications.

He's pretty rough on toys, but that door is still on nice and tight. It opens easily and closes completely without help from an adult. Seems like such a simple thing, but doors on toys never seem to work properly. Not true in this case.This toy is perfectly safe. It's made of plastic with no sharp edges. There are no design flaws that I've seen in the past year. Unless you wrap your child in bubble wrap, they're going to get hurt sometimes... this toy wouldn't be the cause of an injury, so purchase with confidence.Inexpensive toy and money well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fat lip and bloody nose from a seemingly cute &simple toy.","review":"My son recieved this handle hauler for his 1st birthday.

Matties dream is to make this the most successful coffeehouse in Philadelphia, which her mother wanted nothing to do with. Her dreams were then crushed when her mother is discovered to be one of the many yellow fever victims, and the problem was that there was no cure. She then has no choice to leave their family business, and leave her mother behind. Nothing will ever be the same, though.I liked this book because, although it was historical fiction you learned a lot about how they treated the fever, and how it may have been to be a fever victim.

The book is filled with interesting facts of how sick people were treated by doctors. The language spoken by the people also lends historical accuracy to the book. Readers can also find an additional section at the end of the book that has factual information about yellow fever and the time period that the plague took place in.

She became so involved in the book that when she reading it, she would walk carefully in the hallways at school to avoid being touched by other students. She said this was because the book was so vivid in her mind that she felt she could get yellow fever from her present day classmates. This is an excellent book to use in American history class.

I enjoyed reading this book.This story is about a 15 year old girl named Matilda who lives in Philadelphia. Matilda is a smart and adventurous girl that survived during a terrible tragedy. A disease started to spread called Yellow Fever and it killed 10% of the population in Philadelphia during a very hot summer. Her mother gets the fever. Matilda has to leave so that she doesn't get sick and the maid of the house has to take care of the mother. Matilda goes on a journey with her grandpa to Bush Hill.Eventually the grandpa gets sick and he ends up in a hospital. He dies and Matilda is left alone. She has to survive on her own. I enjoyed reading this book and I give it four out of five stars. If you like a sad and historical fiction novel, then you should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting Time of History","review":"Interesting tale told by Mattie Cooke, a teenager living in 1793 Philadelphia. It is an era I did not know anything about. I had heard about Yellow fever hitting tropical places but was not aware that it had ever occurred so far north.It is interesting to see how Mattie seems to \\"grow=up\\" during this tragic time. Once the fever hits her home she flees with her grandfather, leaving her sick mother behind. They do not get far as they both fall ill. Mattie gradually recovers and heads back home with her grandfather, but they find the home has been ransacked and her mother is nowhere to be found.The book is well written and left me wanting to know a lot more about the historical timeframe."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793","review":"Fever 1793 is about the yellow fever outbreak of 1793 Mattie Cook from Phillidelphia has many amazing adventures throughout the whole book. When her mother gets yellow fever Mattie and her grandfather leave for the country to avoid getting sick themselves. Then they get kicked off their carriage by the driver because grandfather was suspected of having yellow fever though he really just had a cold. I liked this book a lot because it gave you a look into the lives of people during the epidemic. I would reccomend this book for readers who love to learn about the past. I would compare this book with Running Out of Time by Margaret Peterson Haddix because it address's the problems withe disease in the late 1700's to early 1800's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read for a long time","review":"This book was really sad but the girl was really strong. It is about a fever that has swept throught their town and is slowly spreading.

This all changed when I read through this excellent historical fiction tale. It is about a girl named Mattie Cook who lives in Philadelphia in 1793 during the large yellow fever epidemic. Before the outbreak, she is an everyday girl who is not very mature yet and doesn't spend her time as she should, trying to get out of chores and listening to her mother. Her life changes forever when her mother becomes ill and Mattie's life turns into a rollercoaster ride. Through the fever, however, Mattie learns about how precious life is, and grows up to be able to make choices on her own and be a responsible young woman. This is by far one of my favorite books, which I could read over and over again and recommend to any young adult or adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fever 1793","review":"Fever 1973 is a book that will bring you to a world you would never imagine! I'm doing this for a school project. Laurie Halse Anderson brings all characters to life. You get into the book and you feel like you are part of the book. The books was filled with adventure and mystery, main character, mattie cook lives in the city of Philadelphia. Suddenly people start dying from a disease called Yellow Fever. Her mother contacts it and so Mattie flees from Philadelphia with her grandfather. Each chapter begins with a quote of people from the book and it is hard to follow.

At some points it was very hard to read and very sad. At some points during the book I had to stop a moment and digest all the terrible things that were going on.

Jim Dale gives one of the most accomplished performances ever to grace a stage, and, although his physical acrobatics can't be appreciated on CD, his verbal gymnastics more than suffice. The rest of the cast- including Glenn Close- provide able support. Cy Coleman's bouncy tunes and Michael Stewart's clever lyrics display more old-fashioned showmanship than anything performed on a New York stage in recent memory.This disc includes four bonus tracks in which Coleman and Stewart audition some of the show's songs. Two of these songs did not make the final production. One of the omissions can be excused, but they should have used the lovely \\"At Least I Tried.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a simple and good one","review":"I've read four books on the topic, and this is a good one. I also unfortunately have many years of personal experience lacking assurance and figuring out what the deal is. The book is short and simple, so it's easy to get through. He has experience with the issue and he isn't dismissive of problems with assurance, but he recognizes that it can be a complicated issue. I read it a year ago, but I remember it well. One thing that I was impressed at was how he ended the book; with the recognition that your problems with assurance may continue, but resolve to continue to attempt to know and serve Christ.

This is very deceptive."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a voice!","review":"Faith Hill has one of the most powerful voices in music today.

When I first got it, it was very hard to get the phone on and off of the clip. Actually, now the phone doesn't even come off of the clip because the release is broken. Then after about a week or so, the detent in the swivel mechanism broke. Now the phone spins around instead of staying horizontal to my belt which is one of the reasons I like these kind of cases.

Funimation should have kept this in the original aspect ratio of 4:3, fullscreen."},{"rating":"1","title":"A note about the widescreen A. Wehner \\"EighT\\"","review":"While many times, especailly today, programs are filmed in widescreen, Dragon Ball Z was filmed in fullscreen, and the widescreen version, as shown in numerous Internet screenshots will crop off a considerable amount of the image and alter the original intentions of the animators. No offense to anyone, but I believe that customers should be notified that they are NOT recieiving the complete product prior their decision to purchase. FUNimation is capabale of so much better than this, and it is disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funimation you are a bunch of crooks!","review":"I am really glad to see they put out the entire season one at a reasonable price. What I'm angry about is buying episode 1 to 26 at $15-$20 bucks a pop. Then they stopped releasing them after episode 26 to dump the rest of the episodes in one release of the entire season one!Which means I bought 1-26 for nothing! I'm buying this Funimation because I love DBZ, but I don't love YOU. This, Funimation, is the last dime you are getting out of me EVER. I've already sent an extremely rude email to Funimation (and I'm not a bit sorry for the rudeness) telling them, I am officially their ex-customer.

The widescreen feature is better than full screen if you have studied film. It actually has more picture than the full screen. Full screen is a modified version of a widescreen in which it was originally created so it can be formatted and to fit a T.V. screen in full. Widescreen shows just as much as full screen from top to bottom, just squished down a little bit, and shows more on left and right sides of the movie. Therefore, this is better than previously made-in-full-screen dragonball z shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dbz at its best","review":"Well this one is great.

First off it hasnt been released yet so nobody really knows how it looks exactly. From the screen shots i saw the picture is cut off at the top and more picture is shown on the sides, but who cares. All there cutting out is a small bit of hair or buildings at the top and dirt on the bottom. Besides, its not like you gotta buy the whole series again because most diehard fans have already bought it all.

The added original Japanese scenes not seen in the U.S. add so much to the novelty of the show. Not to mention being able to watch it with the original Japanese or remade U.S. musical score in the background.

Its annoying looking at half heads :/The quality was amazing, it was so clear, when i first watched it i couldnt believe my eyes. The line dissapearance is sort of annoying too.

However, a portion of the picture is missing, as many have stated. So if you can buy this and accept the fact that a portion of the intended picture is missing, then you will enjoy it. If you are upset that the picture is cropped, then you probably should buy the \\"3 episode\\" uncut DVDs.

I find it impossible to pick a favorite so I bought them all, problem solved. This release is dominated by his own compositions and I really get pulled in by each one of them. His choice of including two David Walbert classical compositions, Study and Prelude, and Bach's Study in Bm along with Fahey's Requiem for John Hurt demonstrate Richard's ability to tackle a wide variety of genres. Driving rhythms, sparkling notes, incredible dynamics throughout. Gilewitz is truly one of the finest players on the contemporary scene. Just shows you what dedicated hard work and a love for the instrument can produce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding performances of Brahms Piano Concertos","review":"I agree with the acclaim received by this set - it is the digital update to past classic performances such as Gilels/Jochum, Serkin/Szell, and Stephen Kovacevich.Chailly is a brilliant conductor as usual, and Nelson Friere possesses a thickish tonality somewhat reminiscent of that other great South American pianist Claudio Arrau, (as opposed to a somewhat 'lighter' sound from Serkin, for example) which is perfectly suited for Brahms. What also distinguishes Friere is his independence - this is not a pianist looking to be note-perfect, but rather one whose style reminds one of older individualists like Horowitz. Sviatoslav Richter's peerless performance of the Second Concerto (under Leinsdorf) will never be surpassed with its electrifying playing, but other than that, Friere's recording is as great as anyone else's.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOLD WORTHWHILE VERSIONS OF THESE MASTERPIECES","review":"These versions of the 2 Brahms concertos are truly exciting. The orchestral playing is muscular and dynamic to a degree I have never heard before. The only reservation I have about this first-rate set comes in Brahms Concerto #2. The 2nd movt of #2 is played too fast and loses the gravitas that can come from this amazing movement. Also, the cello soloist in movt 3 plays like a high school amateur...this sublime movt is marred by the crude, bumpy playing of the solo cello...too bad.Overall, you will not go wrong with this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong, good detail","review":"I'm a \\"dumb\\" music lover.

This is the album to get! Noel is phenomenal on the piano...he always is. Renee's voice is the voice that you fall in love with and long for more.

It fits very well and you get used to it quickly.Cons: (A very small one) My first reaction was that the buttons on the sides of the mouse were way too sensitive. I kept on pressing them all the time while playing online games. I learned living with that and now I don't press the buttons at all.Overall I'm happy I bought it.

The book even goes out of it's way to talk about references to the self in the canonic texts, and he specifically describes why the Buddha's view on the self is not nihilism.What the people who criticize this book are reacting to, I think, is that Collins is an academic, and not a follower of Buddhism, per se.

Since the description states that the power is lower now, I expected less light, but the cheap look was a disappointment. We had a hard time assembling it. Some paint got into the threads of the aluminum body and it had to be cleaned before the column could be screwed onto the base. In addition, one had to be very careful not to force it, otherwise the soft aluminum threads would get destroyed. At $100, this lamp is extremely overpriced.

I purchased it because it is white and is aesthetically better in my white-painted apartment. I had only had this cable service for a week or so when I ordered the cable. A few days after I installed it I noticed that several stations had \\"this station should be available shortly\\" messages but would never bring them in. Some other stations had pixellation or freezing. I called Comcast thinking it was a problem with their box. The tech came out, plugged in a standard cable and the problem disappeared. The tech observed that the \\"stinger\\" (the central core wire in the Monster cable) was not long enough and that may have been the cause of the poor connection. I won't buy Monster again because I have a concern that their quality control is lacking, even thought their the product is attractively designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not use it with Comcast","review":"I used it to hook up my HD TV to the Comcast HD cable box and it did not work well, I lost many HD channels.It is my first big disappointment with a Monster product, and it is so unfortunate because the cable looks very nice and good quality (as all monster products).Read other reviews and stick to the coaxial cable provided by your cable company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, but doesn't work!","review":"Tried to use this great looking cable from the cable outlet to the cable box.

The one and only not-so-good thing I have to say about this CD is that if you listen to it too much, the songs start to blend into each other, and then it becomes kinda dull and you just can't keep track of the songs anymore.

'Mone Enfance' and 'La Chanson Des Vieux Amants' sung by Ellie Stone are not here nor even 'The Statue', all of which, I suspect, would inspire lovers of the music of Jacques Brel to plead for a recording of the film version to supplement the stage version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Memories Revived","review":"So many, many memories attached to this recording.....I attended my first performance of this evocative and exciting show shortly after it opened at the Village Gate 1n 1968 and then as often as possible thereafter - I dragged every friend and visiting relative along almost as soon as they set foot in my West Greenwich Village apartment. I couldn't get enough of this music at the time (I wore out my LP long ago) and I'm now so glad to have remade it's acquaintance after so many years have passed. It still stirs my soul. Jacques Brel is a very special and rare musical artist who through his songs manages to touch every emotional button you possess. Trust me, should you acquire this CD you are in store for a very intense musical experience. The performers are beyond superb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing compares to Brel","review":"Ooff, sorry to say, but these English interpretations do not at any stage resemble the power, intensity and musical level of the original Brel songs.

Listen to Brel's legendary 1961 concert in l'Olympia, Paris and judge for yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SECOND, NO, THIRD BEST!","review":"Any homage to the remarkable Flemish-French singer Jacques Brel (d. 1978) deserves praise but this one doesn't deserve too much praise. It has taken Brel's plangent and often muscular themes and reduced them to stock cabaret gestures and harmonies, sung by sweet, not all that strong voices. The result loses the peculiarly poignant quality Brel's best renditions had, the way he could evoke melancholy without losing muscle, in his tough but utterly romantic style of singing. It is carping to say that I wish certain other songs had been included, particularly \\"J'Arrive,\\" which is, I feel, just a stunning composition. And the way Brel sang it, whoo!I'd give this 2-1/2 stars (out of 5) if the system allowed half stars, but between 2 and 3 stars, this is more on the 2 side than the 3 for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice pan","review":"This has become my every day go-to pan.

First of all it covers a period only 3 records: Alms House (1 track), Prophecy (3 tracks), & the weak I-Testament (6 tracks). There is a mediocre 1993 single thrown in, which leads me to the second problem - only 11 tracks. The Prophet's work really began to soar in the late '90's, after the covered period, so most of the best was yet to come(& is still coming!). Despite this, there are some really good tracks here: Alms House & anything off of Prophecy ('Leave Babylon' still gvz me goosebumps affa all deez yrs). You are, however, wasting your time if you buy this CD even if you have no Capleton at all. I recommend starting out with Prophecy - 12 Amazing tracks with 3 re-mixes to boot.

He (the director) recalled a model kit from his youth. Mostly he recalled the painting on the box, a painting of giant building-sized robots being tended to by seemingly tiny humans...it's a shame he didn't forget this image...There is nothing redeeming about this inane waste of mortal effort. The special effects stink, the story is lost early on, and any semblence of acting is glossed over by directing so childlike that we assume that the robots argued with cast over screen time, and won.This move actually makes the Sci-Fi Channel's Battle Star Galact-a-thon seem like a good idea. Unlike the original Dune, which I rerent periodically to reassure myself it is still terrible, I will never need to check back to be sure this movie is a disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"So campy, its fun to watch","review":"I remember seeing this at a video rental store, and remembering it being advertised on television and in different magazines.

The Grizzly saw vibrated excessively. I clamped it to a kitchen table, and it still was vibrating very much.

I think the natural wood finish is very attractive in person. The storage is great, a nice size drawer for papers etc and two large shelves behind the doors. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because part of the directions were a bit unclear for my husband when he was putting it together. The drawer is wood on wood (no device to make it roll easily) so I ran over the grooves with a candle (wax) and that made the drawer move much more smoothly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Color Resource","review":"The Pantone Guide to Communicating with Color presents a foundation of basic color theory and then moves on to explain how individual colors, and their combinations, can evoke different responeses from the viewer. There are many photos to serve as examples so that you see the effects for yourself. The book does an excellent job of giving enough information to be useful without bogging the reader down with a lot of dry academic theory that would be of little practical use. In addition, there are Pantone color codes given for all of the specific color combinations shown for ease of use if you will be using professional printing services.In summary, this is an excellent resource. It conveys valuable information about colors and how they effect people in a clear and concise way. I highly recommend it for everyone with an interest in the subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought I knew everything...","review":"I was convinced that I was an expert with color.

I appreciate the visual nature of this book, and the many examples of advertisments illustrate the effects of using a particular color (don't expect an in-depth analysis though -- the text doesn't discuss any of these advertisements in detail).

Color combinations are sorted out according to the impact they would have upon the viewer and what mood would they convey (e.g. serene, earthy, mellow, powerful, spiritual, romantic, sensual, elegant, playful, energetic, etc). The author also suggests products and services where particular colors may be best suited or where some colors are best avoided.While the psychological and emotional impact of colors is not exhaustive in this book, it is interesting enough to get you intrigues to further look into it elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pantone!","review":"I have several books on color harmony, but most of them were written in process color formulas, which was not so helpful for those of us who are doing 2- and 3-color work.I have even needed to do some projects with 6 spot colors in which using a build of colors was not the best way to go (at least not if you want vibrant color!)Anyway, that this book is Pantone made it way more valuable than the other books I have.

Okay...not big deal, right?The real problem came when she tried to skate, due to the fact the screw underneath the skate keep getting loose and the skate expand out, he foot falls off. This happened over and over again the whole night, and we must have stopped to put the back on and rescrew atleast 20 times.

I can see why. Ott provides an excellent source of information not only about the fundamental teachings of the Faith but also provides us with the level of theological certainty that the Church has assigned to various teachings.

I recomended it highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful encyclopedia of dogmatic theology","review":"Ludwig Ott's work is an extremely useful reference tool for anyone wanting to know what the Church teaches. The book not only lists the teachings of the Church, but also lists whether the teaching has been declared dogma. In addition, it lists from which scriptural text a teaching has been derived and what various fathers and councils have said. We learn of the major heretics who denied various teachings and what their denials were based upon. Contrary to what an earlier reviewer claimed, the book does state (although very briefly) which teachings upon which any given dogma is based. Even speculative theology is touched upon. Ott's work has proven to be consistently useful to me in apologetics, systematic theology, and history. I believe it will be useful to nearly anyone interested in these subjects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Superb","review":"I can't recommend this book highly enough.

It covers the breadth of Catholic dogma well. Explanations are concise but what they lack in depth is made up with abundant references.

The more of it that sticks in your head the better that you'll do on the exam (and believe me, there's so much in here that you'll remember SOMETHING). The questions are a level harder than they are on the real deal but that's how you should be preparing anyway. If you buy it to use during the school year as a supplement to your textbook, you'll definitely get the most out of it.

The one reason is that the book deals with history through an auteur approach, detailing each filmmaker. The current focus is typically a hybrid approach; using historical details, the business of film, and theory to teach the subject matter. Filmmakers are used as ways to interpret the consequences of that history. I was also surprised when a few major films were left out of the book, mostly foreign lesser known filmmakers. But how can you not discuss Rashomon when discussing Akira Kurosawa? This should not be a top choice for college level film classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"The book looked like it was never even used and was priced acceptably.I'd deffinatly recommened this seller ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only liked a couple of songs","review":"I thought it would have more Scooby-related songs on it.

Too many police procedurals lead to improbable endings and a degree of an absence of real life circumstances. These authors create detectives whose task is often tedious and who often find dead ends to plausible theories. The dialogue is crisp and the humor creeps in at the right pace. An entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, poor transfer","review":"The plot which is typical of movies of the 30s is fun, and is worth seeing. Unfortunately the transfer by Alpha Video (oldies.com) is very poor and looks like it was transferred from a poor VHS copy.

One wonders why Viking, his publisher, the publisher of such distinguished WWII authors as Prof. Ronald Spector, commissioned this author to write on the Doolittle raid.The book is full of basic factual errors and strange assertions about combat and World War II. It tells us that American battleships were armed with torpedoes and that Mitchell B-25 bombers had diesel engines. (Both are not the case.) More importantly and even more bizarrely, it states that if the U.S. didn't win the battle at Midway, Japan's empire would still be \\"intact today.\\"One would be better served (and informed) watching the movie \\"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,\\" which was produced with technical advisers who actually flew the mission.The author would have been too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not researched but well embellished","review":"I was only able to read as far as page 146 before I was turned off by the author's lack of knowlege of the subject. For instance, on the page mentioned above he quotes Lt Joyce as saying \\"my rear gunner was firing.\\" He did record the fact that the tail guns had been removed and replaced by broom sticks. Where was his editor? Other reviewers have also pointed out other glaring errors committed all before page 146 such as diesel engins, \\"Billys\\", and B's taxiing, and so on. The first half of the book left much to be desired, I will not read the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Heros","review":"Although this is a great subject for a book. It is one of the most poorly written books I've ever read. The authors strangely refers to the B-25 bombers as 'Billys', refers to the airmen by their nicknames which is very confusing, refers to the gunners as bubble boys which I found insulting and needs a lesson in basic aviation before he writes another book on the subject. My advice to prospective readers is to purchase any book by C.V. Glines as he is the official historian of the Doolittle Raiders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Elsewhere","review":"If you are looking for a book on the Doolittle Raid, read \\"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\\" by Ted Lawson. Don't waste your time with this book.The book has many factual and grammatical errors. The names of the Japanese Leaders involved are constantly written backwards. For example, Admiral Isoroku Yamamato is written as Yamamoto Isoroku among many others.The author spends more time on Japan's preparations for the Pearl Harbor attack than he does on America's preparations for the Doolittle Raid. The book is not a page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative but Virtually Unreadable","review":"I'll preface my review by saying that I am a big history buff, and especially love military history. And while I found the subject matter of \\"The First Heroes\\" to be quite compelling, the writing is so leaden that the book is virtually unreadable. I also have to quibble with the title since the heroic and doomed stand at Wake Island occurred months before the Doolittle raid was just as important as an early psychological victory in the American war against Japan. The most pertinent comment that I can make about \\"The First Heores\\" is that I became so bogged down by its lack of narrative force that, despite being an avid reader, I couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very readable account","review":"The First Heroes is not only an excellent rendition of the Doolittle Raid but it does a nice job of setting the general historical stage of the period as well. WW2 aficionados may find this stage setting a bit general but Mr Nelson does a fine job with it and its inclusion will certainly help those not familiar with the period put the Raid in its proper context.The book is very well written, entertaining, and is easily on par with Ambrose's best works.One reviewer complained \\"He was known as \\"Bull\\" Halsey to anyone else with just a modicum of knowledge of the major WWII players.\\" This was odd I thought because not only does Mr Nelson cover this fact but also explains HOW Adm Halsey got the nickname.If you have never read anything on the Raid before this is a great place to start. If you have read other works Mr Nelson's is so well done you will certainly find it an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Heroes","review":"I have read almost every book on this subject and First Heroes is by far the best. It captures the essence of the individuals who participated and the apparent hopelessness of the mission. It also accurately depicted the disparity of our nation at the time and how formidable the enemy was as none before had. First Heroes is a well-deserved testament to the character of the men who served our country during WWII.

First, the style is very insipid with the author constantly making sanguine comments on historical figures, as if he was gossiping with friends about the \\"National Inquirer\\". Second, his research is weak. There are but a handful of references in the bibliography showing that the author's reach for primary research is short.

This mold, however, has completely disappointed me. It looked super cute and I was excited to try it out. I used a paper towel to oil the mold like suggested just in case the chocolate stuck. Put it in the freezer. The instructions I was going off of said 10-30 minutes in the freezer would be good enough. I waited half an hour, the stars wouldn't come out at all. Put it back in the freezer, waited an hour, tried again, still nothing. I got two to come out by holding the mold at an angle and tapping harder than should have been necessary at the back of the mold. So, of course, this flimsy mold broke as the second star was coming out. A complete waste of money, I wouldn't buy this again. I'll go find a better mold sold by someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Candy mold","review":"Another candy mold that we are very happy with ... lots of cavities to make big batches for gifts, a snap ... important to coat mold with a bit of olive oil, or some other kind of food safe mold release for easy removal once candy has harden. We also found that a funnel will help pour liquid more evenly into the cavities, since the shapes are small and cavities are shallow, easy for liquid to over-pour the shapes. Good shopping/shipping experience through Amazon and with this vendor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for Kids","review":"These aren't your average \\"kid's songs\\", instead it's a collection published by T.E.C. records, a division of Ralph Records. I'm a big fan of The Residents and this compilation carries on with the same feeling nicely. Because of the experimental and avant-garde nature is why I wouldn't recommend this album for children. For anyone familiar with The Residents, this is a real treat if you can find it.The others in this series called \\"Fruits in the Underground\\" are Potatoes, A Collection of Folk songs and Beets, A Collection of Jazz Tunes. None of these releases are \\"expected\\".

I wasn't sure what book to buy to learn about teaching my baby to swim, but I'm so glad I picked this one. The photos are absolutely beautiful and the book is quality enough to place on a coffee table. I was greatly inspired. The exercises are simple and clearly explained. I was able to remember many of them after only skimming it when I took my baby to the pool for the first time - which, thanks to this book, went much better than I expected. My five month old took to the water very well. The author also clearly stated many safety issues to be aware of - for which I was very thankful.This is a great book. I highly recommend it. ...even if you only buy it for the pictures!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ramekin size smaller than packaging states","review":"I received the ramekins the mail today and was very disappointed because they are smaller than the manufacturer states they are. The item packaging and the website both state that the ramekins are 6 oz., yet they looked too small to hold 6 oz. so I used a measuring cup and measured out 6 oz. of water and poured the water into the ramekins to the very top.

Had to flush it down the garbage disposal so the rest went back to the store for the egg souffles'. Gotta love that finicky part, huh? Anyway, I do recommend it anyway because of their high nutritional value. My rescue Persian cannot eat these shredded varieties because her previous owner kicked out her teeth on one side of her mouth. She doesn't care much for turkey anyway but I was disappointed that she couldn't chew these because of their high nutritional value. Gets tiring cutting up all that cat food!

I had the impression that English may not be the author's first language, and editing missed errors in grammar that, to me, made the book appear less professional, considering its topic. The information it contains is good, and it would be an acceptable reference for someone wanting an idea of what to expect from an anesthetic experience; however, I felt it was overpriced..., being such a slender volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased.","review":"The book was mediocre IMO. It seemed as if Ms Alers rushed to complete this book in a few of hours. I like to become one with the characters and I didn't feel it here.

Toola meets a man from the past named Shunack. Shunack wants to revive the past. Together they put a plan into action that could upset the Earth's natural balance. Agito has to stop them and try to convince Toola to accept him and the new world order. Where humanity is subservient to nature.This movie is great it has good animation, beautiful music and some pretty interesting characters. The backgrounds in this one are particularly well done.

It reminds me somewhat of a Miyazaki film (which are really wonderful and some of my all time favorite movies to watch.) Some concepts of the movie are a bit confusing, but I like that sometimes. The art is well done and I like the storyline. If I had to say what I did not like about the movie, it would have to be the characters personalities. I find them to be a tad bit bland, and could have a bit more depth. Other than that, I think this is a great movie. I also love the music in this movie! The opening theme is one of my favorite songs ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie that will make you want to watch more anime.","review":"After watching this movie I wanted to get more and more anime.

The story was not quite as good, but definitely worth watching. This anime also had a good ending as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid movie.","review":"I enjoyed this movie very much. Yes, it has a distinct Ghibli feel to it, and while they don't pull off the grandness that movies like Nausiica and Mononoke Hime manage this movie is still a wonderful watch. The man vs. nature theme is done well, not going overly preachy, but more thought provoking. As others have mentioned, the scenery is beautiful and masterfully rendered. The characters weren't overly captivating, but certainly likable and interesting to watch. The music was gorgeous (and the Kokia song at the end is her best song, in my opinion) and worth the viewing just to hear it.My only complaint is that this should have been longer. I saw the original theatric previews and they showed more characters and much more depth. Some intruiging scenes were apparently just cut out or were just left out after they put out the previews. If they had found a way to put more of that into the movie, it would have been a perfect 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"It had potential","review":"The beginning of the movie seemed like it had potential. I think some of the ideas in the story could have been developed into a more interesting film, for example, the concept of enhanced beings and plant growth taking on a life of it's own.However, ultimately, the movie was short on story, plot, and character development. We don't get a good feel for who Agito and Toola are, and what they stand for. Alot of the film seems to be Agito screaming \\"Toola!\\", and Toola screaming \\"Agito!\\"I really did not get the point of it and I didn't like the ending either. If you ask me, the ending was rather inconclusive.My favorite part was the beginning song with the flying dragon-plant thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"mother nature unify w/humanity!","review":"i started this movie thinking it would be a cool anime with action; and a theme of nature vs humanity. this movie surprised me greatly! it showed how humanity and nature have to live in harmony with each other for both to survive. the story has a subtle but intense relationship b/t the 2 main characters that keeps the viewer on their seats. the one drawback to the movie however was the middle moves a bit slow. the middle was a bit slow b/c it uncovers the plot and goes into detailed explanation about what happened in the past and why the present is the way it is. but, the movie is still worth watching for all ages. the imagery and story were awesome. definitely recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Price of Admission","review":"Simply put this movie is another boring pedantic man vs nature, technology bad, tree hugging good. I write this as a card carry Green liberal. It plods along in a predicable formula right up to the end. Most of the animation is beautiful but grates on your nerves from time to time as obvious short cuts have been used in a poor mix of styles. You can keep the money I spent on the disc. I want the time I wasted watching this, hoping it would get better, back. I should have re watched Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away.As Rule I do not write reviews.

The color and most of the production values are very good. The voiceovers are pretty good as well though the balance is sometimes off so that it is difficult to understand them over the background noise.But the story is really dumb. Believing that a plant could grow as fast as a man could run? Don't these people understand that growth requires energy? How about that you could put legs under a volcano and have it walk around. Apparently the writer doesn't know that a volcano is powered from the core of the earth and not from something inside itself.I give this a marginal recommendation because this was a superb production lacking only a reason for being made - a story to tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piss poor rip off + enviromentalists commercial","review":"As detailed in the animation as it is, it is a rip off of many other movies combined with a very boring plot intended throw the message of \\"save the world from destruction\\" Its movies like these that degrade anime and give it a bad name.

The setting, while not terribly original, had potential for a good story Unfortunately, the plot is cringe-worthy. I won't go into detail to avoid spoilers, but if you thought there would be some clever plot-twists to put some nuances into the naive \\"forest good, technology bad\\", you'd be mistaken. There are many other things wrong with the plot, but I think the walking volcano (yes, you read that right) sums it up nicely. Was there really a need to put mechanical legs on a volcano so that it can uproot itself and travel a couple of hundred miles, all the while spewing fire and brimstone to finally erupt in a completely different place? They didn't even try to make the plot work, and it shows all through the movie. Characters are flat as cardboard too.

But once you see him on stage in dramatic roles, it's absolutely clear why he is such a rising star. His charisma is off the charts, he more than holds his own against his formidable co-stars like Anna Netrebko, and he has the vocal goods to spare.What a great voice, baritonal in coloring but powerful and bright, and incredibly expressive. And in these French arias he also shows that he is very sensitive to nuances of text, able to use subtle touches to make it come alive. Fabulous Nathalie Dessay is a great match for him in Massenet arias, but I especially liked Gounod pieces. There is no weak entry here, all arias are standouts- this young man likes to go for broke, and I can never imagine him phoning in his performance.If you have any interest in French repertoire, great tenor voice or simply great singing, you should get this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"So comfortable.","review":"Not only does this headset give you excellent sound quality and bass, but it is soo comfortable.

I like the GPS but I didn't know that it was going to take up so much time to download the maps. I felt that they should have had the latest version of this map already loaded onto the GPS. In the future I am going for the disk. Also the first time that I used it the directions were totally wrong it told me to take a left instead of a right and if I would have followed it I would have ended up in the bushes. But since I have the newest map maybe I won't encounter this problem in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luv it.","review":"I've been very happy with my Nuvi. My wife named it Dora. Directions have been accurate and easy to follow. Screen, although small compared to built-in models is bright and very readable. It doesn't always offer the route I would (nor does my wife), but it is always reasonable. If you choose an alternate (or wrong) turn it quickly recalculates and takes it from there. It's been fun to follow Dora's route to someplace familar just to see new streets. Smart address entry saves time, but find by name function takes too long. Location database (dining, gas, etc) seems pretty complete and up to date. Find nearby function is fast and fun.MP3 and Audible player are fine with headphones, but the built in speaker is weak.

It is very easy to use and is really helpful when one is on vacation or in a unfamiliar city.It did get confused once but I just used some common sense and turned it off and back on again. No problem! At this price I would recommend it to anyone. A great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't believe I waiting so long to buy one.","review":"I have owned the Nuvi 350 for about a month and love it. I live in a rural area and have only found one diagonal intersection where it gets confused for a split second. The street annunciation is a must. Product seems very well built. Due to the timing of when I bought it, upon registering it I automatically got upgraded to the 2009 map file (that's a $60-$70 value). Once you get one search the internet for waypoints and other extras (the Garmin website will help you find them).I received as a gift and wondered how much I would use it for daily travel. I have it powered up even when I am traveling known roads. With the arrival time feature, it is nice to know when you are expected to arrive. I would recommend the Garmin nuvi line of products to anyone. They are very easy to operate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly compact, portable and powerful","review":"A navigator with advanced features, intuitive to use and reliable.

I've read the reviews from Consumer Reports (CR) which gave it high marks so I purchased the unit based on that. Wrong move! The biggest fustration for me was powering on the unit and waiting at least 5 minutes to pick up a signal. Sometimes even longer...sigh. Thinking my unit might've been a fluke I recommended my sister to buy the same unit. Guess what, same satellite reception problem. She had to buy an add-on antenna to alleviate the problem. But the reception time was still slow compared to her friends' Magellans or TomToms. In retrospect, I regretted buying the Nuvi 350. I blame CR for recommending such a product and myself for trusting their recommendations without research. Read the other reviews here on Amazon; they tell the whole story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"This is a wonderful product and very easy to use. I wish the unit has additional features such as an easy way to turn off the speech funtion time to time, quick way to go back to the primary screen without hitting the back button many times, and also custom maps. Also a way to plan the trip online and download it to the unit. I am sure these things will be added later on.

I have not owned any other brand, but the Magellan used by Hertz is terrible. Being in sales I find the Nuvi to be a MUST HAVE when ever I am in another city or need to find a gas station, restaurant, hotel or whatever quickly. I still use it when I am home but find that my old \\"trial and error\\" routes are better because the Nuvi only looks at distance from A to B.I have not subscribed the the Traffic funtion so I cannot comment on that. Lastly, do not be surprised if some new destinations are not yet on the pre-loaded maps that come with the device. Overall, though this has been a fantastic purchase. Also, the Bluetooth function in the 360 is not worth the price so stick with the 350."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for anyone who travels or even drives locally","review":"Garmin nüvi 350 3.5-Inch Portable GPS NavigatorOn advice of 2 friends hwo owned a Garmin 350, I purchased one at a retail store last summer. When it was time to buy our boss a Xmas gift, the 3 of us were able to convine 8 others that this was the gift! Mine helps me immensely in my sales geography, and even locally at home. No more mapquest or asking directions--even for a holiday party in a new subdivision! Plus it's portable, so I was able to fly it with me to Boston and it found our way to my sisters' in rural NH, a town of 1100! Along the way, if we wanted to stop to shop or eat, it helped us find restaurants, stores, gas stations, hospitals...you name it, and with phone numbers too! Easy to use touch pad, ETA, even keeps track of your max. and avg speed, and your most recent selections.

I like the large screen size, the touch screen works for me. and the directions are clear. I wish it had traffic and free map updates. I end up using my Blackberry for traffic. I don't use the MP3 player at all. That feature seems like more of a throw-in. It would be nice if it would start tracking satellites immediately after turning on the device. Instead it looks for satellites after you select the destination. This can be a bit frustrating if you are trying to look up local locations in the database and it doesn't know where you are. Still, it routes pretty well and having the restaurant/gas station/venue database is great for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"mismatched part in box","review":"Garmin nüvi 350 3.5-Inch Portable GPS NavigatorI'm puzzled by the favorable reviews posted by others. My own unit must have been an exception. As far as I know, there's nothing wrong with the GPS itself, but it can't be interfaced with either the window suction cup (comes in box) or the dashboard mount (sold separately). Both terminate in ball joints. The GPS provides no matching ball socket, but rather sits in a connector (comes in box) which has a ball socket. The ball socket is way too small. No amount of force could push the ball into the socket. Whatever its power, the GPS is thus far dead weight, because I have no useful fixture in which to hold it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garvin Nuvi 350 GPS","review":"Very disappointed.

It's so bad that if I take it with me, I'm sure to download MapQuest information and any other information that I can find to make sure that I won't get lost when the Nuvi begins its eternal search for satellites. I can't get Garmin on the phone so right now I'm stuck with this thing. It gets better reception when the antenna is closed, but when you open it to mount it, the reception is lost and the satellite search begins. Warning: Even when it works, it will misdirect you. It will take you in circles. It will lead you to somebody's private driveway in error.

Also you cant really see on the screen and see the roads coming, its confusing. I personally recommend Magellan 760, this is the best unit I have used so far. This does aoutroutiung veru fast and is very reliable. Magellan developed teh Hertz Never Lost system, and they know what they are doing.

The directions are spot on.Great Features: Trip details, gives your average speed, distance, time, etc. Turn by turn directions will get you where you need to go.

It can be taken down and removed easily, but can also be an almost-permanent fixture. It is fantastic.Garmin's products are user-friendly, and have great maps. The nuvi 350 has the text-to-speech option (\\"Turn left on Main Street\\" instead of \\"Turn left here.\\" Very useful) and has a TON of points of interest.The screen size is decent; not too large so you have a real blindspot, but not too small so that you need to squint to see where you're going. Also, everything loads quickly on this device.It does not have Bluetooth capabilities, but I wouldn't go that route unless you absolutely needed it (I don't).It's excellent quality and the price is good.

I downloaded the 79 page Owners' Manual from Garmin's website and was able to look up answers to a couple of my questions. However, to correct a problem, I had to contact Tech Support. I phoned and was advised by a recording that the wait to talk to a human was 40+ minutes. Having better things to do with my time, I decided to e-mail my question. Within a couple of days I received an e-mail in reply which told me how to reset the Nuvi's settings and correct the problem. Other than these issues, its apparently working fine now.

The thing my boss loves is that he's saving money in printing and gas (yeah for not getting lost!)A couple of problems- I've found that the turning warning is about 50 feet off. (still need to call garmin help about that) Some businesses are slightly before or after the location that the Nuvi has recorded.I'm planning on buying at least one more for our admissions office, and am very happy with how the Nuvi has helped me to be on time to the various appointments that go along with my profession."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin nuvi 350","review":"Great product.

My only complaint is that the software could allow more choices... for example instead of \\"faster\\" route allow me to choose only \\"super highways\\" or something along those lines. I point this out because in the Nuvi's attempt to get me to point X faster it took me on some two lane country roads when I would have preferred to just cook along on the autobahn at a 160K.

The listings for restaurants, gas stations and hotels is very complete. The only tricky part is changing from one state to another - you need to find the list under \\"counties\\" no less.

This GPS is well above average, as it tells you where you are going next - not just 'exit left', but 'exit left and then right' so you know what lane to get into.The one thing I would like would be an easy access console, where you can see total miles for the trip, how much further, time, ect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied with the Garmin Nuvi 350","review":"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband.

For the dollar, I don't think you can go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"User friendly","review":"This was a replacement for the same model that I got a little over a year ago. Shortly after the 1 year warranty expired, it stopped being able to receive satellites. However, when it did work, it was very intuitive and provided good directions. I like the different map displays that you can choose as well as the extra features (like the audiobook player). Although I was frustrated that the old one broke, I liked it enough to buy a replacement (especially at Amazon Christmas sale prices)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functionality at a fair price","review":"I don't know much about these GPS systems, yet I do know that as a gift for my 69yo father, it had to be easy to use. I was guided to get a GPS that didn't just tell you to turn in 200 ft, but actually gave you the street name. This is so much better. We just took it out of the box and typed in where we were starting/going and it worked. TOO EASY. My mother thought it would sit in a drawer like his Palm did years ago. She makes him take it everywhere. Be sure to give your GPS a name, Rosie is sooo helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting around","review":"I just love my Garmin Nuvi 350.

After a few weeks it had to be returned to Garmin for repair. At the time I did not know but Garmin sends back a refurbished unit. So I pay for a new unit but now own a refurbished one that I could have probably paid half the price for. Anyway the refurbished unit is also defective and has to be returrned to Garmin for another refurbished one. This would be unaccepable for any other product line (imagine buying a HDTV and after one month having it replaced with a refurbished one). Garmin was not understanding or sympathetic to this inequity (afterall it si their policy - so that makes it OK). So for three months I have had two defective units (Garmin has had them for several weeks as well). Obviously I would never buy from Garmin again. I am stuck in this situation but not happy about it. I can only hope the next refurbished unit works."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARMIN NUVI350 GPS","review":"THE GPS WORKS FAIRLY WELL BUT SUCTION CUP THAT GOES ON WINDOW DOES NOT HOLD VERY WELL FELL OFF THREE DIFFERENT TIME SO DON'T USE IT ANY MORE IF I WERE TO BUY ANOTHER ONE I WOULD LOOK FOR ONE THAT HOLDS BETTER.

I decided to stick with Garmin because I loved my StreetPilot and never had any problems with it. I always found a satellite signal very quickly and never had any problems finding locations(even in Canada). I had problems with the Garmin Nuvi 350 from day one. I rarely got a satellite signal and if I did I was usually halfway to my destination already. The battery life was terrible and many times it lost battery power and turned off before I was given a low battery warning. Finally, after 3 months of use the touch screen froze up and it was impossible to use and I returned it. I may have a received a defective unit but overall I was very disapointed in the quality of the Garmin Nuvi 350 and would not recommend this model to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"This may sound crazy but it almost took me a year and a half to decide on which GPS to get.

The Text to Speech (TTS) feature allowing the unit to speak street names performs well enough to recognize the street without looking at the unit.The speed of the Garmin's route calculation is more important that simply allowing you to set off quicker, though. If you miss a turn en route, the machine must recalculate your trip so it can correct your path. The readability of the screen is very good. Even in bright daylight, the screen can be easily read."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well","review":"gets me to where i'm going pretty darn well. It may not have every private house number but will always get you to the street. Only used it a few times but really like it.

Overall I think it is graet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice","review":"I have owned this for a few months now. It performs as expected. It was a good deal at $200 since it is an older model, but the only difference in the new model that I am aware of is a slightly wider screen. I don't feel like that would be worth it. The text to speech does a nice job. It has a lot of great features. The speedometer is nice, showing my car speedo to be accurate and my motorcycle speedo to be about 5% high, both as expected. If you've done your research, you know what it has. I've found everything to be as expected. I like that it also has an MP3 player.Minor Cons:It didn't promise, but I was really hoping it would also have an alarm clock (it is a pretty simple feature) but it does not.I think it is supposed to have the 2008 maps. My house was finished June 2006, the street was there for a while before that, but my street is not on the map."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love it!!!","review":"My GPS is very helpful, especially the way it recalculates your route when you don't exactly follow the route as plotted.

Very easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent navigator","review":"Very simply, this is an excellent product that not only helps you find the way with the least trouble, it is also a product that promotes safety in that it allows the driver to concentrate on the road and not on decyphering highway and street signs. The great thing over a written map route is that you can change your route and the navigator recalculates the trip from your present location. Finally, the navigator is small and compact so you can remove it from your car and stick it in your pocket to avoid theft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Nuvi - what a time saver","review":"We bought the Garmin Nuvi for our service technician and it has saved him a lot of time.

Pretty much all worked same for me but nuvi 350 is a slim model, which is attractive and portable. I carry it in my pocket if i m flying somewhere. It is very convenient. Reason for giving it 4 stars is that it takes a second or 2 more than streetpilot to acquire satelite reception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Unit!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This unit is a great unit and a reliable unit. I was amazed a the accuracy of this unit. I have used this GPS for about a month and am very pleased with it.

The Garmin nuvi 350 is very easy to set up and use. It is very compact and can fit in a shirt pocket. The touch screen system is intuitive and easy to navigate (pun intended;). I traveled to NYC recently and actually used the product while walking through Manhattan!Some of the quirks I have noticed so far; while guiding me to the Hartford Airport, the device sent me to the maintenance side rather than the commercial side (very annoying). Some newer streets do not appear on the map and I have not figured out how to update the maps without paying an exorbitant amount of money.The Pros heavily outweigh the Cons though, so I would heartily recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nuvi 350 is solid","review":"Great GPS. Very easy to work and access the various features. I couldn't be happier. First used it from Raleigh NC to Buffalo NY and it was great not having to read a map.

Upon further research I found that this is a very common problem and the only solution is to return the Unit for repairs.I am returning the Unit, since I am out of warranty they wanted to charge another $50 for repairs but they waived it off.I don't expect such an expensive thing to get these kind of problems just after 1 year.

It is so nice to be able to see what street is comming up before you can see the actual street sign. Also It directed me where to turn when the actual street signs were missing or obstructed ( a case where I surely would have gotten lost or made multiple turn arounds ) Being able to instantly see gas and food options around you is fantastic.

Easy to use, and it picks up satellites quickly anywhere in the car; I usually leave mine on the center console and don't bother to stick in on the windshield. When you arrive, snap it off the power cord, put it in its leather case, and drop it in your pocket.

This week left NYC via Lincoln Tunnel heading to Albany. Instead of it taking me up 95 to the Parkway we went hwy 17 and around Giants stadium. I've changed the settings from quickest to shortest and back but when given too many roads choices it doesn't seem to key to the Thruways or Interstates over hwy's or surface roads.

My wife and I tested this unit on a 100 mile trip and it was great!! It also found a great shortcut for me around a traffic jam on the way to work one morning (I just deviated from my normal route and let the Nuvi recalculate a different route to work.) Besides giving flawless turn by turn directions, the Nuvi 350 plays mp3s, audiobooks and has a translator (only comes with a sample program, the whole program costs an additional $60-$70).

We took it on a test drive to a location that my dad knew well, and he took a shortcut that was different from the way the Nuvi directed us, it immediately recalculated, and took us the rest of the way on the route that my dad was planning to use.

It happened a lot in Kentucky but because I don't know Tennessee as much as I know Kentucky, I felt so desperate.

There are two small glitches: There has been a little problem with the suction device used to attach the Garmin to the windshield. It does not \\"stick\\" as tightly as I think it should and I occasionally have to reseat it. It may be due in part to temperature changes because I usually notice it first thing in the morning. The other issue is that both my home and work location are about 2/10ths of a mile off from what the GPS indicates. I don't notice any significant discrepancies anywhere else. In spite of these points, I'm happy with my purchase and wish I had bought it sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT NEW PRODUCT","review":"This is my fourth nav system.

I did find that the directions were sending me in the opposite direction at first, but that had to do with the antenna not being up and able to connect with the satellite. I like the map views and the voice directions as well as the written directions. I love the size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I would recommend this product. It works very well. A little slow finding a satellite but once it does it responds very quickly to wrong turns with an almost instant alternate route. I had the Magellen 3225 which I returned because it always wanted you to make a U-turns or was very slow in responding to an alternate route."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frakking amazing.","review":"The positive reviews here have proven to be accurate. I've only used the Nuvi 350 for a day but this is absolute: this gadget is going to be equally as valuable to me as my iPod. It has a beautifully designed touch screen menu system, it's fast and responsive, and has been consistently accurate. There was heavy rain and cloud cover today in Manhattan but it had no problem establishing strong satellite signal connections! My Nuvi is very compact so he's definitely coming along with me on my travels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as fast as the 660","review":"This item appears to have been used, repackaged and sold to me as new.I have the 660 as well and it outperforms the 350 in satellite acquisition time as well as route recalculation time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nuvi Navigator","review":"This is an excellent tool for the traveler. I just started in a new territory and could not have performed this job without it. Graphics are clear. However, there were a few roads not loaded into the system.Other than that, I rate this product 4 stars.Ann in VA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uses old maps","review":"My subdivision is 4 years old and appears on Google Maps, Mapquest, and Yahoo...but not on this Garmin Nuvi 350. It cannot find my house, the subdivision, or the tollway to it (which has been open for about 2 years). I have connected the unit to the Garmin web for the latest update...none available. If you travel or live anywhere that has undergone change or addition in the last 4 to 5 years be advised that Garmin probably will not be able to get you there. On old established roadways it seems to do a great job. Hate to turn in a negative review amongst all of these positives, but 400.00 for a GPS that cannot find your own house is unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great WHEN the maps are right","review":"I got this GPS with high hopes, I travel a lot and I am tired of printing out tripquest maps. I hooked it to my computer and downloaded the latest updates. Everything about the unit works great, it is easy to use, I love how it talks to you, easy directions, etc. However, at least in my area, the maps are wrong, worse than an online free map service. Just in town it was wrong three times in one day and on trips around this area of a 150 miles or so it was wrong each time. Maybe it works well in larger more urban areas but it isn't ready for primetime here yet. I returned the unit and of course Amazon's customer service was great as always. I'm hoping maps for these improve in the future as they continue to come down in price. I am very disappointed but I can't justify the price for something that is wrong so often. The bottom line is the map needs to be correct most of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I previously owned a Magellan RoadMate 700. While it was a decent GPS unit, it had several shortcomings that the Garmin Nuvi 350 has addressed.First off, it has an internal battery, so it can be used without running power cords all over the car. The battery life seems pretty good, although I doubt it would be useful for much longer than about 4 hours.Secondly, it's extremely small and light, but doesn't sacrifice screen size or quality.The fact that the unit announces actual street names is great. I've been wanting this feature for years!The Nuvi also acquires a satellite signal very quickly - usually less than 30 seconds even while in motion. The RoadMate would sometimes take upwards of 5 minutes, particularly if the car was moving when the unit was turned on.All in all, it's worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I purchased this item after my wife bought the same for me six months earlier. After seeing mine, she had GPS-envy and wanted her own. This is a very good product. The only negatives are that it is difficult to acquire a signal in urban downtown settings, and there is a significant cost to updating the map software."},{"rating":"1","title":"My GPS...","review":"I am disappointed with my GPS.

Once I was looking for a restaurant which has been in existence for more than 6 years but the Garmin did not find it and instead sent me to one several miles way in another city. The same thing happened for a retail store which has not been at a location in the memory of the folks who are now there. The Garmin I have has a 2006 map so these two events are puzzling to me.I want to have greater confidence in the directions but these two incidents make me nervous about just trusting the directions given."},{"rating":"2","title":"will get you there","review":"Love the product. We used it on our vacation. The only negative I can say about the GPS was that it would take us right straight into major cities (downtown) instead of taking freeway loops. So you really do need a physical map to make sure the GPS is giving you the best route. We loved the feature of finding stores, motels and such. The GPS even gave phone numbers in which to call ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far so good","review":"We have only used our new GPS a couple of times and it has worked great, however the real test will be on our upcoming trip to Florida.

No more getting lost!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Choice","review":"I am glad I purchased this GPS. The 3D view is very cool love it. The volume is loud enough so you can listen to music while driving. The GPS has a MP3 player. I will say it takes a long time for the GPS to reroute. It should be alot quicker. On the other hand it gives great fastest way directions however it can sometimes send you a longer route to get to the highway when there is an easier way to go or shorter route.

Concerns about small size & lack of features in this price range proved unfounded. This is a great device - very easy to use. In fact, I'd say it's the most intuitively easy to use device I've ever owned.

Amazon was more than fair. They have since refunded my money, and now that, I've done more research on the Garmin, I will buy one with the wide angle. After all I wanted it to take with us on our trip to the Smokies, but it didn't turn out that way....I'm sure I just received a lemon, like so many of us do..I know of 4 people who also have the 350 and none of them have had any trouble with theirs...even though I had trouble with this one, I would not hesitate to buy another Garmin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps a faulty product!","review":"After reading wondeful reviews about this product, we decided to invest in one. Sadly, the Garmin was unable to locate a satellite with ease at our home. We would have to drive down our road and wait for a signal in order to program it for a destination site. We discovered that the commands were frequently too sudden and eventually the Garmin lagged at least a mile with its driving directions. When all else failed, it was delightfully helpful in finding us a nearby restaurant when we got lost but was unable to help us find \\"home\\".We were too reticent to purchase a replacement product and will do more research about another navigator."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd love to love it","review":"This Garmin worked wonderfully for the first two days it was in my car. It was simple to use, friendly and changed my whole driving life. It did for my sense of direction what my cell phone did for my number retention so many years ago. Then suddenly it stopped working and merely \\"searched for satelites\\" all day long. I called the difficult to find 800 number, waited 45 minutes for a costumer service representative and mailed it in for service. I was informed that I should have in back in about three days. I was skeptical, but hopeful. It's been two weeks and I've heard nothing from Garmin. I still wait with bated breath to have this ingenious little directional voice back my everlost VW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for traveling","review":"We used our new Garmin on vacation and were able to find gas stations, restaurants, shopping, and more. It was awesome. Not perfectly accurate, it did try to direct us down some roads that didn't exist and even had me at a grocery store where there was actually just a rock wall. But in the scope of how much we relied on it, it was right on most of the time. So glad we had it!

It'd be better if the venues phone number is included in addition to the address / and directions to get there.But the keypad function is hard to get used to, because it doesn't have a regular keyboard lay out; all letters are laid out in alphabetical order. I think people who are used to typing will have the same problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best On The Market","review":"The Nuvi 350 is the best navigator on the market. You can't go wrong with any Garmin product. The only criticism I could come up with is that the text to speech feature sometimes comes up with a funny pronunciation of street names. Nothing that affects your ability to navigate though since you simply look at the written street name on the screen. The more I use it the better it gets.

I bought it because we're in the process of moving to an area that I'm totally unfamiliar with and wanted something to guide me, first on getting there, and then to help me find my way around. The Nuvi 350 fits the bill! It's very user-friendly: easy to follow instructions, clear, colorful images, and simple to install and use, and it's portable. I like that it tells you the street names and not just \\"make a right in .5 miles.\\" I did have to return the first one because the color on the screen faded and went very pale, but the Garmin tech support was very helpful and patient, even though they could not fix the problem over the phone. The exchange was a breeze! So this is a review not only for my Garmin Nuvi 350, but also for Amazon.com. The price was fantastic as I did shop around. Delivery was fast and free!

I bought it just for navigation so I haven't tried to load Mp3's or photos yet, but it will be easy. Great out of the box performance.

Second, once the battery is drained and needs recharging you cannot use the GPS functions while the unit is charging.! Are you kidding me? Who are the idiots who designed this thing? So there you are, in the middle of nowehere, and you can't use your Garmin Nuvi 350 because the battery needs charging. In contrast, my TomTom One can be used while it is charging in the car. Third, the TomTom user interface is much more intuitive and faster to navigate.Don't waste your money. I sold my Nuvi 350 but am keeping my TomTom.

The voice prompts for street names is an excellent feature. The leather carrying case was excellent and fit nicely into my purse. A lot of research went into buying this product and I feel we got a great deal through Amazon and could not be happier with our Garmin.

The unit would have to be reset (located on the back of the unit) and then it would find the signal OK. When the Unit was working it was awesome and I regret that I am returning it as it can't be relied upon. If it was capable of locking onto a signal reliably, it would be an AWESOME unit.

Amazon had the lowest price for this item that I found when I was researching where to buy it, and now I have advertised it to others who want to buy it. I feel a new level of confidence when I go to a new town or big city, and since I can always find my way around, it takes less time to find things than getting lost and driving for a while to look for certain destinations.

Garmin understandably refused to fix it for free.I purchased a second one and all was joyous again. A friend suggested I bring it along for a trip so I put it in a case in my side pocket. When I pulled it out again the screen was horribly cracked. It was a tight but not exceptionally tight fit in my pocket and I find it incredible that this managed to destroy it. Garmin has also refused to consider this one for replacement under warranty.Overall, I feel like this product needs a little more ruggedization before being described as a \\"Pocket Navigator\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE! Navigator Battery is NOT REMOVABLE!","review":"The biggest drawback of this navigator is that manufacturer is still continues to make them with no access to the battery.So how it can be a PORTABLE navigator than?Let's say you are riding a bike or hiking with this navigator, and in 4-6 hours your battery run out of juice, and you STUCK in the middle of forest?That's not nice at all!Now if you could change a battery, you just put a fresh one, and you are on your way again!The other point - once you recharge the battery installed inside the devise for 500 - 700 times it will be almost dead and not to hold a charge.What it means for you - you have to Pay BIG BUCKS for TECHNICIAN to INSTALL A NEW BATTERY.GARMIN, COME ON, FIX THIS PROBLEM, than you might have an Awesome product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great with some problems","review":"The GPS is terrific in most respects. There are two significant problems that are significant. The suction cup that mounts the unit to the windshield or on the provided disk for mounting elsewhere, does not hold suction. It is defective. Also the auto electrical adaptor does not work well on a plug in that otherwise works perfectly on cell phone connects, so it is defective, I believe. This is the second Nuvi 350 I purchased; the first one was for me and the second one was a gift to my daughter. The earlier one has neither problems. I went on line to get a thrid party suction cup to fix the first prolem (it works great), and the electrical connector is just being nursed along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after a year...","review":"Great little gizmo...but it died after only a little more than a year. Not what I expected for the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding !","review":"I love my new Garmin NUVI 350. Garmin has done a great job of making it easy to use, and it's small size makes it easy to install, yet the display is large enough to be useful. It quickly calcultes routes (in just a couple of seconds)and the voice prompts are truly helpful when driving in areas you are not familiar with. I just used it on a cross country trip and was amazed at how much easier travel was with food, fuel,rest area and hotel info immediately available at my fingertips. The 350 was also very useful when I was recently looking for real estate in an area that I knew little about....just type in the address and you are off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple to Use, Intuitive, Fabulous","review":"Some reviewers complained that it doesn't come with a full instruction manual. I found it so incredibly easy to use that I would never have opened one up. A \\"green\\" move by Garmin. I love this thing. The maps are very current and while driving to our favorite destination in WV, NUVI even directed us to our favorite secret shortcut. The recalculations when I miss a turn or decide to take a different road are lightening fast. I also really like the automatic switch to nighttime screen. We use the altitude feature a lot, too, since we mountain bike. I love the current location thing...I can just save it and find my way back to really cool off the beaten path trails. One of my favorite tech toys of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"My only regret is ...","review":"... that I didn't purchase this sooner!!!!

I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Right Choice","review":"I had originally tried a Magellan GPS unit that required downloading of Canadian maps--to my Mac--it only worked with a PC. I returned it. I bought the Nuvi 350 on the advice of friends. It's Mac friendly, but required no downloads for Canada. I'm technically illiterate. I wasn't sure about assembly though it's very simple. I called for technical assistance. I got right through to a highly competent person who didn't bewilder me with his accent! I tried the Nuvi on recent trip. It took me where I was going beautifully. I'd buy the mount that sits on the dash rather than the windshield attachment that comes with it. It works perfectly, and you can get it out of sight easily so you don't signal the bad guys that you have a GPS unit in the car to steal."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it ...","review":"I bought the Nuvi 350 prior to a cross-country trip and it worked out great. I take the little sucker with me everwhere now. It's my little pal. I have never (not once, I'm not kidding) lost connection while driving. My wife had a factory Nav system in her Accord and has a new one in her Acura - both of them lose satelite connection once in a while. I was concerned about that with a portable decive but have been pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes too long to connect to satellites","review":"This would be a great gps if it didn't take 5-10 minutes to connect to a satellite. Sometimes I get lucky and it connects within a minute or 2, but most of the time it takes at least 3-5 minutes. Sometimes rebooting it helps to connect, but not always.Aside from that it is a great device.

It takes time to put a data. If I want a new map I had to purchase a new map."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recharging","review":"The Garmin did show after pushing a few prompts what the exact direction were. However, the Garmin would die out after an hour or two. This is bad especially for long trips on the freeway. Secondly, if the Garmin needs recharging (while you are driving) you cannot see or hear the directions nor do you get visual. Therefore, if you need to turn, etc you might get lost.Garmin takes too many different processes to get something accomplished. I believe there are easier navigation devices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Item does not include cradle","review":"Item was in good condition but did not include the cradle. I've had to buy that separately for another $30 including shipping. Do the math, probably better to buy one of these items new. I only bought it because it will work with my Argent Data System Tracker 2 APRS modem (with an USB to serial adapter cable) Can't test the capability till the mount arrives. There was a snafo on shipping but was FEDEX's problem. They delivered the item but left it in an out of the way spot after allowing a neighbor to sing for it. The vendor was in a bad spot, all they had was the item was signed for so I was left in the lurch, but they did work with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome GPS System","review":"This is the best GPS in the market in the under $500 range.

First, it doesn't have Bluetooth capability (which doesn't bother me, as my Magellan had poor audio quality). Second, the maps are from 2006. Most times that isn't a problem, but I find it strange that Garmin doesn't provide a free update, given they have the new maps. This simply reminds me that the unit was manufactured a couple of years ago and has been sitting in a box.Garmin, this unit is great, but be a class act and give us the newest maps for free, ok?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin 350 GPS","review":"I gave the GPS to my wife for Christmas. She found it easy to use and has learned how take advantage of its feature. She is pleased with it, and so am I.She uses it in a Suburban and the windshield is a little far from the driver seat. It makes entering information on the GPS inconvinient. A longer handle holding the GPS to the windshield, that would bring the GPS closer to the driver, would be helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, but....","review":"The maps and, especially, the POI's are way out of date. Maybe it's a function of our rapidly growing area in NC, but many 2-3 year old road modifications and additions are not included in the latest update. And, the POI's--restaurants, hotels, etc.--can be quite interesting. Some are merely closed or changed, but a few (one of which which turned out to be an older home) never were. To be fair, this is not a Garmin thing: Virtually all mapping programs (computer or gps) use the same map data.Still, it is a fun and very useful tool--I even bought a second one for our second car. It has saved us many a time and its estimates of arrival times, even on long trips, are uncannily accurate. Just don't trust it implicitly; keep your eyes on the road signs and be ready to over-ride the Nuvi when necessary, especially where recent changes have been made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tar-like substance on your automobile windshield","review":"The NUVI works fine...BUT...beware trying to move it from one car to another. The suction cup frazzles and partly disintegrates on your windshield. Garmin sends you another...for free...but it just happens again. The residue on your windshield is tar-like and disgusting. Unbelievable that a product like this should be so poorly designed. I am getting nowhere with the HELP desk, except that they send another defective windshield attachment. Does anybody have any suggestions?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly conceived and gives LOTS of simply wrong directions","review":"I can't believe the designers of this product have ever tried to use it. Allowing the user to enter the zip code as a shortcut, instead of having to type out the city name each time, would be obvious to an idiot ... but not to the people at Garmin.Yes, 80% of the time, the device is wonderful. But the other 20%? Better stay on your toes for an instruction to get back onto the freeway you just exited, going in the opposite direction, AWAY from your destination. Or turning into a residential neighborhood that is miles away from where you're trying to go.I received these idiot instructions about one out of every two or three trips.BAD PRODUCT - BEWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sending My Nuvi Back","review":"Very disappointing. Can't find a church near my home which has been there for 40 years. Can't find Wal Mart two miles from here, which was built over 2 years ago. Nuvi says closest Walgreen is 10 miles away while I am sitting in the parking lot of a Walgreen. Says no \\"Bob\\" in database although we just passed a Bob Evans and it lists the Bob Evans in my home town. And on and on. When is the last time these maps were updated?Definitely not worth $ 700."},{"rating":"1","title":"programing is horrible","review":"Garmin nüvi 350 3.5-Inch Portable GPS NavigatorI gave this to my wife for Christmas prior to taking an extended road trip, the route we had been on previously.

I checked everywhere to find a manual, but even the content list did not mention a manual. Finally, when I connect the machine to the computer, I found a manual. I tried to transfer some MP3 files to the 350. But it was so slow, I though the USB port must be a USB 1.1 port on the machine. I just don't know why such a expensive stuff won't install a USB 2 port on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viewing the screen a problem in sunlit environ.","review":"As is the case with most camcorders and digital cameras featuring a video screen, the data on the Nuvi 350 screen is barely visible in direct or indirect sunlight when mounted on the windshield. And since 90% of my driving is in daylight hours and since I reside in the Southeast US where the sun's brightness is significantly higher than in the northern climes, viewing the display is a problem. Only complaint I have. All other features are most satisfactory. Just wish I could see the data more clearly, at a quick glance actually, so my attention could be where it should be, primarily outside the vehicle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great GPS","review":"It's smart enough to know when I make a wrong turn. Also smart enough to avoid highways (preference because I'm really close to work). It's really cool being able to pick a destination and just go. Miss a turn, no biggie, it slightly scolds you, says recalculating and then sends you on your way. I'll also say the GPS Receiver the SirF Star III I believe is most incredible. I've got a handheld GPS and the TTFF (Time To First Fix) is incredibly short. I haven't tried the traffic receiver yet, but I'm anxious.Only complaint, while mine has the most current map the POI database that's preloaded has a few establishments that are closed at this time, and some new ones (restaurants and such) that aren't in there. I'm relatively new to the GPS market but I haven't found a way to update them via purchasing maps from the manufacturer or otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reconditioned Nuvi not New as Advertised","review":"I received (2) defective Garmin 350's.

I was with my father and it even blew HIM away! I felt SO secure and safe knowing that IT knew how to get me from point A to point B without a glitch! In fact, I PURPOSELY made a wrong turn and it RECALCULATED itself to know where I was and STILL continued to take me to my destination! AMAZING!

If you were told by Garmin tech support (as I was) that you could go ahead and buy the device with the v8 maps and you would be provided with a free map upgrade YOU WERE LIED TO! You were expected to notice (according to Garmin) that this long standing update policy had been changed.

Purchased it on Amazon and the price has dropped a lot since then due to newer model, but I still love the compact size.Easy to do firmware update. After loading the new firmware, make sure you reboot the device twice to have proper update. Register on Garmin web site and they will notify you of updates.Small enough to stick it to left corner of the windshield. The holding arm tends to fall off if dusty, so clean it with a damp towel before putting it on another windshield.Used it in Paris and it was great. Kind of miss the feeling of being lost in a foreign country :) but saved ton of times.It says the street name, so very convenient.[04/05/2007 update] forgot to mention that if you'd like to protect the touch screen, purchase a screen protector from shieldzone.

Once I drove off course, it sense it immediately and automatically reroute me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value; Easy to Use","review":"The Garmin Nuvi 350 GPS is a good value for the money, particularly at the 40% discount from list price. The menu is uncluttered and the device is easy to use. One nice feature is that the GPS automatically recalculates the route if you decide to detour.One mechanical feature that could be improved is that the windshield/dash mount doesn't always hold very well. Also, the range of motion for adjusting the screen is more limited than I would have liked.After having another brand of GPS previously that was in same price range, I find this model far superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but I have seen better","review":"This product isn't bad. It take longer to acquire sattlite access than my boyfriends 260. It takes his about 6 seconds while my 350 takes about a minute everytime I turn it on. The directions are ok but sometimes it can not find businesses (like a local Walmart) that have been built for over 7 years. You have to know there eact address. Sometimes you can have the address but it will take you to an area where the business is not located but if you put in the business name it will take you to the front door.I had send my first one back because the battery went completely dead after only 2 weeks.

Also has info about shopping centres, food destinations, airports, rentals which is an added bonus.As far as upgrades are concerned, I am looking forward to them storing info about prior warnings about the traffic cameras so that we could adjust our speeds(etc..) and be more cautioned.

It's extremely user friendly. I specifically like how it tells you expected time of arrival.Some minor kinks: It doesn't always tell you the best way to go (but then again what GPS really does?) So, I always be sure to look at a map for long trips first, so that I at least know the major highways I want to take (sometimes it tries to take you on smaller highways, backroads, and that makes no sense because the speed limit is lower and you hit red lights)Also, on really rainy cloudy days, it takes a LONG LONG time to load, so always plan for a few extra minutes for your GPS to get signal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good GPS","review":"This Garmin works excellently when you type in a specific address. It found addresses and roads in remote Montana and Wyoming. My only gripe with this product is with its listings of gas stations and restaurants. We were never able to find a single restaurant it listed (other than Perkins), all other restaurants had closed or never existed to begin with. Gas stations were equally troublesome, we went through 5 in a suburb of Chicago before finding one that actually existed. It announces turns well ahead of time. The only annoying thing is there is no pause button, so if you decide to stop somewhere the unit will repeatedly keep \\"recalculating\\" and it says this outloud, until you get back on your original route. It can be hell bent on taking a certain road, so detours are troublesome too.

I was testing it and it wanted to take me out of the way through a neighborhood to avoid the state road I was on.

Amazon graciously refunded my shipping charges, however, so all turned out well.As for the product, it is great. A good buy for the price; it has plenty of features that my son liked. He was very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Garmin","review":"Product exceeded expectations. Very easy to use. Convenient size. Used a great deal when travelling on business and pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing little device -- even in Boston","review":"I've always been spatially challenged, a particular liability in a city like Boston, filled with dead-ends, strange 5-way intersections, non-parallel streets, roads that have different names on different sides of the same street, and a sadistic lack of signage. Nevertheless, this faithful little guide shows me around Boston and its environs beautifully.Admittedly, I have not tried it around too much in the Big Dig tunnels, but it works fine in downtown Boston, in Cambridge, and in the suburbs. It's small, got a beautiful screen, is easy to use, and has a lot of waypoints.My only small criticims are that its touchscreen keyboard is not QWERTY, and that it could have even more waypoints. Highly, highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Map is out of date, but update will cost you $75","review":"I bought a NUVI 350 last Nov. It has problems sometimes (about 10-15%). Such as \\"can't find the location\\", wrong direction, wrong street names. I called the support, found that map and software are out of date, but I was told that I have to pay $75 to update the map. It is unreasonable for a product purchased less than one year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product.","review":"We've had one for about 6 months and it is very unreliable. Sometimes it'll get you there without problem, but too many times it'll steer you wrong. I can understand something being off a bit now and then, but this thing has too many things wrong with it to list. Garmin doesn't support its product either. I'd rather use a road map than this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect much","review":"There have been many times the Garmin nuvi 350 has frozen up on me. I'll turn it off and on again hoping it will reboot but it doesn't seem to work. I can't even tell you how many times this thing has left me stranded. The last and final straw was a few days ago when it left me high and dry in the Yankee Stadium area of the South Bronx. Do yourself a favor and buy a compass instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin nüvi 350 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Navigator","review":"Works pretty well, sometimes it wont recognize when I arrive. Once the address was on a oneway street and it didn't tell me how to get there, in fact it told me it was on the opposite side of the street. But as a whole it is helpful because it calls the street names to turn on and it has a detour which for me is great because I drive in LA."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new best friend","review":"I did a lot of research before purchasing my Nuvi 350 and was not disappointed. The size is perfect (I debated getting the bigger one) and does not interfere with seeing the road but I can read it easily.I was a little nervous how it would fare since I am currently living in the Middle East and I am happy to report that it is fabulous! The maps are accurate, the directions spot on and even the voice directions with street names are correct. Amazing!The extras such as mp3 players and locations (is programed with grocery stores, hospitals, shopping malls, restaurants, etc.) are a nice bonus too.I couldn't be happier with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great combination product from Garmin","review":"We went in with various family members to purchase this item for my Dad this Christmas. Needless to say, it was a hit - probably the first time in a dozen years that we've actually pulled one over on him.I put in a good deal of research to find a versatile handheld GPS knowing that my Dad had borrowed one in the past. After a while I came to the realization that at this point he needs something with a somewhat larger screen that he could use in the car. Thanks to some good cross-referencing by Amazon and other reviewers I ran across this unit. The key selling and performance points for this product were: portability/size, intuitive interface, storage and expansion, driving features, and certainly cost. The other features such as ability to display photos and play mp3s is fine too. As hinted above, this rating did consider the relationship of features to cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad quality","review":"I have bought many electronics from amazon over the years. The first time I have to return. The 350 is light, pocket size; lcd is bright; voice is clear; text-speech is great; play mp3 and photos even though I don't expect to use them very much. Everything is great until a week later. The lcd screen went nuts. The whole screen turns into bright grey and you can't see nothing. Reset didn't help much. Once a while things will go back to normal.Very disappointed experience. I am not even sure I got a new, open box item, or refurbished unit. There is no CD not even a user guide in the box. I download the manual from their website which has much more information. The box is in a plastic bag that is not even sealed. Shipped it back today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I had bought this sooner","review":"The Garmin 350 has met and exceeded my expectations. I travel on a regular basis, and this device has dramatically simplified my life.I only wish I had purchased one sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly rated and worth it","review":"I bought this because it was highly rated at different reputable sites for it's mid-range price, portable size, use of text-to-speech announcing street names where some just give distance before the turn instructions. I did not need the blue tooth technology so this was a better model for me than the next level of nuvi's and allowed me to save some money. I have only used it a few times and am still learning to maneuver through the menu, but it has been a huge convenience, I think it was worth the price and am highly recommending it. Amazon beat the best price anywhere I checked (even Walmart)during the Christmas holiday and I did an extensive search."},{"rating":"2","title":"USE AN IGRIP TO HOLD IT NEXT TO THE SPEEDOMETER","review":"I got this gps but did not like the thing on the windshield and it slid around when placed next to the speedometer. Now I use an IGRIP to hold it next to the speedometer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best GPS system for the money and size!","review":"Garmin makes the best GPS systems hands-down. It's all about user-friendliness and mapping software. Magellan and Lowrance are too difficult to operate. I had a Garmin c320 and the Nuvi 350 is the same outstanding GPS but only about the size of a deck of cards. It's auto recharting of route is fabulous. I live in Chicago and deliberately miss the exits just so the unit will chart a new route for me - on it's own. Oh, the little thrills in life! The MP3 player has excellent sound quality and can file songs according to artist, album or genre. I utilize a 1 gb memory card which will hold 170 songs. The Nuvi hard drive is large enough to download several states. I highly recommend this unit as it will be the best money that you ever spent. Plus, the size of the unit comes with small leather carry case) allows you to slip into your pocket or purse. Thanks Garmin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome !","review":"This is my first GPS purchase which I made after a lot of research and talking with my friends. I narrowed my choices to Nuvi 350 and 660. I decided on 350 because I wasn't sure how much I will using the GPS. Screen size of 350 is good enough and display is excellent. I was a bit worried about audio for such a small size but it was sufficient. Maps are very accurate and signal recpetion is great. Overall, I am very satisfied with my choice and purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just finished a 3000 mile trip.","review":"I have a Magellan eXplorist I use for geocaching and navigation but the the long trip we were heading on included many unfamiliar spots so we bought this unit. I paid $355 and the prices are still going down. The cheapest I just saw was $299.99 at a big chain sporting goods store ad.Overall I am very happy with the way the Nuvi navigated us around. It is easy to use and helpful to be able to find nearest gas stations or banks to get more gas money.The battery with everything on full lasted about 4 hours. One time I let the battery run all the way down and it took a LONG time to recharge and would not boot up until then. I'm not sure if that is normal, maybe I just hooked it up wrong and it wasn't charging much of the time. The cord for the in car connection is fine but the connection to the device is awkward and when connected is hard to put anywhere but in the dash cradle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to have","review":"I love my Garmin Nuvi 350. It definitely serves its purpose ... I don't worry about getting lost again. It helps me get to where I want to go in less time. My friends got their Garmin Nuvi 350 last year and they are also very satisfied with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice item","review":"I did not know much about GPS, but many of my collegues have them and talk about them. My search on Amazon led me to this item. It was so easy to start operating. It does everything I though it would do.

I love it and saw a 200 that did not have the features mine did. I did not buy it from Amazon. I use it at work to find addresses I need to go to service their copiers. Our first trip to Tennessee I put in the info and drove from Florida to Tennessee with out a glitch. I read an article on the web about a guy who tried all kinds of GPS's. He said to just buy the 350 Garmin. He was right. Worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin nuvi 350","review":"The only complaint is not with the product but with the ads. There was so many choices and features and I felt they could have been clearer. I felt they were assuming more knowlege of the product then 1st time buyers would have.This is my 3rd GPS system and although I loved the others they are built into the vehicle and the upgrades are more then I paid for this system. Their advatage is they turn on and off with the vehicle. I would purchase this same system or similar Garmin product without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nuvi 350","review":"Excellent Navigation in a small package.

This makes it difficult to force an alternate route rather than the one computed by the unit. If it allowed multiple stops, it would be better. Perhaps a software upgrade could be developed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Nuvi 350","review":"Great Product. Loads fast.

I purchased the TomTom oneXL from Amazon and returned it after first trip as it not only did not contain the street for my hotel, but then directed my to the middle of a neighborhood when I found the hotel in its list of hotels. I then purchased the Nuvi and find it to be far superior. The accessories are more comprehensive (no case for tom tom) and better made. The window mount on the nuvi is light years better than the Tom Tom. This is a great item and with the reduced price, a great buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great time and gas saving but more update needs","review":"The device has my satisfaction with its 80% accuracy of the acquisition. It is employed to lead out of the maze. There are times that it made the ways to obsolete or non-existence places, but like every thing in life, there is always room for improvement.For that: (1) detour from the route only works when it is on the route, not before, so user has to be actually on the non-desired route before it can guide to the alternatives, (2) non-existence places need to be updated, (3)the GPS car holder is too stiff, hard to pull the device out without breaking the adhesive that hold the holder to the dash board, (4) the car charger cable when charging the device makes it very fragile to break, here the device is supposed to be used daily so more stable and robustness should be factored in the design.Other than these, it is good to let the 350 be a guidance with human sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Nuvi 350 Review","review":"Works Great and The Price Is Right! You can go wrong with this one.Dr. Chuck Vincent"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact and feature rich","review":"I had this GPS for a week now and I just love it. My previous GPS didn't name the streets as this one does. Nor did it play MP3's or have a SD card slot to view pics we take with our camera.The setup was simple as well as the mounting.If you want a GPS, this is the one to get.

I especially wanted a GPS that \\"spoke to you\\" and gave the street names. My only criticism is that the directions sometimes take you on an odd course.

I found the Garmin very unsatisfactory.We tested the two GPS's side by side in the same car. In town,around buildings or with an overcast sky the G had difficulty in finding a satellite but the T had no problems.We did several tests driving with both units in the same car. The T would drive us past an estblished street leading directly to our home and take us nearly a mile out of the way. On the other hand the G never failed to give us the correct turns.I returned the G bought a TomTom 130S with speech for about $10 more.

For the love of all things Holy....Just pass them by!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old paper maps are superior to this device","review":"Purchased this product prior to a long road trip. The directions provided by the Nuvi were the longest most round about diversion you could possibly come up with. If I would have followed the Nuvi directions my trip would have doubled in length. Even navigation in the city (Washington DC) were off or wrong most of the time. I returned this product because I can navigate much better than this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great GPS Easy to use","review":"I bought this GPS for my husband who constantly gets lost. It is extremely easy to use and set up. One feature that I really like is that it says street names, for example, \\"Turn in 200 yards onto Main Street.\\" Another feature that is helpful is if you miss a direction it immediately recalculates and gets you back on track. The car mount is very handy and also recharges the unit. We have used this many times in the past month and it has even showed us new ways to get to places we know. Of course like with any GPS or computer generated directions there can be slight glitches, but overall I would recommend this to anyone. I can't imagine driving somewhere unknown without it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best new Toy!","review":"I bought my Garmin Nuvi 350 after seeing my friend's. It is portable, convenient, easy to use. I got it mainly cuz of my 50 mile commute and in case of traffic tie-ups, its easy to get off any exit and the GPS 'calculates' new directions from there. I've gotten much more use out of it, then I had anticipated. I use it hiking, biking and lending to teenage daughter for longer trips. I also plan on loading pictures to show to relatives on my next trip instead of having to take umpteen zillin hardcopies. Works straight from the box and set-ups are all intuitive (although you can look at manual on-line). Easy to mount on windshield and I love the portability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need Help in Texas","review":"I purchased the Nuvi 350 based on reviews in CR Magazine and this site. The device works great on know destinations that can be found on Google or Mapquest but I live in a new home development in Texas and it plots the street names around me incorrectly or not at all. The first instruction would take me donwn a steet that is not opened yet. I save as my \\"home\\" location the sales office of this development. From this \\"home\\" location it works great and has plotted a better route several times than I used before from Google Map or Yahoo Maps.

It's pocket size, smaller than the original iPod. It has so many features! The photoshow and MP3 are cool extras and work well. No skipping in the music. I like that you can have it on while you are geting directions. It just pauses the music and gives you the direction. It is very accurate. I have not had one problem with it. The only thing is that it gives you the long way sometimes, but that's fine, it gets you there. I love mine and would highly recommend it. Although its easy to use, I would really only recommend it for tech-savvy people. It is overkill for somene's Mom who just wants to know how to get from A to B. But yeah, this is a great GPS. Buy it if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garmin 350","review":"This unit continues to direct me through subdivisions and off the freeways to back roads and through small towns.

Found it to be very nice and user friendly. Also liked the additional features with conversions, music, photo capability, etc...along with the 700Mb internal memory and SD memory expansion slot.The 3-D maps and POIs are great, and getting to the designated destination is OK. One thing though, the GPS will recalculate to the original charted path, instead of a new one, to get you where you want to go if you missed a turn.

We arrive aroud mid-night without a clue to our location. It was pouring and really hard to read the street signs. Then on the return trip home it was early morning and very foggy. The fog did not let up till around 11:00 AM. Well we loved this GPS, it completely took all the stress out the driving. This model talked to us during the trip and also showed the road we were on and all the streets that intersected as well.

I love the 3-D view, find North American Jill speaking mode to be very clear and best of all are the turn by turn directions.Didn't give it 5 stars because with all the fabulous pros, there are cons.The GPS once instructed me to turn onto a one way street to my destination almost leading me to drive against the traffic! I had to drive around the block to get back onto that same street. Sometimes it can't find point of service locations so maybe the maps need updating and I wonder if it takes me the long way. (Lots of main road usage) But I have found that if it doesn't get me there, it does get me well in the vicinity.Overall, a very good GPS and I still wouldn't leave home without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One complaint","review":"From an operational standpoint, this unit is top notch. It works beautifully, and the features are amazing. The ONLY complaint I have is the faint line of shadows on the right side of the screen.

I finally decided that I could live with it, since the unit works so perfectly otherwise. Garmin should address this issue however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Product...but costs $70 each year to update","review":"The garmin is great. But I wish I had known that is costs $70 a year to update your maps. The updates are essential as construction is constantly changing the face of our roads.

I have to say They LOVE it. They have no problem navigating the screens or the functions. Only downfall is that it's SO Small, that you often hit double keys when spelling out address. Another great feature is the audio-book. My folks download books to the Optional SD card and listen to a book on their trip. The nuvi-350 is a great buy on Amazon, which recently had a huge price drop prompted by the release of Garmin's new 200 series! You don't need the blue-tooth feature of the 360 if you're just trying to get from point A to B."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but","review":"I drive a lot for work and go to area I am unfamiliar with, which is why I purchased a GPS. I decided on the Nuvi 350 for the feature of giving the street names so that you don't have to look at the map. This works well. The biggest problems I have had so far, is the suction cup did not stay on when i changed cars. Customer service was very easy to deal with and they sent me a replacement very quickly. All of the GPS's seem to like to send you places via highways. This is not always the fastest, so if you know the way, don't rely on the GPS. I think this is the same with all the GPS's, not just the Garmin. It is easy to program and the touch screen works well. I am not unhappy that I purchased it. We also have a Magellen that my husband uses.Many of my comparisons are to the Magellen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product Though Could Improve","review":"Pros:- read street names can make you concentrate during driving, avoid to make wrong turns.- has battery as an alternate power source, can be operated by the passengers in the vehicle or without pluging the ignition keys.- fast satellite signal locating when start, save time when urgent.- fast calculating and recalculating routes.- nice looking maps.- good night-drive display mode.- good searchable POI database.- dashboard mounting disk included, good for CA consumers.- portable, easy to dismount and take it with you to avoid stealing.Cons:- a little bit awkward to on/off and change routing avoidness/preference.- speaker should be better for MP3 music.- should have full screen display mode of the photo viewer.- should have keyboard layout mode for inputing, don't like alphabet sequence layout.Overall, this is my second GPS Navigator. The performance is impressive the first time I use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Matches Found","review":"The 'No Matches Found' problem can be fixed by updating the software at Garmin website.

After using it for a year the speakers cut off."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Sales Pitch but Unacceptable","review":"The hardware doesn't work properly and I got stuck with an outdated version of the software. When recently using the unit on a trip the machine could not correctly pronounce some street names.The installed software was so outdated it took me to places that were no longer in existence. It's very apparent that Garmin is just going for the bucks and an unfortunate customer like myself will be forced to pay out the nose for an upgraded version of data that should have come with the unit.Be careful.

I live in a rural area of Arizona and several times NUVI has told me to turn on dirt roads that don't exist and it doesn't have roads in memory that have been in existence for the past three years. Going into major cities, it works great; it takes you exactly where you want to go. I'd buy it again in a minute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin GPS Navigator","review":"I am extremely pleased with my Nuvi 350 GPS navigator.

On the entire trip along the major highways, it kept telling us to make a right turn at every, and I do mean every up coming exit. It wasn't until we actually got to the town of our destination, and within five miles of that distination, that it actually told us the correct turns to make. I think we should have waited on this purchase until we investigated them more thoroughly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, good price, good service.","review":"I gave this GPS navigator to my wife for christmas.

MY wife then used it to go to a bridal shower in northeast Philadelphia and fell in love with it. (up until then she thought it was just another gadget i couldn't live without.)

It is much cheaper to buy a GPS that you can take with you then buy one from the car companies for alot more $$$. I took it with me to California, NYC, and Florida. It helped me navigate to all different vineyards in Napa and throughout Battery Park in NY.I only wish it could find POI's and directions from your own voice like the GPS's in cars. It would be great to just speak than punch things things while driving.Great item and worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eliminates Stress","review":"I drive a lot to lead technical meetings with customers, 1 to 4 hours each way. Some of the places I need to find are new to me and others are just notoriously confusing. This is a stress I don't need when I should be thinking about my meetings. My Nuvi eliminates all of this. It obtains a lock VERY quickly (seconds). I rarely use the pedestrian mode of my Nuvi, but it works very well. The ETA function is handy as well. I chose the Nuvi other other, less expensive models mostly for form factor. GPS are high theft items. Being able to drop the unit in my shirt pocket and carry it with me is a major plus. I must have sold 5 of these through osmosis with my colleagues and customers. This gadget is so very useful, I expect GPS to be as ubiquitous as cell phones within the next few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes the stress out of travels","review":"I just moved to Seattle from a small town and was really worried about getting lost in the big city, so i bought the nuvi and have been thanking myself ever since.

It was a very disappointing experience with this product.It worked very well the first ten days or so. Then while on vacation in California on my way from Kings Canyon to Fresno, it lost satellite signal. I almost got lost because I trusted it so much that I didn't even bring a decent map with me. It never gained back satellite signal that whole day until I got to the hotel. Ever since then it had very poor satellite reception. Over 90% of time it froze up because of poor satellite signal, no matter it was in cities with tall building or in interstate highways out in the open. It basically became useless since then. I tried reset and even discharge/recharge the battery. Nothing worked.Maybe I just had a bad luck with a malfunctioning unit. Does anyone have a similar experience with your Nuvi?After I returned from the vacation, the first thing I did was to return the Nuvi. I am truly disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin GPS","review":"I purchased the Garmin nuvi 350 3.5-Inch Portable GPS. Great product in all aspects. No complaints.

The display is bright and can easily be seen while driving. Once a satellite connection is made, the system hangs on tenaciously. Establishing the initial connection can be an issue - I would recommend an inexpensive add-on external antenna that can be plugged directly into the unit for car use. This really helps to establish a link. The unit can acccess fm traffic info, but this option is pricey.The unit functions as an external drive when connected by usb port and mp3 files can be imported for play. Map updates are via usb port or card.This is a very versatile gps. My only negative is that the battery is built in. When it goes, it will only work while plugged in as a car unit.I wish the battery was replaceable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent choice for GPS","review":"I've had this about a month now, and have used it on 3 different long trips. It has been worth every penny I paid for it. It's the first GPS I have owned and/or used. I compared the routes selected locally just to see how it would do on some local trips for which I know the best route, and it has been accurate everytime. The user interface is very intuitive, though my fat fingers caused me to hit the wrong button a few times. One minor annoyance (and minor it is) is that the highway directions are a bit odd. If for example I'm driving 200 miles on the same interstate, it will actually break the highway into segments anytime another highway has an exit. So for example instead of saying stay on I90 for 200 miles, it will break it down to segments of say 40, 50, 30, and 80 (even though I never leave the highway)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help","review":"I have used the Garmin 350 on a couple of trips and found it to be very helpful.

In the end, I just sent back the entire thing and didn't order another one. I rather go to a store and buy one. Even paying more is better than dealing with what I went through.

Unfortunately, she inherited her navigational sense from me! She could not be more thrilled! When she got it, she kept it on in the car when she was just driving around town, setting her destination first, and it called out every turn ahead of time. The screen, though small, enables her to see the shape of turns coming up, and this makes following the verbal directions much clearer when there might be some doubt.

After populating all the fields (with serial # etc.) I clicked submit, and I got a prompt that said I was using an unsupported browser. I closed Safari and tried Firefox, repeated all the work, clicked submit . . . and nothing happened. (Just like my GPS unit.)

The only down side was that it can take a long time to acquire the satellite and download the maps. I recently traveled to DC. While there, I was in areas of town where the signal strength looked good, but the maps would not download. As soon as I got to a better spot, it downloaded them right away. From that point on, it was great.The best feature was that you could search for things that were in your local. For example, we wanted some Chinese food. The GPS located a restaurant 2 miles away and provide the address AND phone number so we could make reservations! That was awesome! The GPS in my car doesn't even do that.I would recommend this product to anyone.Update 10/20/08I just bought the 650 for my work. It's identical except the screen is bigger.

My only complaint is that it is only audible on the highest volume setting.To my surprise, the Nuvi is smart enough to continue to give directions even if satellite line-of-sight is broken. For example, when using the Nuvi in Boston, the Nuvi continues to navigate me through the underground/underwater tunnels. Very impressive.Now, I am definitely an advocate for GPS navigation systems!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Calculates route quickly and accurately","review":"I've used other GPS's in the past, and they are slow, always lose satellite reception, and bring you in a roundabout route. This Garmin Nuvi 350 is just the opposite -- fast, hardly ever loses reception, and brings you in a direct route. If you get miss a turn, it also recalculates quickly.It is missing some of those features that the other Nuvi's have, but I feel like those are not necessary. You're buying a GPS, not a bluetooth phone. This is the best GPS for its price, I think!One thing that could be improved is the database of restaurants, parks, supermarkets, etc. The feature for finding the nearest restaurant or supermarket is useful, but only if the database is complete. I find that sometimes something as well-known as \\"Wholefoods\\" is not in there.All in all, it's a good GPS.

I am still shocked at that mere fact. But anyways, the product is fantastic. The best feature is that it recalculate directions if you missed a turn, etc. really fast. You will pretty much never get lost with this. It is also nice and very small (read: cute, for all the ladies out there). ZERO REGRETS with this purchase.

It is wonderful for finding restaurants, hotels, stores, etc. It's easy to punch in an address and the Favorites funtion makes storing locations a breeze. The display is bright and the sound very good for such a small unit.

The unit continually tried to reroute me off of the interstate and onto state and local hwys. It doesn't have an interstate only feature.

It took almost 2 weeks to arrive.Once I opened the box and tried out the unit, I found that it had no sound.So I called Garmin and they told me to return the unit to them and they would replace itwith a new one. After waiting another 2 weeks I got a package. Inside was aunit marked \\"recently overhauled\\". It works fine...BUT, didn't I pay for a new one?If I wanted to deal with a used unit I would have shopped on ebay and probablyspent considerably less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made the plunge and couldn't be happier","review":"I have used many different units while traveling, but the Garmin nuvi 350 was my first purchase of a GPS unit. I could not be happier. Very intuitive to operate for the entire family. Never even opened the instruction booklet."},{"rating":"2","title":"My husband loves this GPS.","review":"My husband's birthday present this year was the Garmin nuvi 350. He travels quite a bit in his work and he says this gift is incredibly useful. If there is construction work he would like to avoid or if he just wants a change of scenery, he can ask for an alternate route and be confident that he will not become lost.I like the GPS because it supplies an estimated time of arrival that is extremely accurate.The only drawback is that it does not have a mute button; you must go through several steps to turn the voice off. A overall great deal for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bye mapquest","review":"As a Realtor, often time I have to venture new territories. Before the Garmin I would print directions from mapquest to read as I drive. (Not safe)With the Garmin Nuvi 350 I always know where I am going. With the voice director I never have to look at a map. When she says turn, I turn and I'm there!I recommend the Garmin Nuvi 350 to anyone who spends time on the road. Realtors shouldn't leave home without one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, portable and easy to operate GPS unit","review":"That's my 3rd unit of this kind, the others got stolen and this might be the only problem with it.

This is the first GPS system I have gotten. It does what its suppose to do.I like the compact design. I have mine set to the fastest route and tried it out on a route to my brothers house and the directions were right on. My wife used it to go to a conference for work and her experience was better than expected.I do have one con to the product. I wish it had a text recognition for misspelled words. Or have a \\"did you mean this\\" option and give you stores it thinks you are looking for. When I misspell a store name or it is not typed in the way the GPS would recognize it, the GPS would spin forever. This is the reason it got 4 stars instead of 5.Other than that my experience with the Garmin nuvi 350 is GREAT."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"Stop thinking about it... just put it in the cart and go to the check out.

I especially like the fact that it suggests places in the neighborhood when entering the name.Over the past few weeks however I have become more and more reluctant to using it. This is because several times it happened to me that the suggested route was a long detour to a spot which should have only been a few minutes away. Sometimes also, the route suggestion is plain wrong, nonsense.Garmin should improve the routing system...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Nuvi 350","review":"I love the Garmin Nuvi 350. I am going to be doing a lot of traveling and it makes it so easy. You just program in where you want to go and the voice activation tells you step by step how to get there. You don't even have to look at it once it is programmed, just drive with confidence. And if you happen to turn a different way it immediately relocates and gives new directions. The touch screen is terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeds all expectations!","review":"From the point of view of a person who has little need to be a \\"power user\\" of GPS gear, the Garmin has still been an invaluable tool for its core purpose. No longer will my wife and I rely on my own so-called strong direction sense, even in Europe!Indeed, it is easy to use, portable for even hikes, and looking up local businesses in unfamiliar areas has been worth its weight in gold. All the other whistles and bells haven't even been touched outside of this core functionality, but it truly is a tremendous product for your average user.The small screen may be tough on some of you folks in the 50+ age bracket, so be wary there, and the average volume of directions aloud does not exceed volume of music often. Those are just cautions, have no fear, you cannot go wrong with Garmin to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"garmin 350","review":"Worked as expected.

Anyway, he loves it and since it's portable, we can use it in my car, as well. I'm not crazy about some of the routes it takes (but that might be any GPS device) because it will lead you on some rough back roads when I happen to be familiar with the area and know there are better roads available. He, of course, insists on following the Nuvi's advice rather than mine and ends up driving on some rather dark, bumpy roads. All in all, for the price, it gets the job done and it's easy to use.Nancy (northern NJ)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nuvi 350 GPS Review","review":"I won't recommend this product to buy because of two major reasons.1.

Excellent price!","review":"I bought this product at the best price in the market. I saw the exactly same model at the vehicle dealership for $599. The delivery took a little bit longer than what I expected, probably because of Christmas season. It is convenient, versatile, and economic. We use it all the time to see our fuel efficiency. The only thing to improve is that it doesn't have updated maps for new vicinities.

I live in a rural area, on a country (dirt) road, and my house number doesn't come up, but I expected that. I did some research online, and as far as I can see, the Amazon price for a new unit is the lowest around. I paid $377 NEW, and the day I received it, I checked at a Gander Mountain store in Marquette,MI, and they wanted $700. ***This particular unit comes with a car mount kit, I was confused and bought the car mount separately***"},{"rating":"2","title":"coustomer service","review":"This is a very good GPS very pleased with it.

Contacted Garmin - no response until I contested the charges on my credit card. Then they emailed me a fix that still did not work. Told me to call them - was on hold for 1 hours before I had to hand up.

I think it is probably just taking me another way to the same destination (I hope!). It is easy and intuitive to use, however, and I enjoy changing the voice that guides me - from English, to Australian English, to British English, to Spanish, etc. I like the feature that says the name of the street where I will turn; another GPS I used did not have that feature.

Well, I'm fine with old maps - I just want the unit to work the way it had been working, no need for new maps. Too bad - it's out of warranty, so what if it's a known Garmin problem? I understand that a company can't support an item forever, but I can't help to think it's planned obsolescence - 14-months is a little fast, even these days.Personally, I'll never own another Garmin product (and I own boats, and have had Garmin products for years).

It quickly locks onto GPS satellites, the map quality is very good, and deliberately ignoring its instructions results in it recalculating new paths very quickly. A path from Chicago to Montreal (Canada) was determined in under a minute. The voice prompts are very good. Like all commercial GPS-based equipment, it will not work properly when the satellite signals are unusually weak (e.g., among skyscrapers). The searching for specific categories (e.g., shopping, fuel, restaurants, etc.) can be very useful.What I can't figure out is why Garmin would stick an MP3 player in this navigator.I highly recommend the Garmin Nuvi 350."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful","review":"I love this product especially the POI even if it doesn't show the POI in the map while travelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I noted the great reviews for this product before I bought it.

I am looking for a quicker way to get there, or an easier way to a new place, this GPS is great. It fast and easy to use. The screen is large,and full of color. My only complaint is when I want to go a certain way, and it wants to go another. I wish after a certain amount of time of going in that direction it would learn to go my way. Oh well,can't have it all. No other complaints, it is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Saver","review":"Purchased my Nuvi 350 GPS over a month ago..Used it several times and found it to be exactly what I was looking for. I am NOT the best map reader and my husband usually had to take over the map reading while I drove. NOW with the help of our GPS no more arguing over directions, etc. It is worth every penny we paid for it and would recommend it to anyone since it is so easy to program. Love IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get lost","review":"Used on a trip to Dallas, Tx. from Chicago and it performed great. Found restaurants and gas stations and ATMs with no problem. Only missed one turn going through St.Louis,(my mistake) but it recalculated and put me back on track within 1 mile. Only small draw back was I would like to see a better non-glare screen in bright sun. I Recommend this unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than an i5","review":"I first got the garmin i-5 cuz it was cheaper and i wanted a small gps. big mistake. it was worthless in nyc, and worked not so well in DC (where i live). by worthless i mean, constantly losing signal, etc.i've used the nuvi in dc and philly, in the car and on feet. works fine. also, the navigator has a scrolling map, meaning you search different parts of the map not on the screen. and it labels just about EVERYTHING. I was driving by and noticed a small lake on my right. i clicked on it on the nuvi and it told me the name of the lake. nifty."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it so much I want to buy the company!!","review":"I bought this for my wife and now I don't have to worry about her getting lost in our new comunity. She is not very good with directions so this was an ideal present for her. I like it because we have been able to find a great new Japanese restaurount we didn't know about. Very easy to use and setup. I also found our the the odometer on my car is off by about 5 miles per hour.I am even considering buying the company...one share at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a necessity!","review":"Unfortunately I can't compare it to other GPS navigators b/c I've only owned one. It's a great tool to have, I can't imagine navigating without it anymore. But I can't figure out how to input intersections (often you don't have an exact address) which is a big problem. Screen is very sensitive and sometimes I accidentally disrupt the instructions while driving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I originally ordered a TomTom One over the Garmin Nuvi 350 because it was cheaper, but that was a mistake. It gave me awful directions, and the maps were out of date. One road where I live is about 5 years old, and the TomTom did not have it. The directions were so poor that I would have preferred printing directions from Yahoo instead of using this device.I ended up returning the TomTom and getting the Garmin Nuvi 350, and I am much happier. The Garmin has the road that the TomTom was missing, and the directions are much better.Garmin, most other GPS devices, and web sites like Yahoo all use Navteq maps. These are considered the best. The TomTom uses TeleAtlas, which aren't as good in North America.The Garmin was definitely worth the extra money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Itme","review":"This is an overall great item. I recently used it while moving across the country and was very impressed. The display is good, verbal instructions are good, and it is easy to use. I also like the portable ability it has and you can use it on its own battery power. It is small and can be easily transported around so you don't have to leave it in the car for the heat to damage it or for someone to steal it. I would recommend this product to my friends. I also found the price the cheapest on amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't leave home without it","review":"I originally bought the Garmin 680 for myself. Realized this was a bit too big and falls of the window due to its weight. Bought a 350 for each of my sons. It is a smaller size but uses the same technology and the screen is very easy to see. The boys both love it. Impossible to get lost if you have one of these with you. Even better is the fact you can look for stores or restaurants in the area. How did we live without these in the past. Also, I love the voice commands that are announced as you drive. This even works great when you are walking around in a city. It is small enough to hold in your hand and store in your jacket pocket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little GPS","review":"In one sentence: I like it a lot.Pros:It's super easy to use it, 'even my mom can operate it'. The maps are very detailed. You can find almost every place, restaurant, gas station, you name it. Seriously, if all you need is a GPS for directions, then this product may even be an overkill, get the 250. It plays MP3s from an SD card, and it pauses the music to give you directions. I use it when I am riding my motorcycle too: I leave it on my pocket, connect my earbud to the 3.5 mm audio plug and ride listening to music, and never miss a turn.Cons: You can't program a ride with several stops. But I knew about the limitation, and the fact that you can save dozens of favorite locations diminishes this. On a multiple stop trip, every time you stop, just click Menu - Where To - My Locations - and chose the next stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nuvi 350","review":"I really like the Nuvi 350. It has performed extremely well the few trips we have taken with it. The maps are fairly accurate but be advised new roads are not recognized.

I have no doubt it will get me where I am going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but not great!","review":"We bought one of these at Home Depot since it looked neat. It worked fine for a year and matched a mechanical unit we have on our shed. A year later it started drifting so we changed the battery in hopes of fixing it.

We are looking for another suction cup door unit that is mechanical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good luck trying to see the numbers.","review":"This one is a waste of money. You just can't see the numbers without moving your head to find a suitable angle. They should have given the product some sort of glow effect.

Replacing the battery did not solve the problem. Last week the other one dropped off the window and the display is now distorted. Since the batteries cost about the same as the device, we will not replace the second battery, but replace the devices with tradtional thermometers. Agree that the display is difficult-to-impossible to read after dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate","review":"The readings are influenced too much by the temperature of the window and the air on the other side of the window. We have a larger thermometer on the back porch that my wife thinks is ugly, so I thought this would be the answer by pressing to the kitchen window. It has stayed up just fine, but it differs from the other thermometer by 10 degrees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little thermometer","review":"I am very pleased with this thermometer. It is everything I expected, and at a good price. No problems with it falling off the glass window. The glass should be thoroughly cleaned first.

Within three weeks, it fell off and got so wet, you couldn't read the numbers due to fog in the glass. Eventually it ended up in the garbage before it was 6 months old. In Houston Texas, we do not see hardy winters, so temperature had no negative impact, this is just junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cant live without it","review":"I bought one of these 4 years ago. The battery finally gave out. Glad I read the tip about putting paint behind it to read it at night. I live in Northern California, the weather fluctuates all year round from one neighborhood to the other. The weather report on TV does nothing for me. I like to know what it is outside before I get dressed in the morning and walk to the bus. I never really used it at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute idea - but it's just not accurate right outside the window!","review":"I was skeptical as to the accuracy of the temperature and it turns out I was right to be. This thing runs 5-10 degrees warmer than the actual temperature outside in the winter. This isn't really the product's fault, it's just common sense that the air RIGHT outside my window is going to be warmer than a few feet outdoors. But I couldn't rate it very high because I was disappointed - there should be a warning or tips about how to get the accurate temperature. It was a waste of my money, because I don't want to have to guess whether it's off by 5, 10, or some other numerical degree!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Little Window Thermometers around!!","review":"Great for window thermometer for viewing outside temps.

The premise is fascinating: the Queen of England once wrote down information in a diary that, if found by her enemies, could destroy her and bring down her reign. Many of the characters from FIREDRAKE'S EYE return in this reprise, but the plotting is more intricate, the characters even more sophisticated. And Queen Elizabeth is worth the price of the book herself. Highly recommended. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was that the same narrative style that Finney used in FIREDRAKE'S EYE (which allows characters to view the proceedings as if from heaven) is rather stilted and takes some getting used to. Other than that, it's a great historical novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elizabeth I in all her glory","review":"A vividly painted depiction of life in Queen Elizabeth's court, with a wonderful portrayal of the queen herself.

There is a little red cap insert that acts like a pretend seal, but it comes right out without any struggle, so it is not a seal. Then the bottle itself was a little greasy feeling (as if the oil had somehow leaked just a bit), and finally, when I looked at the solution, it didn't seem to be crystal clear massage oil inside (I know it's not supposed to be clear but with a yellow tint, but you get the idea).

Hope that helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Billed as \\"non-allergenic\\"? Yeah, not so much.","review":"Based on that description about the oil, I ordered a bottle. When it showed up, it proved to have an ingredient my wife is indeed allergic to (sunflower oil, as it happens), rendering the oil useless to me. A check of the listing showed that the ingredients were NOT listed on the page, making it impossible for me to ever order from this company again. They state that the ingredients might change at any time - but how would I be able to know that it would be safe to use on my wife? Only by ordering a bottle and checking the ingredients on the bottle - at which point, it's too late if it proves to have sunflower oil, wasting my time and money as happened here.If you want to call it non-allergenic, it needs to *BE* non-allergenic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Aware of the bad batch","review":"Given all the positive reviews, it must have been a bad batch what I had received. It did have a light woody scent. Not too bad, but when it touched the linens, and I put them through the washing mashine the resulting smell was quite awful. Ruined 2 sets. I had tried washing, steaming, using scented fabric softener, sanitizing in vinegar and lemon juice. Nothing helped. So it must have been one of the components that went bad. As far as massage oil goes, it was not bad - went on smooth, not greasy. But I like EO product better, particularly because it did not ruin my linens yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty simple and pretty great","review":"Great massage oil, great price for this amount and is lasting us a long time. My husband and I both suffer from very sore feet because of our jobs, and after many by-hand foot massages we decided to try an electric massager to make the job easier. We bought this along with it, and it's been great. There's no weird or girly smell, it washes off nicely, and this is a great price ($10) for this size bottle. We've had it for MONTHS and it's not even half gone, though we do daily foot and back massages. Love it and will buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent massage oil","review":"This is the best oil that I have used for massages. It is great for the skin. This oil dries very and is applied sparingly. It is also non allergenic and has no odor or perfumed smell. This oil only takes a dime size amount for each area of the body and does not leave a sticky residue after applying. The wife and I love it. She prefers this unscented oil over the scented oils. If you prefer unscented or scented, I suggest the Master Massage brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"long lasting and slippery","review":"This is probably the best oil for the money .

It has a stale smell and isn't very smooth. This made the massage less enjoyable because the oil has a weird feel to it. I enjoy giving and receiving massages but this oil makes the experience not at all enjoyable. The oil leaves the skin feeling greasy even when used sparingly. Without even mentioning how I felt this oil to be, my husband also had the same things to say about it.Beware!! It also stains fabric and furniture. I never allowed the bottle to spill or get messy and it still managed to stain my furniture leaving yucky rings. What a rip-off!I do not recommend this massage oil at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"McHale's Navy Joins the Air Force movie poster","review":"This poster features (from left to right) stars Tim Conway, Susan Silo and Joe Flynn.

It was easy to assemble, nice power, etc - but once I tried to fly it, it quickly became apparent it isn't really a beginner in terms of controls - the fantail is a little sluggish to respond, and the rotor causes a fair amount of spin that isn't easily correctable.Additionally, the wings are not very durable - since I was crashing it repeatedly, due to the above. The wings started splintering within half a dozen flights - and I wasn't slamming it into the ground on crashes, either. In short, I wouldn't recommend this unless you have an easy source for replacement wings (Megatech says they're available, but you can't order them online). Range is great, battery lasts reasonably long, and the retracting prop design is actually quite excellent. Wish I could have controlled it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my absolute favourites","review":"This book has proved invaluable me, and what impresses me most, is the passion with which the author addresses his subject.

However, the descriptions claims that the axle does NOT need to be removed. This is untrue, not only does the axle need to be removed, but the outer CV Joint also has to be removed to slip this boot on! For the price, I guess this is still a decent buy, but was not pleased to find out that this boot required removal of the axle and joint.2 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Relaxing at Work","review":"I was looking for something to relax me while at work. The 3 CDs included are Relaxation, Spirituality and Concentration. Each one starts off with relaxing music, there is a short guided meditation after the second song then more music. The music is relaxing and invigorating at the same time. This is just what I was looking for - something to relax me while working but not put me to sleep. I work during the songs and when the guided meditation comes on close my eyes and meditate."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best season so far","review":"This is definitely the best season so far (although it seems like season 5 may change that!). I am continuously amazed at how the writers keep up with the script. You really get to know the characters even more during this season, as they are 'pushed around', and you see how resilient they all are. Makes you admire them even more! The actors and actresses are at their top, especially Kim Delaney in this season. I also loved how it was still very focused on Army life, but started taking the characters to life outside of post. My army boy is deploying to Iraq in June, and this show has really helped me in myriad ways! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Army Wives season 4","review":"Absolutely love the show and have all seasons...Very disappointed in season 4 the copy I received is in poor conditionThe last disc does not play...It appears to be empty and the disc prior to that skipped and froze...Very Very disappointed.

Whether Ms. Lanier actually owns bloodhounds or just loves the breed, she shows in every word and chapter her admiration for these noble animals. Her description of the training and then the tracking with said animals is so detailed that I feel I could almost take part in the training and tracking, but in addition, the story lines are so much fun to follow. I find myself huffing, puffing and sweating right along with the handlers as they search for a lost human, or are tracking a wanted criminal. Great reads! Hope she continues to write more books every year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entertaining read","review":"I have enjoyed all Lanier's books.

BUT...","review":"Amadea's approach to teaching Jazz improv is a major breakthrough. The book that precedes this and which you should read first (HARMONIC FOUNDATIONS FOR JAZZ AND POP MUSIC) is incredible. It presupposes you know NOTHING, yet after you work through this book it'll be like finishing 4 years of college in 6 months and graduating MCL. - - The one drawback of JAZZ IMPROV is that it requires a lot of thinking... meaning it ain't no magic carpet ride... ya gotta be willing to work at it and stick with it. To put the book in a nutshell, you think of scale tones numerically. You then learn concepts of how to target the tones. His concept of improv is based on TENSION and RELEASE. - - WARNING: Don't think just because you've read the chapter and understand it, you're ready to go on with the next. You have to internalize it. A neat book I used in conjunction with this is BERT LIGON's CONNECTING CHORDS WITH LINEAR HARMONY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, we have someone who can teach and write about jazz.","review":"Jazz is recognized throughout the world as America's greatest art form and we who create this music owe a great deal to Jimmy Amadie for his ability to explain what we are doing and how it can be improved.

After recieving season 7 as a gift, I continued through. Whereas previous seasons dealt with issues taking place inside families' homes, this season seemed to show how exterior national issues impact daily living. This includes: racism, drugs, OJ Simpson trial, aging, abortion, environment, masculinity, homosexuality, television, and the list goes on. As a child of the 90s, I see that this season was also a sign of the times. This was also the season from which most probably gauge their \\"Roseanne\\" impression, fans and opponents alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"roseanne season1-6","review":"Well, This is how i feel about the seasons of roseanne.

Unfortunately the determinations in this DVD were all made long after the lies were public information.Body language is hardly a science, any more than phrenology or the reading of tea leaves by a Gypsy fortune teller. Not one item in this DVD would be admissable in court.

This isn't a port - it's a brand new story with new characters and settings, and unlike the two other games, you can reach \\"eternal\\" on almost all of the levels with just a bit of extra effort. The soundtrack is catchy and contains new songs not found on the other two titles. I haven't tried networked gaming yet, but I'm sure that's just icing on the cake. Overall, this game is a great diversion, and highly recommended for all ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Same classic fun that's slightly difficult to maneuver","review":"I have been a fan of Katamari for a long time and if I find one I love it. This was no different. The music is practically the same but this can be over looked because of the nature of this game. It is a little difficult to control the katamari at times because it relies on the D-pad and O-X-triangle-square. All in all it was still fun to play and a great way to pass the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite The Laugh","review":"With fruity characters and fun levels, Me & My Katamari has definitely been worth the price. Katamari literally means a lump or cluster... and that's what the game is about! Rolling around through various scenes, picking up items and building up mass is the name of the game. Honestly, it was quite surprising how fun it is.The drawbacks I've encountered are as follows:-Iffy controls... They take an eternity to get used to, but don't take too much out of the game.-Difficult Levels... If you're easily frustrated, you may want to look at a few gameplay videos before making the purchase.-Load Times... Just a bit boring, but, again, they don't take too much out of the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Katamari for PSP - awesome!","review":"If you're familiar with Katamari, you should know one thing: this is Katamari on PSP. The developers did a great job. All the physics going on and all the items run quite smooth for a handheld - it's hard to believe while you're playing it that it's able to run on a psp. There is a bit of pop-in, but it's not that noticeable for the most part. So while a few small corners have been cut to fit this game on the psp, in the end it's a legit Katamari experience to go.The only con I can come up with is that the levels get repetetive. You only play 4 or 5 different maps, but the items inside and their organization changes.In the end, I recommend this game to anyone interested. A great game, and the longer you wait, the harder it will be to find this gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Load up the stuff!","review":"This is tremendous fun, and especially nice now that the price has dropped to under $20!

What's really disturbing is that there are no credentials listed in this book for Mr. Lerner and then we find out he's a chiropractor and calls himself a a \\"nutritionist\\". My best friend is a licensed dietician with a local hospital. She told me that anyone can call themselves a nutritionist. They don't have to be certified or licensed and they don't have to take continuing education like dieticians do. Personally, I stay away from people who call themselves nutritionists.

You do feel better, but today's market makes it hard to live the way God wants you to. Another point well made is our need to do exercise - at least a little per day.

The gauge can be read from several feet away due to the numeral magnification.I've checked the gauges' accuracy several times by testing them against USDA Forest Service instruments, and have always found them quite accurate, with the only accuracy anomolies arising when strong winds were involved.The only reason I have ever replaced one of these gauges is due to my personal stupidity...yep, using the gauge well into freezing temps, and simply forgot to empty the gauge resulting in cracking. Hey, that's why I'm on this site right now...to buy yet another to replace yet another cracked one. I should just learn take these gauges in come late autumn, and not to be so fanatical about knowing rainfall amounts in early winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap, and Works Great","review":"It's a cheap \\"analog\\" way to see how much rain has fallen. It doesn't have any bells and whistles or an LCD readout, but it does have nice, large numbers, and easy to see tick marks at every 0.1 inch. It's kind of hard to read unless you are right up near it, but it is very clear and legible. I'm sure this thing is scientifically accurate, but I'm not sure why the top is larger than the rest of the rain catcher. If the top opening collects a certain amount, then falls down to a smaller end at the bottom, I'm not sure how that is accurate, but I'm sure there's a reason, and that the gauge is accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy-Read Magnifying Rain Gauge","review":"This rain gauge works exactly like it should.

When the Amazon sale of the BoB/The Pacific came up, I bought it on a whim. I started by watching a war movie, but finished by experiencing a deep emotional attachment to the characters. There was no glory of war or glamor of violence. This was a journey through the best and worst moments of these soldiers' lives, and we the audience got to experience these moments intimately.

You could learn just about everything covered in this book in about 1 hour talking with a mold designer and probably alot more with the mold designer. If you have been commissioned to start designing molds then you will need a hell of alot more then this book offers you. The final section of the book has work excercises designing parts. But it just tells you to design some parts on Pro E, NOT how to use Pro E to design the parts.

To call them progressive just seems cliche, since that's what everyone else is saying... all I can say is, you must buy this record. You simply will not understand what all the fuss is about until you buy it and listen to it, atleast 3 times, maybe 5 if you're the slow type.

And then I began reading those book on Napolean.

Without question, this may be his best live recording for Philips, surpassing in quality his mid 1990's recordings for his final Beethoven sonata cycle. Here we have an inspired set of performances chosen by Brendel himself, that show him at the peak of his form. All three works are splendid performances, played with much grace and refined technique. Perhaps the best is the Haydn sonata, but I also adored his playing of the Schubert and the Liszt transcription of the Wagner. This CD is certainly a definite must for those who greatly admire Brendel's thoughtful, graceful playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Story","review":"Set in Vienna during the 19th Century, this book transports the reader back to a time where psychology was just starting to emerge as a science.Very refreshing to go inside the self-discovery journeys of two great men, Josef Breuer and Friedrich Nietzsche and find out their human side, with all its flaws.This is also a great introduction to the philosophy of Nietzsche!"},{"rating":"1","title":"other's self discoveries are not for everyone","review":"This may be a nice book to read if you are interested in the characters or in the process of psychoanalysis. There is not much left, though, if you are not strongly interested in the two of them, since the main line of the book is carried through conversations between Nietszche and Breuer. The end result is a lot of dialogue and a lack of reality, in the sense that the reader only gets to know their realities through the interpretations given by the two of them through their dialogues.I also would like to disagree with some of the other reviewers that said this is a deep and challenging book. Indeed, maybe it is for some readers and not for others, but a profound and deep book for me has more to do with the relation between the book and the reader than with the relation between the main characters as described by themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great Literature","review":"We read this book for our book club. It made me appreciate the artistry that true writers infuse into their books.Yalom is a psychology professor -- not a novelist.

Nietzsche is totally rubbish. This can be considered as a good psychological book about life,weaknesses,loneliness etc..F. Nietzche was not your average human being at all so it is very unfair for Yalom to re-create another Nietzsche from his own mind.Its just a made up Nietzsche far too a weak and poor man that is irrevelant.The Nietzche in this novel is not what Nietzsche is all about so it's very very wrong to try putting him in just a fictional characters' shoes.As a matter of fact Yalom is a good psychotheraphist and he is not a bad writer.The book is allright in general if you only take the names out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"You should read this book for two reasons: To learn to ask questions to yourself and to imagince the two great personalities of 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding Obsession","review":"Irvin D. Yalom not only gives a highly entertaining account of a fictional meeting between Nietzsche and Freud's mentor, Dr. Breuer, but also highlights some of the flaws in Nietzsche's philosophy as well as psychotherapy. The novel is concerned with the erotic obsessions of the two protagonists, and explores, successfully I think, the real source of this common human affliction. While reading the novel will not magically cure anyone suffering from this problem, it might very well manage to be a turning point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"I have recommended this book to numerous people and everyone has loved it.

It was also my introduction to Irvin D. Yalom. I've been a big Yalom fan since. In all his works, Yalom is very real, very genuine. WNW is no exception. You can almost see Yalom in the characters of Dr. Josef Breuer AND Nietzsche, and, if you look closely enough, possibly also Freud. Although it is said that Breuer and Nietzsche never met, you would never know in reading it for the first time. Yalom allows the reader to imagine many things. the book is rich in detail, and is a priceless teaching tool.

Bravo, Signor Yalom."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Genius Soared","review":"This book drew me in from the start with its brilliant premise. The great philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche is in a suicidal depression, and his estranged friend Lou Salome seeks to help him out. In an insightfully imagined meeting between himself and one of the founders of modern psychology, Josef Breuer, the two engage in a series of talks that ultimately leads to the unraveling and subsequent recognition of both their problems. Only in historical fiction could you hope to get such a close and human portrait of the great thinker and his idea's. Cannot recommend it enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I was expecting much more from this book, based on the other reviews. It was very slow, both in plot and narrative technique, and didn't really entertain nor inform. I was very well acquainted both with Nietzsche and psychoanalysis prior to reading this and I honestly can say I didn't get anything out of the book. The dialogue and characterization seem overly simplistic and upon finishing, I felt like I wasted my time.

This restored edition of FANTASIA is by far and breathtakingly the best ever seen on video and probably anywhere at all since the original roadshow theatrical presentations in 1940. If you have any interest in this great classic film, grab this now.The only complaint, as others have said, is that all of the marvelous extra features from the last DVD are not included here. If you have the 2000 DVD don't give it away. The lengthy making of features and the recreations of the unfinished numbers are not on this new disc.But what the heck, what IS on the disc is FANTASIA in stunningly subtle and beautiful color and with all of the original surrounding live action footage restored. The sound is quite good considering that the sound tracks were the most damaged part of the film over the years. The Stokowski performances with the Philadelphia Orchestra are incredibly atmospheric and unreproducible today.Get this now! And have a fantastic time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another film enthusiast AGAINST censorship","review":"Every 7 years or so, Disney squirts out FANTASIA and with every re-release, the Pastoral sequence is different. Given the rise of film geeks and the interest in authentic material, its a shame that Disney feels that it cannot put out the uncensored version in a responsible manner. Disney has done so with its problematic Silly Symphonies and the troublesome racial stereotypes they exhibit... why not the crown jewel of the collection?Even more troubling to me is the digital erasure of \\"Sunflower\\"... the use of technology to whitewash history. Shameful. If you care about this sort of thing, send the Disney marketers a message and do not purchase this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"the stars are for the special features, not the movie","review":"Both disc has a documentary, but the first Fantasia's doc isn't even about the film. The doc for Fantasia 2000 is a good making of about Musicana (the first proposed Fantasia sequel in the 70s).Then both disc feature the SAME \\"feature/commercial\\" of the Zac and Cody kids talking about the benefits of Blu-Ray; nothing to do with the film, how fantastic.

The film was made in an era when black stereotypes were common in the film industry. While I do not agree with the stereotypes of the time, it is WRONG to edit the film to make it look like the content did not exist. Other reviewers are correct in the fact that Warner Brothers knows how to handle films from the 1930's and 1940's. They do NOT edit their films to make them \\"politically correct\\" for today's standards. I can clearly see that because of the action taken with Fantasia, Disney will probably NEVER release \\"Song of the South\\". It is truly a shame. These films are part of our American film heritage. Censorship is not acceptable. It only shows that Disney wants to make believe that racial stereotypes did not exist in the film industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware","review":"Some of us are getting copies that are defective.

Now, I read that they add defects in the Fantasia disksto make it less desirable to copy these disks. Of course there is copy protect defeat software out there, but, let's face it, if the original productis defective, why buy it at all?I think it's a rotten trick to make us hold our breath so that we can rush out to buy it when it is released again.Well, I'm too old to wait or permit myself to be made anxious over this stuff, so I not only avoid buying Disney media releases, I also don't bother to attend theDisney movies.I have fond memories of watching Disney and the MM Club, but over the years, Disney has turned into just another greedy corporation."},{"rating":"1","title":"More carrot-on-a-stick from the Disney vault people","review":"Caveat Emptor:--Disney's 2 dvd Fantasia / Fantasia 2000 set does not contain Destino.

Destino was originally to be a collaboration between Walt Disney and Salvador Dali, and famously one of the greatest unfinished films. Until 2003, that is. Since then the only place to see it is in large theatrical venues like NY and LA or art museums. Now it has become more than apparent it will never see a release on dvd after seven years of teasing and internet rumors. I bought this product for nothing.

I was a big Robotech fan when the show first came out in the 80's and also bought all the DVD's. Maybe it was the long wait for it to finally come out and all the hype from the website, but I was a bit disappointed with this movie. First of all, there was all this hype about Mark Hamill doing one of the voices. He has about 3 or 4 lines and is in the movie for all of one minute. Rick Hunter is barely in it as well, and Scott Bernard seems like more of an afterthought character who doesn't have much to do through most of the movie except look confused. The story was so so, and the CGI battle scenes, although nice and shinny, move stiffly and with the fluidity of a early 80's video game.

The characters are shallow, the storytelling is cookie-cutter, and the ending is well... not even an ending.Like with Robotech: The Sentinels, Harmony Gold has once again mutilated the original artwork. It doesn't look like Japanese anime; it looks more like Korean or imported anime at best. The CG is awful as well. The spaceships look like they were textured with brick textures, and the lighting and effects are very poor and amateurish.I certainly hope Harmony Gold just allows Robotech to live on in it's original form -- the form most of us in our 30's remember it as. In trying to gain new, younger fans, Harmony Gold continues to ruin a classic series."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame!","review":"This movie was so not worth the wait. So many things where changed that didn't need to be. Yea, CGI is cool, but it was way over used in this movie. Also, the look of the characters have changed so much that I didn't recognize them.

Tommy Yune doesn't anything about robotech nor do the artists from his korean buddy director and korean anime studio. I'm not collecting this, its not robotech.

With those 3D effects, the movie feels like a cheap computer game.I think 3D has no place in animation, except:-- as a hidden tool to help setup and draw the scenes,-- as an obvious tool to make a full-3D movie (as in Final Fantasy, Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, ...).In any case, 3D or CGI is not needed.Watch \\"Ninja Scrool\\", an amazing animated movie.

The only good it ever did, we hope, is to open a world of foreign anime and cinema to the western set.

This will never be part of my Robotech collection.

So all-consuming is it that you almost forget you're watching animation. Almost. The art isn't up to the quality of other more recent anime movies; the mouth movements, for example, are similar to old Saturday cartoons of yesteryear. And I didn't care for the subdued colors used throughout.I thought the storyline was compelling and kept us interested.

It's damn near impossible to encapsulate that same emotional impact that's earned over the course of eight hours and 25 episodes in a single 90 minute sitting. Why do you think a movie based on a soap opera has never been done before?[The exception to the rule being \\"Serenity\\" which worked because Joss Whedon is a frakking genius, and Summer Glau is hot.]If you're a fan of Robotech then by all means see this movie, but rent before you buy and beware of the cartoon women who can't see their shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good continuation of the Robotech Series","review":"I just saw the DVD and must admit that I enjoyed it. After 20+ years, something of significance has finally been produced and it was enjoyable to watch.I find it interesting that there were people that disliked the DVD. I think the reason why they gave such a response is because they have had 20 plus years to romanticize about the best cartoon series ever created.This DVD was a honorable accomplishment of attempting to please the dedicated fans while trying to sell itself to new fans.

The anime style feel like and american anime, not a japanese anime. If that does not bother you, you can add a star. I still succeded to enjoy the story but not enough to watch it a second time. It take me half of the anime before suceeded to begin to enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Modernized This Classic Cartoon","review":"I have to say this was definitely worth watching. I remember I use to watching Robotech when I was a kid and I even had some Robotech toys. So when I got this movie I was hoping this movie wouldn't seem too kiddy or old school. Fortunately, it was neither. It had a good story line that held my attention and made me curious about the other episodes or movies that I had missed. Then I love the fact they used computer graphics for the robotech machines, which is what really modernized this classic cartoon.So if you liked Robotech when you were a kid or is just a fan, you will enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Terrible movie. Bad animation, horrible character design, even worse story that couldn't decide if it was a teen angst comedy or military sci-fi. A real waste of a license with potential. Original mecha designs from the MOSPEADA series are good, but there is nothing worth while to see here. Robotech, despite its hacked pedigree, is ripe for some good story telling of what other people went through during the various alien invasions - but this movie is a feature length sophomoric fan fiction product. I cannot imagine ever wanting to watch it again. A shame, as being a mecha fan I would really like to see a serious effort homegrown in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome next gen graphics","review":"I absolutely loved this move. It ties everything together from the ending of the Robotech saga. The story line is continuaous. Characters and voices (many are) the same. But what really sets this one up an order of magnitude is the CG artwork and fluidity/detail of the video. It just POPS!! Super sharp. I really like the characters and it really does tidy up all those pesky questions that lingered at the end of the Robotech trilogy. I got this video new and it shipped quickly and in great shape. Outstanding purchase. I'm very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Robotech-the Shadow Chronicles is hands down one of the best anime stories around....I enjoyed every aspect of this thrilling adventure....the plot was fantastic,the character development was exceptional(among the best I've ever seen)and the movie itself was beautifully rendered....it's just an outstanding piece of work! After reading some of the negative reviews [...]I really didnt know what to expect. I went ahead and ordered The Shadow Chronicles despite the negative reviews and now all I can say is thank goodness I didnt listen to all the naysayers. I loved every bit of this movie and recommend it wholeheartedly to any Robotech fan out there and to any other person who enjoys rip-roarin sci fi adventure!

A perspective of the victim like this should be the basis for every criminal trial in America that is dealing with the loss of human life. While I read this book, I felt as close to being victimized by this tragedy, yet knowing I really wasn't. The Goldman's are incredibly strong people-they can endure anything after going through this.The account of the civil trial was awesome. Dan Petrocelli was truly amazing and was able to prove every point without a doubt. I felt like I was sitting right there in the court room. And the victim impacts statements at the end of the book were unbelievably dramatic, they should have been able to say them in open court. Everyone who wants to know the impact of domectic violence and crime in Americal should read this book. This book is truly a tribute to Ron"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not another over done book about the Simpson Trial.","review":"I found this book to be a wondeful tribute to the \\"other\\" victim in the Simpson trial. It gave Ron Goldman a face, a personality and most important a life which he no longer has. His family shared their experiences of what few of us could only imagine to be a terrible and overwhelming time. The courage they showed in going to the courtroom each day, the fact their family was able to hold together through this terrible tragedy is a real boost to the human spirit. Through their words, they made Ron Goldman a real person in our eyes. The book is written with a lot of class and heartbreak. The fact that Ron and his family are the focus of this book and everything they went through was for Ron is inspiration in itself. The Goldman's wanted to make the world aware of what kind of person Ron was like and they did a magnificent job in doing that"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Parent's Worst Nightmare!","review":"This was a wonderful book that I found hard to put down.

Photographs are included with the intention of conveying information - but the quality of the paper, or the printing process, results in almost adequate resolution. Meridth Publishing must think photographic quality isn't important for this type of book, because it isn't designed to be photography book, but with low quality images, one can't distinguish that flowers shown are orchids, let alone be able to compare the images to gain a better understanding of the types of orchids - which is exactly part of the theoretical content of this book.The person new to orchids will want to know how to pronounce the new vocabulary. Very limited information is provided in this area."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is packed with information and great photography.","review":"I really enjoyed this book and refer to it often when looking for information about a specific orchid. I'm the Orchids host at BellaOnline.com and do a lot of research on orchid plants and their culture.This book from Ortho is great for a beginning orchid lover. The photos are plentiful and of nice quality. One of the best sections for someone just starting with orchids is the area of the book that describes and pictures the many types of orchid potting mixes. I also found the tips on mounting an orchid to a cork raft very helpful.The main sections of the book cover basic growing information, propagation of orchids, orchid naming conventions, pest, diseases and an orchid gallery of the most commonly found orchids.If you are looking for a basic resource at a very reasonable price, this book should be a the top of your shopping list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful information","review":"As a beginner in the Orchid world, I found this book very helpful.

The film was shot with a 1979 old A** camcorder. The film looks like a 1978 high school class project! I am not exaggerating one bit.

You also don't want it in your backpack because it'll probably lose a button (happened to me) and I sorta bump a certain button sometimes which changes the World Time (I'd rather have to hold a set button first).

The difficulty is ridiculous, and the options are very limited. There are plenty of extras, but accessing them is tedious and VERY frustrating.

I am also a big fan of Mario Toadstool Golf for the Gamecube, so I was pretty sure of what to expect. I admit that Toadstool golf is easier, but I find this game to be very enjoyable. I play with my daughters - and Eight, Ten and 12 year old. They all seem to have no issue grasping the concept and controls. It is challenging, especially on the green, were almost every putt seems to curve unpredictably, but will time I think we will be able to compensate for this.

So to get a greater fix I purchased this game. Unfortunately this game is not nearly as fun as the Wii Sports version.Aside from the lame story (which I can forgive), the control scheme feels very much like they slapped the Wiimotes abilities on top of a \\"button masher\\". For example, in Wii Sports Golf the power of your swing is determined by the force of your swing, in SSG you sloooooowly rock your arm back and press a button to \\"set\\" the power. This takes a HUGE element of fun out of the game in my opinion. This game might be fun on a traditional console but a Wii game it is not.I plan on trading this one in, save your money for a future golf game that more closely mimics Wii Sports natural flow."},{"rating":"1","title":"clunky controls, dull gameplay","review":"I generally love golf video games. I finished both versions of Outlaw Golf on the Xbox as well as Hot Shots Golf on the PSP. But this game was tedious and annoying. First the swing control was poor and imprecise.

From the demo videos that's what Super Swing Golf appears to be, but it's not. It's a generic golf game that uses generic anime characters and a rough story line to try and bring golf to the Wii.Unless you just really love Wii Sports Golf and want something a little better, pass on this until it hits the bargain rack.

Simple golf, nice graphics, very playable. Alas, this kids game is not what I was looking for.

As the old saying goes, \\"If you've got a good thing, you might as well beat it into the ground.\\" Can we consider a critical path in a project similar to a bottleneck? Sure; now let's move on to bigger and better things.The writing is third rate and the application isn't enough of an extension of The Goal to lead the reader through the number of pages offered. Between thumbing his nose at academics, big business and anyone else he's been slighted by, Goldratt forgets that his primary mission is to let the reader in on his secrets of project management.

I think the book High-Mix Low Volume Manufactring by Mahoney does a much better, if much more boring, job of explaining the complex decision making process that is really needed. For example, it is rare that operations or logistics knows the status of jobs, or the operators, or the equipment, or the material, as well as is needed to take full advantage of any of the techniques, even in a fairly small plant. This results in information \\"noise\\". Add to this variable delay time, and the combination acts to reduce the effectiveness of any control system: this is basic feedback theory.

The only effective management tool that I find now is to stay close to the work and 'pull' the parties along.

I haven't quite figured out where the precise misses are (relative to my world), but I know there are some gaps. Guess I'll have to think some... but don't we all!Recommended reading approach: read once through and then revisit the chapters where our hero is in class and also the one where he is enjoying the TOC lecture (ie. on the second pass, ignore the fictional dialog regarding our hero's fight for tenure).

So I figured \\"What the heck, I will give it one more try, since it is a good price\\" Figured if I still could not get it right, then I would give it to my dad lol. Well I made a simple yeast bread loaf, from scratch, by hand, using the Le Saffre SAF yeast. IT TURNED OUT PERFECT!!! It rose in half the time, and it was just amazing! I am so proud of myself lol. Since the ONLY thing different in my recipe and technique was the type of yeast, I have to say this yeast made ALL the difference! I can not wait to make more!

Gary and his roommate lived down the hall from me when I lived in the dorm. Much of what I read dealing with the arrival of the freshmen to Moore-Hill and dorm l found to be pretty accurate based on my experiences there. I happened to be there because my father had been assigned to Japan, and I had to return to the States at the Air Force's choosing rather than my own. Therefore, I was on campus earlier than the rest of the student body. I remember Gary as a friendly guy. Because there were no scholarship limits at the time, I don't doubt that life was hard on players who were not counted on to ultimately play. I also believe that academics resulted in a number of players also leaving UT in their freshman and sophmore years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"Does what it says it does.

It distills the smooth, high production values of great New Wave bands and adds maturity, sophistication, and lots of sounds I've never heard out of a synthesizer before. The vocalist has a pleasing honey voice; the music is all wonderfully listenable and enjoyable without being boring. I bore easily so I listen to mostly alternative styles of music; there is nothing better than finding an artist that does new things in a truly listenable and enjoyable way. The album has quite a bit of variety, but it all comes from the melancholy, but winningly optimistic tone of your best friend.My favorite lyric is\\"oh incredulous you, with your bitter agecan you see the stars? do they fall like rain?oh innocent child, you were so long agodo you still hear God? does he call out your name?\\"PS.

I would guess that he just does not put as much concentration and effort into his writing as he odoes into his research.

(There is no debate about simple viruses or sub-species such as dog breeds.) Instead we have people like Eldredge foaming at the mouth about the irrational religious rednecks that cannot see the obvious truth of Darwin's theory. It is no wonder that the Gallup polls consistently show only 9-10% of Americans believe in this theory. (The number is slightly higher with higher income and education - but not much.) I wish a passionate evolutionist, like Eldredge, would take on the objective and nonreligious findings of intelligent design and the mathematical problems with evolution. Please, please, forget the bible as an easy target and deal with the scientific challenges. For a good read with a balanced view of the intelligent design questions I recommend \\"Darwin's Black Box.\\"..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Triumphalist ...","review":"This is just another book that attempts to enthrone Charles Darwin as the definitive prophet of science by debunking young earth creationists. The book debunks people who think the earth is 6,000 years old, and uses this as \\"proof\\" of Darwinian evolution.There is no doubt that creation scientists are wrong. But does that make Darwin right? Hardly.The chapter on the intelligent design movement is weak. The author can do little better than try to lump intelligent design theorists with young earth creationists and tries to prove Darwinism by pointing to the way automobiles have changed over the years.This book sucks. Even the Darwinist devotees give it less than five stars - which says something, since Darwinists typically give ANY anti-creationist book five stars regardless of its merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than one version of Creationism","review":"Niles Eldredge, in this book, constantly attacks the idea of creationism, though he makes NO distinction between young earth creationism and old earth creationism. I was very frustrated thoughout my reading by his constant belittling of the idea of creationism, based on the lack of scientific information to support a young earth (and overwhelming information to support an old earth), though Hugh Ross is never mentioned. Hugh Ross is an old earth creationist, an astronomer, and the developer of a creation model that can be scientifically tested. Eldredge attacks creationism as a whole, but he fails to touch the entire subject. He merely attacks the more radical viewpoint. I very much disliked this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"uh no","review":"This will be short.

What caused the 'divine spark?'","review":"There is plenty of evidence for evolution, but without conclusive proof of the 'divine spark' that seperates living cells from the rest of nature, creationism is a better theory than evolution when detailing the beginnings of life on EarthI was disappointed that Eldredge was writing a political book rather than a purely scientific discussion. Certainly, creationism has been used by various religious and political forces for their own means. But I am looking to read something that conclusively proves one theory or the other, without regards to the politics. The holy grail of evolution studies will be an experiment that replicates the process by which life pulled itself out of the mud. So far, nothing has come close. Until someone is able to honestly replicate this process, the creation theory is just as valid as the evolutionary theory.-- JJ Timmins"},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't articulate the arguments","review":"I was dissapointed with this book. I was looking for a good book that could really make the case for evolution over creationism. (I am a firm believer in evolution but wanted the book for a creationist friend.)

Dont let the idea of \\"childhood abuse\\" throw you off if you think it didnt happen that way for you, this book talks to ALL of us! I found myself in here more often,and better said than I could do myself! It was amazing to me that I could find my truths in black and white. And, since I did, her methods of growing beyond are most helpful to me daily. Please read this book- it is extremely well worth it, in my opinion. If you are ready for your truth, you will find it here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but be careful","review":"Jenson's book is excellent in helping you define past abuse and stop minimizing, denying, etc. Her tone is helpful and she shares that she, too, needed healing from childhood neglect. That said, regression therapy can be very dangerous to do alone. Get a sympathetic therapist, one familiar not only with childhood abuse and neglect but Jensen's work, too. I wouldn't recommend doing it all on your own or with non-professionals--the deeper the trauma, the more abuse there was, the more serious the abuse, the more likely you will tap into very strong and deeply buried feelings that can wreck your day, week or month until you work through them. I used the book on my own and had to find a therapist to help me sort through everything.I stiill refer back to her book, esp. identifying \\"old\\" feelings v. the present situation. Be careful, though and have plenty of professional and family/friend support, esp. if the abuse you suffered left any signs of PTSD or anything like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good person with a bad past!!","review":"Kennedy Assassinated was an awesome book. I think that this book is very incredible in detail because it gives you all details about how Kennedy survived his life and how he got through it all. I think that this book is awesome for anybody that can read. If you are interested in history then this is your kind of book. Please take this and remember that he was a good person but he lived a bad past. The best story element for this book would also be suspense. It tells you of what happens and how it all happens. Thank you for listening and I hope that it helped you."},{"rating":"2","title":"...talent abound for this Norwegian sensation","review":"I can't say enough about Annbjord's musical abilities in playing the Hardanger fiddle. After being with Bukkene Bruse and several recordings of her own, Baba Yaga would be her breakthrough. It was Norwegian traditional folk, celtic, jazz, electronic and avant garde all thrown into one big bowl with interesting results. A Mussorgsky concept based off of \\"Pictures At An Exhibition\\" movement, Baba Yaga a Russian witch taking on a Emerson, Lake and Palmer approach...tradition versus modern. If your dead set in something sounding as close to Annbjorg's previous works, you may be disappointed with Baba Yaga...I on the other hand was quite fascinated by it, Lien is opening herself up to new worlds. Listening to Aja for me was like listening to a Norwegian hoedown, throwing in a little chanting at the end for good measure...thats one song that you can literally feel her Hardanger fiddle, I'm in awe of her and her c.d."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emerson, Lien & Palmer?","review":"Not so much New Age as Progressive Rock. This album reminded me of ELP, Yes, Gentle Giant and the like without really sounding like any of them (Well maybe a little like ELP on 'Wackidoo'). Ms. Lien blends traditional and modern extrordinarily well. The Sami yoik in the latter half of 'Ája' took a couple of listenings to fully appreciate (my wife still says 'What the hell IS that?' 'Kauto From Kautokeino,' I answer.) but I think it really works well, blending the Norwegian & Sami musical roots. I anxiously await Ms. Lien's next release - if it's half as good as 'Baba Yaga', it's a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"Fantastic, only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is that their albums with more extended versions of the music are even better.

While not as diverse and upbeat as my favorite \\"Hed Phone Sex\\", it is nice, relaxed, and diverse - with a good mixture of shorter and longer tracks. While the tracks are relaxing, the album certainly won't make you fall asleep - but it is certainly is good music to read by.The DVD that comes with this album features about half the tracks and comes with visuals that are at times stunning, at times funny, and overall make it a long trippy experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst","review":"I think I have read almost every book about football written, and I was excited to find a read about my favourite conference. Before I reached the third chapter, I knew I would be dissapointed..... I have never seen someone butcher a topic of such interest to me.

Calling Kevin Faulk \\"Marshall\\" Faulk twice and Nick Saban \\"Lou\\" is unforgivable and that is why he gets a big NEGATIVE from me. I am a big Bama supporter as well and I found his commentary regarding the Capstone to be orange-biased.Maybe Mr. Ernsberger should be wearing convict orange on the cover? Don't bother folks. Save the $ for tickets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bragging Rights disappoints","review":"As an objective observor with no strong ties to any particular SEC school, I found this book very poorly written. He tries to write a Feinsteinesque account of a season in the SEC, but fails miserably. For one, he feels the need to constantly write about his own feelings about people- these are irrelevant in any well written book. Also, he makes Vandy coach Woody Widenhofer out to be the best coach in the SEC, a rather interesting thing to do considering the Commodores never had a winning season before he was fired this fall. But Ernsberger does this kind of thing a number of times- including a chapter where he ranks the abilities of the SEC coaches- begging one to wonder: what makes him qualified to do this. But the book's main problem is that it is boring- the chapters aren't connected to each other, and it keeps the book from flowing in any logical fashion. It was a good topic, but it was not a good job."},{"rating":"1","title":"A biased account with at least a few errors","review":"I found some of the book merited reading, but it is obvious who the author's favorites are--especially his alma mater, UT. It looks more like a disgruntled fan's attempt to slap down the almighty Tide. I was surprised that an author with a master's degree from Columbia would make spelling errors in his book, as well as factual errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author can\`t BRAG about his SEC or geographic knowledge","review":"I cannot believe the typos and errors in this waste of time book. The writer apparently can\`t distinguish Ole Miss from Mississippi State and I still wonder how he flew in and out of \\"Hartsville Airport\\". Hartsville, SC is a rather small town in Eastern SC and during my last trip through I failed to notice an International Airport.I have been attending SEC football games since the 50\`s and find the lack of research that went into this nonwork very offensive.

As a Boone descendant and historian, it was a disappointing read. The author appears to have written many things based solely on rumor without even doing any verifiable research. Otherwise he would not have written a lot of the stuff he wrote - good example; \\"D. Boone Kilt Bar on This Tree, 1760.\\" Things he says about Boone and his faithful wife in that \\"poem\\" are untruths and writings such as this only perpetuate false rumors. I would love a book of poetry about Boone - this is not one. It is a book about some fictional character that bears very little if any resemblance to Daniel Boone the real person.

Everything is in the soup. Jazz guitarist Eddie Fisher defies description. On the first track Jeremiah Pucket Fisher gives you what can only be described as jazz with a little acid and alot of funk. This should be all over the airwaves. Its too damn good. Land Of Our Father is more jazzy with some spicy guitar licks and some smooth hammond organ. But what makes this CD really hot is Beautiful Things. A 12 minute smoker that incorporates jazz with classical violin and wah wah guitar licks.

There are many topics this book covers, which you can see in the table of contents on this page.This book will also help humanity collectively, as it brings solutions that are both ahead of their time, as well as practical, and needed.I highly recommend this book if you are really looking for answers in every area of your life.

This, she refers to as \\"the rippling effect.\\"Her originality is in how eloquently she shares her own personal tragedies, and how she overcame them. As I read this book, I just wanted to give her a hug, be her friend, and go forward to set my own example that others can follow \\"not by doing more, but by BEING more.\\" This book certainly helped me claim my own authentic power, and in so doing, Barbara Rose has made a remarkable contribution.

This match kicked off the show and it was slow and not really any high spots. The matches that fallow are of varing quality, but most of the matches are slow-paced and not very exciting. The best matches were the two main events, I thought. Savage vs. Ric Flair was fun and even Hogan vs. Vader was ok, but not great.

Even if you know nothing about horses, you will find this to be a great story. The day to day trials of the author are applicable to any lifestyle. I especially like that she gives God the glory for everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heart wrenching book full of Love for others","review":"Originally purchased for a special 10 year old girl who loves horses, I decided to read first. I could only get thru one chapter a night as each one was so emotionally charged and so wonderfully written I wanted to savor each one. Altho, I ultimatly decided this book was too advanced emotionally for my 10 year old I will pass it on to other friends who love horses and will probably give it to the girl at a later date. Kim Meeder is an excellent writer and draws you into the story with such compassion and Love for her calling it is dificult to put the book down. I was never a horse person before, however, I learned so much thru the stories that when I pass a pasture now I look at the horses in a different light. Thank you Kim for a glorious gift you are giving the children and the horses. God Bless you and your endeavors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope Rising is truly that!! I Love both her books.","review":"This book is such a blessing! The work they do at the Crystal Peaks Youth Ranch is so wonderful and Kim Meeder is such a gifted writer! Sad at times, she relates how abused and abandened horses and children work together to give hope to one another!I buy extra copies of her books to share with others and I also support the ranch! In fact, when my daughter recently died, we asked in leiu of flowers, people send donations to the ranch! Sue"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't See the Forest for the Trees","review":"In this fourth work in a series involving Grant vs. Lee, the author continues to lose the reader in the details. I am appreciative of the author's indepth research, but his insistence on including every letter and diary that he can find does not make his book better. The first two books by this author were both highly readible and insightful. In this volume he has completely bought into the revisionist viewpoint of Grant and Lee, i.e. that Grant has not received nearly the credit that he deserves and that Lee is vastly overrated. In the context of the Civil War period covered in this book, there is some truth to that. Though this book makes some valuable contributions overall I did not find it up to the standard set by Rhea's Wilderness and Spotsylvania books."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of resource book than a feelings book","review":"This handbook, written by Doug Manning, is meant to give you an overview of what happens when someone dies, and the choices that need to be made. It is a very easy read that is meant to help you prepare for the funeral and deal with people who do not understand your loss.I especially love his story on how the book was named and how he developed a new compassion for those that grieve.A young mother said, 'Don't take my grief from me. I deserve it. I am going to have it.' Though he did not hear the words spoken from her mouth, those words haunted him enough to change the concept he had towards those that greived and the recovery that would follow. He began to understand that though we need to recover and move on, we also need to experience the loss and move in our own time, not someone else's.Alyicehttp://goodmourninglord.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Take my Grief Away","review":"This is the absolute BEST book to help anyone understand grief. Either theirs or someone else's. My girlfriend got the tapes and encouraged my husband & I to listen to them so that we would be better able to help share/understand her pain of losing her husband and our best friend. So I have bought this and given it to others that find themselves in the same circumstances. Doug Manning truly has a way to help you understand how personal and different grief is to each one of us. Just as we all have different fingerprints, we all each have a different way of grieving. There is no right or wrong way to grieve.If you know someone who has lost someone or if you have lost someone I encourage you to get this book and the tapes if you can get them to help in this situtation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title has promise, but doesn't deliver","review":"A friend gave me this book when my daughter died. The title was so perfect that I expected great things from the book. I was sorely disappointed. Even though it has been years since I read it, one passage still rings in my ears. He says that, even if a grieving person requests no flowers, one ought to send them. I was outraged that anyone would reject the wishes of someone who is newly bereaved so casually."},{"rating":"2","title":"French Poetry by a German Poet","review":"This book contains very different work from Rilke's German poetry, decidedly French in nature, with ephemeral images and nuanced depictions of the poetic scenes of life. Many of the poems also are constructed with an amazing sense of the meter and scan of the French language and with an extremely precise rhyme of French vowels. The reader of this edition will see an entirely different side to Rilke."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Short, But Feels Long","review":"Although I enjoyed some of Spawn, I'm not a Tod Mc fan, but this book still sounded intriguing so I decided to check it out.After reading through it, I realized that it had nothing worth remembering. There are a a few VERY cool panels, but they don't really even involve Creech. There are a few neat story elements, but it's all very trite. This is the first time I've ever said this, but there is TOO MUCH character development, or it just wasn't done in a way that was palatable.I would suggest putting the $10 this book costs towards Haunt and it's ongoing story; as I see it as the better big brother of The Creech."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creech-tastic!","review":"Greg Capullo pulls it off yet again with another great comic!

They are made of this weird plastic that doesn't move well, and is super crinkly and squeaky when you twist the bag at the end. Not sure how else to describe it.

I ordered 2 of these packs and quit them after the third filter. Why? They made me sick to my stomach for two days, so the rest went in the trash. I don't know if it were the plastic filters, which were very \\"slippery\\" when put into the ashtray and felt strange when puffed on. They practically killed the taste of a good smoke. I enjoy smoking and did not buy them for the purpose of quitting, just to reduce some nicotine. Sadly, it did not work, just as with many other products that make the same promise. I guess the only way to eliminate tar and nicotine is to stop smoking all together, which can only be achieved with willpower and the true desire to give up cigarettes, be it for the cost or health reasons. \\"Helpers\\" like these just don't work. Consider it a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nic-Out filters","review":"It has been about four months since I started using the Nic-Out filters and I don't think I will ever smoke another cigarette without using them. When I first heard of the filter I thought it would be like smoking air, but I tried them and seen that this was not at all the case. I could sense no change, except now if I forget to put on a filter and take a hit it's a gross taste to me. I see all the tar build up in the filter and can't believe that was all going into my lungs before I used Nic-Out. I have managed to start smoking extremely low tar and nicotine cigarettes called Quest, which I don't think would have been possible if I had not starting using the filters. I am 29 years old and I have 5 young kids, last year I had two pneumonias which I think was contributed to smoking, but now since using the filters I haven't coughed in months."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would never Purchase This Product Again","review":"Nic-Out Filters For Cigarette SmokersI couldn't find Tar Block Filters so I bought Nic-Out.That was a BIG mistake.

The heroine is admirably self-reliant without being obnoxiously independent, and the hero is generous without being condescending. Both are portrayed in a completely believable manner, with an endearing awareness of their own flaws. The supporting characters are portrayed so humanly that I cannot even hate the villian!

The 'bad character who later seems to become good is just not credible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect read","review":"This traditional Regency has everything I look for: \\"older\\" woman (I search for spinster or widow), romance based on character and life experience instead of physical attraction-although that is there too, characters who grow during the course of the story, and real-to-life obstacle(s) for the couple to overcome. The romance is strong and real but the sex is off-stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing happens...","review":"Gosh, but this was a boring story. It started off well enough, with Mrs. Drew's brother-in-law making an ungentlemanly offer when his brother, the vicar, dies. Lord Winn, divorced and persona-non-grata with the Ton and the owner of the property she finds to rent, is immediately and utterly charmed by her and her daughters. Nothing happens in this story, other than a lot of walking from here to there with Lord Winn coming to the rescue for every little thing. Mrs. Drew even tosses up her cookies at the mere \\"misunderstanding\\" that Lord Winn is talking about not allowing her to stay on as a renter. The conflict dies after the first chapter and all we have left is these folks doing and saying nothing of substance. There is no building up to anything. They just seem to immediately love each other.This was the second story I've read by Carla Kelly and was equally disppointed. With so many high marks I was hoping for a page turner.

Instead, it is an insipid,uninspired waste of time and an insult to the intelligence and taste of viewers, whether they be kids or their parents. Hanna-Barbera cartoons were never on the intelligence level of others such as Warner Brothers (Bugs, Daffy,et al), but at least in their heyday they had SOME entertainment value. This later effort by the studio is truly lame. The voice 'talent' sounds more annoying than even when the actors were in their prime, and the script is beyond ludicrous. Unless you are a desperate collector of cartoons featuring Yogi and his unfunny pals, or are a devoted collector of any films that feature historic aircraft, you will probably be better off spending your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"Step into the shoes of the over-worked, under-appreciated Audrey and feel what it's like to wade through the turmoil to find her true self. \\"Her Backyard\\" keeps the pages turning to the very end.
