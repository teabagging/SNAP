I teach Office 2003 and previous in adult ed., and I know my students will find this new version quite perplexing. Beyond the differences, it also does not work well with Windows XP. There are printer conflicts and it saves as a .docx, not .doc, so for other versions to read the document, it has to be saved as 93-2003 compatibility mode.

In practice, an experienced user of the older version can spend 15 minutes finding a way to, for example, remove the underlining from text.

I find that it is pretty intuitive and I can generally find the factions I am looking for easily. The interface gives Office a new feel, which had to happen at some point.The big advantage to this Office Home and Student 2007 is that it gives you a license for 3 PCs. This is great! I can use it on my PC, my wife's laptop, and later on my kids PC if we decide to get them one. This version includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote.

If you are a veteran user of these programs, you will find that many keyboard shortcuts are no longer functional. Colors and effects you are used to in Excel graphs are no longer possible to replicate. Menus are extinct in these programs and have been replaced with a horribly gaudy ribbon that must have been designed for and by complete idiots. The reasoning for such a comprehensive overhaul of two previously very functional programs escapes me.

The Proofing Tools of the new Office are not compatible with the older OE.)To prevent this problem, do not remove older versions of Office from your hard drive.If you already have, here is how to fix the problem:Use the CD to reinstall, selecting the Custom option. Uncheck all options Except the \\"Shared Features.\\" Expand the branch and select \\"Proofing Tools.\\" Select \\"English\\" and then \\"Run From My computer.\\" Finish the installation. Reopen OE and the English spell check should be selected.Of note: If you no longer have a CD of the older version of Word, you can also use Front Page, Publisher, Word, Excel or Outlook.

Further, the monkey in the movie is not even the same species of monkey shown on the cover. A large picture of an actress also dominates the package. This woman does a fine job but has barely a minute of screen time in the whole movie!

The author writes only one paragraph over the deaths of the five missionary men on \\"Palm Beach,\\" remaining focused around the above mentioned. This is not a feel-good book.

The management has to identify who the good people are and how to retain them.What the book does not tell you: how to handle the head count issue in an otherwise normal company.

The material presented was based upon gross motor skills rather than fine motor skills which degrade in adrenalized situations. I do think that the techniques presented could be executed by most people with practice. The Lt. makes the maneuvers look so fluid and easy.

The ride is \\"stiffer\\" and the spring coil is wound tighter at one end, whereas the original springs had equidistant spaces between the winds of coils, (if that makes any sense). Again, though, the ride is better and could take more of a load. Anyway, to buy all the seperate parts, you would end up spending more money!

I'm 31 now, and before I was even born, my parents were throwing groovy '60s cocktail parties, complete with the cocktail hour music, martinis and fondu. The cornerstone to this era, and years thereafter, was the music of Herb Alpert and Boots Randolph. An essential nostalgic listen for anyone whose parents had (or still have) this music in their collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"One concern","review":"I agree that this is a great classic. This was the first LP I ever purchased, and I attribute much of the reason I became a trumpet player to Herb and this album. Many of these tunes are on a tape that I keep permanentaly in my car, and listen to regularly. Even when I practice I often go back to TJB songbooks and try to mimic the Alpert sound. The only problem I have with the CD, is that I was really hoping they would have corrected the distortion on 'Lollipops & Roses'. The LP has that track so close to the epicenter that tracking becomes a problem and I could never get a clean copy. When making the CD A&M must have used a master recording from an LP. Strange."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Have Heard This Music Before","review":"You might not know it, but you have heard this music before; maybe on a tv game show, maybe in an elevator, or maybe a chewing gum commercial. It is fun, it is infectious, and it sold tons of records in the early 1960s. High art it ain't, but everybody needs a little fun. The cover art is especially fun. An old copy of this album on vinyl will probably cost less than a dollar. So, even if you do not own a record player, you might want to buy it and frame the cover. Kind of silly cheesecake, but fun. If it were less fun, I would never have given it 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic Herb Alpert tunes :-) poor sound quality :-(","review":"Herb Alpert's \\"food\\" CD is a timeless classic. This is one of the best loved instrumental albums of the 60's. If you decide to add Herb Alpert to your collection, this, and 'South Of The Border', would be excellent choices.However, as in many [most?] CDs, this release suffers from major bass-shyness. OK, that's probably being too kind. There really isn't anything here below about 200 hertz! I know from the original releases of this recording, that the bottom end was excellent.

John's a wonderful writer with so much experience in Colorado over many years.

Instead, I went straight back to the office to order this book. It is everything I expected and more.

The chapters are short creating a tempo where the plot thickens and the tension builds.

There are moments when it literally took my breath away. Some may say this movie isn't for the weak and sensitive. I say this film is for everybody with a soul and a conscious. It's for everyone who believes wrongly that goodness lies in the hearts of all men.

The musical fabric is so luxurious and fulfilling as they weave traditional and modern threads together into a seamless tapestry of sound.

At least design a case that will contain the noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHEN \\"CRINKLES\\" ARE WRINKLES","review":"My dermatologist calls them \\"derma-creases.\\" Meg Ryan once referred to them as \\"crinkles.\\" Around my eyes they are just plain wrinkles - Webster puts it succinctly, \\"a slight line or fold in the skin of the face.\\" Somewhere it's said that there are 22 muscles around the eye area. In all probability years of winks, smiles, and sun squints are going to keep those muscles busily producing lines. And me busy combating them.Therefore, it's good to find an ally in Lancome's Resolution Eye D-Contraxol Cream. This is a lightweight, fragrance free cream that's patted gently around the eye area both morning and before bedtime. The \\"D-Contraxol\\" (Lancome's dermo-smoothing complex) tends to relax skin while smoothing.The cream also contains \\"SkinFibre Technology\\" which provides long-lasting hydration and acts as a wrinkle filler.The 0.5 oz. jar lasts a number of months, and the results are significant."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointed","review":"I was hoping to have this book work in humor and advise and it fell flat on both. The author sounds like they are filled with regret and the book came across as passive aggressive. Save the money and pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book. Don't buy at any cost!","review":"Hands down this is the worst book for guys that I have read. The entire thing is one big joke, and not even a funny one at that. I read about 1/4 of it and had to stop because I wasn't learning anything and couldn't read it without wanting to strangle the author. He tries to make everything funny, but it comes off as insincere and like the reader is being talked down to. Crap book, headed for the recycling bin, so maybe it can be of use to this world in a new form...."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"I was so excited when I got my husband to read this book. but all it was was joking about pregnancy when the baby comes and worthless information. to top it off my husband didn't even find it funny"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful","review":"This book is great for poking fun at pregnancy- not for providing any useful information. I was looking for a book for my husband that would have more of a balance of information. Something that wouldn't be too serious and medical but would also give some basic information about pregnancy. My husband didnt' belive that being flat out tired was a normal part of the first trimester- a book that gave some basics would have been helpful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"Informative and FUNNY! My husband loved it! The pregnancy is done and our daughter is 2 months old but he doesn't want to sell it because he liked it so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"This book is not meant to be taken literally or to provide useful information. This book is meant to be funny and it is. My hubby bought the book shortly after discovering I was pregnant and loved it. He buys if for all his friends when we find out they are expecting and still to this day can tell you the exercises that should be done in order to safely navigate your 9 month pregnant wife through a crowded resteraunt. I read it and found it to a great distraction from the gloom and doom of the more serious books. If you like to laugh and your wife is pregnat this is a good book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This Book","review":"This book really pissed me off. The snide remarks and generally condescending attitude towards pregnant women in the book implies that the author thinks that pregnant women are a joke and an oddity. I guess Tom and Pat think that the only way to give a man (who's wife is pregnant) support is to insult women, nature and motherhood because they're feeling inadequate and side-lined. It contained very little actual information and really soured my husband and myself on the whole series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wast of Money and Time","review":"If you are actually excited about your wife bringing you a little bundle joy, don't buy this book. Providing excuses to get out of appointments with your wife, excessive beer drinking to help you cope is not what I was hoping for.

Not the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"What to Expect when your wife is expanding","review":"My husband hated this book. He said the author made it sound like everything was a big joke.

I don't think he actually got to read this book because I was always stealing it! It is hilarious there is no other way to describe it. There are cartoon pictures of what you can \\"expect\\" your wife to look like and there is a guide of what you need to buy each month.It puts a lighthearted spin on pregnancy that at times can be much needed. There does seem to be some filler hence the 4 stars. But if you are looking for a funny book this is the one. I can't say enough good things about this book, it's the perfect pregnancy companion. Also at times the woman in the book seems to have it harder than the avg. pregnant woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE,sexist and awful","review":"I got this as a present for my fiance,thinking it would be a cute funny gift during our pregnancy.However,it got here and neither of us were amused.It's a HORRIBLE book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book for a Man with a Pregnant Wife Who Wants a Divorce","review":"If your wife is expecting and you are a chauvanist pig, you might really enjoy this book. Especially if you have no respect for your wife and are looking for a rocky marriage. I was fooled into buying this book and seriously regret it. Save your money! It's full of negative remarks about women in general and assumes that a man and a wife cannot be friends. It is suppposed to be a parody yet is not funny in the smallest way.

Highly recommended, such a fun read (and good luck waiting for each month to read the next chapter....)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Not Funny","review":"This book was purchased for me as a gift from my wife. I did not find this book to be even slightly amusing. The subjects that are covered in this book that are supposed to be humorous were in fact insulting to my intelligence. I believe that it is a serious problem if males make fun of their wives/girlfriends when pregnant.Instead of using real humor this book uses stereotypes and the notion that all males hate their significant others. This book relies on the typical misogyny that males in our society find amusing. We should be encouraging and supporting our significant others rather than mocking them. From a medical prospective I do not think males should mock or discourage healthy weight gain in pregnant females. Also, I no not agree with mocking, making fun of, or parodying other healthy symptoms of pregantcy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal","review":"I gave this book a low rating, not because it's \\"offensive,\\" but because it's blah humor.I am a huge fan of offensive parodies (ex - South Park and Family Guy), but I found this book disappointingly boring. The jokes might be funny to the type of person who laughs at things like outdated Pollock jokes, but most folks would find it to be a major yawn-fest...or just annoying. If I get a funny book, I want to laugh through most of it--not just a random sentence or two on every 50 pages (too much work).Anyhue, if you want to laugh at pregnancy, better books are \\"Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads,\\" \\"My Boys Can Swim\\" (for the gents) and \\"Pregnancy Sucks\\" (for the ladies). They are waaaay more funny AND somewhat educational too (whoa! what a concept)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"all men are idiots\\" guide to pregnancy.","review":"If you think that \\"typical male\\" is a cute compliment, you might like this book. It assumes a father is basically a complete moron perfectly happy to allow the mother of his child to do it all, while he kicks back with a beer. (in fact, I believe it recommends this practice) If that sounds like you, buy this book. Otherwise, stay away, STAY AWAY!! It's trite, idiotic, and insultingly chauvinistic. Perhaps a good book for football buddies to buy for each other as a joke. You know, with the big bottle of aspirin and the six pack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what a serious father-to-be is looking for","review":"I bought this book to better prepare myself for fatherhood. Basically, it is a joke book that tells you to drink beer and ignore your wife. It doesn't educate you on any of the issues, medical or otherwise, that you and your wife will be going through. So, save yourself the money and go with some other book."},{"rating":"1","title":"what to expect when your wife is Expanding","review":"I had High expectations for this book. However, it's content was un useful. I wanted a book that will have all the information my husband may need for my pregnancy and when the baby was born.

Uses (and re-uses) every tired sexist joke...","review":"My husband and I found this book to be offensive. Maybe some people's marriages really are this sad, with this lack of appreciation for one another. The book is right up there with the regular e-mails we get at work that just re-hash old stereotypes about the differences between the sexes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Evidently the author of this book believes expectant fathers are actually not interested in learing about what their wife is experiencing and how their child is developing. Instead, he seems to think expectant fathers need to be distracted. While there were many humorous parts in the book, there was little information. Overall, I found the book disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.","review":"I thought this book might be helpful to my husband. We are expecting our first child. This book was insulting. Get \\"What to expect when you are expecting\\" and tell your husband he can borrow it if he has any questions or concerns during the course of your pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Parody, What to expect when your wife is expanding","review":"I guess the most important thing to observe before buying this book is that it's a parody. I hadn't noticed the parody label on the top right hand corner of the book. Therefore I was dissapointed when I found that I had ordered my husband a parody on pregnancy.If that is what you are looking for, I would suggest buying the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Husband didnt read","review":"My husband didnt read this book because he thought it was silly.

Yeah, pregnancy can be tough for the momma. Ever think of what it's like for the daddy? I especially loved the cartoons of the mommy each month. Not to be taken to heart, but if you've got a sense of humor this will make you laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this unless you enjoy sarcasm...","review":"I bought this book thinking it would make a nice gift for my husband. I thought it might teach him a bit about what was going on with me while I was pregnant. I read it first, and found it to be sarcastic and stupid. Its not \\"educational\\" at all. I never gave it to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG BAD JOKE","review":"This is NOT the kind of book a responsible father would read. This book expose the bad things of pregnancy and fatherhood. I don't recommend this book at all. Please look somewhere else if you are really interested in how you can help your wife during this important phase."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless","review":"While it was funny as promised, the book is totally useless. There is little to no helpful or specific information about pregnancy. If you are looking for something to help your significant other learn about pregnancy, keep looking. Funny as it may be, for someone who knows nothing about pregnancy, some of the information that is a joke might actually be believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Dads look stupid","review":"I was looking to get something for my Husband to have him stay informed about what was going on with our little one. This book mostly made fun of the whole situation. The Dad is portrayed as a dumb cave man whose only desire in life is if he can have sex with his wife. The Mom is portrayed as a whining and complaining you know what who will apparently makes her husbands life living hell. This is so not true and frankly offensive. I am 30 weeks into my pregnancy and both me and my husband have truly enjoyed learning about our growing girl from other resources such as What to Expect when your Expecting, The Happiest Baby on the Block, and our midwife."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book scared my husband","review":"If your husband is even the slightest bit jumpy, and worries about all of the bad things related to pregnancy (money, etc.), then by all means, keep this book away from him. After reading the first two or three pages, I noticed my husband become paler and paler. I thought the book was perfectly fine, and kinda funny, but I guess this is proof that this is not the book for every husband."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehash of old book still isn't funny, and still needs a lot of work","review":"They must've taken Bob Saget's jokes and put them in this farce. The only thing helpful was the expected costs for 'stuff' as the pregnancy goes along. The jokes all fall flat, the sarcasm is dry and withers horribly as time goes on.I actually stopped reading this book after I forced myself to read the boring common sensical ideas. Unless you're a guy who has no clue about kids/babies, never had friends who've told you what to expect, or cannot look online and read far better websites with better and more poignant information, this book shouldn't be published to waste the paper it was printed on.I heartily pass on this book, and we have a LOT of books with our first kid. This is by far the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Your Time","review":"For any serious father-to-be this not the book for you. I didn't even finish it.

There are other pregnancy books out there that manage to be funny while at the same time actually being enlightening and providing helpful information - unlike this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative experience","review":"Having only been through one pregnancy with one woman I can only say that this book doesn't reflect every man's experience. It does tend to have an overall theme of your wife will be most annoyed with you and that she is pretty much a great big snow ball of emotions that could start with you breathing to loud. But, for the laugh value it's pretty funny to hear how this guy impregnated a spiteful woman. I laughed at it, showed my wife a few things because pregnancy is an adjustment for a woman and isn't an everyday in everyway a bed of roses. Basically it made me feel like I have it perfect and this couple needs to implement birth control."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but Repetitive","review":"This book does provide some relevant info, but overall is OVERLY humourous and gives repetetive info. on what to expect month-by-month.

Many of us have used Penelope Leach or Dr. Spock or others. Their advice is supplemented by the Oppenheim's very easy-to-follow approach to playtime with books.The book develops suggestions for a basic library of laptime reading fun - and each entry is followed up with games and songs to play with your child.I also recommend it as a gift for grandparents and non-parents (like friends who may not yet have kids) who may be looking for ways to interact with your new child, because the advice here is very practical, taking a common-sense approach. The book list also forms the basis of a great gift guide for infants and toddlers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This book was not what I expected. I was really excited to read and maybe get some fresh ideas to spice up reading time but this wasn't it.

But I remember it is a classic British WWII movie in the very low key \\"just chaps doing their part\\" kind of way. What makes this movie unique is that it is about the very brave souls of the RAF who manned high speed boats designed to go out to sea and pick up aircrew that had crashed. Such was the need for trained pilots and other aircrew in WWII that the British expended every effort to go and recover the crews of ditched aircraft. This is probably the only movie made about these very brave boat crews and if you are in any way interested in the heroism of the average Brit in WWII you owe it to your self to see this wonderful movie.I will update this review when I have had a chance to see this movie again in the next few weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul","review":"This collection contains Ray Charles' greatest hits. Among the favorites are 'What'd I Say' , 'Georgia on my mind' 'Ruby' 'Hallelujah I just love her so'.

In fact even with the best people, like Ray Charles it is only a small portion of the total work which plays again and again in the mind.Ray Charles had incredible soul and feeling. And it is that feeling which makes his music so moving and enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Great artist, superb collection, good liner notes....need to say more?

Each personal vignette carries a similar theme - why were we there, how did the atrocities of the war effect me, where am I today? Sadly, there are more tragedies than triumphs, as with all wars, but so poignantly true in this one. Yet, you must go back with these people, imagine what it was like for them, remember how you experienced those times, and hopefully emerge with a compassionate understanding of what it all meant.There are other books out there titled Voices from Vietnam, but Ms. Edwards has listened to these particular voices and played them back as a ringing chorus that will move you to forgive but never forget the victims on both sides of this war."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling photographic odyssey","review":"Written and photographed by Charlene Edwards, Voices From Vietnam is an informative history, a compelling photographic odyssey, and an emotionally moving testimonial to the tragedies and triumphs of Americans and Vietnamese tangled together in a bitter and lethal civil war.

Loser Ira Glass delights in foisting loser after loser story on listeners.

It has two panels top and bottom by four panels left to right, and the panels themselves are smaller than a standard road map. The state-side of the map is too short to include the panhandle area, which is inserted into a box to one side, making it difficult to maintain continuity if you're traveling into or out of the panhandle area. And it is far too small overall to offer anything but major details and towns, so most of the area is just a featureless green. The flip side, which is printed upside down for some bizarre reason, presents \\"blow-ups\\" of numerous cities, but they are too small to provide anything but major roads.

Further advice covers how to use metaphors to sell, whether advertising a product or ingratiating oneself or driving a point home.

Therein lies the irony. The sophistication level of the movie is pretty low, stuff kids would believe in. Yet some of the scenes are violent and a bit too gruesome for children to watch. That doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy some aspects of this movie. The scene where our hero practices katas with his martial arts master in the dojo are moments of poetry in motion. And the opening scenes of our hero with his wife and son are nicely portrayed. But with such mixed temperaments this movie is left wanting for a real audience. As one other reviewer stated, Prey Of The Jaguar begs for a remake.I purchased this movie because it is directed by David DeCoteau, who is mostly known for his \\"C\\" grade horror movies.

The writer has a lot of good ideas to convince the reader of the enormous consequences of bullying. However, the two main characters are too extreme and only stereotypes. They are psychologically unrealistic, especially Hooper, who is more calculating and evil than an eleven-year-old boy normally is.

Either way it improves greatly by the 4th song so it really doesn't bother me. The musicianship is perfect, at no point is there is a mess-up. The guitar solos are awesome.

It's like it's 1985 or something.2)Nikko sounds better than ever. Better than Live AfterDeath even.3)The newer songs (post Somewhere in Time) sound fantastic.The older stuff though sounds worse. Too many guitars,not crisp sounding, like it should be.4)lose Jannick Gerhs, please.5) The inside needs more pictures of the show.

I just prefer Live After Death. The setlist on Live After Death is a million times better than the list for Rock in Rio.

It's clearly a mutual selling: they are feeding upon the great hype made with the BRAVE NEW WORLD album, when Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith came back.

What a lack of imagination!!THis Live set at least tried to capture on disc the excitment of a live peformance in front of 200 hundred thousand people. But, Steve Harris, please, get rid of Janick Gers and chose your live set more properly!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smart","review":"After generating so much hype with the long awaited reunion with singer Bruce Dickinsn and guitarrist Adrian Smith, which resulted in their best album since 1988's SEVENTH SON OF A SEVENTH SON, Maiden fed upon that hype and rapidly released a live album to make some cash....That's all this album is all about: money. There's nothing new here, except the fact that Bruce sung two songs fron Blaze Bayley's days, The Clansman and Sign of the Cross."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware of copy protection crippling","review":"Some copies of \\"Live in Rio\\" have copyright-protectioncrippling and won't play on my cdrom player on the computer.Buyer beware!

They proved for their critics that they still have a trick or two to teach the mediocre bands of nowadays.So, why am I rating this one star? Because there's absolutely no reason for a Maiden fan to buy another compilation from them. In recent years, we had a lot of live albums by Maiden, more the compilations Best of the Beast and Ed Hunter. That's it: I don't see any reason for this product to exist. They should at least have recorded one more studio album with the reunited line-up. Sad, Maiden. Rod Smalwood is never satisfied with the money he's making..."},{"rating":"1","title":"These guys [stink]","review":"After attending several iron maiden concerts, which were pretty cool. I decided to borrow Rock in Rio from a friend. I listened to it for several weeks before making a final decision. These guys do in fact [stink]. They may have tons of energy on stage with an incredibly large and fancy stage show. Why does one need a large stage show? Because these guys know that they stink.Yanick is the worst guitarist ever, and the other two cool guys don't play very much of the solos. When they do it is smothered with reverb and delay.Bruce Dickinson has to be one of the worst vocalists of all time. He could have come straight out of an amature punk rock band. He is constantly off key, nasal, goofy sounding, feminine and a tad fruity. Is that what us metal fans want to hear? I don't think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're Baaack!!!","review":"After spending the last half of the nineties playing so-so music, Maiden came back with 'Brave New World'. That was the best thing to came out in a long time. And now, they one-up themselves by putting out a live album. 'Rock in Rio' has it all : a hot crowd, a decent selection of songs, and a Maided reborn. This beats the pants off of 'A Real Live/Dead One'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the best live recording I've ever heard!","review":"Not only has Maiden become a force again in the studio, but they prove to the doubters that they can still kick [but] live as well. For those that gripe about hearing the \\"same songs as on other Maiden live recordings\\", have you forgotten the new 3 guitar sound? Mixed to perfection, Maiden has a new thickness, depth to their live sound that makes all of their songs sound fresh live, no matter how many times you've heard it.Bruce sounds like he's still in his 20s, and the rest of the band is sharp as ever. While I'm not the biggest fan of Gers myself, he does lend a certain personality to the live performances.So if you are a Maiden fan, or if you just like good live music, this is the CD to get. As for the others that chose to run down Maiden...screw'em. They obviously don't know what a real metal band is supposed to sound like. Guess that comes from listening to too much Papa Roach and Slipknot..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Solid Live Album(4.5)","review":"I really like this live album by the greatest band of all time. It isn't up to par with \\"Live after Death\\", which was the greatest live album ever. My complaints would be too much material from Brave New World, and the lack of songs from such classic albums such as Powerslave, Somewhere in Time, etc.Other then that, this is greatness all around.My favorite two are The Clansman and Sign of the Croos, which were actually great when Blaze did them, but friggin awesome with Bruce on the vocals! Great, amazing renditions of the classic tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maiden is finally back","review":"After their last 2 live albums (A Real/Live dead one, and Live at Donnington) being completely dissapointing, Rock in Rio is where they totally redeemed them selves. With Bruce, and Adrian back again giving them their 3 guitar line up, and their great sound again. I recommend this cd, or Live After Death if anyone wants to hear them live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blast from the Past","review":"I bought this since I wanted Who. Any Who. I like Jon Pertwee's Doctor well enough but he's not my favorite. This book was a wholly unexpected delight. It had the charm of that era and Barry Letts so perfectly captures the relationship of the Doctor, Sarah, and the Brigadier that you can see and hear them in your imagination. This is one of my favorite depictions of the Brigadier. The plot is not complex but it unfolds with a satisfying pace. Is it just me or is there a Lovecraftian touch to the Skang?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A resounding \\"meh\\"","review":"\\"Island of Death\\" was mostly a disappointment. It does manage to fufill the PDA ideal of feeling like the era it's set in (season 11).... it just feels like the worst things about that era. Mainly, the Doctor's an arrogant childish jerk the first half of the book and there's about 50 pages of pure padding in the middle that killed any feeling of suspense I might've had. Not that there was that much suspense to begin with, it's obvious pretty early on roughly where it's all going, bar a few minor twists.But on the bright side, I liked the way Letts tried to flesh out Sarah Jane a little (too bad he didn't do it 30 years ago!), and I think he did a decent job with the Brig."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sandisk 1GB Gaming Memory Stick PRO","review":"I ordered this product for a Christmas gift.

By this time the novelty has worn off and they have been done to death (pun intended)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overworked","review":"Without the infamous Waynes borthers, I found this movie a bit boring. Tired plot with only two spoofs of The Ring and Signs. The plot was too thin, the comedy was trite, and the whole movie was a waste of time. Besides the fact that there was a few laughs to have, the line up of stars was the only thing to look forward to. I suggest to anyone who has seen the first and sequel to this movie, don't hold your breath waiting to laugh..it isn't there."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a wasted","review":"With the Waynes Brothers stepping aside, David Zucker sat in the director's chair to take a shot at the thrid movie.And missed horribly.With so much talent and no real story the 3 movie fall flat on it's face with no real direction, only a constant stream of jokes, not many of them are that funny.With attempts to Spoof 8 mile, Matrix Reloaded, the Ring, and Signs did not pan out at all. The connection with the tape in the Ring and the monsters in Signs just didn't connect.Unlike the pervious movies that were rated R, the studio wussed out and made it a hard PG-13. This is a movie that is meant to be R"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down","review":"I enjoyed the first two movies, but this one was obviously the brain child of someone different. The good jokes are too few and far between. The focus was totally off on what to spoof and frankly, the lack of the Wayan brothers made this film not so funny. They gave it the outrageous factor (and R rating) that made it funny and different. It was like watching a skit show with many commercials in between. There were great actors, but even they couldn't carry the film void of plot. I want my money back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Non stop comedy action from start to finish!","review":"The third and final chapter of the hilariously entertaining scary movie trilogy.

Then she winds up watching a mysterious video tape that tells you that in a weeks time you will die. Cindy must find a way to stop the tape from killing again as well as helpig ensure the safety of her friends and colleagues from any further miraculous deaths. Charlie Sheen and comic legend Leslie Nielson are just some of the names cast in this blockbuster comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It really wasn't funny","review":"I was disgusted by the first one and pleasantly surprised by the second movie. I admire Anna Faris and her ability to never take herself seriously and be silly in any situation. Here, she was lacking. Charlie Sheen was maybe the funniest character in this movie, not that that says much. A lot of the jokes were really dumb, and like a previous reviewer said \\"boring\\". The humor veered more towards slapstick, and relied more heavily on people getting hit by random objects and knocked in certain delicate places of their anatomy. I felt like I was watching a cartoon.Just because people are beating each other up over a stupid misunderstanding doesn't make it funny. I felt like I could have thought up some of that stuff at home. I was disappointed in what they drew from what was actually very promising material. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its time to end it.","review":"The first Scary Movie was fine, the second should have been an indication that the series should end, but the third is dreadful. Ripping off movies from The Matrix to Sighs with out even being remotely funny makes this movie is a real choir to watch. I don't know what to think about the success of this film but I know that this is the last Scary Movie for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Though not a masterpiece, a movie worth watching!","review":"Scary Movie 3, following in the footsteps of its predecessors, is a parody of several films; Signs, 8 Mile, The Ring, even Matrix.Though not a masterpiece, it is a funny movie, guaranteed to provide more than a just a few laughs. The casting is very good (especially Jennifer McCarthy and Pamela Anderson in the opening scene!!!), and the story is very well written.Overall, it is a movie definitely worth watching, and even though quite silly at times, it will surely put you in a good mood!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious! Much Better Than the 2nd One!","review":"Scary Movie 2 had a very funny beginning *the Excorcist skit* but the rest of the movie was a bore. Scary Movie 3, on the other hand, had a rather stupid intro, but the rest of the movie was a riot. Of course, it centers around spoofs and goofy characters resulting in very stupid humor, but you can't help but find it enjoyable. This one centers around spoofs of \\"The Ring\\", \\"Signs\\", \\"8 Mile\\" and \\"The Others.\\" It also features an array of celebrity charaters and cameos with everyone from Charlie Sheen and Pam Anderson to Queen Latifah and Macy Gray.If you want a movie to just laugh your butt off to, thsi is it.

The movie was a complete mesh of other famous flicks, such as The Ring and Signs. I wouldn't suggest that people would buy this movie because it's just humor thrown into odd places. I've seen the movie five times, and although I laugh, it still isn't the greatest movie. I'm just relieved that there wasn't as much language in this movie than in Scary Movie 2. My God - they swore every other minute! Anyway, buy The Ring or Signs if you want to see a really good movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Wayans, No Comedy","review":"Much like the first 2, Scary Movie 3 was based on the hot scary movie of the year, in this case it was \\"Signs\\". The only difference between third and the first two is that this one wasn't funny in the least. Not written, directed, or seen in the movie (like the previous two), the Wayans brothers had nothing to do with this film. They signed over their rights to all productions, which explains why this movie tanked.The only scenes worth the slightest chuckle can be seen on the previews. I suggest you save the five dollars it cost to rent it for a real comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Humor Here!","review":"Don't buy this DVD.

However, the laughs are few and far between, and the only cameos here worth noting are from George Carlin as the Matrix Reloaded-spoofing Architect and Zucker fave Leslie Nielsen as the insane President.

However Scary movie 3 fails to book the same result as the writers accidently forgot to put in the jokes this time. It is rather difficult to say which kind of people were targeted to enjoy this movie, but I figure them to be 12 year old boys without a brain. This movie does not only suck, because of the worst jokes in the world. The movie even has the nerves to reintroduce Leslie Nielsen, Pamela Andersen and Charlie Sheen again while everybody had been hoping those people were bannished from any screen forever.

Mazin and Profit, although trying to follow the Wayne's examples set in the first to films of the franchise, seem to lack the grotesque and random nature of the original writers that made scary movie unique from other comedy spoofs. In my opinion, Scary Movie 3 was a horrible end to what could have been a great trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked 1&2, you'll hate this","review":"Man this was bad!

A little bit stupid but funny (I bought both of them anyway). And I had high spectations for this one because I found the trailer very good. So when I got this one and started wacthing it, i was waiting for the good funny stuff to come but let me tell you that I just laughed during one scene and nothing more. Besides the movie only takes 74 minutes.You'll find several known people here like Pamela Anderson, Queen Latifah and Leslie Nielsen. Finally I can say that they tried very hard on this one because there were not several terror movies that came out lately and one proof of that is that you'll find here a parody of Eminem's \\"8 mile\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool","review":"I have to admit, I haven't watched the first two, so I can't compare, but this movie was pretty good!There are plenty of positives, but the only negative thing I have to say is that I think they could have come up with a better ending. Even the alternate ending is better than the true one. I have to say the ending was stinky poo.I don't want to end my review on a negative note, so I just have to wrap it up by saying that if you have the time you should check the movie out.ThanX!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah","review":"This is one of those films that gets funny the more you watch it. The first hall of the film is so funny, but the second half drags it down with only some mild laughs here and there. Scary Movie 3 is no where near as good as the first 2 which are hilarious but it still manages to be an alright comedy. At least wearth a watch or two"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Trilogies come in Three's","review":"In a suprising move, the third installment in the franchise shed the R-Rating, foregoing the obscene nudity and replacing perepetual perversion with a multitude of inuendos. What results is a hilarious ride that parodies all the movies you know you love. The crazy story follows a newscaster who believes that a videotape has a connection to aliens who've been making crop circles in the cornfield of a local farmer, whose brother is trying to win a local rap contest. The movie is hilarious, and its possible to sit through it and not be grossed out like the first two.

If someone tried to even give me this movie, i'd hit them in the face. It's basically just a parody of the movie \\"The Ring\\", except that movie was good. I loved the first two scary movies, but it just seems everything funny from those movies has been done, and there's nothing fresh anymore. If you're one of those people that laughs out loud when \\"Chandler and Ross\\" get locked in a room or something, then you'll probably love Scary Movie 3.

The Zuckers, who made the \\"Airplane\\" films, are once again at their zany best. This film proves that the movie doesn't have to be absolutely disqusting (this one has a few moments, unlike the puke-fests that were \\"Scary Movie\\" and \\"Scary Movie 2,\\" which were full of crude humor throughout) to be a hilarious film. If you're a fan of the first two, then you'll hate this film. But if you're a fan of the \\"Airplane\\" films, then you'll love this film!

No real jokes, just references.I saw SCARY MOVIE 3 only because I noticed that some of the writers and director had been involved in the NAKED GUN films. I laughed a couple times, but a lot of this felt like the first film (I never bothered to see the second). I really wished they would've left Michael Jackson out of the preview because that scene could've provided one of the bigger laughs--if I hadn't already saw it fifty times in the commercial.I could understand fusing THE RING and SIGNS, but tossing in the Eminem movie parody felt meandering and knocked the movie off-balance--especially since it had nothing to do with the second half of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat out Terrible!!!!!","review":"This movie is just to prove that not all good things comes in threes. While this movie may have others leaving them in stitches, it had me looking at watch constantly hoping that it will end real soon. I prefer the first Scary Movie over this piece of crap any day. The very month when \\"Scary Movie\\" came out in the theaters 4 years ago I watched it 3 times. I lost track of how times I watched it on DVD. The second one could have been better but at least it's not as lame as the third one. I just don't get it when other's claim this is funnier than the first one.

I found myself shaking my head constantly in disagreement with everything that was being said. I could tell a lot of this stuff was ridiculously made up (and I am not a scientist). Also, being a Christian has nothing to do with this negative review. There was simply no research, a lot of bending over backwards to make things fit. In reality, watching this thing kind of insulted my own intelligence.

I do not need to prove that the Bible account is factual since the Bible is inspired of God. I did a little research and found a few things that didn't prove true but might be refuted by someone else. The two scenes showing the ark of the covenant do not match the final image shown at the end of the video. If you check the Bible that contains a literal description you will find that there were not two birds perched on the ark but two cherubs. The first scene showing the ark being crated it appears that the images are the cherubs and not birds. Also the information about El, supposedly representing the Israel God was probably a Cannanite God. El is depicted as a rebelllious son that dethroned and castrated his own father. He was considered to be the creator and sovereign. El could hardly fit the definition of Israel's God."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Fiction less Science","review":"While an interesting presentation and good production, Mr. Jacobovici is fusing together thin evidence, adjusting chronology to fit purpose and bypasses strong evidence when not convenient to the story.

Nothing within this documentary could be construed as proof, yet everything is presented as such. It has all the hallmarks of snake-oil salesmen telling people what they want to hear. If the suppositions had been set aside and the material allowed to stand on it's own, it presents some interesting information, but the majority of the presentation misrepresents the facts, and often the content of the Bible in order to fit the narrative.I see this ultimately as something more damaging than encouraging, and suggest that anyone with a mind too weak to see through the distortions of this documentary not be exposed to it.I do hope that the research continues, perhaps in the hands of those without such a transparent agenda."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie ever","review":"This is the best movie I have ever seen!

One of the bulbs burned out in several weeks'time, which I attributed to heat sensitivity. I decided to go with wedge bulbs instead and bought these PIAAs based on the reviews. Very disappointed - they are too dim even when compared to stock parking light bulbs, while my (remaining) wedge LED blew these out of the water brightness-wise.

Stifled by a rigid sense of what it is important for a girl to aspire to, the sensitve and independent character of Mary Olivier strives to find her own answers to lifes mysteries. She cannot ask anyone about literature, Arts or the more (for her) burning philosophical questions of meaning and substance. When she does she is early on taken to task by the very men she assumed would assist her. This is the key to the subtlety of the dialogue between Mary and her male friends.Considerable time is also taken up with Mary's relationship with her family members. This a satisfying book and the reader will be richly rewarded in following the life of Mary Olivier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits the spot!","review":"After reading other books on how to use After Effects, this is the only book I found that gave really great how-to tips and tricks that I can easily apply to future projects.

The puzzles in this game are nothing more than listening through interminable audio logs and writing down the code for the next locked door. Monsters popping up in the most unexciting ways from dark corners and slowly advancing toward you through narrow hallways. Over and over again.Long time ago I was hooked on Doom 2 and I really waited for its sequel hoping it will be nothing more than Doom 2 with a much better graphic engine. Not much to ask. Instead I got one of the most boring games of all times; a hybrid between Half-Life and Pacman (btw, I think Half-Life is a great game) that somehow feels more like Pacman.There is really no reason at all to play this game if you ever played Quake, Half-Life or Unreal Tournament."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOOM III ALPHA LEAK!!!!","review":"Hi My name is Thorns and I was one of the few lucky ones to playthe 3 level doom three leak.

More like a first person hiking trip (with your Grandma)d) Be unable to handle anything that requires actual thought - I know it's (supposed to be) a FPS, but am I the only one who gets real bored real quick with this type of completely linear gameplay?e) Work for the distributer or be related to the makersDon't waste your money like I did.

I have a Pentium 4, 512mb RAM and an nVidia GeForce MX4000 128mb graphics card, and the best performance I can get is Low Resolution and 640x480 (and even on these lowest possible settings, there are parts of the game that are choppy). And as for scares, well, let's face it; is there any way to really get scared sitting in fromt of your PC playing a game? \\"Return to Castle Wolfenstein\\" was a creepier game, and the Quake engine it used was far more effective than \\"Doom 3\\".Your best bet is to save your money on this one. The final experience is pretty underwhelming and you'll really miss that $55.

So All the bad reviews got me a little worried but all for naught. The graphics: Amazing! Sound FX; Amazing! Fear Factor: Amazing! Game Play: Amazing! Switching between flashlight and gun is a piece of cake, and I don't know why it has so many people complaining. The only thing in a negative review that I can agree with is the level load times.

But its the monotonous game play, hallways, corridors that will make you go puke. What's the point in playing the game in dark. And dont get me started on the \\"Flash light\\", such a pain in the rear. What the hell ! You cant hold flash light in one hand and a weapon in another. Moreover it should have been attached atleast to pistol, machine gun and shot gun. Another down side is that, you cant appreciate the well developed monsters, either its too dark, or they just jump at you and you have to kill them in an instant and then, their bodies turn into ash. Still the graphics are amazing, havent seen any game with such great graphics. Quake 4 has an advantage over this game, like the flash light is attached to the weapons, dynamic levels, variety in game play and so on. And it uses Doom 3 engine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doom again","review":"Doom 3 I thought was a very good fps, but not great. The grapics are topnotch and the sound design is great but thats about it. The story is very weak to me. Every doom has almost the same exact story. The monster designs though are terrific. The fat zombies and the space marines are some of the best that you will find in any game. Though the game can get laggy at some spots, especially if you dont have a supercomputer.

What became redundant was that the same creatures came at me time and time again. It bacame a lightning show of not to spooky guys. The weapons at that point in the game lacked punch. I also found that I lacked ammo quite often. It wasn't until I get into the later part that the golly woggles began to get just a little more scary, well just a little. Some if the aliens were far to accurate for their own good, and could take a far greater pounding than a normanl marine could deliver. Far too many taunts and not enough action at times. I found that I took one to many elevator trips into the airless court yard. This didn't add style to the game. I felt it actually took away from it. I know its a shootem up but it would have been nice to get a little more history or some sence of knowledge of the alien culture. Perhaps next time game makers will consider a cooperative mode so other can join in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty graphics, but unoriginal and repetitive gameplay","review":"This game looks good, but there is very little that is new in the gameplay. It really is just updated graphics applied to the original Doom. There's a lot of repetition too, so many stretches are boring and frustrating. And, most of the action takes place in the dark, so you can't see the pretty graphics most of the time! And why can't I use a flashlight and carry a weapon at the same time? It makes no sense.My recommendation: Save $20 and buy Far Cry. It's a much better game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, outdated - big yawn!","review":"I've read the reviews which support this game for it's atmospheric dark looks, the use of the flashlight, the weapons, blah, blah - but this game is just absolutely boring.The graphics aren't all that (yes running it on good machine but it seems a case of the emperors new clothes), the monsters suck...they just come walking or leaping towards you, the weapons aren't even fun to use.The only thing I can applaud is Activisions sales - by not releasing a demo version they managed to make a lot more money out of people like myself, who would have taken one look and seen what a mediocre game this was for the $50+ price tag.Loved the first Doom's, loved Half-life, Battlefields, etc - and will go on playing them, Doom 3 I've sold already at a $35 loss.Big yawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary - both for you and your computer","review":"This game is amazing in the graphics and sound department, allwing it to be rather freaky (altough I still find System Shock 2 more scary - I know, its an old game). It's scary for your machine in that, if you try to run it at full effects and resolution, your machine is probably trying maddly to keep up.For all you who played this in its original iteration of Doom, then there should be some nostalgic moments for you, but dont expect the game to be a complete remake.I give it five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game doesn't work.","review":"I bought this game because all the reviews said how great it was.

Too much time wasted on silly things like trying to get a combination right to open a storage compartment.And, as another reviewer mentioned, walking around with the silly flashlight is as good as it gets.I even had trouble trying to register the game, but no matter since it is so poor I'm not going to play it.Save your money, buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dude, its Doom","review":"Doom, how could anyone possibly even think that it wouldn't be great.

The enemy is very predictable except for some of the scripted events.The flashlight was annoying because it could not be used along with weapons. You have to lower your weapon everytime you use it. (Mods are available to fix this, but the game seems to be centered on leaving you in almost pitch black to make it frightening. Without the default flashlight set up the suprises are minimal.)I quickly found the gameplay becoming boring because it is very similar to the original Doom. Personally I prefer more tactics in my gameplay. Halo 2 and Half-Live 2 look better, but I look forward to the Doom engine being used on future games with better gameplay and A.I."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This is quite possibly the worst computer game I ever spent 50 bucks on. Yes the graphics are cool, but endless running around before any combat, walking through dark corridors with a lame flash light missing every flight of stairs possible, and having to look at this stupid PDA all the time is not my idea of a good time. I have been playing this game for hours and have not yet seen the first monster. Yes, I know that finding your way around is part of any good game, but for a franchise who has built itself around combat as a main theme, running through doors for hours on end doesnt quite stimulate the imagination. Do yourself a favor and buy the latest installment of resident evil for your PS 2, dont waste your time on this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it- it's worth it","review":"I can't believe people are giving this game such horrible ratings. First people created hype for it and now it supposedly does not live up to expectations. Well im here to tell you it does. It doesn't introduce any new elements to the genre it still fcking awesome. The graphics are mindblowing and the gameplay addicting. Blowing ugly dudes away never gets boring. Plus the requirements are amazingly versatile. Just have something around a RAdeon 9600XT and you are all set. I didn't find it that scary but im only half way through it. There were 2 freak out moments so far. Buy Doom 3 people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who can wait?!","review":"I've seen much, if not most, of the information about Doom III. And while I've been gaming on PCs for the better part of 15 years, I can say without a doubt that this title is the single most anticipated product of my gaming life (with the possible exceptions of Half Life and Halo). The emphasis on tension, atmosphere, pacing and the immersive illusion of reality leave me expecting a lot. But based on the reputation and track-record of ID Software it is unlikely that those expecations are misplaced. Factor in the influence of Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails and this 'game' will almost certainly be deep, dark, sinister and flat out scary. Let me buy it now, please! ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAK difficulty method of blindness","review":"This had the potential to be a fair to good game, but the software engineers decided the way to increase difficulty is to blind you. Now, let's be fair. You can make ANY game hard by blinding the player. It's a weak, pathetic substitution for difficulty. It deprives you of the visual fun of a strange world, which makes me suspicious that the 'strange world' is probably not there. The way to cover up lame stunts in an action movie is to shake the camera, add loud noise and in other ways distract you from the action. This is the WHOLE story in DOOM 3. Give this weak-kneed, pathetic follow-up a pass. Save your money. It's crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"I shoulda listened.....","review":"WHENEVER the ratio of 5 stars to 1 star is under 10, you are best off to not purchase the item.Doom3 ratio is 4.1So, I paid.

Dark, creepy, it marked a resurgence of horror FPS games and pressed the boundaries of the hardware of the day.As of Dec 2007, however, it doesn't do that any longer and there's darker, creepier, better written games out there. As we enter 2008, 8PM on a Thursday night, there are only ~10 people on all the servers that my copy found tonight. Doom3 might have a lot to be said for it in multiplayer mode, if people were still playing it, but they're not.If you're toying with buying this game today, buy it as a single player FPS, and buy it cheap. Half-Life2, Prey, and a half dozen other, better written, FPSes are available in the same 15-25 dollar price range. If you can find this game under $20 and have a deep love of id Games, go for it. If you'd rather just find a good single-player game, blow that $20 on something more compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Hype, Minimal Delivery.","review":"There is nothing wrong with Doom 3. It is a well-put-together FPS with some nice graphics technology. It has a storyline that is solid, and a few interesting missions. The problem with Doom 3 is that it is just another FPS wrapped up with pretty graphics. There's nothing terribly revolutionary about the gameplay, nothing that makes this game stand out from any other FPS on the market right now, except the graphics engine, which wasn't all that impressive in my opinion. The weapons are boring, the levels are dark and kind of scary, but rather homogenous. I'd say wait until the hype wears off, and the price goes down, but only buy this one if you need it to complete your Id FPS collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Flop","review":"Bring back Doom 2. A far superior game. Game is way to short. No place to run and gun. It's to dark for to long and to many shadows. No neat secret rooms or passage ways. Finding codes to open doors gets boring.

Yes the graphics are tops but thats to be expected with the natural progress of game developments. What is significant and NEW here is the scare factor of this game. No other FPS game I have played before this one has been sooo scary! I literally cringe when turning corners because the suprises are so well done in this game.

That's all they've been good at since the original Doom. Leave the actual game desgin to the experts. This is just a mediocre game on a fantastic graphics engine.

My computer performed flawlessly, albeit at Medium settings. The game is fabulous. The environment is astounding and is increasingly scary as the game progresses. Yes the objective is still to shoot the bad guys, but the way it happens is very unique. I think this is a real gotta have game. BUT you also gotta have the power to run it.

The biggest problem I have with it is the plot of the game. Its a \\"first person shooter\\" for sure, but after an hour or so you do not feel like you are really getting anywhere. [[[Go around corner - shoot monster - go around next corner - shoot monster - go into dark room...]]] and yeah, just start shooting because everything you encounter is the enemy. This game could have used some versatile direction in the realm of a more outdoor landscape as opposed to the confines of a space station.

And this game is not worth buying the only game worth buying is half-life 2. Cause at least they know how to give a kick ass online multiplayer game.

I decided to take it to Best Buy and buy Half-Life 2, after buying half-life 2, i still had a lot of money left, so i was thinking about buying the remastered half-life 1, but I saw Doom 3, and remembered the awesome commercial I saw for it. I picked it up and took it home. I expected an amazing game such as doom 1 and 2, but instead it was terrible! Doom 3 is nothing but a scarier first person version of the Men In Black 2 game! You get trapped in a room with aliens, you kill them, then you move onto the next room of aliens, up until you find a somewhat bigger and scarier alien that is referred to as the boss. The game will most likely be over in 4 or 5 days, and the alien's graphics are somewhat really bad for the time, so I dont know what else to say but Doom 3 isn't worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Hype, lets see it deliver....","review":"Ok, im not doubting id, but lets see the game bfore we give it 100 5star reviews......"},{"rating":"1","title":"doomed doom 3","review":"If you liked all the old doom games, this will be a great disappointment.

While it is a good game, it becomes repetative....But man what glorious graphics! Let me tell you, the technical detail has never been so staggering and all around awesome on any game ever created. Perfect curves, great colors, realsitic characters, and scare-you-outta-your-pants like zombies make it all worth it.As for the game itself, it is a good game overall, heck maybe even great... but it does lack of originallity in gameplay and variety. If you like throwbacks, this game is perfect for you. Predictable first-person shooter about a man who goes to Mars for a new military post and eventually becomes a one man wrecking crew agains Hell's army. If you liked the original games, your gonna love it... but if your new to the series, and you'll probably wind up thinking that its a good game but too redundant for your true liking."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent graphics engine, AI a little predictable","review":"OK, like everyone says, the graphics engine is the best out there -- the lighting from the flashlight and all the ambient lighting from the swinging lamps, flashing red alert sirens, etc, are unbelievable.My only problem was that the gameplay of the monsters coming at you turned a bit predictable after a while. Comparing this to Halo, for example, I enjoyed halo more in the sense that each monster acted drastically different, and there are \\"puzzles\\" in halo like having to figure out that those certain larva creatures will explode on your shields.I found one specific part of the game to be excellent -- because the monsters are coming at you so much for a while, there is a roughly 10 minute portion in the middle where things calm down, BUT you are still on edge waiting for something to happen! Good scripting with that.So, the game is great, but don't expect it to be everything you want and you will enjoy it more I suspect."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as it is hyped","review":"the gameplay was not very smooth. also there were a lot of bugs and possibly glitches that caused crashes.i think the game also needs expensive hardware to run properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"The future is a very dark place with no duct tape.","review":"If you are a fan of first person shooters with any sort of depth look elsewhere.

Doom got me into gaming, it was new, innovative and fun. But now, 10 years later - the same game with a new face - is in short BORING!! Graphics and sound are cool - very impressive - that is about it. The requirements are way over the top - unbelievable. The guns take way too long to reload - way too many monsters and not enough story and things to do to make the game interesting. The game may have gotten better visually - but it has not grown up like the rest of us did. It's still stuck in 1995.

This is because the game consists of hours of monsters jumping out from walls behind you only to shoot you in the back. There is little innovation in this game and very few real challenges. The sameness is monotonous. Oh, yes, the graphics are quite nice, but even they have a similar look, sort of dark interior, mechanical corridors, mostly.I was disappointed that there were very few physical challenges, such as jumping over moving objects, nor were there any puzzling mental challenges to add some variety to the game. This game was so empty of fun, I rushed though it to get to the end. When I was done I could only think to myself, what were they (ID) thinking.So if you enjoy spinning around to kill the baddies, coming out of seemingly solid walls, constantly, by the thousands, then you might like this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spooky. Great graphics. But can't see s***!","review":"(*Review based on Demo*)Perhaps many people go for the appeal of being left in the dark - and it definitely adds to the spookiness factor - but I just found it, well... annoying.80% of the game you're either in the dark or can't see but a few feet in front of you. Its sort of like trying to fight in a box... its just rediculous.There is nowhere to crouch down and hide or use any sort of tactics. Instead, you're just mindlessly running through areas, trying find stuff to shoot at.Seriously, you can't use a light-mounted gun this far in the future??

This game lacks all of the things that I was hoping for.Instead they ruin it with a plot, cutscenes, lack of finding some weapons until the end, yadda, yadda, yadda.However, if this game were called something else like,.....um, I don't know.....\\"Extremely Dark Game With A Flashlight\\"...I probably would have liked it a lot more.Like I said this isn't DooM."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"First, I am not a gamer.

Or, when they give you a new weapon, you get just enough amo for 1 roomful of villans. I put in the code for all weapons and amo. It was a blast to play. It was still plenty hard...but it moved much faster overall, and this made me realize how diverse the game really is. Shotgunning thru the same corridor for an hour just to make it 15 feet to the next door gets real tedious. Gimme something good...BFG 9000 by God... blast um... much more fun this way.

You might even enjoy it for a while, but eventually you realize how bad it is. The graphics aren't very good, they look like a computer graphisised version of clamation, not of real people. The story is not very engaging, and only moves forward occasionally. Finally my largest problem is that I find myself doing the same thing over and over again. The game takes place entirely indoors in dark rooms. There is no variety in the gameplay whatsoever; you go from room to room dodging, and shooting. You are not given any opportunities to use veicles, or try different play stiles.

I was disappointed that the book did not live up to what was anticipated. I believe Ms. Chadwick has much talent and the potential to write a masterful piece. However, she misses the mark here. The text flows nicely and provides an easy read. The book however is predicatable, plain and juvenile. There is no character development and we are not given enough depth of information to form a bond with any character, most importantly our protagonist, Cat. I saw her only as a hard working, shallow \\"I want it all\\" young girl in a woman's body. We have no idea who she really is and I found myself thinking that the women protrayed were one dimensional and lacked real substance. If only we knew why they felt as they did, acted and reacted as they did, we might appreciate them all the more. This would make a great beach read. If your looking for something a lot more thoughtful and discerning, keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Chadwick has written an engrossing book, full of realistic characters -- complex, charming, vulnerable yet brave.

Cat has been writing since she was a child and at the age of 34 she's just been published -- a first book that is getting a lot of attention and is guiding her toward a new path in her life. At the same time, she has met someone who could be \\"the one.\\"Trying to cope with the changing tides of relationships, career, and impending fame; coming to terms with ghosts from the past; Cat struggles with the ever-shifting shapes of a life in transition. In the process, we are taken on a rich and insightful journey. This is a wonderful book.

I only managed to read the chapter on arranged marriages and her treatment of the account of the gracious couple who were obviously happy with their situation was ridiculous.

I don't know how I can get these to be more comfortable, short of trying to stretch them and possible cutting them where the ankle rubs.

I skimmed several parts, especially about military movements and politics. I wanted it to be over.CAUTION SPOILER: My favorite character was the sister of Valentina, a supporting character. She was strong, independent and fun to read about. However the ending for her was sad. I don't like sad endings. I didn't like Valentina's decisions.

Some of the guitars and vocals reminded me of AiC as well, and as good a guitarist as Zakk is, he's no Jerry Cantrell...and certainly nowhere NEAR as good as a singer as Layne Stayley (RIP). To the moron who said that AiC sucks, get a f***ing clue and listen to Facelift or Dirt. When Ozzy and other wash outs were turning out endless garbage in the 90s AiC were providing fans, yes even metal fans, with the heavy music they wanted.Anyway, this album is bland and fairly forgettable, despite Zakk's talent. Only recommended for hardcore Wylde fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zakk's At It Again...","review":"This is a disappointing album. There are very few spots that are \\"attention-grabbers\\" in a positive way. Zakk's annoying Ozzy-like screams are more apparent here than on previous efforts.

Tracks such as \\"What's In You\\", \\"You Must Be Blind\\", \\"Suicide Messiah\\", \\"Say What You Will\\", and \\"In This River\\" really define what an ass-kicking songwriter that Zakk truly is.Pick this one up!

There is not one bad song on this album. This is one of the only albums released in many years with no filler songs. In 20 years this album will be a classic. Zakk's guitar playing is the best I've heard on any BLS album. I can't understand why anyone thinks Zakk sounds like Layne Staley from Alice in Chains. I don't hear it.

That God-awful video for \\"In This River\\" is laying it on thick and pasty, just like a fresh laid stinky cow turd. His singing is a cross between Ozzy, Weiland's voice on \\"Crackerman\\" and Will Ferrell's character with voice immodulation syndrome. After the 45th pinch harmonic and formulated chorus you will want to hurl your intestines out and then eat them like a dog, because your puked up intestines will go down more smoothly than trying to digest this disgrace to metal, music and the world.

Which I rank as one of the most underrate hard rock releases in the past 15 years. What distinguishes this album from the other BLS releases is the song writing and catchy riffs. I did not care to much for the 1st couple BLS albums as they were more newer metal/ thrash. However blessed hellride was a start for obviously good things to come. This album saw Zakk focus more on his song writing then blowing people away with loud head bashing sound. This album still demonstrates great guitar work but it also introduces great song writing. Man you can just hear some of his influences in the feedback and effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zakk's still pumping them out!","review":"Yes that's right, he's the hardest working man alive today in the music industry. The cd's just keep coming and that's a good thing for the most part. It's not like we have to wait a decade or more between releases only to be totally let down (are you listening Boston?). This cd is more of the mellower side of Zakk. It's somewhere between Blessed Hellride and Hangover music. It's good stuff, but maybe a little rushed at times as the songs are not quite up to par with other releases. Don't get me wrong, it's classic Zakk and I love that Southern rock vibe, but perhaps he should maybe curtail it to maybe one new release a year?"},{"rating":"2","title":"What's not to like?","review":"I've read some of the reviews, and frankly, they make me chuckle. Yes, some lyrics (You Must Be Blind) are repetitive, but, since when was rock music not repetitive? At least it's not typical sissy rock that you hear on the radio all the time with the same two guitar chords over and over again. Zakk is amazing. If for nothing else, listen to the album just for the brilliant guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen","review":"Really, if you are only going to listen to the good reviews, and dismiss the negative ones, just because you don't want to hear them, why would you even consider listening to music reviewed by anyone?Anyway, this album gets two stars for effort. Zakk Wylde is one of the most mediocre songwriters in \\"metal\\". Yes, their are a couple of catchy songs on this album, but only for the reasons of being repetitive. \\"Fire it Up\\" has three chords throughout the song. Seriously listen to what is being played, Zakk will sing the same line over, and over, and.....over again. The riffing is nothing special, I don't see the big deal really. Nothing against the man, he is just highly overrated. So, overall less than mediocre, boring, and repetitive songs.

After listening to it I thought, \\"I won't be buying that because I have no urge listen to it again.\\" The guitars riffs are all right, but rather boring. It seems like Zakk is putting the emphasis on his vocals and just not really kicking ass like he's know for on guitar.If you want real BLS, buy \\"Stronger than Death,\\" \\"Sonic Brew,\\" or my personal fovorite \\"1919 Eternal.\\" You can't ever get tired of hearing these albums.If Zakk wants to go in this direction he can do whatever he wants because he wrote some serious high quality heavy metal when metal was going through a rough time. I'm just telling you that \\"Mafia\\" is boring and doesn't come close to living up to a standard set by previous albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Am I the only person who is disappointed with this album?I love Zakk to death but his last to albums were awful.The songs need to be faster and heavier.I find that he's starting to sound more and more like Ozzy with every album he puts out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zakk Wylde at it again.","review":"I am a big fan of Zakk Wylde and everything he does, so when I heard his new album I was immidiately thrilled. After I got it and listened to it the first time I was in awe. Zakk is such a great musician. Everything in this album is top notch and you won't be dissapointed. This is a must buy for every fan of hard rock/metal and beyond. My favorites in this album are 'Fire It Up', 'Suicide Messiah', 'Electric Hellfire' and of course 'In This River'. This is a listen from start to end, you won't find a boring song here. I gotta say, I think Zakk found the middle ground between Hangover Music and 1919 Eternal. Go out and get it, you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why zakk? why?","review":"I loved every single BLS album leading up to this CD, but Mafia has to be the worst album zakk has ever made.That being said, I do enjoy suicide messiah and in this river (tribute to dime, R.I.P.), but just about everything else on this cd annoys the hell out of me. a good example is the chorus in \\"you must be blind\\" which has to be the worst chorus ever written. zakk simply repeats the words \\"you must be blind\\" with and incredibly annoying synth effect in the background that ascends with the pitch of zakk's voice. at the end, it repeats SEVEN TIMES! this song sums up the CD, long, repetitive, and dissapointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing sound !!!","review":"I have read a review that Zakk is ripping off alice & chains who was also a great band. Man where do you think they got there influences on singing style from. Ozzy has ben singing like that since the 70's .This album is pretty good a couple of the songs are realy catchy the only thing I didnt like was some of the solos sound very familiar like they have been done before maybe I am mistaken. This was well worth the money an dose kick ass."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst BLS album to date","review":"I can conclude one of two things from this album. 1. Zakk Wylde needs to take a longer break between writing his albums or 2. His Creative well has run dry. This album really isn't very good at all. I tried to give it a chance but I'm just annoyed that Zakk Wylde would release an album full of songs that I feel were targeted for the radio. If you were to take all the filler songs of his past 3 releases, tie in a catchy chorus, and put it onto one album this is what you would have. Uninspiring, unoriginal and mediocre song writing, sadly I feel I could have done a better job at writing the riffs and lyrics on this album. Anyone who thinks Zakk Wylde is the savior of metal worships anything he touches and thus praise this album, but I really just can't do it. If your just discovering BLS pick up 1919 Eternal, and Stronger Than Death and progress from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad children","review":"I had bought this toy for my 3 and 4 year old boys.

I just returned from an 11-day trip to Jerusalem in which I traveled throughout the city and outlying areas. The details in the maps are accurate and essential to finding destinations. The historic, political, and cultural aspects are presented with, I believe, a slightly Palestinian biased approach. Look, there is no way you can visit Israel and especially Jerusalem without an opinion on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; if you do not come with an opinion, you will certainly leave with a few. The issues are highly complex and layered and not to be taken lightly. Any author writing about the city must assert some positions, to do otherwise would be intellectually dishonest. Author Daniel Jacobs does his best to navigate these treacherous waters, although you may detect a well-informed bias. Don't let this stop you from buying/using this wonderful guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"very unbalanced reporting","review":"The author of this book is extremely biased against Israel. he seems to practically bendover backwards to put a pro Arab slant to just about everything in the book.

I was almost expecting him to blame any bad weather on the Israeli government.I was extremely disapointed , and to me it seemed that he found himself a soap box , at my expense. It's a shame that he put so much effort into trashing a country , instead of concentrating his efforts on presenting the beauty of such a pretty and culturally rich land.

The hero is so unprofessional I didn't like him from the start--but he does get to kiss her early--but, why? I saw no reason for these two to be together.I could not finish this novel. There was so much back-and-forth murkiness and not funny stuff. I looked at the ending and discovered the reason for the murder was stupid and not at all amusing. Dirty family secrets are not funny. I have no problem with people's sexual preferences but it made a very boring motive. The stalker was predictable but the reasoning was so compicated and needed so much explanation--that was not, again, funny.I threw the book against the wall--twice. An enormous waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not order the Kindle Version.","review":"The publisher of this book has messed up the last and final chapter in the kindle version.

She makes me laugh out loud and that's pretty hard to do.This was a great read. I loved the connection between Audie & Quinn. All the characters were really well developed and added to the story. Quinn had a wonderful big Irish family and you could feel Audie's anxienty about them yet also her longing for the closeness they shared. The tension between Audie and Drew was palpable and almost heartbreaking since they we're supposed to be family. I would even be tempted to read Andrew's story if she felt so inclined to write it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I don't have high expectations when I read a romance novel so I was surprised to find myself bored with this one.

I did not want to put it down and ending up reading it in a day and a half. She had just enough of everything I like in a book. Great characters, super great love scenes and a total surprise of who the villan was. If you do not like sex in your book this is not for you. Ms Donovan does an excellent job of describing the scenes without making it peverted, it was pure. I will definetly read more of her books. I have not read fiction since my children were babies.

I highly recommend this book. This book really stays with you long after you put it down. It really reminded me of how passionate love can be when you first fall in love. I will be first in line to get any book by this author. I've also read He Loves Lucy, which is also fun and sexy with great characters. However, He Loves Lucy is not quite as erotic as this book, but still a very passionate and romantic tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love is a roller coaster","review":"This reminded me of an old wooden roller coaster -- slow to start, chugged up a big hill, but when it finally got started, woo-hoo! What a fun ride! I was a bit frustrated in the beginning because I did not feel the immediate chemistry between the characters. I was ambivalent towards the character of Audie, but she gradually grew on me. Quinn was as good as gold and her reluctance to give in to her feelings made me want to give up on the book. I'm glad I didn't because the story vastly improved once Quinn begins to seriously court Audie and the family secrets are slowly revealed.

Following the kinking, the handle leaks water and then no more steam is produced. We tried several different ways to make the unit work, but it really can't be used for anything without the hose kinking from the heat.

This one isn't - but it's not terribly bad, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Certainly not for everyone","review":"Takeshi's nihilistic gangster flicks are always going to be polarizing, and Outrage is no different. This film is entirely centered around murder and violence; there is almost zero character development, humor or respite.

I realize that every configuration is not the same and there can be glitches and problems. But after hours of installing, reinstalling going online and tinkering, this product simply does not work. According to device manager it is working properly, the green power light is on, but nobody is home. No picture. Nothing. I am using Windows XP Home on a newer high end Toshiba. Also note that the Quick Start brochure is also not accurate, which I had to learn by going to Creative's website. Personally, I actually like the flimsy stand that everyone else seems to hate. It's possible that I just was shipped a bad unit. But as for now it is DOA, so my experience has been very frustrating.

For these types of tasks, the NX Pro has done everything I ask with little or no fuss.I've used some other webcams before, and the NX Pro is the best I've seen at adjusting to lighting conditions and producing a clear picture -- although the color output can be a little too warm or cold at times. But if you're going to be fussing about color warmth you probably shouldn't be using a webcam anyway.The design is practical and rather cute. Sometimes I wish the frame rate was better, but really that's wishful thinking for something in this price range. Most consumers should find this webcam more than satisfactory for all their webcam needs. Try to get the rebate if you can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little webcam","review":"This webcam was reasonably priced and works very well. The image quality is better than others that are priced higher. The separate microphone is a good idea so that you don't have to talk into the webcam. The grips do not work well on a LCD monitor--that is probably the only complaint--but the stand is ok if you keep the webcam on a flat surface.I would recommend if you are just chatting with family and friends over the internet or for quick movies. Not too fancy but good and reasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative Labs WebCam NX Pro","review":"Picture clarity is better!! The stand does not clip on well for a Flat monitor screen.

Great price, excellent picture, good color and contrast. It beats many more expensive products and is certainly far superior to some of the Logitech products out there. I'm running a 2.4 gig machine with 512kb memory, Windows XP Pro, which of course did not recognize the driver compatibility but installed without a hitch anyway. This webcam works great with the software bundle it comes with, and it is an above average bundle at that. Works out of the box with Yahoo Messenger and Windows Messenger, no problem at all. Total installation time about 10 minutes. My only complaint would be that the stand for a flat panel monitor include some type of device that allowed for a firm attachment. I suppose a little velcro or tape would solve that problem. Other than that, you cannot go wrong with this purchase. Creative has another winner with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than logitech","review":"I agree with other reviewers. The Creative Webcam NX Pro is better than the logitech webcams.

The quality is like a Camcorder and not a webcam. But don't use it for movies - it is just a webcam.The base gives it 4 instead of 5 stars - it keeps toppling over - the base is light and awkward like a tripod - does not fit a LCD top as designed to and does not even sit well on a flat surface.

I crashes randomly, sometimes after just 3 seconds!Now is you want to try it with Linux, tough luck, as this webcam manufacturer didn't give away any driver or documentation to people willing to make a driver.

If those reviews were authentic, I wonder which antiques they were comparing with.I would have given it a 1 star if it wasn't for the smooth installation of the product.I already returned the product and got the refund - $4.99 on me because the product was not defective. And I just got the Logitech QuickCam Pro 4000 and it works perfect with great video/picture quality that you're able to tell who's who in the cam!

The driver/application/installation process hung repeatedly. I finally had to go directly to Creative's web site to get the most current drivers. Although I eventually got the camera to work, picture quality was poor, and the frame rate was a joke. The slightest movement produced smearing and broken images. The frame rate was closer to one frame per second than the advertised 15 frames per second. Undaunted, I tried it on another computer (an 1800MHz AMD Athlon). The results were the same. I returned at the next day.When Amazon credits my account, I'm going to buy a Logitech 4000. This camera appears to meet my need for quality.

Reading the book together with my Brazilian friend, he found numerous technical errors in spelling, pronunciation, and word choice.

I found a highly respected program from Georgetown University, and some also suggested Rosetta Stone. I bought the Georgetown tape program, the Rosetta Stone computer program, a state department tape program and a Pimsleur CD program and I spoke with several people from Brazil and the pronunciation from all is much different from what is phonetically presented in this book. Get a different book if you want to know how to pronounce words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many mistakes","review":"Learning a language in the informal and fun way proposed by the book is always good, but unfortunately this book has too many mistakes, mostly concerning pronunciation. For example, the letter X in Portuguese does not have only two sounds like they say, but four. The difference between \\"closed E\\" and \\"open E\\" is never pointed out, so that the letter E in words like \\"dedo\\" and \\"elefante\\" is said to have the sound of the English E in the word \\"egg\\", which is not true. There are also too many accents missing. The list of problems goes on and on. Concerning the CD, I'm totally amazed that the speakers, although from Brazil, still read all the mistakes contained in the book. In their life, they would never say \\"gostar o Brasil\\", but \\"gostar do Brasil\\". I'm Brazilian and a Portuguese intructor. There is hope for the book because the grammar is not bad, but it needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I was born in Brazil - thus Portuguese is my primary language.I came across this book only by chance.I used the \\"Look Inside\\" feature and had a shock: I noticed an excessive amount of words that are not spelled correctly, many cases of poor translation and text showing inappropriate use of slang (and too much of it). To make things worse, the author committed basic grammar errors. All this is absolutely unacceptable when the book's objective is to teach the language!I strongly recommend the author to submit this book to a Brazilian linguist expert for a deep, thorough review.I definitely do not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 5 star performance by Anne Sweeney Holliday!","review":"From the minute you meet the personable young attorney, Joe Manzarelli implants you in his life!

No fun games to play with your pup. I named mine Puffy and I like to love Puffy, but it's not very fun.

Turns out the reviews are right. My daughter had to repeatedly call the dog, only to have it move two feet, turn its head and bark at her. She got bored with it after twenty minutes. The dog isn't useful as a \\"stuffed\\" animal either. It's just a machine with fur over it so it's not something she'd cozy up with. The fur was sliding around on it too. Not a good toy and not worth the price. I returned it the next day and my daughter hasn't asked about it since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Go is a No Go","review":"Bought Go Go for my 7 year old daughter who tried to call it once with no success. This toy does not come when called unless you are screaming loudly and continuously for a long while.The fur is fine and brushes well, and the sounds made are real enough. The biggest complaint is that the motions are too hard to \\"train\\" and this toy does not respond as described to sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This toy is good only for a stuffed animal and even then it isn't very good; white fur, too heavy etc. It does NOT listen to it's commands. We gave this to my daughter for her 6th birthday.She had a hard time with the instructions \\"pat the side twice to follow you, pat the head to stay, rub the back and...\\" Sorry but it never (and I do mean never) did what we asked it too. Instead it would just go around and around to the right. Bad toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy Mommy","review":"Save your money. This is a piece of JUNK!!! I would have returned it, but my husband through the box away before we learned how disappointing this toy really is. Either it does not come at all when you clap/call it or the stupid thing rolls the other way. My 4 year old has more fun playing with it while it is turned OFF. Save your money...buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing toy.","review":"My now 6-year-old daughter enjoys playing with this toy for few minutes every few months, but leaves it switched off. It barks but beyond that it delivered none of the tricks that were promised. Also the fur is soft but it its thin over a hard and heavy plastic frame, it is soft to pet but not to cuddle. I also bought the cat verson of this toy for our older daughter who was equally disappointed in her toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Go My Walking Pup","review":"Well, here is another fine example of a toy that works better on TV than in the home. My daughter lost interest in this in about 5 minutes. The dog barks and spins in circles rather than come toward you when called. We've had to scream at it just to get it to move. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but disappointing","review":"Got this for my 7 year old daughter. She had been begging for it for months. Since she had played with it at a friend's house, I thought it was a safe bet, but she was bored with it after two days. When you first get it out it seems really cool. But you quickly realize that it walks into walls far more often than it comes when you call. I was also unable to get it to perform \\"guard mode\\" or \\"sleep mode\\" at all. I'd say if you want something cute and fuzzy, try a hampster. It will teach your child responsibility and won't be boring after 48 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its totally cute!","review":"I love it! Its so cute!

If there is any background noise it gets confused and won't do anything you ask. We have tried making the house silent and still get the same results. Myself and a friend bought Go Go dogs last Christmas for our daughters and were both disappointed.We don't have much luck with this type of toy, we also purchased Poochie back when it was popular and it didn't do what was advertised either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This has to be the biggest waste of money I've spent on a toy. It does not respond to sounds, it moves maybe a few inches if it moves at all. It's not soft or cuddly. It's just a noisy piece of junk. And I paid full price for this thing when it was a popular item. Not worth it even with the 60% off it's being offered for on this site. Can't even sell it at a yard sale.

It is based on a real life, and it is neither exaggerated nor embellished. Life as it is, struggles, loneliness, quest of its meaning, healing of our wounds, the meaning of existence. This young man is obsessed by absolute truth, and he sets out to find his truth on his adventurous quest all the way to Alaska. The ending is tragic, but not sad.The rhythm of this story is like breathing and the beat of the human heart.Thanks for telling it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Great Movies!","review":"One of the best movies ever made.

I thought Chris was selfish and irresponsible, and that his pursuit of his own truth did nothing but leave a trail of pain in his wake...and he just didn't care. But the film is so beautiful and compelling that by the end I felt it delivered exactly the right message - that happiness is nothing if not shared."},{"rating":"2","title":"For my son, amazing movie","review":"We, my son and I read the book first, which was an amazing book. The movie, which doesn't usually happen, was amazing also. I recommend both book and movie to anyone. Thanks Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie with a great message at the cost of being sad","review":"You follow the unchained ambitions of a person we all have within ourselves and this movie with several messeges has one overpowering one left for the end that comes more as a consequence than as a hurtle that some character a writer created. I saw some glimmering greatness in this films pictures-like frames that reminded me in small ways of some of the more beautiful and free movies created. Days of Heaven came to mind by Terrence Malick. In a year full of nominated movies that not many people cared about, I couldn't help but think how maybe this great and accessible movie would have perhaps awoken a bigger reception. The jury of \\"who ever they are who votes\\" academy persons lost credit with me since this movie was overlooked, as well as Zodiac. What's wrong with this film that it shouldn't stand next to No country for old men, There will be blood, Micheal Clayton, Juno? I would replace nearly any of them in fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective DVD","review":"Love the movie but DVD at two defects where the movie would pause and had to skip the scene.

It's about the journey of a college graduate who needs to go out on his own and find himself, away from the chaos of his family. For him this means exploring the nation, facing his fears, and living off the land. He gives away the last of his savings, dumps his old beaten up car, and takes off backpacking in hopes of reaching Alaska. This story is filled with many life altering friendships that he forms along the way, and many obstacles that help him become a better man. Its a heart breaker though, things don't always go as planned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest Interpretation of the Book","review":"Director Penn takes the banal story of a pampered narcissist who goes into the Alaskan wilderness to find TRUTH only to die alone from starvation and tries to turn it into some kind of Homeric epic of self-discovery. Penn tries to tie the hero's angst to his parents who in the book aren't disparaged in any way. Sure, they have problems, but the boy's 5 siblings seem to be just fine. Only he turns on them and sets out to deliberately bring them pain they don't deserve.The book is ok for high school kids. It's well-written by an author who himself went through a period of alienation as a young man. The difference is he lived to tell the tale.Ironically, the parents the hero so despises go on to establish a Foundation in his memory. They're doing just fine. Also, the hero took on his journey a sleeping bag his mother had made by hand, slept in it every night and in the end it becomes his shroud. What would Freud say about THAT?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible !","review":"I read this book about 3 years ago and one rainy Saturday I decided to watch the movie. IT WAS AWFUL !

The biggest thing wrong with this movie is the story it tells. A 23 year old college graduate wanders off and travels across country with the ultimate goal of going to Alaska. Meanwhile, his family thinks he's probably dead. The movie tries to explain his actions are because his parents fought a lot and were really wealthy and materialistic. The disturbing thing about this movie is that he is portrayed as some kind of hero that escapes our horrible \\"society\\". Please. The guy was obviously mentally ill, but the movie conveniently leaves this out. I feel bad for the guy's family after watching this. Into the Wild is a long, bad, bloated, and ultimately disappointing movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Malfunction","review":"...bummer to say, that this DVD did not work in the Blu-Ray, DVD player or any laptop. I wanted to simply exchange it for one that works...but, it seems it can only be refunded. I want the movie I purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I should care about this brat because....","review":"I realize that this movie attempts to portray an actual life. And knowing the young man and the story (the half I was able to sit through) only through a lot of artistic license and speculation, I will reserve judgment on the real Chris McCandless. But the self-righteous, self-obsessed, grandiose brat portrayed on the screen is no one whom I could ever care about. I don't know what the basis is for medicalizing his lousy character and personality, but I'm not quick to buy into that sort of thing...not for people who are able to function in the normal world and relate normally to other people when and while it serves their interests. I guess maybe he wrote some real crazy-sounding stuff before he died, but anybody'd lose it a little in those circumstances. Going into the situation though, I just see a brat about whom I could not possibly have cared less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"This is just my opinion, a priviledged kid quite possibly suffers from a mental disorder, reads a book on wild berries and which ones will kill you after he makes and eats his all natural trail mix. Oh my gosh was this movie boring. I normally like documentaries or movies based on real life experiences but this was just long and boring. If you suffer from insomnia buy this movie but if not I would skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into the wild - yes please.","review":"This movie is both stunning, disturbing and entertaining. The visuals and scenery are often stunning, the transfer very good and sharp. The film, based on a real story, describes a young man's quest on discovering his place in the world - ultimately ending in tragedy. The movie left me feeling both uplifted and elated, by the stunning scenery and impeccable acting, and also disturbed by the descent in to a troubled youth's inner mayhem.The movie is very entertaining and raises many valid questions about the society we're living in. Well recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"a young man with a death wish","review":"Even though I thought this movie was great I still ended up angry at our main character for doing what he did to himself and his family.It was irresponsible and selfish. Perhaps he never intended to come out of this alive, expecting to either die from the elements or starvation.If he did go with the intention of it just being an adventure and to return to his home soon, then it only means he was a fool, not a hero:someone with no knowledge or sense of preparedness for life in the wild- reckless behavior, plain and simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting.","review":"This movie ended in a manner that I did not expect.

It was pretty long but it didn't seem like it was too long. We continued to talk about it even the next day. That is a sign of a good movie to me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Film of 2007","review":"Unfortunately the film was snubbed by the Academy, as well as the soundtrack. It's quite sad when they choose three songs from a movie Enchanged that were so badly written, and disregard the brilliance of Eddie Vedder. I think that this movie not even being acknowledged by the Academy is a disgrace to the movie industry. This film is mind blowing and really makes you contemplate life. No one will ever know the truth behind what happend to this young man, but Sean Penn does a brilliant job bringing his interpretation to the big screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"All thumbs up!","review":"The whole family agrees one of the best movie we have seen in a long time.

The imagery and music really hit home. If you have a love for the outdoors, or always wanted to, this movie will touch you, move you, and impact your life.

I can't believe the main character didn't jump on the jailbait when he had the chance. If he doesn't agree with society and society's laws then he must have not agree to the underage law of 18. He is a freaking hypocrite! I wanted to see some action not homosexual singing on the stage. What a fool! That poor girl. She must have felt like unwanted and ugly when she was rejected after throwing herself at him. He got what was coming to him at the end. Stupid idiot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiled rich brat celebrated in movie","review":"Give me a break - are we supposed to identify with this self-centered, inconsiderate kid who needs to \\"escape\\" from parents who want to buy him a car and send him to law school? If he hadn't been so self-absorbed and sure that he knew more than everyone else, maybe he would have realized how woefully unprepared he was for his little adventure. He obviously didn't care about anyone else, or the environment.The only thing this movie offered was great scenery."},{"rating":"1","title":"HD Review????????????????????","review":"Amazon, why are you allowing non HD DVD Reviews? This title will be released on March 4, 2008."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destructive and Self Involved","review":"This was an incredibly bad movie with a counterproductive message. It is an exercise in navel-gazing with a selfish destructive main character. Do not waste your time with this one. If you need a summary of the plot, it is the story of an individual with promise and potential who decides to throw his life away because he is so busy searching for \\"meaning\\" that he is unable to find the existing meaning around him. In the end it did not matter because the search costs him his life. I am just upset that I cannot get back the portion of my life wasted on watching this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing lots of potential but unrealized","review":"The main character had lots of potential and the promise of that \\"ah ha\\" moment or awakening kept me watching this movie. But in the end he was not particularly enlightened nor achieved any enlightenment. Bottom line this was a person who searched for meaning and in the end only realized that food and health were fundamental. Most of us already know that. I was watching for a bit more. I do not recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"An adventure which invites you to re-examine who you are","review":"My husband has read several books by Jon Krakauer, including the one this was based on, and I have great admiration for Sean Penn, so this was an enjoyable movie for us. My husband felt the screenplay was very true to the book. For anyone who has ever become disillusioned with society at any time in their life, for whatever reason, and considers heading out to find real meaning in the wilderness, this movie rings true. But it also shows that even with luck and decent skills, at some point, nature can teach harsh lessons. The scenery is gorgeous, and the actors' performances excellent. It doesn't answer any questions; rather, it presents the story and leaves the interpretations for you to think through. A keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into the Wild","review":"I loaned my original copy to my dentist who took a cruise to Alaska last year and saw where McCandless was stranded. This is a replacement copy that I will be using in my classroom as part of our Transcendentalist Unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"No man is an island...","review":"This is the best and most underappreciated film of 2007. I suspect that come oscar time it will garner an award or two, possibly Best Director for Sean Penn and Best Supporting Actor for Hal Holbrook. I'm not holding my breath for Best Picture however as it's ultimately a bit too bleak and the main character too unconventional to be an easy sell to the Oscar crowd. I absolutely loved everything about Into the Wild, most especially Emile Hirsch as Christopher McCandless who is amazing in his most impressive and challenging role to date. It is very true to the book and whether you feel it is the sad chronicle of a misguided youth or the ecstatic tale of one guys search for ultimate freedom, one couldn't ask for a more perfect adaptation. One is left regretful that McCandless only realized his epiphany too late...\\"Happiness is only real when shared.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"This was a decent outdoor movie!

Great soundtrack as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of \\"Into The Wild\\" DVD","review":"The \\"Into the Wild\\" DVD is done in a almost continous flash back format. It is very hard to put the young mans life story together unless you have read the book. The book is excellent. I recommend reading the book and not watching the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Into the Idiocy","review":"A film made of rubbish. Let me sum it up: *chris* excuse me, \\"Alex\\" embarks on an eye opening enlightened \\"journey\\" to Alaska. Roll the Eddie Vedder music. *Chris articulates a profound cliched point* for instance, the dialogue between Chris and Mr Franz: \\"Mr Franz when you want something in life you gotta reach out and grab it\\". Really Chris? So it breaks into more Eddie Vedder music and then he eventually dies. I love how he thought society was such a bad place with all the LIFE experience he had. I mean he just graduated college but he knows about the trials and tribulations of what it means to live a life and function in society. Also, how selfish was he by not calling his parents - ok if not his parents, perhaps his sister, who it was obvious they were pretty close with each other. Speaking of his sister, she was how old? 15-16? She was spouting out some pretty advanced vocabulary for someone her age. This movie tried extremely hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"The movie keeps you interested the whole time, lots of very good scenes. Great actors, great story, great message. Don't miss this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a heart wrenching story!","review":"I was really hoping he would get out of there. That was a lot to take in. I can not believe someone went through that much pain and just rawness of life. The movie was wonderfully made, with the cast being so perfect for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul searching journey","review":"We might not all agree with the paths taken, but nobody could say that this guy did not try to forge his own path to see where it could take him. It makes me so sad that he passed so senselessly, when we are in such a technological world he was just a few miles from help and medical knowledge that could have saved him. I have a feeling he is very happy on the other side however, still carving a path somewhere beyond. Sountrack is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice...but sad ending","review":"I am a fan of Jon Krakauer works. So I had to see this movie when it came out. In some ways I am happy Christopher lived life on his own terms. It takes a lot of guts and determination to do what he did. But in the end I am sad he died."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, but WHERE'S THE COMMENTARY?!? Maybe on the Blu-ray edition...","review":"I'll let you peruse the movie plot through other reviewers.I recall when I saw this classic in the theater thinking: \\"Wow...can't wait for the commentary on this!\\"When I rented what I believe is the single disc version of the movie from Netflix, no commentary...and it doesn't look like it's on this special edition either. That's a total gyp.Maybe I'm being overly critical here, but this is one of those movies THAT COMMENTARY WAS CREATED FOR. It's the PERFECT movie for it... It's dying for it!!!I'm going to wait for it to be available on Blu-ray, which I think is worth the wait with the scenery of Alaska and all.Then perhaps they'll wake up and grace us with the presence of Sean Penn's (or someone's) commentary to enhance the story of our character Mr. Supertramp!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The end result of impractical idealism","review":"*alert* Filled with spoiler potential *alert*Portions of Into the Wild were beautiful. The natural landscapes and odd characters were often compelling. However, the end of the movie was ruinous and unappealing. Into the Wild is not a story of hope, transcendence, or overcoming. It is, instead, a story of failure.I'm sure many viewers will be able to relate to the main character's need to explore himself and the world around him. Emile Hirsch plays Chris McCandless very well. However, I question the logic of glorifying a life filled with what I consider bad choices. Perhaps there is a lesson to be learned here. I will let you the viewer decide for yourself. Be aware before you decide to spend a few hours with this movie that there is no fairy tale ending.Nature can be cruel and Alaska is wild. McCandless saw, heard, felt and tasted things many of us will never experience. Is that admirable? Decide for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful.","review":"I'd just like to start off this review by saying that no life is insignificant and while it's perfectly fine to disagree with the way someone lives their life, no one has the right nor the authority to deem someone a \\"waste\\". Everyone has a right to their opinion but there's this little thing called tact that people seem to forget every now and then.This movie was amazing. I can't really find the words to describe how it made me feel and the immediate connection I had to this boy. I don't think he was a spoiled brat at all, I think he was so desperate to find himself that he was willing to go bush in order to do it. How many people can say they abandoned their lives in pursuit of adventure and how many people secretly want to but will never find the courage to do so? I don't know if I will ever find the courage to and I'm not sure if I would go about it the way he did but I admire him for his bravery. I think he did a beautiful thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Film","review":"I find nothing admirable or inspiring about a young man who tries to live off the land with no hunting skills and can't even live in the woods for 6 months.

Alaska Railroad, BNSF, and Union Pacific;-- Roger Miller's \\"King of Road\\".You think, I didn't get the gist of the movie? On a big theater screen you can't miss it -- the story of a dumbass -- Alaska has seen enough of them, with or without diaries. That it was a true story doesn't make it any better.

Anyone who prepares to live in the wilds of Alaska with just a floral and fauna book is kidding themselves. I expected more of the Alaska portion of the story.

I didn't make it through the first half hour. I just didn't feel anything for the main character or his family. A college graduate gives away his unearned college fund and abandons the life his parents gave him. Whoop de doo. He became homeless by choice. I live in San Francisco and I see it everyday, homeless by choice. For me it is not a revelation. i just couldn't see myself watching this guy try to find himself for two hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry - really great but sick","review":"Hey, the film had wonderful AK scenery (how could it not) and it had several pretty good actors (Chris wasn't one) but in the final analysis - it was a really well crafted travelogue film about a kid who was mentally ill, and the end result is quite unappealing.

Follow the wonderful adventure of an idealistic young man as he grapples with the truth behind modern life and unversal values.An original thinker he rejects the tradtional mould to make up his own mind about the meaning of existence. Either bravely or foolishly wandering America.Allows us each to make our own value judgements about important issues which touch all our lives such as we follow his travels. Ultimately comming to conclusions about the value of people and relationships in our lives. A great film for the adolescent.Tragic and moving. Great acting. Excellently filmed and delicately handled by the filmaker.This work both believable and inspiring..Best regards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect movie","review":"I'm sure you're wondering why I gave this 4 stars if I consider the movie to be perfect? The thing is, this is the most inspiring movie of all time (in my opinion) and the acting is flawless, but there could have been more special features on the second disc. I think what they have is great, but it left me wanting more instead of being fully satisfied. Perhaps adding a commentary to the film with Emile Hirsch and Sean Penn and Jon Krakauer, and on the second disc have interviews with the real people that Chris came across. The second disc contains an inside look to the characters and making of the film. Other than lacking special features to the film, I highly suggest picking up the movie, book, and soundtrack. All are fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Loved the movie! Good audio and sound quality, and it also loaded very quickly. Great movie too, very good rent"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, taken with a grain of salt","review":"\\"Into the Wild\\", based on a true story, is a fine film with some fundamental flaws. Christopher Johnson McCandless, leaves a comfortable environment to live on his own and to seek his own destiny. He wanders through South Dakota, Arizona and California before eventually finding Alaska, where everything changes.Sean Penn's film is often heart-wrenching but it dwells too much on platitudes. Added to that, Christopher seems unusually too well-equipped for the realties of the harsh life portrayed. He gets into some scrapes, mischief and trouble but often comes out looking better than he has any right to do. That said, \\"Into the Wild\\" is worth viewing for one main reason...the gratifying performance of Emile Hirsch. This young actor is terrific and keeps the viewer's eye on him all the time. I can't think of another actor who is better suited for this role and I recommend \\"Into the Wild\\" for this performance alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nicely done","review":"Based on a true story and can tell.

Regardless of your views on society, politics, and whatnot.That being said, it's a well-told coming of age story that tracts through the areas of family, loneliness, and, above all, freedom. The term freedom itself has become quite muddled with propaganda that this type of freedom is as refreshing as the open lands of Alaska. This beautiful extent of freedom is portrayed from every angle ranging from pure optimism to the coldest of misery.The movie is supremely acted and well thought out. It may get a bit slow in the middle, and the multiple stories itself can become a bit confusing with the extent of the overlapping, but overall it is a laid-back story of a kid breaking away and embracing his own plan; no matter what."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Into the Wild'..video issues...","review":"The movie was great, but, the video was not.

The trailer looked interesting. What I saw in the trailer matched what I saw in all but the end of the film. In order to not spoil it for those who haven't seen this film or who haven't read any reviews that give away the ending, my comments center on only one thing. With all of the lead character's experiences of living on the road, his ability to survive in the wild for several weeks, and his apparent intelligence, why would he look at a swollen, fast-moving river in his path back to civilization as an impassable obstacle? Did the writer(s) of the screenplay leave out some important things from this movie about the end of the story? If not, then this one issue caused me to feel like I wasted 2-1/2 hours.With so many 5-star reviews, it's apparent that many people liked this film. My only advice is to be prepared for disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"He didn't know what he was doing","review":"I couldn't get into the movie, it's a historical thing so yes he dies and I knew that before watching the movie. The guy didn't know what he was doing \\"Striking out on his own.\\" He had a book of plants and thought he could survive in Alaska. Yeah tell that to the natives who spent thousands of years perfecting thier Alaskian existance. OK so he wants to get away from civilation for various reasons. So do many of us, but we have common sense not to strike out alone in the Alaskian wilderness. He's lucky he found that bus or he would have died much, much sooner.

Even though I knew it was coming, it really got me down. That said, the film was worth seeing.The acting in this film was of very high quality. William Hurt played such an ass that you really understood why his son wanted to find a different path. I don't often like the characters Catherine Keener plays, but she really impressed me in this film. While I am just mentioning these two, the rest of the cast was equally good.Finally, all the visuals in Into the Wild were beautiful--not just the Alaskan wilderness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Prepared Enough","review":"Purchased this for my son as a gift.

Here is a true story about an individual who doesnt live by society, who doesnt need material posesions, a true poet with a passion for nature and life. Unfortunately he died, but in his short life he lived more than most of us. Critics who made fun of his death need to be careful what they say for they don't know how their end will come. Not that any one will notice.

I hated this movie and thought it wasn't artistic or had an good moral. The kid despises society and burns all of his money just to end up working at McDonalds to get enough money to go to Alaska to die. I felt bad for his family. Too bad they had such a runt as a kid. Don't glorify him people, he did nothing noble or worthy, just forgot to take his ADHD meds."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Swing and a Miss...","review":"Although I was not familiar with the story, I was REALLY wanting to see this movie. However, the story never lived up to my anticipation. Try as it does to present meaning to the tragic upper middle class American society that Sean Penn loves to hate, the movie comes off as an attempt to portray a spoiled, self-centered \\"victim\\" as a liberating messiah. In the film everything he touches is turned to gold. But yet, he remains a unfulfilled, self-absorbed uber-brat. Yeah, we all hate our parents at time throughout our lives, I get it. But to this extent?The message of the movie is simply this: focus all attention of your life on your own fulfillment (or lack of). In the end, this will somehow give you a satisfying, albeit, unplanned death. But the soundtrack was good. Save your money on this one. Better yet, try to find Farley Mowat's Never Cry Wolf."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I like how the \\"armchair quarterbacks\\" have passed judgement on Mr. Krakaur and Mr. McCandless. I highly doubt any of them have done anything that could even be remotely close to being outside their comfort zone, let alone their livingrooms. Chris McCandless walked out of society and didn't look back. I challenge any of the \\"Pillars of Virtue\\" to do that. Until you have walked a mile in those shoes...please just close your faces. You have no room to judge or speak out against the author or protagonist.

If I raised kids like these two I'd be really depressed-I kept thinking as I watched and listened to these two spoiled brats---how would they like to be born into poverty-and have no help at all and have to fight and claw their way up and out of poverty. This is a good example of what happens when you give kids too much; they appreciate nothing. The main character is so self righteous....so preachy -and like he knows anything? The only good thing about the movie was the scenery-it's pretty---but the movie stinks and the characters are all a bunch of self absorbed nit-wits. Bleeechhh....I hope they all go into the wild and ...stay there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sean Penn wants us to celebrate the individualism and courage of a mean-spirited, cruel, selfish kid.","review":"The main character is totally unlikable because he is so judgmental and cruel to others. Going out on his own is not enough, he needs to hurt and condemn others as he does so. The movie tries to make us feel sorry for him because he is the result of the world he was brought up in. Didn't work for me! He is as much a creator of that world as the result of it. To quote a John Hiatt song \\"You only see the world you make.\\" Finally, as portrayed in the movie, his escapades before he arrives in Alaska are unbelievable; \\"Hancock\\" made a better super-hero. I am going to go read the book to see what really happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078","review":"It was critically acclaimed, full of stars, and Academy nominated, but Into The Wild wasn't for me. The film is based on the true story of Christopher McCandless, a young man in search of true freedom. A recent college graduate, inspired by naturalist literature, McCandless decided to travel to Alaska and live off the land. The film follows his journey, from college graduation and is an amazing story. Emile Hirsch gives an unbelievable performance as McCandless but was snubbed by the Academy. I suspect it was for the same reason I didn't like the film, it is unbelievably slow. The story and cast are amazing, but everything is so sedentary and precise, that you can barely sit through the thing! Some three hour plus films, don't feel anywhere near that long, that's how you know they're great. On the other hand, Into The Wild easily feels much longer than three hours and unfortunately doesn't do the story justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"sloooooooooow!","review":"this movie was not my fav. way too slow. be prepared for a long movie.

He engaged in foolishness and took foolish risks because he knew he could go back to his parents for help, and especially if things turned-out badly.Overall, I enjoyed the movie, and McCandless is a likeable character.

It brings a beautiful and in-depth look into the mind of a young man not sure what he wants to do with is life, but pretty sure what he doesn't want. I thought it was phenomenal especially if you wonder if the grass is greener on this other side of untamed life.

It is definitely worth seeing, but very sad. Emory is full of some very smart and very privileged young men and women. I think this boy confused rejecting consumerism with rejecting people in general. He tries to make his life meaningful by turning his back on his family and materialism. His search for meaning is tragic and very hurtful to his family because they really love him and never know what is happening with him. I believe that the ultimate meaning in our lives can only be found through love and connection. His failure to really connect with self love and love for others is what ultimately killed him.

His dialogue and writing style are getting better, but there is the occassional clunker. (Why do the bad guys always have to sleep with their female subordinates?)

But the Capellan Solution series has been a huge disappointment in general and Dagger Point a waste of Tom Gressman's writing in particular. The plot makes no sense given the history of the ELH, the cameos by Victor and Theodore are very much out of character and the whole Vietnam thing was done better in Ideal War (although it stunk then too). I was hoping this book would turn this sub-series around...

It was more like 1 on 1 fights between individual 'mechs. I would expect that more from a BT book about the clans than the inner sphere.Second the story didn't make much sense. It never explained WHY the STAR LEAGUE would send troops to fight against a Star League member state. If they were put there as a warning to Sun Tzu, and then an 'incedent' caused them to intervene, fine, but the Light Horse went in shooting.Alot of different things in the story didn't make sense.

But Texier's own unselfawareness, her own unwillingness to really be self critical beyond a few scattered moments, her inability to get beyond the sarcastic and repeated question, \\"what did I do to you,\\" point up the difference between life and art. Texier confuses sex and love, and thinks that she can bind this man to her continually, even though he explains that he doesn't love her anymore, by passionate and wild sex, and then asks in a condescending and obviously insincere way, \\"so what did I do wrong?\\" This memoir demonstrates the narcissistic self-obsession that probably caused the relationship to collapse in the first place. It gets two stars because it generates a sort of voyeuristic sex based need to keep on reading, almost against one's will."},{"rating":"1","title":"He said, She said.","review":"I was very disappointed in this book, despite the numerous rave reviews.

I did, however, finish it before I threw it away so I gave it two stars for providing some interest. There was definitely some raw emotion displayed in the book but the writing was disjointed. The format was distracting and in the end, it is simply a sad relationship disintegrating. There seem to be no other players, the children take a back seat to the 'adults'. I feel sorry for them--not only did they lose their family but the whole ugly mess was laid out as a meager feast for bored readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this what American publishing has come down to?","review":"Yes, this book is painful--and I mean painfully bad.

Skip this one for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"POIGNANT!","review":"The author did an excellent job of making you feel every emotion that she went through during the breakup of her marriage.

Except for the cover photo, a half page list of Blenko colors by years, several photos added, mostly from one particular collector, and an updated price list (arbitrary and useless in many respects, because collectors don't really pay much attention it) the book remains the same. If you have the first edition, my advise is not to waste your money on this one.I was disappointed when I realized the publishing house just used the same document of the first edition, and just replaced several photos. The writer and editors should have used better photos and a more modern page design, and also include photos from several collectors, not just one. A complete revision would have been a worthy endeavor. Unfortunately, the editors chose the easy way out, and the results are clearly mediocre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blenko Book","review":"Got this as a gift for my wife after visiting the Blenko company.

If you read \\"Sanctuary\\", you'll be effectively getting the same story, plus a much higher level of writing, plus an introduction to one of the great writers of the past century. So don't waste your time on this thing.Chase was a serial plagiarist, and also made a play at copying \\"The Big Sleep\\". Chandler, faster off the mark than Faulkner, hit him with a lawsuit and forced the book off the market. So you won't find that one on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been a Cagney movie","review":"I had never heard of the story until the movie based on the book ran on TCM in the early hours of the morning. I didn't watch it, but decided I had to have the book.Very film noir feel to the story. If I didn't know better, I'd think Cagney's White Heat character was based on Chase's \\"Slim\\". The same \\"Top of the World, Ma\\", coupled with amoral sadistic behavior.At first it was a little hard to change gears in the writer's POV, from the hoods to the detective, but once you figure it out, it is a very nice read."},{"rating":"2","title":"1950s here we come!","review":"This was a fun book.

Not all of the tracks are winners, however: \\"Crystal Ball\\" is dub that doesn't quite sound right; for a better dub track, check out the darkly humorous \\"Snipers,\\" instead. Hardway also embraces more vocals too: witness the contrapuntal falsetto and tenor on \\"Choco Blanco\\" or the happy-go-lucky sier on \\"Sunshine Moonshine.\\" An interesting change of direction from a varied and talented artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside a hit man","review":"David Fleisher is a professional, dealing, as he puts it, with the same commodity as doctors and midwives, but at the other end. He is hired to remove an inconvience and proceeds to organize to complete the assignment.Told in first person, most of the novel depicts his methodical approach to service delivery, with flashbacks illuminating his early days in the profession. This hit is complicated by the fact that he knows the victim, in fact the victim was his early montor, not that a professional would be deterred by that fact.After all prepartion is complete, Fleisher meets his victim, on Christmas Eve as it turns out, but then, (of course) complications arise, leading to two or three surprising turns before the ultimate conclusion.John Wainwright was a prolific British author in the 1960s and 1970s (and perhaps later). His writing style is not taut, but interest in the prime character and in some secondary characters is maintained.

On \\"Stepping Stone\\" (5) she talks about a woman who is continuously verbally abused by her man but she keeps taking it until she finally has gained enough \\"strength to carry on.\\" The music is all top notch with a band playing some blues, some jazz, and a little bit of funk. Her voice is very cool but I don't think that she has the pipes of some singers but this is ok cause what she does with her voice works perfectly well and leaves very little to be desired.

The album produced two huge hits with \\"Come Sail Away\\" and \\"Fooling yourself\\" both of which can be regularly heard on classic rock radio today on a regular basis. Several other tracks received album rock airplay as well. The album contains all of the varied elements that made Styx what they were. You have Pomp Rock with \\"The Grand Illusion\\", and \\"Superstars\\", progressive rock with \\"Man In The Wilderness\\" and one of Dennis Deyoung's best compositions \\"Castle Walls\\", and Hard Rock / Metal with the James Young staple \\"Miss America\\".

However, I strongly recommend purchasing the book as part of the set that has four audio cassettes. The tapes will teach you correct pronunciation and help you more with retention. The book covers basic grammar, has fun illustrations, and puzzles. Fun for all ages"},{"rating":"2","title":"DIAMONDS","review":"I bought it because it said Daft Punk was involved in this album. Regardless, after the first song, I was hooked. What a great album. I can hear a bit of Daft Punk in the driving drum rhythms and the influence of eighties synth pop. Benjamin sounds like early Peter Murphy or the lead singer of the Call and at times like early Bono. Great song craft. Worth paying the import price."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow! the amazing album with the diversification!","review":"i feel strange why there's no one writin' any review about this fabulous album? first i didn't expect much of it, i just thought it a cd pleasing to the ear, but after listenin' it over and over, i found it really a great one full of various music types, and ben's voice brings people into different moods. i appreciate his talent highly, and undoubtedly i like the way he writes the lyrics, direct and revealing. this's definitely an album worth listenin'!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"This is definitly not the typical album, great mixture of vocals from up beat to slow jams.

The vanity came packaged very well with no damage. Although it came in many smaller boxes, it went together perfectly in less than 30 minutes! My wife loves it and it's a great match to the rest of the furniture in our bedroom. Thanks for a great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviews were right on","review":"This vanity was everything the reviews said it would be. It is made of real word, it is attractive and sturdy. The instructions were right on, it was packed very neatly and tightly and it took just half an hour to put together and that's because I took my time. I purchased this for my soon to be 14 year old daughter and I anticipate this will be a piece of furniture that will last her...she might even be able to pass it on to her daughter as long as she takes good care of it. It was an excellent buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy!","review":"I just bought this for my Fiance's birthday. It was one of the best packed item that I have ever received. It took me longer to unpack it than it did to put together. All parts were packed woth bubble wrap and then in small boxes. I was able to put it together in about 45 minutes. All the parts went together well and everything was aligned and well crafted.For the price this vanity is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice vanity set - but smelled out of the box","review":"This is a nice vanity set for the price. It had a bad odor though when first taken out of the box. We had to air it out for a few days before putting it in my daughter's room. It went together pretty easily.

However, it doesn't matter as the picture quality is simply atrocious. Obviously straight from VHS and pan&scan. The French DVD is widescreen and light years ahead in quality; unfortunately it only has French audio, is out of print and very hard to find second hand. Great movie, afwul US DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last","review":"I looked forward to using this product. It seemed to work well, while sitting. It does not protect you outside or while walking as it will not displace any wind bourne allergens. My major problem is the warrantee.

Looking for other alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I was so excited at the prospect of receiving a product that was going to allow me to be able to sit in meetings where perfume smells, and other odors had always kept me from attending. I had a friend who had used this product and was very happy. My problem with the product that I would like to pass on is the fact I am senistive to whatever is used in the product. As soon as I had it around my neck and switched on the air freshener my throat started to hurt and I had a problem breathing.

I was intrigued by what seemed to be something different in this book, however, and picked it up just last week. I must say, it is very good. The author's approach is unique, fresh, and an enjoyable read.But I was blown away by the CD. Most book CDs are fairly predictable and less than interesting, much less valuable. Not so with this one though. Instead, George Anderson has included some very compelling documents, excellent (though sometimes too simple) spreadsheets, and 2 very nice project plans, among other excellent objects like pictures, powerpoint files, and more.

What else can I say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not how I imagined it would work.","review":"The product quality is great, and worth the money. The reason I rated 2 stars is because in actual use, having a guitar strap hanging off the neck by the tuning machines is not so ideal. The strap gets in the way of your hand when you fret on the 1st and 2nd. I ended up having a luthier mount a button on my guitar and it works much better. I didn't want to put a hole in the guitar but it ended up being the best choice, I just hope one day I wont regret it by having the wood split."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds guitar well","review":"This little thing does it's job. Two separate pieces, one loops around the headstock, one around the strap, then they've got a little plastic clippy that latches the two together. No tying, quick and easy to connect or disconnect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Convenient","review":"I bought the Quick-Release System with my new guitar on the advice of the salesman. I didn't want to alter the heel by drilling it. The biggest like I have for it is the ease of removing my strap when putting the guitar in it's case. It is a quick, convenient, and inexpensive solution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than laces","review":"First let me say I'm an absolute beginner, so take my word with a grain of salt. When I bought my Yamaha guitar and asked the salesman where the other end of the strap goes, I was surprised when he said you tie it to the headstock with laces. Just sounds pretty shoddy and undependable. This item is so much better than trusting your knots. Easy to install and remove, and seems very sturdy. I haven't had much use for it yet, but I'm glad I have it available. I've been impressed with everything I've bought from Planet Waves."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Bought 2 More","review":"THIS, Is a GREAT thing to have.

The one Amazon actually sent is rounded to the right (see this link: Mouse Wristrest Pillow, 7-7/8\\"x10-7/8\\"x7/8\\", Black (KMW57822).) Notice the model number on the rectangular mouse pad and on the rounded mouse pad: they're both 57822. That's a tell-tale sign that Amazon mislabeled the rectangular mouse pad with the model number of the rounded one.As long as the rectangular Kensington mouse pad is labeled with 57822, don't buy it, or you won't get what you expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silicone Gun Cloth","review":"I purchased this silicone cloth in order to wipe down handguns. Many years ago I purchased a similar product and it was finally time to replace it. The Outers Silicone Gun & Reel cloth are a superb buy for the money. The cloths are soft and will not scratch the surface you are using them on. They have a pleasant silicone smell and do exactly what they are prescribed to do....remove oils; fingerprints; and, dirt leaving no residue. The silicone contained in the cloth will protect the metal surface of your handgun. The 17 x 17 size is standard. In reviewing the various products on the market, I found these cloths to be the best buy for the money. I bought several of them.They are easily foldable and can easily be carried in your range bag. I carry one in a resealable plastic sandwich bag. It's there when you need it and will last for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Great","review":"Received this product only to find that it is not very loaded with silicone oil. It is much dryer feeling than another maker's silicone cloth that I have continued to use for several years. I would not buy this product again. In fairness, I could have received an older cloth, but seeing as how it's sealed in a plastic bag, it's hard to imagine why it feels so dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really dry","review":"For oiler cloths these were incredibly dry and seemed a bit old even.

I received mine in the mail today and it's currently sitting in my trash can. I realize you get what you pay for ..., but this was ridiculous in my opinion. The medium and thick slices were the same thickness and the julienne simply did not work. I was surprised by how flimsy this product was: I was afraid I was going to break it when I changed out the attachments! I'm not a master chef, but I believe my kitchen items should at least do what is promised.

Jean Pike *****Reviewer: Cindy Williams Newsome, Author, HobbstownPublishedAuthors.net/LwnewsomeAuthor, Jean Pike, has written a tantalizing novel that will hook the reader with the intrigue that begins in chapter 1 with the main character Angel. When Angel comes to Littlebrook, the town is never quite the same. Each character is well-developed and the plot thickens with each chapter. Ms. Pike takes the reader back to a time of innocence, small-town secrets, love, hate, redemption, and the ultimate love story. The author's skill in describing events, places, and people will enhance the reader's ability to understand the drama that unfolds.

Same learning program but professionaly done."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Advertisement for their Greek Text","review":"I bought this book many years ago and read it through. I was quite disappointed by the treatment of textual criticism given. The book reads like an advertisement for the critical texts that they have put out. It did not provide solid scholarly arguments to support their choice of manuscripts and methodology in making their textual evaluations. Many papyri are listed and classified according to their accuracy but no explanation or justification for the supposed authority of these texts are supplied - apparantly you're just supposed to believe the Alands and not question it any further. This book left me the impression that modern critical textual scholarship is an arbitrary and subjective endeavor lacking firm, testable scientific premises and is driven rather by personal preference and prejudice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually a pretty good flick!","review":"Even though this is an older movie and had to get it on VHS I still enjoyed it.It even had Ryan Black playing the young Geronimo in the first part of it. Lot's of action and a good cast. I love Michael Greyeyes who played Juh. This guy has sooo much potential as an actor. Have seen him in a few other things. The actor playing Geronimo did a good job too. And Jimmy Herman playing the OLD Geronimo was excellent too. Whether this is ALL historically correct or not I am not sure. It does give a glimpse into the younger years of this period of Geronimo's life.I think much has been INCORRECTLY printed and filmed about this man. It's definitely worth the viewing if you are a fan of Geronimo or that period in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient.

The rings have stayed locked and held up through years of use. The front and back covers are extra long so nothing hangs out the side. The curved back looks sharp when lined up on a shelf with others like it, but can be slightly difficult to insert paper labels in. The rings are strong, don't bend easy, and stay locked even with 8 pounds of paper product on them. (5 inch binder holds 8+ pounds) The rings are also easy to open with a push button tab at the bottom.The cover length and curve out of the spine will very with the ring size, so if you want a lot of these binders to have a uniform appearance on a shelf, the ring size should only vary by a half inch.

I am listening to my CD via PC speaker auxilery hook up now!(because I HATE media players!) If you like great music you can't not like this! It has the incredible beats of percussion and drums and the screaching(mid range) voice of James Yong and the elvan sounding Denis De'Yong. Let's not forget Young's hard mid sounds on gitar and Shaw's masterful leads. IF you want to be uplifted(or go sailing) this is the music to listen too!

Unfortunately, Pieces of 8 is merely a repeat of Grand Illusion. No new musical direction is advanced here.

Whilst the 2nd version is ok, it goes too far beyond chili, I mean you have typed CHILI into the search engine and looked up this particular book right? The 2nd edition has too many supplementary things when all you need as a side for chili is rice, chopped onions/tomatoes and a nice cold drink.I really enjoy this book as it is simple and whilst slow, a great winter warmer. And everything tastes nicer the next day so keep that in moind when making a big batch! i have the 1st ed which only has the chili recipes and nothing else, its a nice small softcover book which takes up not much room and gives me chili and nothing else.

Very thought provoking but with a great storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Shop of Horrors Meets Charlie Brown's Christmas","review":"I just can't share the other reviewers' enthusiasm for this, the second volume of Colin Wilson's four volume Spider World trilogy (yes, that's what I said). There are hardly spiders in it at all--a bit at the beginning, and a bit at the end. In between, it is a story of our hearty band of adventurers going forth into a bizarre wilderness of evolution run riot, to face down a monster killer plant from outer space, only to find out that like Charlie Brown's Christmas tree, all it needs is a little love. While the outward journey itself is rather interesting, the two climaxes are entirely anticlimactic. The book closes with our plucky hero facing down the Death Lord himself, only to be saved by the Deusest of Deus Ex Machinas. I was disappointed. But not nearly as disappointed as I am by the final book of the series. There is a world of much better storytelling out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brand new idea in rock music","review":"STYX' second album features a new guitarist/ vocalist in Tommy Shaw.

It seems like alot of people don't really care for it but totally check that one out I love the way Dennis opens it with his vocals. And the title track Crysatl Ball is great too.

If you're in the mood for depressing, slow, melancholy, atmospheric, quiet stuff, this is a good album. Only problem is you're not allowed to wallow in it for long, because it ends way too soon. The first time I listened to it I left the room for a few minutes during track 6, came back expecting to catch the last couple songs, and it was already over. Still, I would recommend this CD if you ever like listening to artists like Mazzy Star and Trespassers William, though this is a bit more sparsely produced. If you find those artists unbelievably dull and drawn out, you probably won't like this. However, I do like those artists and I do like some miserably moody music, so I enjoy it.

If you have a dual mass flywheel don't attempt to turn it, replace it or you will just be ripping the motor out again to replace the flywheel. Price a stock dual mass flywheel (DMF) and you'll see why you need this conversion kit; unless your made of money as DMF costs over $1K by itself. Don't waste you money.

The book is deceptive because it starts out as a murder and you expect to witness the ghost inflict revenge in some cunning fashion. No such excitement.

It's supposed to be somewhat of an homage to the horror genre, as the book is dedicated to various scary authors, but it fails utter at being even remotely scary. The plot plods and is confusing, there is absolutely no suspense, and the ending is confusing and leaves one wondering what happened in the book. I am actually surprised this book was allowed to be published. Bear tries certain tricks--one of which is to write something, and then have a line in italics, as if that line is supposed to bring home the horror or the creepiness or whatever. But Bear fails laughably at this. He writes something, and then, as if he's just counting the lines between italicized lines, he'll put a line in with italics. Bear has written a scary book before--Psychlone--but I don't what he was thinking here.

It was a waste of my time and money, though I've read everything Greg Bear has written and will continue to do so hoping for a return of the storytelling skill he showed in his early works.

For one, being a electrical, computer, and biomedical engineering double major (electrical and computer fall under one major at this university) along with mathematics as a third major, I would have greatly appreciated if more examples were placed in the book. Don't get me wrong, the examples provide the reader with a good idea of how the built-in functions (that are so useful) work, but there still needs to be more and I think exercises (like in Chapra's and Palm's books on using MATLAB with engineering applications) would go a long way into strengthing the quality and usefulness of this book.

It is how you store your Matlab expertise, so to speak.The chapter on matrix algebra shows powerful tools for matrix manipulations. Useful for many types of linear systems analysis.Now, you can even tie Matlab into actual programming languages. From a C or Fortran program, you can invoke Matlab, and vice versa.

This book did not serve its price for couple reasons. First, the index is poor. Too many of the fundamental concepts are not included here. The examples are poor and insufficient also. These are my personal opinions, but almost everyone in my class agreed with me. My professor recommended us to have some kind of reference book on computer programming for the future use, but I sold this book because I knew it will not help me, and I wanted my money back badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like the Help button better.","review":"Not only is the on-line Matlab help better, its free.

I've read many of them, they are easy reads and so informative. It is really helpful to learn about other's experiences and struggles, and to hear advice on how to help you now. My favorite part of this book is the chapter called \\"So, you love an ACoA...\\" and is good for your partner to read to help them understand things like why you might overreact to certain situations or have such a negative view of yourself. Don't be turned off by the old cover, mine looked like it was from 1960 or something, the book is not outdated by any means."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for those from dysfunctional homes","review":"This is an absolute wonderful book. It is must read for those who have come from any kind of dysfunctional home. If you find that you are successful in the world but you may find your personal life, your relationships in the pits, then take time to read this book. You would realise why is your life such a mess up. Happy reading"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandatory!","review":"If you are an ACOA or need to understand one, you have got to read this one. At first I thought it would somewhat different, but it deals with basic information I needed to become aware anyway. I am reading all books related to ACOAs and dysfunctional families and this one is among the best. It presents a lot of common myths ACOAs have and aren't aware there are other possibilities. For example: \\"If I am not in control at all times, there will be anarchy\\". Then the myth is discussed in a few pages. Quite shocking for someone who sees life in an inflexible way. I would strongly suggest \\"The Secrets of Dysfunctional Families\\" ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book may not change your life, but it changed mine.","review":"I spent years of my life not understanding why I could never successfully take a relationship \\"to the next level\\". It drove my self esteem so low that at one point I was seriously considering suicide. I came upon this book, and suddenly I understood why I had so many failed relationships and just was overall unhappy with life. It does not have all the answers, but shows you the way to a place where you can find them if you want to and are ready. If you grew up in an abusive family, I believe you must read this book.

Then the story began to take hold. By the time I was into the second madman's story, I was hooked. If you like metaphysical voyages, like Banks' The Bridge or some of Borges' more accessible works, you will like this. If you like your Buddhism warmed over slightly, again, you'll enjoy this.I did, but I like dream-like voyages.

So, if you haven't lived in Russia, many things won't make sense. (But then, many things wouldn't make sense either way.)

It boasts of being able to sew through three layers of denim, but I haven't tried that yet. I did make a pair of pajama pants out of a tricky thin, slightly stretchy satin, and it worked impeccably. The auto-tension adjustment is a piece of cake and the different stitches work very well. As a beginning sewer, this machine meets all my needs. The slipcover that came with it is very nice as well - no huge case needed to keep it free of dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a good machine","review":"I am mystified by the 4 and 5 star ratings this machine has received. I myself have had nothing but problems. I followed instructions and used only singer needles/bobbins. I have spent more time replacing needles, re-threading and fixing tangled-up bobbins than I have spent actually sewing. I finally gave up and purchased a Brother machine that works beautifully. Customer support at Singer was not helpful--tended to blame problems on user error. This I can accept, but I truly believe I have done everything right and that this machine is just a stinker. A shame, Singer used to have a great name and now I will never buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product","review":"I purchased this machine last year on a thanksgiving sale.

Singer has made a compromise on its quality parts these daysP"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give it ZERO stars!","review":"I have owned the machine for over a year now. I am sure than anyone who gave this machine more than 1 star didn't own it long enough to figure out how sucky it really is. The first thing is that the manual isn't very good. I think they were afraid of text because descriptions are short and lacking detail. The second complaint I have is a common one for this machine: it jams up all the time! I spend more time screwing with the tension and re-threading than sewing. It is so frustrating! I had to take it to a professional to fix it once and it is broken again. It isn't worth it for me to keep fixing this headache of a machine! Trust me on this one, spend some extra money and get a better machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, I'm taking it back tomorrow.","review":"I found this machine to be finicky. It is a fairly quiet but it jams up for no reason. It will sew straight lines one moment and the next you wont be able to sew three inches without it jamming up.

This is NOT your mother's Singer. It jams for no apparent reason, snaps the thread every 3 inches, is a pain to get the bobbin in, & I could go on forever, but I'm in a hurry to run out & get a Brother. Do your own research, search the Singer & Brother reviews here & on other web sites, you'll see what I mean. If you take your chances on this one, best of luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!","review":"I did not buy this machine on Amazon, I got it for Christmas instead. I agree with all of the other 1 star reviewers out there. This machine is a piece of junk. From the moment that I opened the box it has given me nothing but trouble. The first time I tried to sew with it the needle broke off and it is a miracle if the needle actually stays threaded for more five seconds. I was willing to over look this, because this was my first machine and I thought that they were all like this. Yesterday though proved me wrong. The machine has locked up and there is no way to get it to move.My advice is to spend a little more money and buy a better model. This one is not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't even thread it","review":"The machine seemed difficult to thread when I first used it but once I got it threaded, it worked well.

Any hints?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Tempermental!!!","review":"I have used this machine for a couple of years and have spent more time troubleshooting, fixing and backtracking because of it! I bought this because it has all metal internal parts.(My last machine was an inexpensive Brother that worked great but the internal moving parts were made of plastic and cracked... Not sure if it had been dropped or not.) I have watched the instuctional video several times, and continue to have issues every time I use this machine! if I had the choice I would not buy this again.

I took a few classes at a local shop and fell in love with sewing but fell more and more OUT of love with this machine.

I had so many bobbin issues, thread issues, jams, broken needles, etc. that I would have to stop sewing for days just to let my frustration subside. This machine is total crap and if you give it to a beginner I think it will only make them think they hate sewing when what they really hate is sewing on this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great price, nothing more","review":"Just bought this machine over the weekend because of the \\"great\\" price.

I am a mechanical engineer with an MBA and I may be a detailed and picky person at times but I have to tell you that you should not spend your money on this machine. Remember the saying \\"you get what you pay for\\"? Both my wife and I have used other sewing machines and this one just does not work well. You will spend more time undoing knots and fixing problems thank actually sewing. You may be able to sew on some very thin material but don't count on sewing trousers or jeans, or anything remotely thick.

One day while sewing a skirt ruffle on, it jammed and the damage was worse than the machine cost. Thankfully it was still under warrenty. Singer just isn't what it used to be. They wouldn't even cover the cost of repairs. Thank you Amazon for being awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead after two projects.","review":"I received this as a gift from my mom so naturally I want to keep it as long as I can and use it, if only for sentimental reasons. I hate this sewing machine. It let me complete one project, a rectangular dog bed, perfectly. After that one project it started jamming and bunching the thread on the bottom of the fabric. I took everything back to square one, oiled it, followed all of the instructions and still cannot get it to work. Put it back in the closet, let my anger and frustration cool off for awhile, took it back out, started all over - same result, jamming machine and thread bunching. The Singer site advice is to never turn the wheel clockwise and if you have turned it clockwise, the machine needs to be repaired.So, they set the machine up to be broken so that they can charge almost as much as you paid for it to repair it.I'm going to keep it in the closet until I can let go of the sentimental attachment, meantime I'm getting a Brother machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why these songs?","review":"\\"A Music Fan\\" says he only knew one of these songs?!!

Today the shovel finally completely detached from the body of the dozer.We also purchased the crane, which has fallen apart as well.My son was very excited to receive this bulldozer, given his obsession with all construction vehicles. It's been very disappointing to watch it fall apart. Guidecraft needs to do some serious quality control on their line of construction vehicle toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE REASON, only","review":"for not giving the Horenstein performance the extra star (that it probably deserves, anyway). It's simply because of the continued availability of a performance from 73 years ago; the latter, with Toscanini, Jussi Bjorling, Kipnis and the forces of THEIR time. Richard Lewis is a FINE tenor, but Bjorling is unsurpassed, in SO many of his inimitable recordings. Ms. Stich-Randall and Norma Procter are probably equal to the earlier, female duo of Zinka Milanov and Bruna Castagna ... and Kim Borg can, possibly, even MATCH, in many ways, the legendary bass .... Alexander Kipnis. Horenstein's interpretation is both subtle and forceful, well-paced, and NEVER lags in inspiration. All-in-all, then, this performance probably deserves at-LEAST four-and-a-half stars; it's only the continued presence of four of the GREATest of earlier singers, with the dynamic Toscanini, that could PUSH this exceptional recording into \\"second\\" place, of all."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Opinion","review":"This book is slightly hard to understand, but if you're a willing person to learn, then you'll do fine.

Just listen to the \\"Allegro Barbaro\\" or the various Roumanian Folk Dances and you'll see what I mean! This repertoire is as yet poorly represented on disc, and this collection is any Bartok-lover's dream. It is well packaged, the sound quality is superb, but above all, the music shines in all its glory through the fingers of a true virtuoso.

We'll have to ship it back at OUR EXPENSE (heavy item).I know Amazon sold this saw in early Sept. for $300.00 shipped, so why not offer it to us at that price instead of just canceling the order? I called their cust. service several times but was basically given the run around. I know a couple of people who ordered this saw as well and are very unhappy with the way this was handled.

Detailed instructions, well-marked parts and a good quality machine all added up to a pretty straightforward assembly. The saw is quiet and powerful. It is so smooth and substantial that I can stand a nickel on its end on the table when it is in operation. The two cast iron wings give the table a smooth, precise finish. I added the T2 fence, which is quite substantial and more than adequate for my needs as an amateur weekend woodworker. It attached to the saw without any problem. I bought the saw at Lowe's, so I wouldn't have to hassle with (or wait for) delivery, and it was a few dollars cheaper. The saw is beastly heavy, nearly 300 pounds, so you need to have a strategy ready for how you get it to your workshop.

I am no lover of big companies but the author is so biased in this book it is hard to believe anything she says.

P&G has done many things wrong, most big companies have, but it is not the cause of the fall of Western society."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's incredible","review":"It's incredible how the author of this book is so biased; she is totally against P&G and her rage is obvious. One can easily deduct that she is using all her journal power to revenge of something. She quotes opinions of some employees who couldn't get a hold with their strong corporate culture and the few examples she gaves reflect the \\"truth\\" of 100,000+ employees worldwide. Where is the good side of the company?

I cant hear you...what\\" i decided to try this unit since it seemed to get really good reviews in the Dolce and Gabana version and the Plum version. After not being able to sync the unit easily for some reason, i finally got it to talk to my phone. The sound quality was louder than my old headset but a bit static. Its so bad, the unit doesnt stay synced with my Blackberry for more than 5 seconds and then just keeps dropping and re-syncing constantly. I can not use this with this phone.

The PC required a restart to recognize it, but once it did, it worked just fine other than a popup telling me that it would work faster if it was a USB 2.0 I was hooking it into.

The author seems to follow the theory that gay men all act the same, like the same things and go through the same experiences but in reality do not. As a gay man, and as a Latino, I and my brothers have not been privy to his experiences. Rather, we usually live in fear, hiding our true feelings and experiences.

THIS on the other hand, is a GREAT album.Continuing their progression into a real punk rock band, the album has some great riffs (Birdie), clever guitarring (Novo) and the usual funny yet intelligent lyrics (Mooseman's Jukebox).Definitely worth a listen, Millencolin are continuing to move forwards but without forgetting where they've come from, and their maturity shows with some clever and effective backing vocals.Cheers guys, keep up the good work, can't wait for the next album!!!!

The dusty setting is so realistically portrayed that I got thirsty while reading and even sneezed! The story satisfies on many levels as a paranormal mystery, an immersion experience in the life of a farm boy, and also as an exploration of the power of dreams as motivation and inspiration. Though this book is targeted to young people, I recommend it to anyone who wants to escape the real world for a while, and then rejoin it with a new perspective and appreciation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supernatural Quick Read Recommendation","review":"Although published in 2004, I just became aware of this title, and I really don't know how I missed it when it was released.Somewhat reminiscent of a Dean Koontz or Stephen King work, Dust begins with the disappearance of seven-year-old Matthew Steelgate from a small, farming town. There are no witnesses, no clues, no answers. Shortly thereafter, a stranger appears in the town, and the people in the town begin to change. Children are still disappearing and no one but Matthew's 11-year-old brother, Robert, seems to care...or even remember the disappearance.A well-written book that I thoroughly enjoyed and read in a day. My only major complaint is that it was too short.Recommended for lovers of books with a supernatural flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical","review":"Magical Realisim at its best.

A wonderful read and not easily forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story!","review":"I have not read anything by Arthur Slade, and this was a pleasant surprise. It was maybe a tad juvenile for me, but I still read it with interest. It was a unique story but could have been fleshed out a little more. We could have used a little more information about the mysterious character, Abram, i.e., what he was, where he came from, etc. Otherwise, I don't have any criticism, and I feel you get your money's worth.

Nicely Done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Captivating Read","review":"Dust definitly doesn't bore you, this book was a very eerie and interesting read. The characters the \\"Traders\\" should have brought up a little more before thier arrival to make the story more climactic (maybe Robert could have been alone with Abrahm one more time prior to thier reveal); and also the climax seemed a little rushed. Besides that I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivatingly written","review":"I've started and abandoned my fair share of books ... and would consider myself a picky reader of fiction, especially the fantastical variety.This book was AWESOME.The writing was fluid, the characters well-developed, the story interesting and twisting just enough.Loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sci-Fi Mystery...","review":"During the Great Depression, Robert's younger brother Matthew disappears from a small dusty prairie community in Saskatchewan, after Robert refuses to walk into town with him.

The books plot had no flow to it and it seemed as if Arthur Slade had to meet a dead line by the way the ending was written. I just was not happy after completeing this book and I would not recommend it to anyone even fantasy lovers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An unexpected surprise!","review":"I'm not sure what drew me to this book, but upon reading the opening chapter I immediately downloaded it and was engrossed. In the Dustbowl days in Canada, Robert's younger brother Matthew has gone missing. When a mysterious stranger appears in town and makes miraculous promises, Robert is the lone skeptic. Driven to find his brother, he continually searches for answers.While the prose was beautiful and the characters were vividly painted, it was the element of mystery that made it such compelling reading.

With a title like \\"Put On Your Old Brown Shoes\\", you just KNOW it's going to be some lame pseudo-jazz uptempo thing by Rick. Hodgson's stuff is starting to get whiny rather than positive - \\"Crazy\\" and \\"C'est Le Bon\\" are decent songs with nice melodies and hooks, though less original than his offerings on previous albums. The only song that was even a moderate hit, \\"It's Raining Again\\" is a decent song, but compared to previous albums, it's more of a jingle than anything else, with not-so-great lyrics (come on you little fighter / no need to get up-tighter). Overall, the lyrics are dark and despairing, and point the way to Roger's departure from the band, which goes out with a whimper not a bang."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Much Pressure To Out Do Breakfast in America?","review":"I don't know if the band members ever commented on this, but I get the impression that even they were surprised by the incredible success of Breakfast in America. Certainly the expectations were incredibly high to make a great follow up album. Unfortunately, Famous Last Words failed to come close to the success of Breakfast.The songs are just not up to par here. In fact, I consider this the weakest of the Hodgson-involved albums. The Rick Davies songs are beyond awful, while some of the Hodgson stuff is his usual high quality.In hindsight, it is fairly easy to tell that there were troubles in the band when listening to this. Unfortunately, they couldn't come up with a \\"farewell\\" album worthy of the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arguably Supertramp's Best","review":"I discovered this album 10 years ago. Initially it was enjoyable, mostly for the popish \\"It's Raining Again\\" and \\"My Kind of Lady.\\" But this album, as much as Springsteen's \\"The River\\" or Dan Fogelburg's \\"Innocent Age,\\" needs to be listened to again and again to derive satisfaction from its entirety. Supertramp manages to capture diverse musical styles in the various songs and bring a continuity to this album which is unparalleled. \\"Know Who You Are\\" is one of the most haunting, gorgeously textured songs in modern music. This is one of my favorite albums of all time, even if based only on many thousands of times I have listened to it! Highly, highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a waste of money if you want real ideas!","review":"This book is a waste of money if you are a physical education teacher who simply wants ideas to use in your classroom.

If you're looking for the WWF's version of a Playboy centerfold video, this is the tape for you. Very revealing (AND I DO MEAN REVEALING!!!!) modeling sequences with Sable on the beach, on horseback, and swimming in a pool. There are some wrestling highlights, i.e. the WM mixed tag, and other \\"matches\\", plus it shows the infamous bikini contest with Jacqueline at Fully Loaded. Again, this video is way more style than substance. If you're into Sable as eye candy, pick this one up.

It shows all the highlights of Sable's career and aome other footage like her swimming, modelling, tours of her house and her driving her car. This tape has some great eye candy and shows all the WWF matches she has been in. Ex 1) Sable vs Luna evening gown match 2) Sable and Edge vs Jacqueline and Mero 3) Sable vs Mero 4) Sable and Mero vs Goldust and Luna 5) Sable and Jaqueline bikni contest Everyone should have this video"},{"rating":"2","title":"yo sable is hot in the video","review":"i saw the video when it first came out it was so phat that i would like to buy a cpoy but when i went to the store they were sold out sable has a hot body i loved the video"},{"rating":"2","title":"She is whoooooooooooooooooooo the body and her wrestling.","review":"This video is for the fan of sable.

What wrestling?","review":"Like every male to have reviewed this tape, I enjoyed looking at Rena \\"Sable\\" Mero three-quarters naked. That's what one star is for. The other is for the fact that they do actually show some wrestling (not much, but some). The rest of the video is just for Sable to pose provacatively and shove her enourmous cans into the camera.

First of all I feel that it's poorly written and that the characters are two dimentional at best... The first part of the book is too short and leaves one wondering what's going on... I think the basic premise of the book is good, but the style in which it was written made it a chore to read... I would not call this High Fantasy, it pales in comparison to Tolkien or Tad Williams..

David Hackworth has entered the world of fiction with one fine piece of work. His first attempt smacks of \\"been there and done that\\" in a style not unlike Clancy of Griffin but with a gut feeling reality that brings back emotions once past. The entire book was a page turner and the last half was a nonstop joy ride. Well done Hack, I highly recommend this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novel.","review":"Price of Honor is an excellent novel. The pace is exciting, and the military and political story-telling abilities of Col. Hackworth are excellent. On military matters of software, hardware, and honor, the author's narrative is particularly rich. To my pleasant surprise, however, the love and romance scenes are pretty good, too. They aren't just thrown in, and abruptly written, as can happen when the author's heart is clearly on gadgetry or war or mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Price of Honor","review":"I just finished The Price of Honor. It was truly a captivating and most enjoyable book. As a general rule, I don't particularly enjoy fiction; however, I read this book in one sitting. I chose it because I had enjoyed Hackworth's other books. I was not disappointed in the least. This book puts Hackworth in a class of military fiction writers like W.E.B. Griffin, P.T. Deutermann, and Nelson Demille."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche'd to Death","review":"I really like David Hackworth. I liked him when I worked for him in Vietnam and I like him now as a talking head. The truth is in him. Only trouble with this otherwise decent story is that he uses every overused cliche that every other writer has ever used. It gets old after the first two."},{"rating":"1","title":"May Rate this as a negative star.","review":"The only reason this book got printed was because of the name of the author. I am a 20 year veteran of special ops so I have some insight. His naration of Somalia was simply shoddy re-telling of other material. It lacks creativity. I fail to understand how a man with as much experience as he does could produce such a bad piece of fiction. Colonel Hackworth should stick to writing about combat and leave the romance to the professionals at \\"Harlequin\\". Do not buy this book. Especially if you prefer realistic military style books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fiction!","review":"I like Hack's style. He's a good story teller and his writing ability is top notch. You will find this work of fiction as compelling as Hack's non-fiction. Fans of the war novel will enjoy the action sequences and the characters. Hack is more genuine than Clancy and refreshingly different than Marcinko. (although I like both authors very much) I look forward to more from Hack and I recommend this one highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Romantic Adventurous Novel","review":"Col. Hackworth has penned a story which keeps the heart beating rapidly during the adventurous military settings while creating that special \\"tingling sensation\\" throughout the romantic scenes. Many authors have written excellent action stories and many authors have written wonderful romantic novels; Col. Hackworth displays the unique ability to brilliantly combine both elements. I enjoyed About Face; I loved the Price of Honor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good novel","review":"I really wnted to like this book. I enjoyed About Face tremendously, as well as Col. Hackworth's other nonfiction. But this is not a good novel. His writing is poor: \\"The smell of spilled scotch floated through the room like methane over a garbage dump.\\" Who writes that stuff? No one this side of high school. His best writing is, of course, about the battles. The personalities, especially the women, are horrid. Colonel, stick with the nonfiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Price of Honor","review":"I normally stay away from non-fiction authors who write fiction because their fiction usually is rarely as good as their non-fiction (the Late Carl Sagan comes to mind.) However, I made an exception for David Hackworth's first novel.This exception was well worth it. I enjoyed the book as a good, well done read. The plot about the Military Industrial Complex (MIC) and greed is well thought out. I had a problem with some of the climax because some of it turned into stuff from a really bad conspiracy movie. This is a good solid adventure to be enjoyed.Finally, I would like to make a comment about Hackworth being an SF groupie. That's total BS. He led the equivalent of a Ranger unit in Korea, and his actions in Vietnam from My Canh to his quest to improve small unit training showed that he walked the walk. I really believe that he respects those who live, not speak, the warrior spirit. And if they happen to be SF types, so be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hackworth should stick to non-fiction...","review":"I just finished \\"The Price of Honor\\" and was seriously disappointed. I have read all of Hackworth's other works, and although not always agreeing with him, found them all insightful and interesting. Not this book. In some parts its actually pretty ludicrious, particularly all the conspiracy-theory nonsense and the Vietnam Vet who relives the war in the forests of Montana. Some of the characters are simply thinly-guised real life people, and the F-44 is a thinly-guised F-22...The best parts of the book are the combat narratives from Somalia and Bosnia. Hackworth has extensive knowledge in both areas and considerable combat experience as both a solider and journalist. In authoring a plot, he stumbles badly. Overall, for readers of Hackworth, there should be enough fiction in his non-fiction to satisfy you (if you get what I mean). If you are determined to read, get in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish it","review":"As a retired Air Force officer who enjoys listening to Hackworth on talk shows, etc., I realy wanted to like this book. However, the characters are cardboard cut-outs with no believable human emotions, the plot is slow, and the writing is stiff and unimaginative. Even the sex scenes were boring! He clearly knows his stuff when it comes to combat and the military environment, but maybe Hack should stick to nonfiction. I gave up on this book after reading about half of it, something I almost never do."},{"rating":"2","title":"An oldie, but a goodie!","review":"I first read David Hackworth's \\"The Price of Honor\\" the year it was released, and I was very impressed. For a start, Hackworth is a noted writer of non-fiction, so I was a bit dubious about his attempt to write fiction. Not a problem for Hackworth! He has managed to use his own personal wartime experiences to great advantage, & produced one of the best thrillers I have ever read. This was like Ludlum on steroids. An well-conceived plot with well-defined characters, & loads of exciting in-your-face action, makes \\"The Price of Honor\\" a must-read for thriller fans. Unfortunately I lost my original copy, so I recently purchased another through Amazon. When it arrived I put all other work aside, sat down, & immersed myself in it, finishing some eight and a half hours later, just after dawn. What a great way to spend a night!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Battle Scene Writing Good, but...","review":"This book starts off OK but then gets into some really farfetched stuff.

Both are must have CDs. As far this one being released just as my summer picks up, kick ass! Summer of Darkness here I come!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Honestly, I thought the first Demon Hunter was great. It brought a rather fresh sound to Christian Metal and was musically valid...but this album........It's just bad. I'm sorry it is! I love Solid State and love the fact that there are Christian who do metal but it does not mean they can pile up some chugalug drop D riffs and pass it off a hardcore.First, the guitars are just plain weak, the riffs are unimaginative, mediocre, and consistently the same. The vocals lack any real passion, there is no depth to the distorted vocals and the clean vocals sound far more out of place than they did on the last album.Combine these two factors with the mushy bass and drums and the entire album sounds very weak, bland, and the same throughout. Let's be honest and call this album what it is, a vassal for the clean vocal chorus that tends to pop up on every track. This however is no different than any number of filth bands played on your local radio station.I can not recommend this album in any way."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best","review":"these guys definitely have talent, but this cd lacks variety, almost every song sounds the same, rhymes the same and has the same basic beat.Only 2 songs on this cd stand out, which are the awakening and beheaded.Beheaded has the dude from agony scene, and he makes the whole song, without him that song would be just like the rest.Other than those 2 songs this whole cd is BORING!

So I heard Demon Hunter was in town doing a show. But I was short on cash that week, plus I had family commitments with my wife and kids. What to do?A few days later I plunked down the \\"concert\\" money on \\"Summer of Darkness\\" and had the chance to listen to Demon Hunter for hours on end. I'd still love to see them live, but this CD is a fantastic consolation prize. Although my first time through it, I thought it had less variety and poorer production than \\"The Triptych,\\" I started to change my mind on the third and fourth spins. Now, I'm torn. This album rocks harder than \\"The Triptych\\"--which is a good thing! Yet \\"The Triptych\\" has better lyrics. Overall, a toss-up between the two.Whereas some groups know how to scream, and others know how to write good lyrics, Demon Hunter combines the two and creates its own accessible, yet unique sound for those like me who enjoy a daily ear-shredding. They better be planning a fourth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing!","review":"This sophomore release from Demon Hunter has got to be the best metalcore album of all time. Ryan's growls are as good as ever and the guy can sing like nobody's business. I'd tell you my favorite songs, but they're all good. But if I had to pick, I would say the best songs are The Awakening, Beheaded, Our Faces Fall Apart, Beauty Through the Eyes of a Predator, Annihilate the Corrupt, I Play Dead, and The Latest and the Last. Go get this album and support this awesome band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definetly one of the best releases in the last few years!","review":"I bought their 1st CD a while ago, and I thought it was pretty good. Then...I recently picked up this monster...and I was floored by the great production going in a heavier direction with emphasis on walls of thick guitars, great screaming/melodic vocals and thunderous double bass pedaling by Mr. Jesse Sprinkle (I didn't know you were such a closet metalhead!)Almost every song is stellar--honest! I mean, please listen to the samples if you don't believe me! I love the songs: \\"Beheaded,\\" \\"My Heartstrings..,\\" and \\"Annihilate the Corrupt,\\" among others. Honestly, this Cd has not left my player along with Killswitch Engage's latest and Staple's debut CD.

The only thing that really is consistantly christian about this band is the fact that they are afraid to use curse words in their songs. I usually hate christian music, but this band is dark enought to allow me to overlook it and not even view them as such. However, this album is not very good and it gets old pretty quickly. I still don't get the idea of an evil christian band."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Up With this?!","review":"Demon Hunter is a cruddy band.Ryan Clark is one of the worst vocalists I've ever heard.All he contributes to the band is cruddy vocals.All Demon Hunter has going for it is Jesse Sprinkle's awesome drumming skills(which are now being used in Dead Poetic:)).Do not buy this CD.Demon Hunter is trying to be like a christian Slipknot with a little gothic melody added,they do a horrible job.In my opinion Demon Hunter is a band for goth posers who where the Hot Topic zipper pants all the time.I'm giving this CD two stars for two reasons Mike Williams from The Agony Scene has guest vocals on here and Jesse Sprinkle has awesome drumming skillz."},{"rating":"1","title":"regan is a dumbass","review":"dude slipknot does not worship the devil or w/e u said. slipnkot is f***in awesome so shut the hell up.the only christian bands that i really like are UnderOath and Showbread and Dead Poetic"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a LETDOWN!!","review":"DEMON HUNTER's first album caught my attention for about 5 seconds, then I realized how bad it is!

One second the lead singer is growling and screaming to no end, the next he changes it up to very good sounding singing. The guitars and drums are very interesting and catchy, and while not outwardly christian, the lyrics are thought provoking and very well written. I think the band has become alot better since their s/t album, and I think they are even better on the songs I've heard off of The Triptych. An all around well put together CD. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This is a refreshing book. It's politically incorrect, so the knee-jerk liberals (like those here who gave it one star) won't like it. Reality is reality, whether you like it or not. And this book presents the reality of what works and what doesn't. I would recommend reading Eric Fromm's \\"ESCAPE FROM FREEDOM,\\" too, because some points that are incorrect in this book, you can see corrected in that book. But most of the points made in this book are correct. Just as a child's parents can make or break his life emotionally, so can culture make or break a country's economic and political life. Harrison is dead wrong in some of the details, but his overall point is dead right, and it's refreshing to see someone make it. This book shows the importance of self-discipline, and, personally, inspired me to become more self-disciplined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read it if you must","review":"This one is worse than \\"Culture Matters\\" (same author).Know the code before you dive in -- income is distributed, not earned.

It is ethnocentric in that it positsthat the best culture is the WASP culture, ignoring the fact that a belief that grace manifests itself in material gain has rationalized greed and ruthless economic exploitation.

You do need to give it to an older child - as it is a slingshot type toy - younger children can't grasp the concept. Yet, they can still enjoy the fun of the toy if they simply throw it.As the cow flies through the air, you can hear it moo. It is a great toy for anyone that plays with it. Perfect gift for the child that is hard to buy for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun noise when they hit something","review":"This is a fun toy with the exception of the difficulty of shooting it.

I assume the problem with the toy was a simple one concerning the battery, however, there is no opening to take the mechanism out, so you'd have to remove the stitching, try to figure out the problem, and stitch it back up. I knew from reading other reviews that this could happen. What I didn't expect was the horrible customer service. I notified the seller that it was broken on arrival and they sent me a form letter telling me to ship it back for a refund or replacement. The only problem was that they wanted me to pay for shipping which would have cost me as much as the toy itself. I replied that I didn't want to have to ship it back due to the cost, and asked if there was another way to work it out. I again received a form letter with the same information to ship it back. I finally got my money back after filing a grievance with Amazon. Never buying from this seller again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR PRODUCT","review":"This broke in seconds. Cheaply made.

The rubber is too stiff for little hands to pull back very far. I thought they'd have fun with them but after a few unsuccessful tries no one played with them. Combining this with the fact that the toys break easily I wouldn't recommend them for little kids.I bought six of these flying animals and although they're cute, they are extremely cheap. I tried each of them out before I put them in my grandchildrens' stockings. One of the cows' legs broke the very first shot I took with it. With shipping costs it's not worth sending back so if you decide to buy one you are taking your chances that it will last more than 5 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flying Cow","review":"This toy was a hit with everyone, toddlers up to the big boys!

The first thing I wanted to make was the Beef Stroganoff recipe from the section, \\"The Man in the Gray Flannel Liederhosen\\". My father, brave soul, brought me all the ingredients that it called for and even chased my mother out of the kitchen before she could enter hover mode. It came out fantastic. It has been the fall-back recipe for the rest of my life. Truly a great introduction to cooking on one's own as well as very entertaining reading for those who are curious just what ordinary living was like in the 60's. I even used the ironing board buffet table idea when I lived in a small studio apartment over a furniture store while in college, it worked great! I'm so glad this classic has been re-released. I made the mistake of loaning it out and (surprise!) never got it back, so now I can finally get my old friend back in my cookbook collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for any girl. Wish I'd had it in college","review":"I love the way this book is put together. No more figuring out if the side that looks good will work with the main course that looks great.

Within a few minutes of looking at it, I knew I had made a mistake. While it has a lot of information and wonderful looking homes, like so many books about various styles of architecture, its author and photographer seem to concentrate on homes west of the Mississippi. Do they not know that there are great examples of all eras here in the Northeast? (I live in upstate NY) MA is well represented in the first chapters, but after that it seems to be almost purely Chicago and points west.Also, while not all the homes are huge and clearly expensive (a few modest homes can be found in each chapter), the fact that there is only one obvious ranch home -- and it is a grand one -- is ridiculous. Yes, many ranches are probably more modest than they want to include, but come on? How can a serious book about \\"American Style Houses\\" ignore this style so completely?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misunderstood","review":"I don't know if I misunderstood that this DVD was a documentary.

So bought these in hope that it would make it easier for me to find the balls and thus shave strokes.I'm not sure I found one ball that I wouldn't have found just as quick without the glasses. And worst than that, when there are a lot of bright (white) things on the course, it makes it so you go to every little piece of paper, bright leaf, etc... because from a distance those are the things that stick out and you can't tell that they aren't the ball unless you get up close or pull the glasses off.Maybe if you have really good vision these would aid you, but for me they are a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only used one time but...","review":"After dusk it made things way too dark to see anything. During the day, anything light colored looks like a ball. But having said that, I think if it was a bright day and you had just green grass and a ball, it would be easier to find. When I went there were leaves on the ground. So I guess under ideal circumstances it might help you. In other cases, you might be better off without them. Will keep trying them and see how it goes.

When I called the Firm's customer service to report the problem, they said they couldn't help me, that I'd have to call Amazon because I didn't buy the ball from them directly. All I wanted was a patch but, again, they couldn't help me. Amazon came through as always, providing a return label and a complete refund.

I never read it and later passed it on. Now, 35 years later, I have just visited the Grand Canyon, USA, recognised the cover of the book at a gift shop, and read it on the flight home to Australia. It appealed greatly to me because of the fun-loving, free-spirited nature of the burro. I could identify Brighty's journeys with our stay at Grand Canyon and my walk down part of Bright Angel Train, and the book certainly created feeling and atmosphere which enhanced our short visit to this incredible and beautiful place. The illustrations in the book gave me great pleasure also, and I felt those who enjoy reading children's books would enjoy it as I did.

As the movie continued, I was hooked. This has to be one of my favorite anime series ever. If you like big vacuum tube run mecha fighting against improbable Nazi Super Science, then this is for you. Character developement is generally okay. Obviously it is strongest for our hero, but the supporting characters, particularly the pilots of the Kishin Corps, are well done. The story telling doesn't bog you down with massive exposition, instead it illuminates through snippets and rewards attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"giant robots and more robots!","review":"this is one of the best titles in anime. The art work is great and the story telling is all there. there are giant robot battle's and a lot of action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kishin Crap","review":"Ok the story goes something like this. Back in WWII aliens have started to invade but there is a group of japanese special forces that use giant robots to help defeat them. These robots have these \\"core devices\\" ,which are alien technology, that are required to operate them. There is no explanation what they are other than that, oh and every once in a while they resonate attracting the aliens that drop out of the sky carrying submachine guns?? Anyway it's up to the Kishin Corps to save the day and stop them and prevent the Nazi's ,teamed up with japanese army, from getting the core devices too.I really am not a fan of \\"alterate past\\" stories, but the plot is too corny. The animation isn't that great(not bad either)and somethings just aren't explained like the reason the aliens are there and why do they only want the unused cores?I did kinda like when the robots started up and fought the aliens but overall this show just wasnt' that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This book was given to me as a gift.

I find it far more difficult to unlearn something than to learn it correctly the first time.I scanned the book, and no pronunciation guide at beginning, none at end, and none included with each word.

I have the hammer drill and recip saw that I bought in 1996. I use them several times a week in my work as a self employed handyman.The tools are phenomenal. The drill can break your wrist if you hit something that stops the bit. You'll find more uses for a recip saw than you thought possible once you no longer need to plug it in. They run and run and run. After 10 years I had them refurbished at the Dewalt shop for about $90 each and they're like new tools.The downgrade is for the batteries. The NiCads supplied don't have all that much capacity and succumb to the reduced charging effect even if the full discharge feature of the charger is used conscientiously.

'Raise up a child' is heavy on feelings, but light on truth. What I mean is, consider some of the poems in the book....they emphasize feelings overfaith and ignore the importance of choosing something good to place one's faith in. Through Johnson's book, children learn to like the things they like. These are not 'lessons' which teach morals, but are poems which focus on fun/pleasure/feelings.Books with much more substance would be William J. Benett's 'Book of Virtues' or Colin Greer's 'A Call to Character : A Family Treasury of Stories, Poems, Plays, Proverbs, and Fables to Guide the Development of Values for You and Your Children' -- Both are great!

As a teacher, I know when a book is loved by the children. I see it not only in their enthusiasm, but by the looks on their faces. In \\"Raise Up A Child\\" they love the wonderful black and white photographs showing real children,daddies and mommies and grandparents. They see themselves in the pumpkin patch, playing in the sand, some even feeling the precious baby's sadness in \\"Perfection\\". The beauty of the book is how through these pictures and enchanting poems children are shown the love of God in a way that they can understand, by moments in their lives they can relate to. As I hold one of my grandchildren and read to them from this book, I know it is impressing in their minds and hearts all the different ways that God shows His love to them.

The title is a bit misleading ... it's much more than home remedies and is not intended as a substitute for pediatricians. This well-organized book covers a broad range of potential concerns (from colds, behavior problems, discipline techniques, rashes, ticks, and allergies to more serious diseases) and ages (babies to teens), offering information that is easily understandable yet fairly comprehensive and to the point. It can help parents understand what's \\"normal\\" and specifies when a visit to a doctor is imperative/advisable. It's useful as a reference, allowing a parent to review the child's symptoms before a visit to the doctor and perhaps ask \\"better\\" questions (or provide \\"better\\" information) during the examination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This should be called \\"Prevention's Book of What You Can Buy At A Pharmacy\\". There are actually no home remedies. I would expect to find things like tea tree oil for acne, or a salt solution or garlic for an ear infection. Instead, it advises you to buy benzoyl peroxide or see a doctor for acne and warm water (and a doctor!) for an ear ache. As if people would never think to go to Walgreens and buy some zit cream! There is no mention of things we would actually have on hand to treat symptoms. It appears that every illness mentioned in the book will either resolve itself or you need to see a doctor. I cannot understand why buying drugs would be considered a home remedy unless you live in a pharmacy.If you want to buy a book for a new mother that will actually help, buy one of the \\"What to Expect\\" books.

This book will not do at all for as I read it, my familiarity with several of the cultures briefly looked at showed me that the book has very very little depth or understanding of those cultures (here I am especially referring to the ancient Greek, Roman, Mesopotamian, and Egyptian cultures).

This happy-go-lucky account makes it seem as though the Pilgrims believed in religious freedom, when in fact the only religious freedom they came to protect was their own. All other interpretations of God, they believed, were false, and should be corrected. This book also marginalizes the importance of the Natives who ensured the survival of those who would eventually destroy them.This book is also an excellent choice for history teachers who wish to give examples of how children are purposefully given false impressions by adults, especially with regards to America's history. I'm buying a copy for this specific purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Story of Thanksgiving","review":"My 7 year old and 4 year old asked me to read this book every night since before Thanksgiving. It's December and they are still requesting it. The words are so simple, that they now recognize most of them and read to me! Simple words, but great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story, Small Book","review":"I bought this book for a Thanksgiving story hour that I did for a group of 0-4yr old children. I really like how this book explains why we celebrate Thanksgiving, which is why I used it for story time despite it's small size. I knew it was a board book, but I didn't think that would make it diaper bag-sized."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorely disappointed","review":"I thought their products looked really cute online so I ordered one of their children's growth charts. Unfortunately, I ran into problem after problem with them (product was delayed, then it never arrived... apparently, it got \\"lost in the mail\\", followed by another delay). I found customer service very prompt and courteous, but when I received an automailer from Amazon asking how I rated my interaction, I had to answer honestly that I had run into problems and had not received my package yet (despite the excellent service). I couldn't believe that the vendor read my feedback and decided to cancel my order!! If they didn't want my feedback, they shouldn't have asked for it! I am pretty disappointed as I would have waited (despite all of the problems) for the product. To me, this is a total cop-out. Customer service responded that they apologized for this \\"rare event\\". Unfortunately, it is my ONLY experience with this vendor and it has left a bad taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd time not so lucky","review":"I successfully ordered this growth chart before, but not so successfully, this time. The connecting string was not long enough to allow the 3 pieces to hang properly and the centre piece was upside down. Disappointing. Sending it back cost me 25.00 and change and and I only got 5.00 and change credit for shipping. I should have just kept it for all that it cost me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute","review":"Just received this over the weekend and hung it. It is very cute. I didn't have much problem getting it hung at the right height and the strings that keep the separate pieces together are snug, so the measurements stay accurate all the way up. Just beware that the back can scratch your furniture and walls. I had it laid on my table to write my sons name at the top. He came by and got a little rambunctous at the table and it left many scratches from the tabs that hold the backs of the picture frames in. I plan to buy some tacky stuff to secure the bottom to the wall, but it looks really cute and my son loves the trucks on it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Growth chart","review":"I didn't know this was made of wood until I received it. I thought it was high priced but I needed one. It turns out that it is not high priced for what it is. It looks very nice on the wall and will be a great keepsake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephen Joseph Growth Chart: Transportation","review":"Very disappointed with this item. I purchased it as a gift and the growth chart was put together backwards. It will have to be taken apart and put together in the right order. It bypasses the date for being returned which I would not receive a full refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute growth chart at a reasonable price","review":"I had searched for a decently priced growth chart for my daughter for quite some time before I found this one. I found lots of websites where they wanted over $70 for growth charts! This one is really cute and I love that I can put pictures on it. I thought it would come with stickers to write the dates/measurements because I have a similar one that for my son that has stickers, but it doesn't. You have to buy a paint pen to write the information on the chart. Sharpie makes paint pens in so many different colors I was able to find one that matched the paint well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice gift!","review":"I gave this as a gift to a travelling cat-lover. It was very well recieved. Funky website, too---interesting vendor. I will shop there again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful gadget","review":"The Norprp cast iron panini press is a very good and useful gadget. I had really gotten tired of using a filled-up tea kettle as the top weight on my grilled cheese sandwiches. The press has just the right amount of weight, covers a wide area on my 11-inch calphalon grill pan, and is easy to clean (just a quick wipe-and-dry). The reason I gave it four instead of five stars is that the ridges on the underside are pretty useless. You can't really heat this thing up enough on the gas burner to use it to simultaneously grill the top-side of your sandwich as the product lit promises. It never gets hot enough and loses heat as soon as it comes off the flame. So for me it's just a fancy weight -- but that's what I bought it for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good press for the price","review":"This item is good but not as great as it's advertised. It works very well as a heavy press but you'll still need to flip the sandwich since it doesn't stay hot enough for you to get the pretty grill marks on the top side. It's useful and definitely great if you don't wanna spend a lot of money on a fancy Panini Press!"},{"rating":"1","title":"enamel rubbed off","review":"Was so psyched to get this & what a disappointment to see the enamel coating chipping, flaking, & rubbing off with my hand. Didn't require much effort too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect little lines","review":"This cast iron press works well. No complaints with it so far over the course of three weeks. I've used it mostly for pressing sandwiches, which turn out nice and crispy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Heavy Cast Iron but Doesn't Work Like an Electric Press","review":"Quality Heavy Cast Iron but Doesn't Work Like an Electric Press. We have the cast iron Caphalon grill pan and this Norpro Panini press fits perfectly. My husband is strong enough to make a (not so flat) patty melt with it but I can not. Also, I found that it does heat up with a gas flame so you can make the grill marks on your sandwich but it takes about 5-8 minutes on the flame to heat up enough. I believe they advertise that it takes about two minutes which is not the case. The press works fine for grilled cheese sandwiches but not for meat stacked panini sandwiches. Husband likes it okay, but I don't care as much for it since I already have a Krups sandwich maker for grilled cheese, peanut butter/jelly sandwich, etc. If you plan on using the press for something light weight it is a quality heavy press. I'm still going to have to buy the electric panini press."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic but gets the job done","review":"For the price you can't go wrong with this press. It is basic but effective. The only negatives would be that it comes in a flimsy package without any instructions and I am not sure about the claim that it is enameled. But all in all its well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Enamel - Just Plain Cast Iron","review":"It arrived and the package read \\"Norpro Cast Iron Panini Press\\". Sure enough, there was no enamel on the press at all. Note inside said \\"If press gets wet, dry immediately,\\" because it would rust since it is not enamel coated. If I used it with my enamel cast iron grill pan, it would scar it. So I returned it for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"für seine Zeit nicht schlecht","review":"Bei dieser Bewertung beziehe ich natürlich das Alter des Buches mit ein. Heute ist unser Anspruch höher - hoffentlich - und eine solche Arbeit würde man als mangelhaft ansehen. Aber das Buch verspricht nichts, was es nicht hält. Einige Abschnitte kommen etwas zu kurz, zugegeben, doch was gesagt werden wollte, wird gesagt. Aus eigener Erfahrung weiß ich außerdem, dass der Titel oft vom Verlag und dann oft zum Schlechteren geändert wird.Der Autor war vermutlich ein Kampfkünstler im besten Sinne, was seine anderen Veröffentlichungen nahelegen. Jedenfalls, wenn man dieses Buch mehr als Handbuch für den Fortgeschrittenen und weniger als Lehrbuch für den Anfänger versteht, sind vier Sterne gerechtfertigt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prefaced on Swordplay","review":"To really appreciate this book, it's advisable to have experience/a working understanding of several of the common forms of swordplay. The instant it started referencing forms and motions I wasn't familiar with, I lost interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK as a curio, but no more than that","review":"Quaint old book, of interest only as a curio. It was dated the day it was published. The old-fashioned illustrations may appeal to people looking for Victoriana."},{"rating":"1","title":"faux widescreen","review":"The VCI release is in \\"fake widescreen\\".

They are very small."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This is a complete waste of money, you can get more information from a quick Google search. It is a cheap version of Wikipedia for a ridiculous price. Complete disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding","review":"2012 mustang gt ----this knob is fantastic. excellent hand contour for wrist ergo. 400gr weight helps and absorbs shifter vibration and enables reduced shift effort. worth twice the price. read and follow install directions for tight fit.highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Shift Knob","review":"I've been to my local auto parts stores looking for a shift knob recently and this knob is as good as the ones they are selling for 60 bucks. The adapter insert is nylon which is much better than the cheap HDPE plastic ones found in sub 20 dollar knobs. I would definately recommend this one if you like the feel of weighted shift knobs.PS.... I think the picture at the amazon site shows the knob looking sort of purple, this is not the case it is black with red stitches."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice.. i little heavy but","review":"nice real leather, i little heavy but well worth it. too bad I did not enjoy that much since i have to trade in my old car. will buy again.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't fit my car","review":"This didn't fit my 08 nissan altima because there is a tab to pull up to shift into reverse which this prevented when installed. If you have that type of stick shift I wouldn't get this. But the return was very easy and efficient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just say no..","review":"Happily went back to my OEM shift knob after this. Doubt I'll ever think of changing it again. It changed the throw of the shift. I like stock from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels good but does not stay longer then two months","review":"It was great fo a couple of months. After a couple months of use it became loose and no matter how I try to repair it, it stays loose. I liked it so much that I bought another one. It became loose in less than 1 month and it is impossible to fix it no matter what. I am not going to buy third one. But if you make it work - it feels very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!","review":"I really like this shift knob. I bought it to replace the factory unit in my '93 Probe. It reminds me of an old Dodge pistol grip shifter in that you grip it in a hand-shake position. It looks and feels very well made and comes with replaceable inserts to thread over the shifter. Unlike the cheap local autoparts variety these inserts actually work. An allen wrench screw holds the insert to the medal interior of the knob and you just thread it onto your shifter. The insert is shaped to only fit one way. This gives you a very tight install as opposed to a knob that spins around on you. My only gripe is that it doesn't appear,or smell to be leather as the description says. I still dig it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time Travel can be...","review":"a lot of things. Dangerous. Action packed. Confusing. Mostly confusing. The Doctor and gang find themselves in a London of their future (our past) rocked by war, death and ruin. England seems to have fought itself into a corner while trying to hold back progress and technology. This has only allowed its enemies to gain the upper hand.The answer seems to be in the past (but once again a future the Doctor has yet to see) and the novel itself, while somewhat confusing and slow, is worth the read in the end. Doctor Who fans, who know their Doctor Who history, will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not really \\"tall\\"","review":"Wish they were really \\"tall\\", they are not.

It turns out that Visio 2007 does NOT follow the file naming convention for Windows Files........ Had to change the names of all my old files before it would accept."},{"rating":"2","title":"the coming new world disorder","review":"This work illustrates that Martin van Creveld is more than one of our premier military historians and theorists.

I called the company to arrange a return and was informed in a dismissive manner that the item did not qualify for return because it is a food-preparation item - even though it remained in the original shrinkwrap.My problem is not with the policy - it is what it is. My issue is with the way this company treats customers that have problems with the products. The customer service representatives I encountered placed all blame and burdens on me with a dismissive and uncooperative attitude. I will never order from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Table","review":"I bought this table because I wanted something portable and big. I don't have the space to leave it up all the time, so this was a great fit. The table was easy to setup and is very sturdy. The rail holds pretty well, you just have to fully engage the lever. It took me awhile to figure that out. If you don't, the rail can pop up. I might try to adapt this table for use with other tools as well, not sure yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value and Must have for table Saw","review":"THis is a great addition to the Skil Table saw and a must have to any small DIY portable table saw.

Don't waste your money if you already know anything about Six Sigma."},{"rating":"2","title":"Design for Success","review":"Very readable and applicable to new product introduction success. I liked the use of sidebars and icons for definitions,tools, cautions, tricks of the trade, examples and smart managing tips. Management checklists at the end of each chapter were good for summarizing and action planning. Generous use of references for more detailed information on specific tools and methods allowed focus on main topic of DFSS methodology and organization/management issues of implementation. Left me with desire to get more involved with DFSS in new product development to improve a company's growth."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Paid For","review":"For $10, what can you expect? The book is too high-level to be useful. It jumps around and talks about various tools and the philosophies behind DFSS. I was hoping I could give it to my students (I'm a DFSS instructor) as a reference book; but it did not give them the level of detailed they need to apply the tools I've taught them. If you're interested in learning the philosophy behind DFSS, Subir Chowdhury's book \\"Design For Six Sigma\\" is a much better read. I am someone who collects Six Sigma books; this was the only book I was happy to give away for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising.

Outstanding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not everything, but almost everything","review":"The book is very interesting for all of us who own/love an Ampeg amplifier.The best of it is no doubt the description about how the milestones of the modern bass amplification were set.One of the weakest parts (although I understand that must be part of the story also) is the sometimes excesive detailed description of all and every adventure the company went through, I mean, some of them should have no more than two lines dedicated whereas in the book exist as a complete article.But in the overall appreciation, I really like it because helps me to understand where my amplifier comes from, and I like to know where the things come from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away","review":"This player looks bigger in it's pictures at amazon than it really is. I dont mind that except that the lil speakers dont do anything for the sound. The sound quality is... well there is no sound quality. The FM/AM tuner is useless and you can listen to AM in the background when you tune the FM reciever. The cassatte player does not have rewind and the autostop works only during playback, not during forward or rewind. If you are looking for a low end cassatte player coby seems to be a better choice. This one does nothing but disappoints. I am returning mine!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Darling is anything but.....","review":"This is a hentai movie based on a video game. I've never seen the game and can only imagine (though I'll try not to). The premise is lame, the art work graphic and this is definitely NOT FOR CHILDREN. The story follows a graphic anime artist who is offered a job with the catch that it must be done in 30 days. This requires him (as he explains it) to use his hyper erection mode. This allows him to move at hyper-speed (about as far from reality as you can get). Fortunately for him, he's just married his lovely and well endowed assistant who's more that happy to give him a hand. She does more than provide lip service to the project and does so with a subservient demeanor that will be offensive to any woman who's not into that themselves and attractive to males who's fantasies run that direction. It leaves little to the imagination and lacks any real character development (but then what Hentai movie does). This one's for a limited audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"What else can you ask for??","review":"I loved this story! It was perfect for me. I especially like that Donovan does not perfect her female characters. All sizes and sorta all ages, it's wonderful!Emma is a divorced vet who has a lot of debts and isn't very lucky in love. She recently got custody of her deceased best friends daugher, and lives with her Dad and her in his ranch.Thomas is some sorta cop who is undercover looking for an assasin who killed his dogs deceased owner. He also had bad luck with women, and his ex left him because he can't have children.The sex scenes were awesome! Although, it was excruciatingly nerve wrecking waiting for them to finally get it on because it took a long time for them to actually do the deed, but when it does happened it is worth every minute of waiting!One thing I didn't quite get was one minute she's a conservative divorcee vet and another she's a drum playing chic??Two broken people one prospect of love, what else can you ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a chance on this book it's a sure bet!","review":"I read this author's first book and very much enjoyed it but wanted to read another before getting excited. I am now officially excited. The plot was good and the cast were people I liked and could care about. Like her first offering I was sorry to see it end.Pick this up as well as her first book so you can enjoy the beginning of a big successful career. This writer is going to be big."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I actually finished this","review":"I read an awful lot of romance novels and I can't believe I actually finished this one. Granted, it didn't take very long. Most of it was SO unrealistic (not even a hint of reality) that I found myself skipping whole pages/sections. Nothing new or exciting here.I did enjoy Hairy - but that's about it. Perhaps the author has promise and I will try reading her again, but if this is the best she has to offer ...There are dozens of other authors I would prefer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total no-brainer from chapter 1","review":"I like a good romance but some are simple.

Prepare to laugh and to be enchanted. I kept expecting Susan Donovan to make a false step and she NEVER did! If you love dogs and romance, you'll love this book! The hero is a great combination of machismo and vulnerability, and the heroine is unselfish, loving, but a little insecure. Each person helps the other with the difficulty and the end of perfection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So much FUN!!! ( 4 1/2 stars)","review":"What a funny little book! The story was so sweet and the characters had soo much chemistry..wow! It is rare for me to read a book where I equally enjoy the h/h...Emma and Thomas were so perfect together and I adored both of them so much. There was a lot of laughter in this tale as well. I especially loved getting in to little Hairy the dog's head. What a cute idea! My only quibble with this book that kept me from giving it 5 stars was that I felt the beginning was dragged out a bit. There was a gap when Emma and Thomas werent together that just felt like forever. Other than that, once this book got rolling, it was truly delightful. Id definitely recommend it :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and funny romance","review":"A good number of laugh out loud moments. I like how the attraction is instant, and they don't really fight their falling in love with each other (i.e. minimal angst). Thomas is a blonde Adonis who was emotionally closed off up until now, when a voluptuous vet throws everything in his life for a loop. Emma is a good woman - thoughtful, funny, intelligent, and with a lust for life...and Thomas. There is a scene with flowers that really made my toes tingle and left me grinning ear to ear, even when I immediately went back and read it a second time because it was so sweet and romantic. This book is zany and totally not realistic, but hey...it's romance escapism in all its unabashedly heart-warming glory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Smiling","review":"I've read about 40 very good books this summer--most of which I bought because of the reviews written here on Amazon (this is my first review). All the books were excellent just as reviewed by other Amazon members, but this is my favorite to date!

With that in mind, this book is a complete let down considering her previous work. It does not move, it does not go anywhere. It seems like the story is drawn out and diluted to the point where I had to stop reading the book; it simply got boring.A disappointment indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be missed","review":"This stunning novel is a must read.

Both her recollections of what brought her to this point and the passing scenes along her mundane bus ride stunningly emerges the reader into the details of life in a totalitarian regime from insect infestations and shabby construction to the alert sense of surroundings to the insecurity of knowing if an accident is an accident. The final page is haunting."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Sorry to disagree with most of the reviews but I found this book to be quite boring. I have no doubt life was miserable under Ceausescu but the writing describing her life under duress was less than inspiring. Her descriptions of her life were not informative. And her descriptions of people on the tram taking her to an appointment with the Interrogator seemed vapid and simply a page filler. I felt nothing much for this woman. Her situation is never made quite clear and I found that irritating. This was not a strong book. It lacked force."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Struggle to follow story line","review":"I found it difficult to figure what this was all about.

I was looking at Laredos, Tony Lama, Justins, etc. These looked the nicest and had the best reviews out there. They were all unbiased and actually dead on. They came in a little before the estimated delivery date too.It was hard walking in a boot at first when I am usually wearing sneakers or shoes. Its definitely worth it. It took me a day or two to adjust. These boots are the most comfortable footwear I have ever owned. They are soft and don't hurt your back when walking. Its like walking on air with these.

Everything takes forever to find now. The simplest commands are no longer located in any logical place. I spend 75% of my time hunting for stuff that used to be easily and predictably placed in the interface. This product is an attempt by Microsoft to impress somebody with a slick looking interface. Unfortunately, usability was not just a low priority - it was completely excluded from the list. I cannot use this garbage. I need a word processor that let's me spend my time writing instead of looking up stuff in help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating and Unusable","review":"We purchased this program thinking that it would eliminate some of the bugs from earlier versions of Microsoft Word. Instead, it multiplied and amplified them. Whoever designed this program seems never to have spoken with a secretary. Our word-processing staff, who have years of experiece with many different systems, including earlier versions of Microsoft Word, found it frustrating and unusable. Documents that took only minutes to type took an hour or more to format. The simplest functions, from inserting page numbers to aligning paragraphs, required extensive searches through a maze of templates. Nothing was simple or intuitive. And when we attempted in desperation to escape from the program into a friendlier alternative environment, we discovered that even that had become a major project. The program offers seductively pretty graphics, but ruins office productivity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the experienced user","review":"Microsoft claims that the new \\"ribbon\\" interface allows users to more easily find and explore options. This may be true for new users; I wouldn't know. For those who use office programs daily and are well versed in the various options available, the new ribbon is infuriating. Worse, Microsoft offers no option to return to the classic menu system. I have seldom been so frustrated with an update. It's as if the people who traditionally use their products were completely ignored for the sake of new users."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microsoft WORST 2007","review":"Word 2007 is a perfect example of why you shouldn't try to fix something that was never broken. Instead of improving Word, they made it ugly and just plain annoying.

The toolbar is now a \\"ribbon\\" that's a cluttered mess of icons instead of quick, simple pull-down menus. I wish I'd done more research, and I'd have ordered an older version of Word with my new laptop. THIS SYSTEM SUCKS.

Did MS even THINK about the actual day to day end users? My office bought me a brand new everything computer and I had to give it to one of the bosses here as he rarely uses Word - I bought ANOTHER computer and then I had to go buy a used copy of MSWord 2003 so I could actually get back to work. I certainly hope they know about this and will come out with an MSWord 2008 that goes back to the drop down menus, etc. that we all know how to use.

It's feature-bloated and non-intutive for the generations of users who had become used to older versions of Word. What made them think they needed to change the user interface remains an enigma.

But for those of us professionals that have been using the program for years and would consider ourselves somewhat of an expert at the older program - our productivity suffers severely due to having to relearn everything.Great, simple, daily used functions are tightly hid away in the very recesses of this program. Not to mention the dumb tools menu that takes up half the screen and in no way speeds up editing of a document. Grrrrrr.I'm not a person that cusses - but I came very close for several weeks with this program.

Word crashes at least once a day for no apparent reason. Don't upgrade to Word 2007 or Windows 7 if you think it will be more stable.2. When Word restores the auto-saved file, it often is corrupted, whereby links to other files are broken and need to be rebuilt by hand3. Their help feature is almost worthless. Unless you're a 10-year old who doesn't understand the most basic things like how to cut and paste, the help feature either doesn't address your issue or forces you to spend 10-20 minutes finding it.

Page formatting is an exercise in frustration. Document protection doesn't work. Opening and closing multiple documents is more difficult and guaranteed to go wrong. I could go on and on.

We even took our son to see the Wiggles live when they came to town, and we loved their show.This video, however, was very disappointing. The gremlins creep around doing nasty things to sabotage the Wiggles. For some reason the Wiggles can't see them, despite the fact that they are life-sized people lurking around in ridiculously bright costumes. But the worst part is that the music on this video is sooo lousy. No catchy tunes. No bright, sparkling lyrics. None of the things we love about the Wiggles.JMHO"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointing","review":"I love the Wiggles, but this dvd leaves much to be desired.

The porch on the front cover is illustrative of the porches featured inside. If you can't afford the house that goes with that porch, you won't be able to afford the porches on the interior either.This complaint is no small matter--the issues that arise in trying to make the most of limited space with a limited budget are different from the issues faced by a multi-millionaire designing a dream house with a dream view.The self-congratulatory text concludes, \\"You've seen spectacular examples of porch design and been directed to the details that set them apart.

The grammer, punctuation and sentence structure is so poor in places that it is hard to follow the story as you would a regular book. Clearly this book is either self-published or published by a very small publishing company. No major publisher would print a book with such blatant errors. When the author is trying to make a point, the typestyle, which is much larger than necessary to begin with, often changes to all capitals. Sentences are ended with several exclamation points, I assume for effect. In reality this just comes across as BEING SHOUTED AT BY THE AUTHOR! (See what I mean?)

The divine Marian Nixon as the long suffering wife helps A LOT to bring up the quality level of a seriously turgid story about a gambling addict/performer who seems to get too many chances to make things right, though that's just my opinion!

Information is not concise nor is it presented in a fluid format. It really seems to lead you around from one place to another picking up the pieces as it goes.

The Bluetooth wireless headset is perfect for driving, cooking, etc. As a game system, the potential is there. The graphics are the best I have ever seen on a handheld system...Super Monkey Ball is fun, with minor bugs here and there with the framerate. Keep in mind, the games will improve dramatically with the 2nd generation titles! EA has signed on to produce games for the system, which is an awesome sign for sports fans!

First of all, it tries to be everything to everyone but fails in the end. The games are mediocre (forgotten Playstation 1 ports) and the phone capabilities are subpar at best. I would also mention that the screen is oddly shaped for gaming and you have to literally take apart the entire back of the system (battery and all) to change games and THEN wait 2-3 minutes for it to boot up.In a nutshell, save your $300 and get a GameBoy Advance.

The \\"gamepad\\" design makes the buttons counter-intuitive to use as a phone and impractical to use as a gaming system. The screen is far too narrow for games to be displayed with any degree of useful information about surroundings, and given the numerous addon costs involving in making the system any more than a deficient gaming device, you could see from miles off that this piece of plastic-fantastic casual-glance garbage isn't worth your money.I'll keep my 3210 and my Game Boy Advance, thankyou very much, Nokia.

It's a smaller screen than a cheap Palm device. Yet the unit itself needs about twice as much pocket space as a GBA-SP, so forget about slipping it in a shirt pocket; it's bigger than any phone on the market. The large size, odd shape and brightly colored buttons pretty much guarantee that you'll look a complete tool if you try to use it as a phone.As if that wasn't bad enough, the interface is complicated and confusing; don't expect to be able to pick it up and use it without reading the manual.For the price of an N-Gage you could get a refurb iPod, a t68i and a GBA-SP.

It drags at places and you really have to be enthusiastic about reading the heritage of various families, but some of the stories told are interesting and entertaining. Included are several pages of black & white photographs that show Sayville and Bayport in the past and present. It's a great read for anyone interested in the history of the area, and as an accessory volume for anyone interested in the history of New York society during the Gilded Age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case contained the wrong CD","review":"I received only the case for Greatest Hits Vol. 2 as ordered, HOWEVER, the actual CD inside is the Greatest Hits.

This collection includes Alpert's classic \\"This Guy's In Love With You\\", the only vocal of his that was any good. Also included is one song from his Brazilian LP WARM (Zazueira), and one song from his jazzier TJB from 1974 (Last Tango In Paris) where Herb does some great trumpet playing! There are some concert favorites here, too! \\"Wade In The Water\\" wasn't a big hit, but was popular in concert. There's not a dud in this collection. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm \\"Bearing\\" it all","review":"I first saw this program back in 1983 as a National Geographic special on PBS. As a nature/travel enthuesist - I was captivated by the incredible opportunity a traveler had to view these great bears so close, and the shear isolation of the little town of Churchill, Manitoba (Canada). Because of this video, and my desire to see the greatness and beauty before it was spoiled - I was forced to add \\"polar bear watching\\" to my list of \\"Things I Want to do Before I Die\\".Well, my time has finally come (no, I'm not departing this world). I'M GOING TO CHURCHILL...! If it were not for this excellent program, I would never have known about this wonderful opportunity.

We laughed our heads off at the number of times Klaus Kinski says the line, \\"What are you doing?\\" in every conceivable situation throughout this film. For weeks we went around everywhere imitating him. And every film I saw him in after this reminded me of this one. I realize he is a great European star via Werner Herzog, etc. But I always think of Klaus is this marginal film saying, \\"What are you doing?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"AS A BLACK MAN I WATCHED MARIANNA HILL THIS WAS A INTERESTING MOVIE SHE IS VERY SEXY IN THIS MOVIE SHE WAS VERY CONFUSED ON WHO TO TRUST THAT MADE HER VERY ATTRACTIVE AS WELL I WISH I WISH THEY WOULD COME WITH THIS ON DVD .

He finds songs that are not mainstream, and gives a wonderful interpretation. His voice is strong and versatile, and his guitar playing is masterful. He also possesses a great sense of humor and is able to completely entertain his audience. I understand he even performed aboard the USS America aircraft carrier after the Gulf War. I can't recommend highly enough this album for great sounds and entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"You havent heard suicide without having heard this album.","review":"This album is purely amazing. It's filled with some of the most atmospherically depressing black metal I've probably ever heard. The riffs are raw, the vocals are tortured and the sound full of immense pain and suffering. Plus, every song is basically as good as the next. I highly recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of a more raw sounding black metal. It's absolutely great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical genius for any millenium","review":"I, too, was introduced to Gino in mid-70s.

I know this movie had its definite awkward moments, such as the beginning monologue directly spoken to the camera, but after I kept my mind open about it and continued to watch, it grew on me. Lesnick has some very witty lines, and she did a decent job acting, too. Too bad we couldn't see more of Michelle Green, as well. But I was very impressed with Erica Shaffer who played \\"Christine.\\" I think her honest and sincere charaterization is what made the movie. But one question for the director...why was \\"Christine\\" wearing a horrible wig half the time??So, overall, I'd say check out this movie. Favorite part/line of the movie: \\"This didn't happen in Mexico.\\" Curious? Then you have to check it out. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"HOLY COW HAVE WE SUNK THIS LOW?","review":"(...) This movie was a failure. The premise was good, but the actors couldn't act, the director couldn't direct, and the dubbing reminded me of watching the old Godzilla movies on Saturday mornings. Everyone is so supportive, except the mother-in-law. The father doesn't speak through the entire movie except to impart the greatest words of wisdom to Rachel near the end and clear up the mess she's made for herself in 10 minutes. Typical, cliche, and BORING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"way too long and kind of boring...","review":"Four words: don't waste your time.I was not impressed with this movie. The characters seemed rather bland and you could tell the actors just memorized their lines without putting any life into it at all.The story was okay, but not very interesting. I was just waiting for it to end.I'm not sure why it got good reviews on here, but that's what made me want to see it.

Do yourself a favor and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be mistaken with the opening","review":"I saw the start of this movie on my mom's TiVo but it did not record the whole movie. I thought the opening was cute and funny. So I rushed out and rented the DVD. Boy am I glad I only rented it. The only good thing about the whole movie is that its filmed in San Diego (my home town) so I knew the areas they were in. Other then that it was all around lame. If you must see it RENT IT DO NOT PURCHASE, unless your looking for a dust collecting DVD to add to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful!","review":"Poor acting, poor writing, poor direction... and you can attribute it to one person... the lead actress, writer and director, Helen Lesnick, who is deluded enough to think anyone would believe two fairly attractive women would fall for her whiney self. Terrible, terrible movie. Anyone giving this more than 1 star (because there is nothing lower) obviously works for the production/video company and has some sort of vested interest in making people buy this atrocity. Michele Green is the only thing good in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What could have been","review":"This movie had the potential to be a decent flick except for Helen Lesnick inserting herself in front of the camera. She really ruined her own creation by doing this. Erica Shaffer and several of the other actors did a nice job and I enjoyed their work in this film. Mz Lesnick's lack of acting ability as the lead character caused this ship to sink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah. Period.","review":"A few funny scenes, and a lot of J.A.P. angst.

Oy vey!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do some gay movies have to be so bad?","review":"I picked up this movie on accident, but I doubt that it was fate! It's not horrible, but rather unnatural (acting) and uninteresting (plot, direction). I wondered how a movie like this could be made? And why? However I'm strangely fascinated by this film because I actually attempted to see it a second time, because I just couldn't believe that such a horrid movie could be made. Despite my good intentions however, I could only take the film for about 10 mins the second time around. Some gay films are really bad in terms of acting and story line, but this one takes the cake! Why do some gay movies have to be so bad? I haven't found an answer to that one yet, however I have a feeling that it's a conspiracy. The Republicans are funding terrible gay movies to make the entire population straight! ;)If you like Bar Girls, you may like this one. However, if you like High Art and But I'm a Cheerleader, your best bet is to run as far away from this movie as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Family Affair that's totally boring!","review":"I rented this movie a few weeks ago because it was a gay movie I hadn't seen before, or heard of. Then I realized why I hadn't heard of it or seen it before. What sounded like a great premise turned into the longest 100 minutes of my life. I have nothing against movies and actors that \\"break the fourth wall\\" and talk to the camera, but when the first line of the movie is, \\"this is a gay movie, and there will be gay and lesbians characters--but not at the same time--so if you're in the wrong theatre I'll give you a chance to leave\\" and then there's actually a thirty second break in dialoge? Too much. I didn't care about the characters. There are movies that exemplify the message of \\"accept your kids\\" and \\"follow your heart and don't dwell on the past\\" that are a lot better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get your tissue","review":"Cause after you buy this movie you will want to have a funeral for your wasted money. This is movie is...so beyond horrible. Honestly, forcing people to watch it could be a form of torture. I had a deep feeling of dread when in the first 2 seconds of the movie main actress starts talking to the screen. My dread grew to absolute horror in the first 3 minutes when I realized with out a doubt that the main actress COULDNT ACT TO SAVE HER LIFE! And As I said in the first sentence. I felt like crying for my lost money when after 15 painful minutes I realised NO ONE in the movie could act and things were not going to get better. Save yourself and leave this movie on the shelf.Honestly, how do some movies get funded?"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Absolute Shocker....Don't Bother!!!!!!!!!!","review":"What a complete and utter disappointment this movie is. The acting is atrocious, with the characters lacking depth and a story line to match. The lead character is frustrating, with the actor simply kidding herself to be lead role material. I purchased this movie in good faith that finally a decent lesbian flick had hit the screen. Sadly I did not see the end of the film....I could not stand the boredom or the irritation that Helen Lesnick was causing any more! Do yourself a favour....hire it before you buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no truth in advertising","review":"marketers skillfully used Michele Green, from L.A. Law, as a draw. she was in the movie for perhaps ten minutes in a minor role. the main character tried too hard to be funny, and thus, wasn't! terrible acting, a stiff script, no chemistry between the marrying couple. talking to the camera was equally annoying. don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Helen Lesnick WISHES two women would fight over her!","review":"I'm trying to understand how people reviewing this film are saying it is the best ever. This is on par with Claire of the Moon. The fact that the lead actress is also the writer/director should explain why the story line doesn't make any sense. I didn't believe that this whiny unattractive woman with no observable charms could have two hot women fighting over her. Maybe in Helen Lesnick's fantasy world that happens to her but it doesn't make for a good film"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wagging the Triangle","review":"Maybe I can't rate a film based on the entire fifteen minutes I've managed to watch of it. Nah! Sure I can!This film exhibits one thing about lefties and homosexuals, that I, a leftie and a homosexual, cannot stand: the perpetual and extremely irritating tendency to preach to the choir. Within the first five minutes Lesnick has turned to the camera and begun lecturing the audience: \\"If you don't like the idea of a lesbian wedding then get used to it!\\" Something along those lines anyway. I wondered upon viewing this travesty what Ms. Lesnick was thinking. Who in the hell did she think was going to rush out to watch this thing? Evangelical Christians?Oddly enough, I rented this film inspired by Lesnick's statement that she was trying to make a film where the gayness was not the central issue, and there she is, giving a kindergarten lecture on diversity in the opening scene.Also, when the character playing the mother looks younger than the protagonist, you've got problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"No \\"pass\\" for lesbian theme: another stinker!!","review":"There will always be those who don't care at ALL about quality in a film. As long as there are lesbians in it, baddah bing, 4-5 stars. This movie just plain old fashioned stinks. It makes Clair of the Moon seem great. Just take the advice the the 2 stars and below ratings...save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawnnnn..oh, is the movie over?","review":"One of the most boring lesbian movies ever made. When will we get quality flicks that don't always have to explain about being a lesbian and just be it and be GOOD? I reccomend \\"By Hook Or By Crook\\"- that movie rocked a@$!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad","review":"I should have rented this DVD before buying it. This movie was painful to watch. The lead who is also the director and writer overacted to a fault. The cast was mismatched and other than a couple of moments that went by quickly, I laughed only due to the lack of quality. Even for a [wierd] film this is substandard. It is overly dramatic, awkward, and self indulgent. I advise anyone interested in this film to rent it first before you think of buying it. This way you can save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight to the point...This film is worth seeing and buying","review":"A Family Affair is a film about love, sex, romance, and the drama that can develop, but it is drama while your laughing. As a straight girl I was not sure if this film would be for me. It was, and I have to say it is one of my favorites I have seen this year. I love the characters of Christine and Reggie, the girls fighting over the affections of Rachel...Well honestly, I'd let those two fight over me any day. I especially like the dialogue between these two during the dinner scene, priceless.So straight or gay see this film it will leave you smiling and wanting more from these filmakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh....simply awful","review":"While I appreciate the effort that goes into making a feature film, it's hard to say much good about this film.....silly story, trite characters and an actress who looked way older than her character's stated age.....the jokes were generally lame, and overall it had an Afterschool Special kind of feeling.....sorry, I applaud the effort, but thumbs down on the film....."},{"rating":"1","title":"just plain unfortunate","review":"This film is a lesson in banality. Unoriginal and un-funny this movie relies on lesbian stereotyping for 'laughs' or groans in this audience. A caricature of itself that is simply embrassing to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BAD BAD","review":"I bought this movie based on the reviews it was given by people who had seen it. BIG MISTAKE, I have to say that this is the worst film I have EVER seen. The actress playing the lead was supposed to be 35 ( 45 is closer, im being kind here) she appeared to be the same age as the actor playing her mother. I know it will appear I am being shallow but I watch a movie to escape for an hour and a half, the lead actor was not the least bit attractive (again I am being kind). The actual story was really good but it was so unbelieveable. The new and ex girlfriend were both attractive women (minus the wig) who in reality would not have been fighting over the lead but sleeping with each other. On the whole I was VERY VERY disappointed and shall off load this movie as soon as possible or maybe just burn it.THIS MOVIE DESERVES NO STARS."},{"rating":"1","title":"I asked Blockbuster for my money back!!!","review":"As a general rule, I shy away from lesbian cinema because the acting is horrible. There are a few notable exceptions, such as: Aimee and Jaguar, When Night is Falling, and High Art. This film does not come close to the caliber of the three aforementioned films. This is quite possibly the worst lesbian movie ever made, and that is saying something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment","review":"I rented this dvd with very high hopes when I was first craving films that were at all lesbonic, and it was such a let down. The screenplay was awful, the acting offensively bad, and the technical aspects-well, I realize that it was a low budget film, but come on people. The sound was especially bad, to the point of distracting.Aside from the movie being bad, the special features included interviews with everyone EXCEPT the chic who wrote/directed/starred in the thing. I agree with another reviewer: buy this ONLY to help promote the making of more, hopefully better, movies with a lesbian subject matter. For actual entertainment value, go elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is too much","review":"I knew when I ordered this it had received mixed reviews but as always went ahead and ordered it with an open mind. Knowing that as with most things that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. When will I ever learn, good quality lesbian films are few and far between and sadly this is one of the misses. The fact that you cannot give zero or minus stars gives this poor film a falsely high rating. The acting is wooden, scenes and script uncomfortable. Other reviewers mention great sexual content, steamy scenes and sexy performances. Which film is all that in then, as I didn't see any of that in A Family Affair. If you can I would rent this DVD rather than buy or borrow would be even better, that way your hard earned cash remains safely in the bank and no one gets hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I was totally disappointed by this movie. Although there were some parts that made me laugh, the majority of the movie was a big letdown. I found the acting and the dialogue amateurish and totally unbelievable. This is one that I should have rented before I bought it. Well, live and learn. I wish I could give Ms. Lesnick a big thumbs up for this because there is a great need for good lesbian movies. However, this just isn't one. Maybe next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST LESBIAN MOVIE EVER!!","review":"DO not buy this film. I rented it the other night and it was a waste of four dollars. My girlfriend fell asleep within 5 minutes, but I actually watched most of it.The story is drawn-out and boring. There is no chemistry between the actresses. The humor is deliberate and unfunny. You can look forward to jokes such as \\"I stand corrected- or rather-sit corrected.\\" (the character is sitting.)buying this film will only encourage these people to make more movies. It's up to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful...but only buy the spiral bound version","review":"Great quick reference book (and cheaper than Scotts Catalogue)...but the spiral version has two big advantages in my mind1) You can tear out the pages that you don't need to make the book smaller and easier to use. For example I remove the United Nations, 1st day cover, famous autographs, duck stamps, Canadian trust terrritory and postal stationary sections.2) It is easier to use the book balanced on your knee while checking eBay or folded in half next to your Stamp Album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so bright than stock.","review":"These lights are not brighter than stock white turn signal bulbs. Not to mention in turn signal (bulb housing) is covered in amber color. With stock white bulbs I can usually see the white bulb blink off of on coming signs from a distance at night. With these new bulbs you can't even seem them blink off reflectors from signs. However they happen to perform well and I'm not sure how long they will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as advertised","review":"I did not buy the PIAA 19225 bulbs from an Amazon vendor. They replaced, and installed without problem, the inadequate original bulbs (7440) in my 2010 Honda Odyssey backup lights. The combination of the original bulbs and Odyssey standard tinted windows made backing up in the dark hazardous. The PIAA 19225 bulbs provided no noticable improvement. I'll probably have to go to auxillary lights to resolve this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very superficial coverage, but many entries","review":"I found the book little more than a disorganized glossary of explosives and related terms.Yes, it does have hundreds of different explosives types listed, many of which are very esoteric and rare. And it does contain good thermodynamic data for many explosives.But the explosives, terms, and safety data are all lumped together and only classified alphabetically in a single group.Coverage is spotty. For example, black powder gets good coverage (relative to the overall superficial coverage of all subjects), while TNT is barely mentioned. Prills are covered in some detail while nitrification isn't even mentioned. Manufacturing techniques and intermediate reactions are at most just a few sentences, even for important commercial explosives.All the information contained in the book can easily be found on the Internet or at your local library, and in much better detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"RAZO its in the name...","review":"This is my second RAZO product.

He is very easy to read but not \\"light\\". By the end of the book I felt like he was \\"my\\" pastor.

I'm looking forward to reading more of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay for a sample, but not complete for the fan","review":"I agree with the fan from Virginia. This album is a disappointment for the Mangione fan who thinks he/she is getting the full tracks of the songs listed. Obviously, the second reviewer has never listened to the full tracks before offering the comments that this album is \\"perfect\\". Although the collection is a good synopsis of some of Mangione's better works, save your money for the real cuts, not the abbreviated versions here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go for the whole thing.","review":"If you really like Mangione then get the full length CD. Eleven bucks is too much, if you should pay any at all, to listen to only part of the tracks.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reference Yes, Learning or Instruction No","review":"I purchased this book because the customer reviews were fairly positive. But this book is a lot like going on a scavenger hunt. Information is scattered throughout and it is your job to find it. For example, the term \\"threads\\" is referred to quite often early on but they don't define this term until midway through the book. I found myself jumping all over the place for either a definition or explanation."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have ever bought","review":"If you're a beginner to Java-programming: DON'T buy this book. This is probably the worst book I have ever read in my entire life. And I meen it. It's a struggle to just look up a specific simple command. The examples are much to complex. To learn to bring up a window (fx) you have to read 7 pages of code, when one or two pages is enough. That would even be OK if the rest of the code was explained - but it isn't. Have a look at the on-line version before bying this book. When I bought this book I was a fairly experienced programmer in Pascal, Basic, Visual Basic and Delphi, so it's not the programming itself that is the problem. I'm only sorry that it's not possible to give 0 stars (1 is the lowest)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to understand.","review":"I find this book difficult to understand, so I'm looking for another Java book to buy. (I'm an experienced programmer with 15 years in the industry but no OO experience.) For example, the authors cannot explain \\"throwing\\" and \\"catching\\" exceptions without using the words \\"throw\\" and \\"catch\\". This is like a dictionary defining a word by using that word in the definition. Sometimes these authors spend pages of your time giving you an overview that only serves to confuse you. Brief overviews are fine, but in most cases they should just get to the point.

I dont know how useful it would be for an experienced Java programmer since I am not."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Puzzle Book","review":"In my opinion , this book is not for people who are willing to learn Java. I could hardly find what I want. I find myself in a puzzle while searching for a subject. While explaining something , it always refers to other pages and when you open these pages you could hardly return to the place where you've begun. So this book is only for experienced programmers."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for BEGINNERS","review":"This was my textbook for a introductory college class for Java, and I never refer to it that much. Not too many examples to take a look at. It is good for a reference when you are more knowledgeable about Java. But don't think this is a handholding sort of book for the neophyte in Java. I wish there were more example for applets in the book. Anybody wants to buy my copy? The college bookstore is not buying it back, and I wonder just why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Java overview for experienced programmers","review":"This is a good intro tutorial for experienced programmers familiar with Object-oriented programming(OOP), but people not familiar with an OOP language like C++ will find the explanations lacking and terminology confusing, even though it does try to explain OOP. For the experienced programmer, this books gives a good overview on the various features of the Java language, but you'll have to turn to another reference for more advanced subjects and class descriptions, though the CD does includes complete listing of the Java API. But this book can't really be recommended unless you have to have a book in front of you because the complete tutorial is freely available online and for download on Sun's site at http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/ where the tutorial is more up-to-date than the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good Java book","review":"I used this book to try to figure out gridbags. Oh my were they complicated! I spent a day trying to figure it out, but the text and examples simply further confused me. The rest of the book was similar. Instead I picked up Sun's CORE Java Fundamentals - and it showed me just how easy gridbags are to use. It was obvious that this Campione/Walrath book neglected to explain the mere basics!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the serious contenders","review":"My bookshelf is overflowing with Java books that I've purchased through the months. Campione's and Walrath's book is by far the best. This book contains as much beef as does Horstmann's and Cornell's Core Java series. It also has a very good blend of the human element - not just dull, dry, boring techno talk. Their light sprinkling of humor certainly helps break up the tedium.I found their discussion of the basic Java fundamentals to be the best - very clear and very accurate. Simple enough for the beginner and not insulting to the advanced. I especially appreciated their practical programming and troubleshooting tips.I'm really looking forward to their next collaborative effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good job Mary & Kathy","review":"I found this book very interesting; above all for beginners. Indeed, no prerequisites are needed in Object-Oriented technology. The chapters and paragraphes are well-defined and structured. They set out most Java's concepts; that is, Object-Oriented, Security, Multithreading, Network, portability, and so on. Moreover I found out plenty of clear and accurate examples and a lot of reviews. For summing up, I recommend this book for beginners in Object-Oriented programming ( like C++ ), and Thinking in Java from Bruce Eckel afterwards for mastering in Java programming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very few good Editors such as Campione & Walrath","review":"As a student in college, I had a very good English professor. He taught us the ins-and-outs of technical report writing. Apparently, Campione and Walrath went to the same school as he did.

Most other books (eg - Teach Yourself Java in 21 daysetc) have borrowed,copied and repackaged from the 'The Java Tutorial'.The only problem I see with this book is that the nature if its contents is extremely dynamic and keeps changing all the time so one does not want to make an investment in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for beginners","review":"This book is awful. The examples are complex and confuse the issue rather than enlighten. The text does not illustrate the topics but in many cases simply lists them. There are many examples where in attempting to define a term , they use the term to define it. The book includes a trail map, but often it is a trial to follow it. The authors waste many lines of text simply predicting what the next paragraph will do. I do not recommend this book.

After a few minutes playing with it, I found all the adjustments easy to make. I LOVE the adjusting knob. Took a few tries to learn the trick for realeasing the straps, but now I find it easy. We are still using it rear facing, so I can't comment on forward facing, but overall, we have been very happy.In the rear facing position we did have to put a towel under it to lean it back enough so that he could sleep without his head falling forward. But the instruction book suggests this, so I know this does not compromise the safety at all.It is a little big.

The only thing that bothers me is that rearward facing, it doesn't recline far enough. We put it in both my husband's truck, and my Ford Explorer, and in both vehicles it doesn't recline far enough. It is fine when my son is awake, but when he falls asleep, his head slumps forward.

The lever would frequently stick, preventing the straps from being loosened (which could be tragic in a true emergency), and finally, it stopped working altogether, enabling the knob to be turned while neither properly tightening or loosening the shoulder straps. Seats that have the lever system on the lower front/middle are much easier to use, and have less problems. The Graco Comfortsport & Safe Step seats have this sytem, and work just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Title for your Review","review":"It's a decent OChem textbook.

However, molecular orbital diagrams are very poorly illustrated as to allow clear understanding. There is a severe lack of problems in the text. The classic Organic Chemistry text, by Wade, offers much more straight-forward problems, and in much great numbers. The study guide/solutions manual does NOT live up to its title. There are NO notes, study outlines or anything tho compliment the text. All that is in the study guide is solutions to problems. Overall, the text and ancillary materials are no match for other organic texts out there. Stick to the classics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst textbook for Ochem","review":"If there was a way to give this book 0 stars, I would. Horrible horrible book. If your university uses this book, they have a deal set with the publisher to get a good percentage of sales. I go to UofM Dearborn, and I can tell you this for a fact that they use this book for money, AND to confuse students. I advise all students to get Brown/Foote/Iverson book OR Francis Carey book. Personally, B/F/I makes the concepts fun to learn. This book takes concepts that should take no more than 2-3 pages, and spreads it over 75 pages PER DARN CHAPTER and adds big words to confuse the readers. Its a shame when reading the darn book becomes a bigger challenge than understanding the concepts. I GUARANTEE you that if you use this book you will struggle a lot.

First of all, the author will go on and on and on for pages giving a detailed explanation only to say in the end that it is not correct. He thinks this is helpful, however, it is extremely confusing and an enormous waste of time. Also, he lacks the ability to present material in a simple, logical and concise way. For example, when presenting substitution and elimination reaction mechanisms, he goes on for 75 pages (yes, the chapter is 75 pages long!!) yet never simply lists the basics for determining which mechanism will occur. All you want is a simple table, for example, 1) SN2 - favored by primary carbon, polar aprotic solvent, strong nucleophile, etc. 2)SN1........ If you have to get this book, purchasing the solution manual is a must.

Good Disc all the way through. This is how saxophonist impersario Gato Barbieri brought in it that made it go big time. Produced by the one and only Herb Alpert and plus assistance from his wife, Michelle Barbieri. Agree with the rest of the reviews here that believe it's unbelievable, essential and fill with Latin flavor and a touch of salsa and smooth reality. Jay Chattaway's CTI-based arrangements is incredible and strong with good kicks from the brass and strings. Fireflies, Fiesta, Los Desperados are thrilling with fire. Also Herbie's own \\"Behind the Rain\\" is consider yet the absolute piece of work of them all. Remember Herb's version 3 years after that on RISE? Thrill to have this at any collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"the once great...","review":"Gato is still an excellent sax player, but the thrill is definitely gone, he's no longer anywhere near the cutting edge he existed on in the 60s and 70s. With the exception of The Third World Revisited, you can tell how good a Barbieri album is by the used price. Mass produced smooth stuff ends up in the delete bins fastest. His later stuff is good for a day or two, but doesn't stand up to repeated listening. Some of the latest stuff can't stand up to one hearing.

This is the kind of Jazz that I like listening to indeed. The first time I heard Europa, I was blown away by it's beauty and romantic tone. I never knew that Carlos Santana had written the song originally until I heard it on a Greatest Hits CD that I have of him. Besides Europa my other favorite song on this CD is Behind The Rain, it is truly spectacular to listen to and Gato's sax soars to incredible heights on this one as with the rest of them.

Some like Creamy.In jazz, some people like the funky, visceral grit of Mingus or the quirky genius of Monk, and others like the more contemporary, tranquil sounds of Kenny G or Najee.Those who prefer the former should, as I did, take measures to avoid purchasing this slick, poppy, modern-sounding CD.Those that prefer the latter will no doubt enjoy this CD as much as, say, Manhattan Transfer, or perhaps David Sanborn, who Gato sounds a little bit like, with a slightly raspier tone, less honking tone.This reminds me of a joke I heard the other day:What did Sanborn say when he stepped into an elevator?\\"Man, this place ROCKS!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"MAN, PRIDE AND VENGEANCE","review":"Although Carlo Rustichelli is'nt as high profile as some of the other Spaghetti Western composers (ie: Ennio Morricone and Luis Bacalov) this is a first rate score in every respect.

Especially as an owner of an 100% original Alfetta GTV (the one the book is mostly about) I was hapered by the fact that it doesn't cover dellorto carburators, which are the most common in europe, and it also fails to tell you how you get the engine out of the car, which is hell if you don't know how to do it with this specific car. thirdly there is no mention of cylinderhead differences, which makes you assume they are all thesame, which they are not. Too bad, but completely useless once you start revising the engine, or any part of the car, because only part of the information is available.

All in all, way better deal than buying them from the local parts store. Tip: All parts I buy from Amazon I first look up the correct part number from OEM parts lists or autoparts websites, then see if Amazon has the same part at a better price. I wouldn't trust Amazon's part fit finder thing. I've tried it and you can come up with some pretty funky stuff.

At $7 (free shipping with amazon prime), this is a complete no-brainer. Trying to rip anything with the stock blade was totally useless. As soon as I put this one on, I could rip pen blanks from leftover scraps. Paid for itself in the first day.As a unexpected bonus, it is also made in the USA, probably the only part on my saw that is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the money.","review":"If you're upgrading from a basic hardware store bandsaw stock blade (like my Ryobi), you will want to ensure that you fasten your jaw securely as it may drop dangerously close to the cutting area when first using this baby.Not the greatest bandsaw blade ever, but the value is amazing for the price. If you're working with high tolerance stuff or cutting parts for NASA go elsewhere - otherwise, if your blade isn't cutting straight or the bandsaw prefers to tickle the wood instead of ripping it into two pieces, check this thing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"All went fine","review":"The process went fine.

The dvd is compatible for Zone 1, so what is wrong? Then I see in fine print, you need a pal compatible player to watch it with the music.

You now have a bright blue, Easter egg looking bulb in your turn signal housing. It also gives off different colors in different lighting, and it still does give off an amber color in certain lights.On some applications I can see it working, but I felt it looked too \\"ricer\\" for my taste.I ended up just buying actual silver/chrome coated bulbs that light up Amber.

I really love this version of the song & this made me want to track down the bands other works, this CD.Well, I know the track I love & still strongly recommend is a remix. That remix's are always different from the bands original version of the song but I was really amazed just how different it was. I expected something more in lines the the other Ministry of Sounds CD's I have.What I got was a weak, cross between erasure & Savage Garden! That was a shock, there are good songs on the album but nothing as strong as either band unfortunately.Also the remix CD has not go the 'Deepest Blue' John Hopkins Mix on it either. The remix CD is nothing & is nothing special in anyway.All in all, very disappointed in the CD's but still recommend tracking down Chillout Sessions 2004 & sticking with the John Hopkins Mix on that album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony SRS-Z1 Personal active speaker system","review":"This speaker system was easy to hookup and the sound is very good for such a small unit.The only drawback is that it is limited to using only a \\"mini-stereo cable\\" for input into the unit.

There must be some way for the Hendersons to spend some time together. When their son Davey asks to go on vacation to Europe, alone with some other classmates, well of course that's out of the question. . . right? That is unless Jenny can come up with a clever plan so that the whole family can go and make this a much-needed family vacation. And what a vacation this turns out to be!

Instead, it's just poor quality video of Scratch from 1990, rambling incoherently and walking around in his garden.If you're a naive teenage reggae fan, determined to study Scratch's every random utterance for signs of divine wisdom, then perhaps you'll enjoy this. Otherwise, you'll realize it's just a silly bootleg, designed to make a few bucks off of Scratch's myth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually a measuring cup set","review":"These are not actually prep bowls as stated in the description. They are also much smaller than they look in the picture. The box actually says they are \\"Measuring cups\\". The largest is 1 cup. The others are 1/2cup, 1/3cup, and 1/4cup. They are labeled on the bottoms. As a set of TINY prep bowls, I suppose they work well. Measuring cups, however, really need a longer handle.

Heck, they owned the right to market phones under the AT&T brand. This applies to Sony and other name brands. I think the only company design and make their own phones is Panasonic.

Everything from outdoor sports and recreation to antiques, chocolate, festivals, and so much more. Organized as a guidebook to facilitate easy reference, with a comprehensive index and chapter by chapter lists of names and phone numbers, Country Towns of Wisconsin, in addition to being informative, has the engaging readability of a novel. Avoiding the dry, pedantic nature of some travel guides, Ann Hattes's writing style is reminiscent of a conversation with a good friend as she invites the reader along on her journey.

He sounded very authentic !Fragilidad/ Fragil (Fragile) is such a tranquil and peaceful song. Yet, the meaning behind the lyrics are anything but.The classical guitar interprets the contents of the song beautifully; It speaks out to you. For me,personally, the song is a Sting classic !Si Estamos Juntos (We'll Be Together) is not a favorite of mine due to it's quirky late 80's pop sound.However, it serves as a counterpoint or balance to the rest of the album's melancholy and relaxed mood.Mariposa Libre, as a a previous reviewer stated, is a gem !Nada Como El Sol deserves more than 5 stars...Especially for its Spanish/Portuguese interpretations as well !"},{"rating":"2","title":"From those who Spanish is our first language...","review":"It is clear to me that what Sting wanted to do, translating some of the songs of \\"Nothing but the Sun\\" (just 5 to be precise, and Fragile is translated in both Spanish and Portuguese), was to give an opportunity, to those who don't speak English, to experience what the album is all about. The translations are as literal as possible, which could be a good or bad thing. Good for the people who, for example, have NBTS and love the melodies, but don't understand bologna of what he's saying. Bad for people like me, who know the language (sort of...) and wanted something new. Either way, I have to admit that S. really obtained exactly what he wanted from the album (from what I see).

Producers: Jose Quintana, Bryan Loren, Sting. It's difficult to gauge whether NADA COMO EL SOL was a marketing ploy or a heartfelt attempt at crossover. In 1988, Sting re-recorded his vocals for five songs from his smash NOTHING LIKE THE SUN album in Spanish and Portuguese. In many ways, the decision makes aesthetic sense, as the original songs all have Latin-tinged arrangements, and Der Stingle himself seems quite at ease with the translations. Whether one really needs to own NADA COMO EL SOL, however--anymore than, say, Peter Gabriel's German version of \\"Shock the Monkey\\"-is debatable, though the set will certainly appeal to completists and those fluent in Spanish and/or Portuguese."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, solid intro to web site design","review":"This book gives a very good overview of what needs to occur to setup a corporate website.

This book adds to my feeling that company- and battalion-level histories are much, much better than regiment, division, or army histories. I have two complaints: 1) there is poor editing - numerous misspellings, missing words, etc., but that is not the author's fault - it's the publishers, and 2) there are some regrettable and very uncharitable, but perhaps understandable, comments made by the author regarding men who were back home.

It must be placed perfectly or the drip mechanism is not engaged and coffee and coffee ground pour out of the top. BIG mess. Unfortunately, the complaints do not end there. The steam from the unit condenses behind the carafe and creates a big puddle every morning. And to be quite honest it doesn't really brew that great of a cup of coffee.

Coffee brews quick, and stays hot for a long time! Cleanup is a breeze, just dump out the permanent filter, rinse the brewing mechanism, rinse the carafe and you are done!Now the downside - the buttons. Due to this machine's nod towards simplistic times, it is somewhat lacking in buttons. This makes it easy to brew a pot immediately, but setting the timer takes somewhat longer than neccessary.Overall, this is an A+ coffemaker, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in a fine Italian coffemaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"This item has been recalled","review":"I purchased this in early Dec 2005 from Starbucks.

The water resevoir lifts out for easily filling from the tap, so you don't have to fill the carafe first and pour it into the machine. The resavoir has graduated markings.

It is a minutely subtle nudge between thinking the pot is locked in vs. locked in and hitting the no-drip trigger.

Not too tall and fit nicely under our counters.It comes with a gold mesh filter which you may or may not want to use.It has a removable water reservoirIt has a programmable feature for those who do not have time to brew when they get up in the morningCons:My biggest issue is the heat. Its just not hot enough and I take my coffee black. Not good and it only gets worse after a couple of hours. I cannot stand constantly nuking my coffee in the morning.The design of the carafe is also annoying as you have to position the spout just so or it does not pour.Summary: Ulitmately a bad and expensive investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"We are very disappointed with this coffee maker. It DOES leak, has confusing instructions ( why would anyone want their machine to operate on military time???) and does not produce a hot cup of coffee. For the money, it is not worth it. Perhaps more time should have been spent on the operation of the machine and less on the \\"retro\\" look. Going back to Mr. Coffee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I did a lot of research before purchasing this coffee maker. I spent a lot of money, and now after less than a year, I am looking for a replacement, and it won't be another DeLonghi product. The gold filter disentegrated after 3 months. When it came time to replace the charcoal filter in the water filtration unit, I could not find anyone who carried them. I contacted DeLonghi, and they sent me to some online dealer who never returned my emails. The basket that holds the filters has a plastic piece that keeps falling off. And finally, believe everyone who says the carafe leaks when you pour the coffee. I thought they were just crazy and couldn't pour properly, but the only way to avoid half of your coffee running all over the counter is to hold the carafe over the sink at about three feet above your mug, then pour very very slowly. At least the drips will go down the drain.A lousy product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves a Huge Mess","review":"This coffee pot makes good coffee, however, at least once a week we awake to a huge mess on the kitchen counter.

When I add my little bit of cream, I need to drink it quickly or the coffee will be too cool (which is fine for me because that's what I do anyway).

Who the hell compared this to Once Were Warriors, what a joke. The only purpose of this film seems to be a movie attempting to show how badass Hawaiians are supposed to be, which I have to say it's not very impressive.This movie sucks and if it truly is a reflection on Hawaii, then my opinion of Hawaiians is that their goofy little kids.

The ear plug supports the relatively small weight of the boom/mic and cord. It feels fine at first, but gets uncomfortable after a while. I discovered this while waiting for my first call with the headset on.3. The mic is noise cancelling and must be close to your mouth in order to work properly. The boom is too short for me and as a result the noise cancellation cancels out my own voice!

After running less than 200 copies the machine had ink all over the inside and on the paper feeder.Epson replaced this unit with a new unit. Trying to run 20 copies this unit also sprayed ink all over the inside of the unit and paper in the feeder.Epson replaced this unit with a \\"refurbished\\" unit which when unpacked had loose parts from the paper feeder. Unit was shipped without locking the scanner or installing the paper feeder properly.I purchased a new unit and two months later a had a used \\"refurbished\\" unit that would not feed paper.Not happy one bit with Epson Customer Service -- Jack"},{"rating":"1","title":"Espon RX620 could be better","review":"I would not recommend this printer to anyone considering buying a new or used one. I have gone through color cartidges quickly and switching to black ink also slowly drains the other color cartridges as well. It does print nicely on paper and photo, but there has to be something out there that does not hit your pocket hard for ink replacements. And now wireless is the way to go as well. It did nicely scan old photo negatives from my parents days into my computer. The real reason I bought the printer several years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"had some trouble","review":"When I tried to copy something on this printer, say it was a black and white image with a lot of plain paper around it, the printer would print the image fine but would also spend a lot of time printing a slight tone behind it of the 'paper color'. This seemed like a big waste of time and ink so I called epson ( and i must say that they have a pretty good tech support) and they said that this was a hardware problem and they sent me a new one. I recieved the new one and it wouldn't print at all and made a horrible noise when I tried to do a head cleaning. So now am sending this one back too....Its too bad, it seems like a nice printer otherwise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Print heads WILL clog and cannot be cleaned","review":"Don't waste your money on this piece of junk.

I've had the chance to use it for all types of printing, reading memory cards, and scanning a document. I have not yet used it to scan slides or negatives. That's next on my list of projects.

Never again Epson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this printer!","review":"This is a nightmare! It won't DO ANYTHING WITHOUT INK. I mean, it won't SCAN. The ink is sooo expensive. It is a HOG!

Last time I checked ink is not a requirement of a scanner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't buy an Espon Again!","review":"This is my third RX620. My first two LCD panels went out while it was still under warranty thank goodness. It was a very painful experience at the time but now I am having new and more frustrating problems. I would have to say that I was mostly pleased with the prints with my PC but I have switched over to a Mac and now my prints are just plain junk. I have updated drivers, new calibration for my monitor, I can even print out of the epson printing software that they send with the software bundle and I still get dark muddy prints. I have tried different profiles, messed with the driver settings and tried every little suggestion online from others like me. There are many other people out there like me. Just do a few searches and you will see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this printer!","review":"Similar to other reviews, the ink usage on this thing is ridiculous.

For B&W copies or B&W prining in general, it uses a bit of color ink each time. You cannot turn it off. Phoned Customer Service, they said it does this to improve quality. I said this is unacceptable, fraud. Was transferred and then cut-off. I later looked this up and saw some printers do this - Epson's do. This is a joke, especially considering in general this thing is an ink hog, and the ink is expensive. As well, the paper seems to jam often, and then the thing makes a super-loud grinding noise. The actual color photos are quite good. Next time I will stick to a cheap HP (as I always had). Epson, never again. Should have known better to spend this much on a printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epson RX620 Evaluation","review":"Color prints from E mail or web pages are great, vivid and bright. However, it is extremely slow to print (ads claim up to 18ppm) The copy function sucks, on copy function; poor quality copies taking up to 2 minutes, the scan is fast but requires going into Applications and starting Epson Scan every time then to print out is forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY FROM EPSON!!!","review":"First of all, it is impossible to print with only black ink, in effect wasting all your colored ink and giving all black and white prints a nasty green tone. Secondly, yes, it is an ink hog. It says you are out of ink, when really you are not. For example, I just opened the lid to change my yellow ink, and when I closed it I was suddenly \\"out of\\" light magenta. I hadn't even printed anything. It won't let you do ANYTHING on it when it's out of ink either. IT'S HORRIBLE. Also it is incompatible with some programs on my computer (Illustrator 10). It is overall a frustrating expensive ink whore.Another thing, my roommate has an Epson and it broke for no reason after a year, the same happened to her boyfriend's Epson. I read another online review of this printer that says after owning it a year the owner has to do a head clean every 4 pages.Don't make the same mistake I did!!!

I usually have high tolerances for non-perfect equipment but this is going way too far.My biggest complaint? YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT ALL INKS BEING AVAILABLE! This doesn't sound bad initially since its a printer and all but realize this means you can't print in B&W; only if you're out of color. You can't print only in blues if the red is out. You can't do anything.Once even one of the ink cartridges are out, you basically do not have a printer anymore. Even the damn scanner/copier won't work without color cartridges.

Roughly the first half of the clip is, frankly, corny, but necessarily so. It shows a prepubescent who is still innocent and naive, in an era that stressed conformity. The latter half of the clip shows her developing resolve after being shunned for wearing a simple bracelet with Jewish symbols. The ending is rather ambiguous, which I find remarkable for a film made at a time when moralistic loose ends were tied at the end of a story.I tell my students that the young woman portrayed here in all likelihood went on a few years later to become a damned good hippy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Latimore's obscure but soul-soothing Malaco debut set.","review":"Originally released in 1982, this (somewhat) obscure album was Latimore's Malaco debut. Latimore's husky and smoky yet vibrant and heartfelt vocals are truly in peak form on the slow-burn Soul-Blues ballads which are predominant on this CD. As was the case with most Malaco albums of the 1980s, this one was sparsely produced and most of the songs were (obviously) aimed at serious Southern R&B fans--not surprisingly, it failed to get any considerable amount of radio airplay. This is music that soothes the soul, however, and an album well worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read for anything \\"Competitive\\" .. especially pool.","review":"I enjoy pool ... but found the insights in this book apply to anything at all I do where \\"winning\\" is important.

There are precious few books on the topic of the mental side of pool and billiards (I know of only three), and this is by far the best of them. The author is a sports psychologist (and pool player), and he explodes a lot of the \\"mental myths\\" of pool, including undoing some bad advice written by pool pros and wanna-be pros who meant well but didn't know what they were talking about psychologically speaking. The prose is also a nice read, especially for a nonfiction book. I can especially recommend this volume for intermediate players who are having a hard time dealing with league or tournament competition pressure.

If you usually play much better in practice or when nothing is on the line than when in serious competition, this book is for you. Dr. Fancher teaches you how to use competitive pressures to your benefit. Believe it or not, you actually have the capacity to play better in competition than in practice by using the methods contained in this wonderful book. It's worked wonders for my game. I've surprised myself many times over the past year with sterling play during pressure packed matches.

I have taken long trips with them no problem, they are great on buses and plains. they fit comfortably on your head and a just well. if you have large ears you may have a problem with the headphones rubbing on the tips of your ears but for every one else they are good. it is easy to wear them for long periods of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe my expectations were too high","review":"Bought these, tried them out, returned them. They had no bass, no matter how much I fiddled with the EQ settings. Also, when I put them on with no music just to test out the \\"passive sound cancellation,\\" I was underwhelmed. They cut out some sound, but they also reverberated some frequencies resulting in a bad droning noise. I'm sticking with my UR-20's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Giant Headphones","review":"These are passive noise reduction headphones, so they are big and bulky. They appear well made. The noise reduction is very good. If I'm listening to music, I basically can't hear what is going on around me if it isn't very loud. This is the effect I was looking for, to be able to tune out the world around me.I also have the Koss QZ-5 headphones and I find they are lighter and fit tighter around the head. They are also less likely to fall off. However, the QZ-5 have the metal strap at the back, so it is impossible to rest my head on something while I use the headphones.Given a choice between the two, if resting one's head is a requirement, then I would suggest that the QZ-99 is a better choice. If not, the QZ-5 is a better choice for that reason. Both work equally well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"I bought these mainly for the warranty, as I've used many good headphones that would just quit shortly after the warrant period. A lifetime warranty is very helpful.As for the headphones themselves, they surpassed my expectations for a forty dollar set. I was really impressed by the sound isolation. I'm taking these to college dorms, where sound echos like crazy, and these headphones muffle up the environment noise quite a bit.The fit is about average. I could feel it pressing against my head, but the ear cups were very large and ample for my ears.The sound is above average. It's not the best ever, but it's definitely good for the price paid. This is NOT for bass enthusiasts. The bass is pretty non existent compared to DJ headphones. But I listen to a lot of vocals, and they come through pretty clearly.Overall, I'd recommend these to anyone who doesn't need bass.

The differece was that these are like ear protection devices like target practice shooters use. And the noise cancelling type use an electronic circuitry to \\"phase\\" out the noise, significantly. Also, the phones \\"clamp\\" on to your head, giving you aching pains after wearing for an extended period. The sound quality was alright, not much in the lower range, but didn't play loud enough.

The other bonus is the fabulous sound quality. These are my new favorite headphones for listening to music! They are far more comfortable than earbuds and the sound quality is incredible when compared to earbuds. I can hear parts of songs that I did not even realize existed, or had just blended into the background.

I spend the entire race crushing the headphones against my ears to block out sound. I used this set at a race yesterday and it was the final straw -- the left side speaker no longer works rendering them completely useless (which is a positive because it will force me to buy a better set). Spend a little extra and get something that works well and will last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good noise reduction and features for the price!","review":"I bought these for a NASCAR race and they worked great! They are straight-forward, fit well, and had a nice volume knob and mono/stereo switch built in. They're not light, but I wore them for nearly 3 hours straight with no issues.

No, not completely, sound can leak in but it does do a very good job of mostly dampening everything. I used to have to put my head phones on full blast to try and block out my roommate watching tv so I could concentrate, now I can just put these on crank the tunes a bit and just focus.One thing of note is that these headphones are designed primarily to block out sound and all the other niceties take a back seat to that. They have pointy edges which I had to file down to stop from stabbing my neck. They are quite heavy especially if you are wearing them for long periods of time, they sometimes give me a headache for that reason. They also don't fit amazingly.All that being said I love them.They do exactly what I need them to do and they are very decently priced, shop around before you buy them but if all you care about is raw sound blocking power and the ability to also listen to music these are probably the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for noisy environment","review":"I use this during flights & it is perfect.

I don't need audiophile sound quality, but these are unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shooting Muffs With Speakers","review":"These fit very tight on the head, which caused me headaches. The only noise canceling you get from them is the insulation on the ear cups. They are more like shooting muffs with mediocre speakers in them. They would be good for listening to music while mowing the lawn, but for everyday wear I would avoid, as they are not that comfortable to wear for long periods or time. Cheap earbuds would do the same job imo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Koss QZ-99 Noise Reduction Stereophone","review":"These are wonderful head-phones; great sound and nicely shut out the outside world while you are wearing them.

There is no instruction either as to what size duplex nails would fit. It took me a trip to the hardware store to got the wrong size nails. For $1 more (I spent more than that on gas and time), I would suggest to go with theZareba Electric Fence Black Pinlock Wood-Post Insulator With Nails - 25 Pack PL25WPthat comes with nails. Well, I used Zareba for many years. I have not used the SC-75 yet because I am tired of running back and forth to the hardware store. They could be very nice insulators but I am sorry that I switched brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"When I bought this phone for my home office, I was pretty excited about it. Its exterior is an attractive matte silver, the handset feels good in the hand, and has a nifty lighted keypad and screen that even tells you the length of your phone calls. However, this was the first cordless phone I've ever owned whose sound quality on the other end (what's received by the person to whom you're talking) is so markedly poor that people commented on it. When my husband and I tested it out ourselves, we were horrified to discover that this phone is so unclear that it makes you sound like you have a lisp. Also, I never found a way to comfortably hold the handset next to my ear for extended periods of time. It's possible our particular phone was a lemon, but unlikely; we returned it immediately, and are trying our luck with the vtech2431."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Looking","review":"I purchased this phone to replace my dead 900MHz phone. The phone is very attractive and a breeze to install. The phone had perfect clarity......but the phone CAN NOT be used for long calling times.

Both my wife and I avoided using the phone in favor for our very old analogue cordless.

If a DVD or CD disk is not properly loaded into the carousel tray or if a disk should vibrate from its position in the carousel, the tray will become jammed and cannot be automatically or manually opened. Don't bother trying to take the cover off and fixing the unit yourself, because even after the dislodged disk is removed, the tray door will not automatically open when the button is pressed. The entire unit will have to be serviced, which isn't cheap. I understand that the trays are made in such a way to accommodate different formats, but this has led to the above problem. I guess you take the good with the bad. I do not recommend this unit if children will be operating the system, as it is too sensitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best DVD Player period.","review":"Dvd players nowadays are a dime a dozen. the harman/kardon easily seperates itself from top competitors with its high quality design and performance. first of all many features i did not find on other were availiable with the h/k. such as 5 cd/dvd carosel and mp3 etc. the picture is incredible on hdtv and the menu is flawless. the six or seven times zoom is a definite plus for fast action scenes or to catch hidden details. the only problem i had is that the reading of cds takes from about 10-20 seconds per start-up, otherwise seamless skipping and fast-forwarding from then on out. the champagne color insert is a nice touch to an overall excellent player."},{"rating":"1","title":"harmon kardon dvd 50","review":"This is a piece of garbage.

I'm a relative beginner to watercolors. I wanted something step-by-step, and from the description, I thought the book would have many projects and paintings to try. This is not the case. It has page after page of vague suggestions for techniques--this author is especially enthralled by spraying water and paint onto the paper from spray bottles--not what I was interested in at all. This book might be good for painters who are accomplished and want to try new techniques, but I wanted a basic book with basic techniques. I also wanted some step-by-step paintings, something that an experienced painter probably wouldn't need.

The other reviews that praise this movie are very misleading. To put it simply, this film stinks. The cinematography is horrid, the music is worse (Western pop from the sixties), the story line is pitiful and there is no acting in this film. It is not a drama nor a comedy. It is a tragedy. This movie was given one star because reviewers are not allowed to give no stars. Amazon.com should be more honest in the reviews they promote if they want return customers.DON'T BUY THIS FILM. IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not cool.","review":"Not cool at all. I've seen most of the early Samurai movies and if you are a true fan you will not like this. Everything about this movie- from the fake B&W to the stupid jump cuts is just bad and silly. No drama, just parody of convention. It's like a 6th grader watched too much Quentin Tarrantino and Kurosawa, (both of whom I love), and tried to make a movie. The music choices are dumb- the camera angels are ridiculous. Not good-bad. Bad-bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the classic samurai film...","review":"Like one review on this film,I was turned off very early because of the tone of the film(to lighthearted for my taste).I'm a big fan of the Kuroswawa film epics,and this film(or so I thought),would be like that in every sense.The main character had no screen presence at all.The music score just didnt do it for me. Look at the making of the film,it was stated that this was a MTV generation film,they were right on the money.To bad I'm not of that generation...You cant always go by other people glowing recommendation,I should have gotten \\"Seven Samuari\\".."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful...just awful.","review":"I shut this movie off after 15 minutes. It was unbearable to watch. The direction is heavy handed, the selected music is a mistake, and you can see the poorly applied rubber prothestics they used as make-up on the actors to imitate baldness. Also, the interchange of black and white footage with moments of color is anything but subtle. Even as a joke, this movie wore out its welcome quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Historically Accurate","review":"Wow. That's all I can say when I saw this film. Originally recommended by one of my fellow students at my Iai-jutsu class, I rented this movie, and it instantly became one of my favorites. Unlike many martial arts movies, it avoids taking itself too seriously, therefore avoiding many downfalls that are common with 'americanized' martial arts movies. It is, in fact, what I would classify as a comedy. Nevertheless, it is surprisingly historically accurate, and the martial arts demonstrated are much closer to traditional study than anything I've seen in any other martial arts movie, period. Definitely worth seeing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie all could enjoy","review":"Very enjoyable movie. It had a great story, enough action to keep people interested in that happy and also made me laugh quite a bit. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I hated the rock & roll music in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sakura and Syaoran","review":"This book is great. Sakura and Syaoran get closer to each other as the day goes by. Sakura likes Yukito and Eriol but still doesn't know about Syaoran love for her. Syaoran seems to have a teddy bear for Sakura but doesn't have the guts to face her. His face turns red (shy)when he see her around. In this book Sakura get a fever and still goes to school. Syaoran finds out she has a fever and cared for her. Suddenly, a clow appears and Sakura goes out to capture it but Syaoran find her and stop her with a stare. (meaning liking way)Her brother know about her fever and about her going out to capture the clow.To sum this all up, the book is about Sakura and Syaoran's relationship. I love this book because of that. I don't have a friend like Syaoran and my life isn't like Sakura but I could dream, that why I read this book. Girls think about relationship like them. So Sakura is like my role model and a close friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I love this band. The music brings me back to the 80's.

The core of Split Enz were the talented brothers Neil and Tim Finn. Neil's guitar playing and Tim's vocals made up the Split Enz melodic pop rock that made them popular in the new wave circuit. This cd includes some brilliant songs such as \\"History Never Repeats\\", \\"Six Months In A Leaky Boat\\", \\"I Got You\\", \\"One Step Ahead\\" and the funky \\"Dirty Creature\\" to name a few. Split Enz were also known for their outragious hairstyles as well as clownish uniforms that definately fit the \\"new wave\\" mold. Although Split Enz no longer exist, this cd represents the best of their hits. Younger brother Neil Finn formed Crowded House in the late 80's and had a string of successful hits."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Message to My Girl\\" makes it all worthwhile!","review":"People remember Split Enz for \\"I Got You\\" and \\"One Step Ahead,\\" but \\"Message to My Girl\\" should have been the band's biggest success. The track comes from Conflicting Emotions, the last Split Enz album released in America. \\"Message to My Girl,\\" like the Who's \\"Bargain\\" and a handful of other songs, is a rock rarity--a powerfully poignant love song. During the eighties, Enz founder Tim Finn enjoyed a successful solo album and wrote music for the film The Coca-Cola Kid, while little brother Neil kept the Enz spirit alive with his band Crowded House. The nineties found Tim and Neil playing together in Crowded House and then, in 2004, collaborating on the excellent Finn Brothers album Everyone Is Here (take a listen to \\"Won't Give In\\").

I was a tad confused by some of the plot twists towards the end as well, but I attributed that to my own ignorance of anything resembling technology or science (theoretical though it may be), and not to any shortcomings on the author's part.

Very quickly afterwards, the story breaks down. It becomes intensely flat and uninteresting. The plot undergoes convolutions that felt more like an irritating dream due to indigestion. There is hardly any charecter building and no sooner is one charecter introduced, than it is replaced by another, equally unimaginative, charecter.There were too many references to twentieth century culture that felt out of place: changing flat tires, the music from \\"Psycho\\", Ballroom dancing!!!

Even Boris Karloff can't save this one I'm afraid. Unfortunately, The Mummy and its sequels don't live up to the glory of the other monster collections (Frankenstein, Dracula, etc). I think The Mummy collection is also the worst of the film transfers, and even though I know how old these movies are, the other transfers to DVD are much better. Also, unless you are a true Mummy fan, the sequels included here (Mummy's Hand, Mummy's Curse, Mummy's Ghost, Mummy's Tomb) are just not that exciting.

It does one thing that most theologians have failed to do, make you look at the bible in a more reasonable and livable way. not just a manual of instructuions on how to live as a so-called christian and ..woe betide if you dont do what it says!! I have always been fascinated by the book of revelation and have felt it didnt make sense in the \\"death and destruction\\" terms as most of us are made to believe by the church. After reading this book i have realised that there is more to christianity than the usual pointing fingers at others and making them out to be the so called anti-christ!!

I tried to fuss with them, and could sometimes get them to close, but didn't feel secure, and when I set the rifle down, the slightest bump popped them open again. I tried two sets for two different scopes, and all four did the same thing. The regular BC flip up caps... locked and tight. These... completely suck, so they are basically unusable. It would have actually been better if they didn't spring open at all, and you just simply flipped them up manually, but not staying closed is stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never again!","review":"Light weight, appears to be sturdy, and fits the scope like a glove.

It is not bluegrass, country, blues or jazz-- it may be hard to find in the record store-- but it is great music that you can listen to over & over. Some parts of it may put you in a romantic mood-- other parts may make you dance. To a serious musician who knows music theory & harmonic progression, it is especially rewarding. It has harmonic and melodic interest and it is fresh and wonderful. I think of David Grisman and his mandolin, and I guess one word I would use is seductive. He is just a master of the instrument, purely and simply. Subtle virtuoso, this man. Give it 3 listens before you decide-- I guarantee it is like nothing you ever listened to before.

In fact, the baqua doesn't appear until the reader is 7/8's of the way thru the book. Then the connection is minor and forced.

First, it got off to a slow start, now that's ok but if it is gonna start slow, it should be longer than 275 pages. Second, nothing much happened, well not as much as most authors put in THEIR novels, and the worst part was the way in which Kirk decided to give up the Enterprise and start teaching? Any good Trek fan knows that AIN\\"T GONNA HAPPEN! And, the way in which Kirk loses the Enterprise is already a movie anyway. And it's a good movie too. I don't reccommend this book.

The recorder would never skip in the same location twice although always around track 3 or 4 regardless of the album. When not recording, all discs would play perfectly without skipping.

There are spaces within words. Words don't have spaces between them. There are graphics that seem to come out of no where that I couldn't identify. I contacted Amazon about it, they said they would call me back but did not. Oh, and they removed my first review of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cut and Dry....to the point! Love it :)","review":"Pavel's concepts are so simple and yet make perfect sense! His strategies really work for instantly increasing strength. I couldn't believe it....I would stop reading and implement a couple of his tips for basics like pushups and found I immediately could do more and felt stronger. I no longer do traditional \\"work outs\\". I just \\"practice\\" doing a couple things like push ups and deadlifts MANY times throughout the day...I have found that I am stronger and actually doing more. I really am glad I came across this book...it was just right for me at this moment....btw....I am a 42 yo female."},{"rating":"2","title":"A useful, pragmatic book","review":"Pavel is best known for his kettlebell stuff, but he appears to understand exercise and strength building in general. I like this book because it's in a clear style which helps you understand what to do, and why to do it.In particular, you will learn a few exercises which are very challenging, and can be used to achieve great strength gains. At the same time, he explains how to make them easier, so you can get things done when you aren't strong enough for the basic exercise. It's an uncomplicated system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could've been shorter...","review":"One thing Pavel does is talk too much. Quite a few pages and possibly a couple chapters could have been cut out of the book. That's probably what made people mad, they felt they were getting ripped off. If the book was shortened, and sold for $20 or $30, would have gone over better. Naked Warrior is the bodyweight companion to Power to the People. It has great info that I'll apply to my routine down the road. But it's written more with the weight lifter in mind than someone like me who does exclusive bodyweight training; but its still assessable. I recommend it to weight lifters, for those like me, I would recommend purchasing Convict Conditioning, then coming back to this if they so choose later."},{"rating":"2","title":"git r done","review":"Follow through and enjoy the rewards. No book is worth much if you don't complete the exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slight exageration to offset all of the fives.","review":"Yes Pavel has some good ideas for increasing one's demonstrable strength, and yes, one-armed pushups, and one-legged squats are perfect, no-equipment-needed ways to take one through the full range of difficulty in the major muscle groups, BUT why must he be so frugal with his information!. The principles are the same espoused in previous Pavel books and tapes, with two different movements. Every three of his books, (at least), could, and should, be condensed into one, with smaller print, less salesmanship, and a touch of intellectual generosity. I love way his proponents make the sparse number of movements seem like a virtue. It's not, not at $39.95, and not when I KNOW he'll be coming out with another product that reveals some 'secret'; that he's held back until all of the possible income has been derived from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Marketing More info","review":"As with most reviews below, Pavel is more of a salesman than author. Overpriced books that have more ad text than information.There is a line between being a \\"positive\\" coach and a coach with an ego. Pavel travels way past that line, so much that you get mad at him (and yourself for spending too much money).VERY LITTLE worthwhile infomation but try to buy it used or way below cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good As The Film","review":"I love this movie, I love Molly Ringwald, I love that she worked at a record store, I love her car, Annie Potts, Jon Cryer, Andrew McArthy, and all the music on this CD. Opening with OMD's \\"If You Leave\\" it only goes up from there. \\"Left Of Center\\" by Suzanne Vega is the anthem of anyone who ever left on the side lines of the main stream, New Order's \\"Shell Shock\\" - The Smiths brilliant, \\"Please Let Me Get What I Want\\", and my favorite \\"Wouldn't It Be Good\\" (wouldn't it be good to be in your shoes/ even if it was for just one day), \\"Bring On The Dancing Horses\\", the always welcome \\"Pretty In Pink\\", I mean really isn't she? This is pretty much my teenage life caught on CD. Now I need to go out and buy that new version of the DVD that came out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true time-capsule.","review":"\\"Pretty In Pink\\" is what I always think of as one of the first alternative soundtracks. I mean in the mid 80's, this was the cool stuff you had to search out, and other than maybe \\"If You Leave\\", I've never heard any of these on radio. This for me, like many I'm sure, was the introduction to bands like INXS, New Order, The Smiths, and Echo & The Bunnymen, all monsters of 80's alt-rock. All of which I still listen to today. \\"If You Leave\\" was a huge song, and \\"Pretty In Pink\\" got decent play as well. Another track I love is \\"Left Of Center\\", and I saw Suzanne Vega live two years back, and when she played that song it made my night. Overall, if you're a fan of 80's alt-rock, or the film of course, this is a must to own. I guess that's why I have it on CD, cassette, and vinyl."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album will bring you back...","review":"My husband and I attended both high school and college in the 80s, resulting in us being huge fans of the decade's music for life--we even had all 80s music at our recent wedding! This album is part of our vast 80s music collection; it's such a must-have that we bought a replacement when our old CD player destroyed our original copy. The songs wil take you back both to the movie and to the decade, starting with the title track, \\"Pretty in Pink,\\" a huge mainstream hit by a non-mainstream group, the Psycedelic Furs. Other hits from the album include OMD's \\"If You Leave\\" and \\"Left of Center\\" by Suzanne Vega. My favorite, however, is \\"Wouldn't it Be Good,\\" a Nik Kershaw tune nicely covered here by the Danny Hutton Hitters. Finally, fans of more obscure 80s groups such as New Order are likely to enjoy the remaining songs on this tape. For the sake of both nostalgia and the music itself, this album is a must-have addition to any 80s collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Pretty","review":"The soundtrack to the seminal 80's classic Pretty In Pink is almost as the movie itself. In many ways it's tough the not think of OMD's \\"If You Leave\\" and not think of the film. The song is a perfect piece of 80's synth pop and an outright classic. The Psychedelic Furs' 1981 song was the inspiration behind the movie and it elevated the song from an obscure single into another 80's classic (albeit in a re-recorded version for the album). A pre-Luka Suzanne Vega teamed up with Joe Jackson for the haunting and hypnotic \\"Left Of Center\\" and Jesse Johnson provides a little funk with \\"Get To Know Ya\\". Inxs recycle the \\"Listen Like Thieves\\" sound for \\"Do Wot You Do\\" and New Order adds some goth to the scene with \\"Shellshock\\". The picture has been hailed in recent times as a perfect encapsulation of 80's high school and the soundtrack provides the chorus to that voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so pretty.","review":"I remember walking out of the theater thinking, \\"well that was not nearly as good as I thought it would be\\". The sound track was not much different with some exceptions. First of all, the movie version of the song \\"Pretty in Pink\\" is nowhere near as good as the Psychedelic Furs original version. Second, the absence of the Rave-ups \\"Shut Up\\" was disappointing. The sound track is not all bad though. \\"Bring on the Dancing Horses\\" and \\"Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want\\" are excellent and as much as I hate to admit it I love \\"If You Leave\\". The rest is pretty forgettable. If you are looking for a great collection of 80's songs you can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me....","review":"Before I begin, let me tell you this. I am not an 80s person. The only reason I bought this album is because of OMD's \\"If You Leave\\". I really like that song. Turns out the album was nothing like that song to me. The only other song I liked was \\"Shell Shock\\" by New Order. All the other songs were just weird. Many had good music but were destroyed when the singers opened their mouths to sing. Two stars is generous for this CD because I only gave it that because of 2 songs. I am looking to sell my copy. I did not like this album. I don't recommend it unless you are a real 80s music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"I had watched Pretty in Pink a couple of times when I was about four. Years went by, and I found myself in a used CD store, throwing over a couple of bucks for this soundtrack, I went home, stuck it in my CD player, and all of these memories from the movie came rushing back, I cried. It was so odd, I hadn't remembered any of the movie before then, but the minute If you Leave came on, I could picture Andy hugging Ducky....Now, I wouldn't give up this CD even if you payed me, somehow I feel it's conected to my past.Finally, a few months ago, I re-watched the movie, and I have to admit, the soundtrack is better. I liked the movie of course, but it was a little too 80's for my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"great buy, but don't give it away","review":"I had the tape once and gave it to a friend..stupid mistake!The songs are great on here. My favorites are if you leave (omd), shellshock (new order), wouldn't it be good (a nik kershaw cover by danny hutton hitters), please please please let me get what I want (the smiths...A song that is constantly covered over and over again by artists and one of david bowie's favorite songs.

It is the last album they did that was great, anything later and they get too poppy. One of my top 5 albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to love this","review":"I did. I wanted to love this, because Leonard Cohen is the real deal, a poet who works long and hard to produce songs of transcendent loveliness and knowingness. But the reality of it--the Wainwright family and the McGarrigles, and even Nick Cave--is that the singers here have far too much reverence for the material to make it come alive in performance. Except for Cohen himself, but he appears as a performer for only a few minutes. The performances, even by Beth Orton, are just too precious for words. I'd like to see this done again, only this time with Iggy and the Stooges as the main performers. Then we might get some sense of the vitality of Cohen's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing!","review":"I got this as a gift and - thinking it was a documentary on Cohen - was very much looking forward to watching it. Unfortunately, this DVD seems to have been put together by someone who does marketing for the McGarrigle clan (the Wainwrights are kids of one of them), who decided to try to get some face time for these artists by (mis)using Leonard Cohen's name. U2 gains nothing by participating - and the comments by Bono and the Edge were great - but I was hoping for a documentary on the great Leonard Cohen, not some weird performances of his songs by these people that he does/did much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is a crack in everything ...","review":"... That's how the light gets in. From Cohen's great song \\"Anthem\\", the next to the last song on the DVD performed by Perla Batalla and Julie Christensen is the best lead in to the finale - \\"Tower of Song\\" performed by Cohen and U2. Bono is so good on this performance and his apperances throughout the DVD that you can almost get to like him! In fact, his appearances and self depricating manner are a far cry from his - at times -bombastic self promotion as the savior of the world's downtrodden. But, I digress...If you do not know who Leonard Cohen is or have never sampled his music, this is the DVD for you. At first listening, Cohen can turn you right off. But, Rufus Wainwright, his sister Martha and mother Kate McGarrigle make Cohen completely accessible. These are some of the best performances ever given - not just of Cohen, but EVER! \\"I'm Your Man\\" will give you goose bumps as performed by Nick Cave. Get this DVD. You'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leonard Cohen I'm Your Man","review":"If you like Leonard Cohen, forget this DVD. Cohen sings only one song at the end of the DVD. The rest of the songs are done by other people, some of which may even be called singers. It was good to see Julie Christensen and Perla Batella again. If you like Leonard Cohen, buy the Live in London DVD. That one deserves ten stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"what's not to love?","review":"Even if you are not an absolute lover of Leonard Cohen, (which brings me to another point of what is wrong with you anyway??? how can anyone not love him and his work? so full of spirit and soul and questions and love and wisdom?)I know I sound like his loving mother hen that just cannot understand how anyone does not love her chick.So I'll let it go for now and summarize: buy it, watch it and cherish it.A great documentary about a great man."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money","review":"I realy thought this retrospective would join my collection right up there with the \\"The Last Waltz\\" by Robbie Robertson and the Band and Roy Orbison's \\"A Black and White Night\\".

(And sorry, Rufus Wainright is extremely overrated; Antony is just a freak show.) However, I was looking for a documentary about the man's life. There is all of about ten minutes of interview with him and about 5 between Bono and Edge, who themselves looked like they had something much more important to do. They didn't inverview Cohen's Buddhist teacher, but that may be his policy. Really the only insight is that Janis Joplin is the girl in \\"Chelsea Hotel\\" but even that's on Wikipedia.Just read his books folks, after all, 4 minutes of the ten minutes he's interviewed is actually him reading a preface to the Japanese version of one of his own!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful Production","review":"I am a big fan of Cohen and the artists that are on this album. The production quality is painful and distracting from the talent and the message. Sadly I wish this product could have been produced by someone with more expierence.

He opened it 12/1/2012. We watched it this weekend. Neither of us could stomach these punk kids singing Leonard's songs. It was awful. We would mute them singing, then listen to Leonard speak after they were done. These kids were young. They have not lived his life and could never in a million years sing with the passion he has. If you value Leonard Cohen and his beautiful songs and amazing voice, do not buy this. If I could I'd ask for my money back. As it is, it's too late for that and all I can do with this is toss it in the garbage. Love Leonard.

(If you have never heard the original music as sung by Cohen, you will most likely not be anywhere as appalled.) The Wainrights were simply awful. Even Nick Cave, who I used to like, is painful to watch and listen to here. Listening to U2's Edge compare Cohen to Moses was also a scary experience...the last part of the DVD when the old master finally sings his own song but is backed up by U2 (a group about 20 years past their prime) was somewhat redeeming but again, could not hold a candle to the original studio version of that song.Worst of all, the interviews and bits with Leonard Cohen are way too few and far in between.If you want to hear a far better \\"tribute\\" CD to Cohen, I would recommend \\"Tower of Song\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Prized Purchase","review":"This video and the CD of the taping was an eye opener into the world of Leonard cohen.

No doubt you'll find such a declaration hard to believe, but go ahead and waste your time listening to this total flop, right across the board. There's just nothing here, nothing new, nothing interesting.Take the Santana track for example. Sounds completely and uniquely Sanatana, just like you've heard a hundred times before.Sting warps his voice at the start of his song, then settles back into the usual Sting sound - but it's all been heard before, so why would anyone want this?I was most looking forward to what Christina would do with her song, and I found out - taking it in every direction except one that makes sense.This is a product put out by people who think the public is stupid, and will eat up anything.Better off getting the best albums by the individual artists (eg.

This is a reasonable album that is totally redeemed by the fantastic interpretation of \\"Hush, Hush, Hush.\\" The reviewer who complained about Annie Lennox's fade out (which then transitions into some Hancock solo work) totally misses the narrative point of the song. As the character being addressed drifts into what is probably his final sleep, the vocal slips away and a dramatic (and deeply satisfying) harmonic shift takes focus. It's the musical equivalent of the bright white light - brilliant musical storytelling, and utterly moving. It is reason alone to buy the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly great","review":"Herbie is a master, of course, and most of these collaborations are wonderful. A few might be a bit TOO experimental.... but overall a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did Exactly What He Planned...","review":"Everyone is saying this isn't typical Herbie blah blah. That's not at all the intention or vision he had in creating this record. This record was intended to be a mix of people that Herbie himself considered to be greats of there praticular areas of music and wanted them to bring there styles and ideas to te table. If you have HDNET they played a great documentary about the making of this album which taught me much more about Herbie as not only and artist but as a human being.

So, you can tell I have been a devoted follower. This latest release buffles me. What was the point of Herbie's doodling on the piano behind the \\"top of the pops\\" list of characters? I do like Annie Lennox, Sting, Santana but they and Mr. Hancock don't make a good match. I am aware of continuous popular music influence on jazz (best ballads are made of brodway tunes) but this cd does not attempt to interpret, expand or do anything interesting with the material.

No. However, through reading the explanations of different individuals' charts, you will pick up the general understanding of what is where - what these symbols mean.It's a really fun book that doesn't provide too much or too little.

This is an excellent and highly entertaining documentary following the history of the banjo and it's influence on American music, specifically Blue Grass. It seems that this instrument has recently enjoyed a resurgence in popular music used by artists such as Taylor Swift, The Civil Wars, Mumford and Sons, Modest Mouse, etc. and this documentary provides a good history of the instrument.

I make compilations constantly, and these homemade compilations play on all machines but my Harman Kardon FL 8380. Other irritants include the fact that it takes forever to turn on, and it then must cycle through every CD in the machine before allowing you to play music. This cycling happens even after you replace a disc. After a disc is through playing, it returns to that disc if you've opened the machine during the time that disc is playing.

Yes, it's a very pleasant surprise.A man invents a machine which can switch the inward beings (at least the brain) of two humans so....the doctor winds up being a killer while the killer becomes him, the doctor in actions and thoughts. This \\"fact\\" is hidden because the two people still have the old face and body of the person they used to be, so no one else can see the two people have switched \\"identities.\\"Anyway.....there is very good suspense in this film as the good guy tries to save his wife and family from being killed by the deranged human.

It's also a good idea to have Head First Java (2nd Edition, Sierra, Bates) in your bookshelf with the others - plus anything by Cay Horstmann (Core Java I and Core Java II.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic device works well","review":"This device performs very well for the price range that it is in.All of the fuctions will meet most requirements for basic sound mesurement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great life lessons!","review":"guy doud is a delightful speaker, and this recording has so many wonderful life lessons for people of all ages. doud reveals his own past to us, and the inspiration that led him to teach and touch the lives of others, which led doud to become the recipient of the \\"teacher of the year\\" award. he reveals to us that it can only take one word to either make or break a child. doud's speaking ability is amazing, his message inspiring. he captures the attention of his audience, creating a desire within the heart to be a better, kinder person. i recommend this to anyone who would teach... and don't all of us teach in some capacity?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun","review":"I received some of these as a gift in the past and loved them.

(Those books were published in1961 originally.)Actually \\"OVERSIZED\\" is a understatement..as it is 50 by 30cm.

Sounds weird but if you can\\"search for images online\\" you will see that it was VERY charming and innocent.I can't imagine that many of these fragile beautiful books survived..but for alover of Anglund's work they are a joy to behold indeed. Very worth the search!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Israel's Politics of Nationhood","review":"This is a fantastic book -- it actually starts before the Holocaust with the battle of Tel-Hai and the death of Yosef Trumpledor and touches also on the ghetto fighters, the Exodus affair, the Kastner trial, the Eichmann trial, the 1967 war, and the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin -- focused on exploring the treatment of the Holocaust and related issues by the Israeli political elite (especially Ben-Gurion) in their quest to craft an \\"Israeli national identity.\\" As mentioned, the book touches on a number of different incidents and issues, but the keystone is the Eichmann trial and Hannah Arendt's book \\"Eichmann in Jerusalem\\" and the controversy that accompanied it. It is quite clear that Zertal is an admirer of Arendt, and has published on Arendt and her work before. It is well footnoted and very accessable (that is, you don't have to be an academic to really get a lot out of this book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone in 60 Seconds 2 was great, everything else a letdown","review":"I'm from Toby's hometown and really enjoyed the unfinished Gone in 60 Seconds 2 which was filmed in our area.

Deadline Auto Theft is actually the original Gone in 60 Seconds with some very minor editing. It is well established that Gone in 60 Seconds 2 is unfinished and this shows the stunt sequences that would have been in that film. That amounts to about 33 minutes of car chases with no storyline to speak of. If you've seen the original Gone in 60 Seconds, acquiring this film will be an extraordinary waste of time unless for some reason you insist on seeing the complete Halicki body of work, in which case, the special features are quite nice. Everyone else should get this, or the original Gone in 60 Seconds, not both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delta 36-U30 Uni Fence","review":"The name speaks for itself.

Several experienced kayakers that we met at the river (and paddled with for safety) were impressed with the skills we had achieved - this was a section of river not generally navigated by canoeists. We only flipped once and confidently avoided any dangerous situations. This was a good kick start to a lifestyle that I think we both will enjoy for many years to come. The book is straightforward but very thorough. Mr. Grant's writing style makes what could have been a dry technical treatise an enjoyable read. The appendices at the end with gear manufacturers and additional sources of information are concise and very useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT BOTH BOTTLES","review":"This is terribly misleading.

As years went by there were a lot or R&B. And, there was the Motown sounds, along came the Disco era. Music was popping off everywhere, and I lost the sounds of Johnnie Taylor. I have now rediscovered Johnnie Taylor like an old lover. I just can't get enough of his music. He tells a story in his music, a story that many can relate to in our past relationships, some relationships worked, some didn't. Johnnie captures these experinces in his music. I think this album represent the best of Johnnie Taylor on a high note. I give it a high five.

Short in terms of songs, only 10, 1 is almost a classic, 1 is ok, the other 8 are very solid songs.

I heard him on some M.O.P. projects and his voice and flow stand out and he keeps it goin' on this album as well. Prodcution is decent.

Installation was not bad however we did not get a template in the box. Sound quality is like a little protable radio so don't expect it to be the quality of, say a boom box...it's not there. The Bass Boost is worthless, I notice no difference when it's on. You should also be aware that the reception is very poor. I was not able to get stations I can get on all other radios. The attenna is in the power cord which must be stretched all the way out for mediocre reception so plan on having run room for the cord. I was very dissapointed with this product and would not recommend it. For half the price you can get a small boom box or radio that will sound much better. The stations are not easily set.

The sound quality is terrible. The volume mysteriously turns down on the radio and the only way to fix it is to either turn up the volume (and then get blasted away when the volume unexpectly increases!) or turn off/on the radio.

I've got to hand to each of you 23...you knew what you were talking about. This is a scorcher!Not sure there's much I can add that hasn't already been said. You're probably checking these reviews because you're a fan of the slide guitar. You probably already like Derek Trucks, and Luther Dickinson, and Robert Randolph. You'll dig this one...no doubt!The last time I was this floored by a guitarist and backing band on a live recording was the first time I heard Ronnie Earl's \\"Blues Guitar Virtuoso Live In Europe\\". Yes, it's THAT good! Sonny is amazing and the band is tight.Make that 24 straight 5-star ratings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonny Landreth Live...Whew...","review":"I've been lucky enough to have seen Sonny Landreth live six or seven times now in remarkably different settings. I saw him play lead for John Hiatt, I've seen him open for Buddy Guy at the Fillmore, I've seen him at Blues Festivals and fortunately, I've seen him several times with this, his regular band.Sonny doesn't write great great tunes, they're alright, but the thrill is in hearing his mastery of slide guitar and his tremendous sense of dynamics. Nobody understands the power and technique of slide the way he does, and no one can rip it up and then bring it way down to such effect, either.This is a great live set and while it doesn't totally replicate his live show, it gives a good taste of what he's up to and just how damn good he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grant Street","review":"I found this album to be pretty repetitive. The third cut has a crisp, rocking beat and the last one is a nice embellishment of his somewhat hit tune Congo Square."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speed isn't everything","review":"It should be said that Sonny Landreth is blindingly fast on guitar. Yet, after trying to like this album for more than a week, I just do not. And the reason is that my ears detect no soul at all in his playing. I am reminded of several other virtuoso guitarists (Walter Trout and Johnny Winter most specifically) who make an awful lot of noise, but very little listenable music. I am also missing entirely the Blues aspect of this recording. It's rock-and-roll. A little more attention to melody and continuity, and less fret-finger acrobatics, would help a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celebrating the South WAY DOWN South","review":"This is an outstanding celebration of the power of playing a genre you love, in a venue you adore, in front of people in synch with the event and the music. I 'tracked' down Sonny Landreth via my love of John Hiatt. I've collected JH records from the beginning and seriously thought no slide guitarist could ever surpass Ry Cooder's style on Lipstick Sunset. I was wrong....heard Beneath This Gruff Exterior and immediately went on line to find out more. Living in the deep South of New Zealand on line is often the only/best way to find out about people like Sonny who don't frequent the air raves. I have every SL cd and love each of them for different reasons. Grant Street, I think, is the culmination/coming of age/combination of all of these into a pure format that packs power and passion.

I'm kind of shocked that other reviewers are dishing five stars so liberally. I thought these were all pretty boring. These (4) stories have potential at times and do manage to tickle you with an oddity here and there, humor as well, but it's too slow and a little lacking in the entertainment vector (and I really hate Dargo's new 'softer side'). Shamefully, I admit the primary reason I don't like these episodes is the lack of space scenery or battles. Not many special effects and locations are a little average and low budge.

A bad pressing I think.I had to reattach the jacket with some glue and clean up the record.Despite doing all of this.The vinyl had many pops and clicks.I had to sell the album and buy another one in a local store.This one was much better.I don't know what's happening with the US pressings.The same happened with the Beatles Vinyl box set 2012(this item wasn't bought on Amazon),but It's somethig it's happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deluxe Edition: Audiophiles Need Not Apply","review":"I had high hopes for this release since I've had very good luck with all of Universal's other Deluxe Editions, but unfortunately, this one ended that win streak. This version is overly bright and suffers from digititis, much like the previous remaster, but not quite as severe.If you already own a previous version and are simply looking for an upgrade in sound, I can see no reason for you to spend your good money on this since you already own something that sounds similar to (2002 remaster) or better than (MFSL or the original CD version) this release. The original CD release, and especially the MFSL version, are vastly superior to this - pretty disappointing since even the reining champ, the MFSL release, sounds like it could be significantly improved upon.

I simply can't be without it. When I listen to these songs it takes me back to my senior year of high school, staying up all night to type out my senior theme that I had procrastinated too long on...while listening to this beautiful music over & over. I remember driving aimlessly for hours just so I could listen to it cranked up high without parents yelling to turn it down. A true classic that is like visiting an old dear friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A RARE GEM","review":"Although this recording is older than many of us, it sounds current and vital. \\"Take The Long Way Home\\" is so incredibably melodic and well constructed, it makes Britney drop her spears.

Worth the \\"upgade?\\" No. I am so tired of the record companies releasing \\"deluxe editions\\" when they are anything but deluxe. In the case of Breakfast in America, you are paying for an overly processed \\"remaster\\" with a live album of material that has nothing to do with this album in a direct fashion.

There was also no missing pages which is really good, otherwise I would have definitely sent it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't","review":"After seeing that the book is on the bestseller list, I decided to read it. It was so disappointing - Hui was trying hard to be an Amy Tan, which she clearly isn't.Even the use of Shanghai as a location was a bad idea. The reader could not get a feel of the city - in fact, the characters could be living in another country.Instead of reading this novel, buy a fashion magazine instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love and Sex in a Big City","review":"Those who criticized the book for lacking the spirit of Shanghai- who say that it could take place in any large city- missed Wei Hui's point. The main character is a 27 year old girl finding her way through the glitter and glam of a large city teaming with global influences. This is no traditional China and she is certainly not a traditional girl. Whether or not Wei Hui is the voice of a new generation and whether or not this book represents those born in China (or at least Shanghai) in the 70s is not important. Its not a glimpse into the China foreigners love to imagine- its a glimpse into the life of a twenty-something beatnik city dweller who just happens to be Chinese. If you want a book about love and sex that reads like the poetic prose of Banana Yoshimoto you've found the book. If you're looking for something that depicts the stereotypes of Asian women that you have in your head, go read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"As typical as other new generation of Chinese popular writers nowadays, this's a tasteless so-call semi-autobiography, full of self worshiping, and it's shallow to the point of laughtable.

I lived in Beijing for about a year and a half and i can say that the superfluous and plastic life that Coco lives in this book does not show at all the reality of China. In fact the only thing she talks about is going out to fancy restaurants, listening to western rock-bands, and wearing designer clothes...She ends up going out with a westerner, married, rich, and with a big d..k.To sumarize: boring, predictive, simple written... And again the biggest marketing thing they got is that it was forbidden in China...Oky"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost a TORTURE to read","review":"I found this book hidden in my basement. The book started badly and ended even worse. As I was reading, I kept wishing that it would get better but it never did. However, this is a good book for quick reading on the subway or bus. It is extremely shallow and does not require much thinking. It reminds me of a poorly written Harlequin. In fact, some Harlequins may even be better.The author attempts to tackle modern day issues but failed miserably. Her views in life is limited and unrealistic. The characters lacked depth - every character was vain and sex crazed. Her constant description of how beautiful the heroin was and the tight clothing she wore got annoying. The sex scenes are repetitive to an extent where it appears that the same words are used. The setting of Shanghai appears to be irrelevant and misrepresented in many ways.I give this book 2 stars.

I made it through the book and got a party idea from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"very superfacial","review":"I find the characters in the book very superfacial, particularly the Baby, to the point, she is annoying.Maybe it is banned, because it is too bad.

There are plenty of great Chinese contemporary writers out there; Jung Chang, Dai Sijie, Gao Xingjian to name a few. This book is not as controversial as depicted. Nonetheless, I found it very skanky and tasteless. If this wannabe Amy Tan has another job, she should keep it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche, predictable, stereotypical, and boring","review":"Seriously, how many more of these type of books are Amy Tan wanna-be going to write.

Nothing special."},{"rating":"1","title":"exaggerated, just try to make herself standout. don't buy it","review":"I also read the chinese version of this book. is it a literature? definitely not in chinese. I just feel the author is getting the stories from Penthouse or playboy and bundled with a little thing about Shanghai.The story itself is neither interesting or surprising. She tried to make the contrast of having a loved one who have problem in sex and another German who can satisfied her in sex. I'd say this is a BAD book and not worth to read at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"no genius here","review":"drug-glorifying, pseudo-intellectual, narcissistic crap with little or no depth. the author goes into unnecessary detail about her 'wet spots' and her perverse sexual desires probably in an attempt to be provocative, fresh or insightful. whichever, it didn't work for me. although desperately trying to be one, this author is not a genius. there are a few passages where the rays of truth fight their ways through thick clouds of the inflated image of a meaningless, artsy fartsy wannabe philosophical shanghai subculture. hence two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"sick!sick!sick!

This was the worst book I have ever read! After the first few chapters, I couldn't take it anymore and simply glanced through each chapter to the end just to see if it might get better.The plot was shallow, the metaphors too over the top. I'm not a prude, but the sex scenes grossed me out as each body part was explicitly named......talking about your vulva or uterus during sex is NOT sexy! ew!I'm guessing she didn't have any editors helping her with this? In any case, it should not only be banned in China, it should be banned from all bookshelves worldwide in an effort to discourage bad writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Obessed and Stupid","review":"The book is full of depressing lives filled with lust, and nothing else.But what is the point? That some people in the material Shanghai are just empty inside? That sex is everything they have to fill the holes and emptiness?Credit given to the hot sex scenes, but these alone does not make a good book.And it is a shame that its ban in China (as you can imagine its negative influence on teenagers) has been used as a marketing tool to promote it in the West.Lucy Chen"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Cheesy!","review":"This book was a terrible read! It was monotonous and boring, and the translation was pretty cheesy. The author is repetitive and uses Western references in a tiring manner. Even as an Asian woman, I still couldn't relate to the characters because they were so underdeveloped. I can't figure out what it was about Tian Tian that Coco was so in love with. She just \\"fell\\" for him, no questions asked. If you're searching for meaning in this book and yada yada like some of the other readers here, I guess you might be able to find (or make up) something if you look hard enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing read, had some poetic phrases","review":"This was a rather disappointing read, I enjoyed her writing style but it went into way too many descriptions, and I was more interested to see how the dialogue & the story will develop. The characters were well described and introduced, but nothing much really happened to them. The references to Tian Tian's upcoming death took away any thrill that would have caused, so the surprise was taken away. The encounters with her lover were not bad, the story was just not going anywhere. References to feminisim were weak and did not mkae for a good argument. I sadly do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad bad Beautiful Author","review":"This book gave a headache for me. Especially when this Coco adores herself too much. As the story moves further this young lady shows more and more of her fineness. She's beautiful, independent, smart, lenglei, fashion-wise, open, different, controversial, lovable and sexy. The most irritating of all is when this 'very fine young lady' conducted a game of poem and flowers in her party. Flowers for the most beautiful and poem for the smartest. You guessed it right! She got so many of both. How pathetic.After all, this overly light novel is smartly written to welcome outburst of controversy in China. I recommend this book for Malaysians and fellow Asians (this is an example of a minor Asian's true lifestyle) and just forget this if you're Westerners finding the unique way of Asian life."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"i work at an independent bookstore and this caught my eye. however, as soon i started to read it, it became clear to me that this book book is badly written. it's obtuse, with unbelievable characters. the protagonist is unusual at best, and the plot is just not engaging. i exchanged it the next day for something else"},{"rating":"1","title":"shallow river","review":"I must admit it's kind of surprising to find such a degree of directness in a novel set against the backdrop of an oriental city like Shanghai. I never expected to encounter sex as steamy as dim-sum. But after an initiation in modern China's version of 'sex, drugs and rock 'n roll', I couldn't help thinking: 'What's next? When does 'it' happen?' But there is no 'it' to happen. Like a shallow river this novel keeps on flowing, but fails to reach any depth. It is like fast food: convenient enough to appease one's hunger, but too superficial to make a lasting impression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy Tan she is not","review":"And thank goodness for it. I am a big fan of Amy Tan, but if you're looking for a mystical view of China, you won't find it in Hui's book. If you want to verify that she could be the voice of the younger generation of Chinese, you should probably discuss the book with them for yourself.Coco may not be a likable main character. So? Neither was Anna Karenina. I'm not comparing Hui's book to Tolstoy's classic novel, but a likable heroine is not a prerequisite for a good book.Hui does a wonderful job of weaving in the atmosphere of Shanghai among her poetic prose that it's always a bit of a shock to put the book down and return to your own world. She illustrates the interesting mélange of Western and Eastern flavors of the city as she allows us to follow a bit of the life of Coco, the narcissistic journey of youth to find one's place in the world.My advice to you is to give to book a try for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"RACIST GARBAGE!","review":"If you still think all Jews are greedy scheisters and all African Americans are lazy and stupid, then you'll love this book too. The lack of insensitivity amazes me and is an indicator of the warped mental state of the author. The author seems intent on exploiting old racial stereotypes in order to make a tidy profit on the book. The storyline is poorly constructed and has no focus. It lacks imagination and seems as though it was written just to make money. Take my advice, do not waste your $$ on this book! This is a 2 thumbs down crock of horsehay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shanghai Baby Flop!","review":"When I first heard that this book was banned in China and that it was a bestseller, I was eager to buy it. After having read it, I can't say I could or would possibly recommend it to anyone. I found the author trite, banal and narcissistic. It certainly was a far cry from Anchee Min's Becoming Madam Mao or Amy Tan's The Hundred Secret Senses. Everything written within seemed shallow and hollow, despite the overtones of sex, excitement in the big city and the world of artists. The author tries to expose the new generation x'ers of China, but I feel she has not succeeded. She has merely plodded on about herself, her deep love of Tian-Tian and the ever physically satifying love affair with Mark the Western-mystique. Whatever! I'm really not sure how the book was given rave reviews. As for China banning it...I think it was merely a decision to step away and keep a good distance from such an awful piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of sex scenes with little content","review":"I read the Original Chinese version, I find it rather dissapointing. With all the hypes about this new raising author, I thought the story was pretty shallow.A lot of details on sex scenes and derogative lifestyles of the new Shanghainese generation.

Because it was banned , the marketing hype calls the book \\"real China of today\\" and cool, and it represents modern China. You almost feel from the raving reviews that there is this great movement and turmoil and as if every one in Coco's age is like her. Perhaps you should see how the young really live in China, just like how the world perceives America vs how we really are. Good grief! The writing is hollow and hard to sympathize when one really knows what is happening in China.

And what can she do about her attraction to one of the suspects?I started out liking the book. I found the humor fun and the character likable. But the plot was boring. I figured out a key plot point chapters before Desiree did. There is a subplot concerning a friend's husband that adds nothing but pages to the story.

The full list of the track is included on the product description, so I won't list that here. I was puzzled by the absence of the song \\"It's Alright\\", which was used at one point and nobody except the makers of this film seem to have heard of. I noticed some folks' complaining about the inclusion of Cronauer's broadcasts, and the supposedly poor quality of the soundtrack. Don't know what either bunch is talking about, really. Both sound just fine to me. And if the broadcasts become tiresome quickly, odds are the movie will too, and that's a shame, because \\"Good Morning, Vietnam\\" is one of the best I've ever seen.Included on the front and back of the case are some images of Cronauer and other characters, as well as a full track list.

Don't care for that song that much. Both were on the movie, but I guess they wanted a song for every feeling or sediment.

The only disappointment is that I thought I was ordering the same Kilty as my brown pair. However, those have a continuous piece of smooth leather inside the base of the shoe. This has two pieces sewn/glued in. You can feel the seems a little, especially the edges by your toes. The leather is adjusting to my feet with time, but these are not quite the perfect comfort shoes of my other pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed, wrong shoes","review":"I was sent a pair of soft sole moccasins. The top of the shoe looks very cute but I can not ever wear these outside so whats the point, I didn't buy slippers. The description and picture of the shoes, in all colors, shows a rubber sole.

My only problem is want them in grey, brown and black too..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfy","review":"Have several pairs of Minnetonka mocs which are wearing out - very comfortable, like being barefoot. These were a very satisfactory replacement for my very worn old black pair. The only caveat is that any kind of mocs would not be suitable for someone needing arch support. I have a very high arch, which, even with age and weight, has not, thankfully, \\"fallen\\" or otherwise given me pain. As I age, I am less fashion conscious and more comfort conscious, and much prefer these \\"barefoot wonders\\" to the \\"old lady shoes\\" that I might otherwise be forced into. But the Minnetonkas look good with casual outfits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Moccasins","review":"I bought one for myself last spring and fell in love with them the moment they arrived.

I was expecting a wonderful pair of shoes, considering I already own them in brown and in purple. I have never been more disappointed with an order received from any online company. They were absolutely terrible. One shoe has a rounded tip around the toes, the other is more pointed. They are two different shades of gray. One is a more stiff leather the other not so much, AND one is bigger than the other (and both say size 8). And to top it off Amazon customer service was horrible. I can't see myself ordering from Amazon.com ANY time soon, if ever again. Very, very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great moccasins!!","review":"I purchased these and loved that they came almost immediately.

Guess what they still run big!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfy slippers","review":"These mocs are. nice to wear around the house. I ordered a half size down as other reviews suggested that I do.

So, if you are looking for something to wear like slippers these fit the bill!"},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd pair","review":"These moccasins are super comfortable. This is my second pair and I love them! I usually wear a 7 1/2 but found when I tried them at the store that I was better off getting the 7. Even though they were a bit snug, they stretch after wearing them. I also love that the minnetonka's all run the same; I ordered a pair of boots and just got the same size as the moccasins-perfect fit. Overall great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Moccasins were returned","review":"We were looking forward to receiving these moccasins for my wife but were very disapointed when we found defects in the lacing near the tongue. The top holes for lacing were torn on both shoes and the lacing had pulled out. Obviously a manufacturing defect which should have been caught at the factory! I guess the Chinese are not really up to par on quality control these days. Very disapointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just great","review":"These shoes are just plain great.

Here's the rub, I bought these for my wife for Xmas not knowing that apparently they run big. She tried them on a few weeks later and they were too big. I emailed Footnation and they wouldn't exchange them for another size b/c of their 30 day return policy. Since I purchased them the beginning of Dec, by the time I gave them to her it was already 20+ days into their 30 day policy. Ridiculous. I can understand not RETURNING the shoes after 30 days but to refuse to EXCHANGE them for another size? You've got to be kidding me. In this market you would think stores would bend over backwards trying to keep customers. Wake up retail world, its no longer a booming economy! I would have purchased more shoes from them, but no thanks. I'll find a store that appreciates my business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice suede moccasin, good for around the house/driving","review":"I have had these in 3 different colors, the lighter color, tan, is the nicest but eventually the moccasins started showing dirt/wear. I then ordered the black and brown which are also great. The black I found I needed to wear black socks with as the color transfers to your feet or socks.They are extremely comfortable and have held up well and I have worn them grocery shopping and around town on occasion. But they are not so good to go for a walk in the woods as the soles are very flexible and it becomes uncomfortable walking over rocks, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"a shame","review":"the moccassins arent as described when they came they were softsole when the picture and desription described hardsole moccassins they need to fix this asap"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I rated these shoes one star because I just don't believe any shoe should look this beat up after 3.5 months. I have very rarely worn the shoes outside, mostly just around the house. I don't think they would exist if I ventured out in them. They look sloppy and overrun because the width has stretched so much. And, they stretched width-wise very soon after I started wearing them.I don't think anyone with a slightly narrow foot could wear these. My width is between B and C and these are probably at least a D now. Both of the ties have ripped off, and I probably only tied them a few times. They're comfortable because they're such a wreck they're barely touching my feet anymore. I need to buy new mocassins, but I definitely won't be buying these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Purchase","review":"This Moccasin is exactly what then other reviews stated. Go for the size or half a size smaller then you wear. I just got them the other day and I wore them all day and what a comfortable feeling, they are just perfect and I recommend them over any other ones. All the other reviews helped greatly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice 5.5M Winter Boot","review":"Hard to find a winter boot in 5.5M,so I was very happy to find this boot. Keeps me warm/dry and has good traction. Zipped over my skinny jeans just fine. More of a winter boot than a true rain boot, since it has the lining. I've received many compliments when I wear them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless shoes and bad return policy.","review":"I ordered 3 pairs of Moccasin shoes for family members (upon their request). However, two pair did not work out. I called to ask for their return policy. On their website, they stated that after 30 days, you will need to pay $5 for each pair to return. If in any way you damage their shoe boxes, you will need to pay another $5 for the shoe box. Please, who in the world charge people for shoe boxes???? I will NEVER shop for their shoes again. Also, they make shoes that have no soles. Who in the world wear that kind of shoes????Very bad business practice. I don't know why people give their product such good reviews. Run the other way will be my recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable Mocs!","review":"I had been looking for a pair of moccasin's for awhile. I wear a size 11 so finding shoes of any kind in stores is a bit of a challenge. I saw these on Amazon and was hesitant to order shoes without trying them on first but I went ahead and ordered.Later that week I received them and they actually fit! I wore them the first time for hours and there wa no breaking in period at all. Very comfortable. I do wear thin socks as I found they were a little too snug with my usual white sport type socks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and falls apart","review":"I bought these hoping I could find a shoe to wear around the house. But after owning these for a few months, they have stretched out so much I can no longer wear them. The big toe area has a big hole in the leather, the ties keep coming apart and never stayed tied. I will not buy Minnetonka shoes anymore. Such a shame because they use to be quality made, now they are a piece of nothing. Maybe they are this way because they aren't made in the USA anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect color and comfortable","review":"I love moccasins and have a few pairs and the quality and comfort of minnetonka is above the rest.

So, we haven't been able to do anything yet and it's been nearly a month."},{"rating":"1","title":"This shoe lacks quality","review":"I bought this shoe four months ago. I paid fifty dollars for them, but they did not prove to be worth the money. Unfortunately, after two months the interior bottom started detaching itself from the rest of the shoe; this makes wearing them very uncomfortable. Also, the shoelaces come undone every fifth step, so extensive walking is out of the picture if you don't want to be highly inconvenienced. Overall, the shoe did not meet my basic expectations, and was utterly overpriced for the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong order !!!","review":"What i ordered is Minnetonka Women's Kity Moccasin \\"DUSTY BROWN\\" and what i got is a black one with tiger print on the top front .. though on the box its written dust browngetting a wrong order cost me a lot cause i live outside the US so i have to pay shipping plus customs and returning it via any courier will cost me triple its price ...i will think twice next time if i thought of ordering anything from Minnetonka !!! as i order a lot of things from others and get exactly what i order !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"Good and comfortable shoes,but box looks cheap... the color of it looks like it has been stored for a long time.

Love the feel! Once Spring rolls around (and drier weather), I know I'll be wearing these more.The only problem is that the show runs big. Taking the advice of other reviews, I purchased one full size smaller (5.5 instead of 6.5). The shoes are very snug, and I know the leather will stretch out...but the soles feel just a tad bit short under my toes now. There's going to be a tradeoff between the two - either wear the shoes loosely and buy a half size smaller or buy it a full size smaller have to feel that your toes are starting to extend beyond the front of the soles.I would purchase a second pair a half size smaller to see if it's a better fit...but it's a tad bit pricey for me to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly satisfied","review":"I love these shoes they are very comfortable, they came in time and were a good price.my only complaint is that they run a little big."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minnetonka Moccasin","review":"I think these shoes are very comfortable.

This is the largest size I ordered. I have several stands some purchased online in the states and others purchased in the orient. This stand is far inferior to all others. It is very light weight and flimsy. Even without a fish bowl the stand wobbles badly. An 11 inch stand is for a large Fish Bowl.

I believe my headaches to be sinus related because they are in the center of my forehead just above my eyebrows and I do have alergies.

Thereafter I only use it when I feel stuffiness coming on. It keeps my sinus' running and nose is clear. No headaches from sinus pressure and I really like that. I would recommend this product to anyone with sinus, allergy problems. It works better than anything else I've tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't deliver relief","review":"After reading the previous reviews for this product, I was excited to purchase it and feel the sinus relief and freedom from headaches it seemed to promise. I gave it a real shot (two weeks), and wanted to believe in it, but ultimately, it didn't provide any sinus clearing action or prevent headaches. Think about it, you have a headache, and shoot PEPPER EXTRACT up your nose to relieve it? I was hoping for a homeopathic solution to some painful ailments, but didn't find it here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe alternative to Afrin","review":"When it comes to head colds, especially the really bad ones when you can only breath through your mouth there's nothing more tempting than squirting some Afrin into your nose. It is a miracle drug no doubt but easily habit forming. You shouldn't use it (Afrin) for more than 3-5days max. This last cold of mine has been dragging on and after 5 days I know I need to stop with the Afrin. I tried this as an \\"all natural\\" alternative, let me tell ya it's not for the weak, it's like snorting Pepsi up your nose. It works well, about 75% as well as Afrin works but you can use it after you've used the Afrin for a few days. I'll try it other days too for when I have a headache or bad allergys. Good stuff overall, worth a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally relief!","review":"I rarely post a product review. However after using Sinus Buster for over a week I'm a believer. I suffer from allergy congestion and sinus headaches which can quickly turn into a migraine. I take prescription allergy medicine but still seem to fight nasal congestion. This product clears my sinus and knocks down my sinus headaches FAST! I only have to use it once or twice a day. Sure it has a slight burning sensation but it is tolerable for the relief it provides. A few seconds of discomfort for hours of clear headache free breathing is a solid trade off for me. As with any product I'm sure nothing works for everyone. But this product works great for me. Substantially fewer headaches, clear nasal passages. AWESOME."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH MY WORD....","review":"First off when you hear or read about the burn take that an add to 10 times.It is on the pricey side first off but i was willing to try anything, with that said tried it in the morning and yes I said a lot of bad words and shed some tears, then waited. By the afternoon i was more stuffed up then i was in the morning before taking this, so i thought maybe you need to take it a few times before it really started to work so once again I sprayed and swore and cried...and what happend my nasal congestion got even worse to the point I couldn not breath at all through my nose... I wont use again.. not worth the money.. I could of dealt with the burning/stinging if this product work I will say the bruning only lasted 10 seconds at the most..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this stuff!","review":"If \\"0\\" stars had been an option, I'd have given it. I bought this product to clear up chronic nasal congestion so I could dive without being dependent on stuff like Sudafedrine which makes me hyper. Everything folks wrote about the burning is true. But what was MUCH WORSE for me is that I could NOT stop sneezing (and I mean ALL day) or breathe through my nose for almost 3 months after discontinuing it - and I only used for about a week. The sad part is that I mistakenly thought I had developed a new allergy. Ha! I probably had zero functioning nasal mucosa left!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't use it!!","review":"I'm surprised at all of the positive reviews on this product. I too suffer from year round allergies and I thought I would give this a try (something natural for once). I followed the directions and sprayed a little bit into each nostril, but the burning sensation was too much for me. It's like stuffing chili peppers into each nostril. That's how much it burned. My eyes have never watered so much in my life. You forget about the congestions for a moment, because it feels like your nose is on fire. I'll stick with Afrin or Zycam for nose sprays from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Work","review":"About the Pain - Like anything that can cause discomfort, each person's individual pain threshold will determine how something like this affects them. I probably fall some where in the middle, so the pain was definitely intense, but didn't last too long, and would have been worth it if it had done anything...About the Relief - Unfortunately, the relief was non-existent for me. Admittedly, I have chronic sinus issues, but this product did nothing at all for me. If it helped at all, it would only provide relief for a minute or two. Most often, not even that. I have tried it off and on for a month or so and have finally given up that it would ever give me any relief under any condition, even when i'm just slightly stuffy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stings","review":"Perhaps I am the only one...however...spray this in your nose and there is a shocking sting...I was amazed...and there was little relief like Afrin...I was hoping to stop using Afrin but not with this...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes","review":"WOW.

It was no help at all for that purpose, I had to tough it out. However, after two weeks free of the Oxymetazoline nasal spray, this truly helps open my sinuses better than saline. I do like the product very much, but gave only two stars because the bottle leaks with use. It is too expensive to waste half the liquid in this way, so can't truly recommend it for that reason. Going to try a different brand next purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Product ever","review":"I am an unlucky sufferer of pregnancy rhinitis. I get stuffed to the point of 0% air coming into my nose. Thus creating the additional issue of chapped lips and just generally looking pathetic.I am stuck though. I bought this crap in hopes that I could break my need for Afrin since Afrin is the only thing that works. Not a chance in hell.I used it while at work. I ran out - spent the $16 on the crap and to my genuinely furious surprise got a bee sting pain in my nose and my nose completely shut off all air flow.I am absolutely disappointed since I was specifically told not to use Afrin anymore but now I must suffer more.My nose looks like Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and I feel like I have had Mace sprayed in my nose.BEWARE - if you have allergies this will only make them worse!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pepper Spray In Your Nose Ouch !!!!!","review":"This item is 100% trash when. I used it the first few seconds where heavy burning witch the box said then after that my nose blocked up like a brick wall.

I'm very sad to say that for me, this stuff does not work as quickly, easily or thoroughly as Afrin. I'm profoundly disappointed, since I don't want to go back to the Afrin, but sometimes in the middle of the night, I NEED to be able to breathe through my nose for my CPAP device.Ugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mountaintop","review":"The product does exactly what it said it would do-clears your sinuses immediately to relieve the pressure and headache due to allergies.

No sinus trouble for 4+ years","review":"This stuff is the BEST!!! I've been using it for over 4 years and I've yet to have a sinus infection and I suffered from them for years--overusing antibiotics along the way. Burns like mad, but works so well! Even helps with those awful migraines! The metered dose bottle is easier to use than the spray, so worth the small amount more. Also, it does lose it's effectiveness after about a year, so I always buy a fresh bottle just before flu & cold season, and I use it daily as a preventative. It is yellow colored, so don't be alarmed to see yellow spots on your tissue after using, and don't use with your favorite handkerchief!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire in the hole!","review":"In my experience with this product it is just a hot poke in the nose.

Even though it was more money than I cared to spend, I thought if it worked it be worth it. I am congested most of the time and would love a natural nose spray that does not effect the nasal passages like they say Afrin and other products like it do. I was EXTREMELY disappointed with Sinus Buster nasal spray. First of all, IT HURT!! I like spicy food as much as the next person, but this does not compare to that in any way. After spraying it twice in one nostril, I reallyyy didnt want to spray it in the other, but again I thought if this works the pain would be worth it. Well after spraying it twice in both nostrils with ABSOLUTELY ZERO relief, I've come to the conclusion that it does NOT work.

Burning nose, burning eyes, watering eyes, etc. It almost knocked my to the ground. This is not \\"discomfort\\" as the package says. It is pure pain and unnecessary. And after all that, very little relief, if any. No one should have to suffer like this. It may work for some and I am glad it does, but not for me. I tried twice and I am throwing it out. A waste of $14. It honestly felt like someone punched me in the face after one spray of this product!!! I could not believe it. I will try something else.

The main ingredient is YES, Capsaicin pepper! Look closely at the label and you will see the RED PEPPER with the words Capsaicin pepper on it! Feel the Power is NO LIE!!! Your sinuses will burn so bad you'll wish you could stick a fire hose up your nose to make it STOP! IN MY OPINION, SAVE YOUR MONEY AND SNIFF CAPSAICIN PEPPER (RED PEPPER) FROM YOUR SPICE CABINET IF YOU WANT THE SAME eye watering, SEVERE sinus burning effect! Hurts so much I almost hit the floor and my eyes watered for a long time! No way am I spraying that in my nose EVER again! Scared to even try the Allergy Buster I purchased at the same time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"this product is horrible.. do not ever buy it. it does not work. it burns like hell. but will give you NO RELIEF. if you want real relief.. buy sinex by vicks. it works . doesnt burn. instant relief. DO NOT EVER BUY SINUS BUSTER"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely useless product","review":"I'm not going to go into my life story here; I'm just going to be blunt and straight forward. This stuff isn't worth the powder it would take to blow it to hell! Seriously, I can't figure out how it has gotten this popular! Aside from the intense pain and momentarily disoriented feeling after this garbage hits your sinuses, it has zero effect! If you just feel like throwing away 10 - 15 bucks that's fine, but buy your self some of the real stuff too because you will need it to do what the Sinus Buster doesn't... Clear your sinuses! I'm sorry if you were looking forward to using this and not having to rely on the cycle that follows the real stuff (I was too), but it's the truth, this will do nothing but give you a short and painful burn in your nose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for BBQing on Ribs, Chicken or Steak!!!","review":"I tried this stuff and it's HOT!! Hot in the nostrils, and Burns like a Hemorrhoid!! Wow!!But I did spray it on meat while I was cooking on the grill. Works Good for that!! All the meat was Spicy, and Tender, as well as Juicy. I gave it only 2 stars because I ran out of it while I was Grilling, and needed a bigger bottle! :("},{"rating":"1","title":"mixed reviews.","review":"Well a large percentage have given 1 star terrible ratings and a lot have given great 5 star reviews. Either A. Lots of the good reviews are fakes or B. The people that are addicted to afrin/ oxymetazoline or those that have rhinitis medicamentosa are trying this and expecting it to work like afrin or cure their condition but are in fact not helped because the rebound effect of RM is causing there sinuses to swell shut and that it is not actually the fault of the capseicin not working. Does anyone who doesn't use the chemical sprays get relief from this product? Maybe. But the ones that have existing conditions shouldn't expect this to work like their existing drug does or cure the issues caused by other medications. I'd like to see some more conclusive reviews but I am leaning toward this product being a gimmick and not actually providing serious relieve to normal stuffiness. And that there might be a lot of sham positive reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOLY BURNING SINUS CAVITY, BATMAN!!","review":"That stuff hurts! What little it did to relieve the sinus pressure sure wasn't worth the pain it caused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel the Burn","review":"Yes, a burning sensation was expected when using this product, but it's a strong sensation. It'd be worth it if this stuff actually, you know, WORKED. Which, sadly, it did not for this consumer. Tried it on four separate occasions, no relief."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Pain...\\"","review":"My husband bought me a bottle of this to try. I'd had a bad sinus headache for over a week and he heard a commercial on the radio for this product and figured I could give it a try. Later that night I went to use it and it HURT! (major understatement). Well, I guess my husband didn't believe me too much on how bad it was so he tried it the next night. I tried warning him but he was determined. He took it into the bathroom and I just sat there listening... then I heard it. First the spray come out of the bottle, then the scream of \\"oh my God!!!\\" I was rolling over laughing! But seriously, fair warning -don't touch this stuff! It really does hurt more than any nasal spray should and for me, it made me even more stuffy. The only good that came out of our experience with it is getting to read the funny reviews of others that have had the same pleasurable experience. I'm giving it one star for the entertainment value of sharing this story ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurts so good","review":"I get sinus headaches a lot, constantly have sinus congestion, this stuff works pretty well. It hurts pretty bad, but I think it's worth it. Just deal with the burning, funny smell and tears you might have. My only concern is what prolonged use might do to you (besides give you a higher pain tolerance). This is also a hilarious thing to use with friends around."},{"rating":"2","title":"This really helps!","review":"I have suffered from severe sinus headaches for 30 years and this is the first over the counter product that actually provides some instant relief. It does not totally make the headache go away, but with all except the most severe of them, Sinus Buster takes the pain from being something I can't stop thinking about to a background nuisance. It subsides the pain enough that I am able to resume activities such as working with much better concentration since I am not distracted by the pain. I would recommend this to anyone with sinus problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Charming Performance","review":"The technical aspects of this presentation, such as the camera work, are superb. Each song is treated with a different cinematographic technique, approaching Caetano from unusual perspectives and providing a dynamic panorama of his artistry. The fact that Caetano is on stage yet an audience is never visible seems a bit strange, but who needs an audience in order to enjoy this performance? My favorite number is Terra, for the relaxed bliss with which Caetano performs this powerful song. His guitar solos near the middle section of the show are also very charming. Overall, this has to be one of the best music DVDs in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Brazilian music lovers!","review":"I fell in love with the music from Brazil thru the notes of Gilberto Gil and Antonio Carlos Jobim. I felt that what they did was perfection, and nothing could be done to improve it. How sadly mistaken I was!. A new generation pops up every year, and Caetano Veloso holds the flag as the premier singer-songwrite-arranger-musician extraordinaire!This Concert sends chills down my spine right at the start, when the drummers take the stage and start with a very unusual intro to Minha voz, minha vida. My brain was not ready for all the wonderful noises that came then... I recommend this DVD to anyone with a fine taste for modern brazilian music. Much better if you have the latest state of the art equipment to play it with... you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad camera work","review":"This is great music and I love the CD but this is a really bad movie. The camera work is terrible and I could barely watch it once. Buy the CD but skip the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The end of a saga","review":"As always, Mr. McKiernan has written an outstanding novel. The novel ties up all the loose ends and prophecies from the previous novels. Bair was a great character and McKiernan did an outstanding job of developing him and his relationship with Aravan. I found the idea of Bair questioning Adon's previous actions quite fascinating. I only wished McKiernan spent more time discussing that aspect of the novel. Also, the section in the novel where Dalavar spoke to and tried to convince the dragons to switch sides was classic. Its sad to think that this may be the last novel about Mithgar. I pray that McKiernan will decide to write at least one more."},{"rating":"1","title":"The same 10 to 20 pages repeated over and over for 500 pages","review":"Just another of the endless sagas, with much detail but little story! The characters get on their horses and off, they tie them up, talk for a while, then get on again; The author repeats this cycle over and over again with a little action thrown in every 70 pages or so! If you love minute detail and endless repetition then you'll love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blues by a Great Artist","review":"Brought back a lot of memories - I saw him live in Chicago.He was one of the great ones, right along with Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This watch was a disappointment for what you pay for it. It is hard to read at an angle, the countdown timer you would use to start a race is difficult to use and nearly inaudible. The concept behind this watch is neat, it looks nice, but Suunto should update this product and stop selling this particular watch. For a simpler, more user friendly Suunto sailing watch I recommend the M3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unhappy with Watch","review":"I have been sailing for some time now and received the watch as a long awaited sailing gift.It is a little big, but I got over that very quickly. I had the watch for about 9 months and was preparing for an ocean voyage. I was looking forward to the compass feature. Two days before the voyage the compass went crazy and has not worked since.The really annoying thing about the watch is the necessity to look \\"directly\\" into the face. If you look at an angle, you might see any array of numbers imaginable, fives are sixes or eighths, and ones become eleven. The date 9-15 becomes 8-16. It is really maddening.I admit I haven't been back to the manufacture yet, but these problems should not occur to begin with.Be advised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Owned three, never will I own a 4th","review":"I can't tell you how frustrated I am with this Yachtsman watch. I sail over 10,000 miles per year on average and really need to have a watch with the features that this Yachtsman provides. However, I cannot afford to keep replacing watches and bands.I have owned THREE Yachtsman's. One of these was a warranty replacement. I have four sailing friends who also bought Yachtsman because I owned one. Would you believe that all of us have had problems with this crappy watch?My third watch is now dead due to water leakage. Prior to that I have had the following problems with Yachtsman watches:* Multiple wrist band failures* Sticky buttons* LCD backlight out* Display turned black in sun light* Resetting by itself* Foggy display* Poor customer serviceI have purchased two Sunntos and I PROMISE YOU there will not be a third."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip OFF","review":"Even though the manual says \\"Yes, it is waterproof to a depth of 30 meters (100ft). Rain and other normal exposure to water will not effect its operation. You can swim wearing your wristop compouter. However, the wristop Computer is NOT a diving device.\\" i dove to a depth of 50 ft (15meters) and my Suunto Yachstsman completely died !!here is what Suunto said:From: Suunto Help Desk <...>Sent: Tuesday, april 10, 2012 19:19Dear Sir/Madam,thank you for contacting Suunto.The Suunto Yachtsman is not a dive product and you shouldn't take it deeper than 2 meters. The watch is water resistant but it's not water proof, this means that you can take a shower with it and swim, but it should never go deeper than 2 meters, also the buttons of the Yachtsman shouldn't be pressed under waterWith best regards,Suunto Help Desk"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Sailing Watch","review":"Difficult to use functions. Sequences are odd and not intuitive. Barometer and compass functions are imprecise. The last straw was the battery failure, and inability for a new battery to work reliably with this watch. It is now sitting dead on the shelf.Replaced it with a Citizen Eco-Drive Titanium Stars and Stripes -- well worth the difference. Now also using a Tissot Sailing Touch, really the ultimate for a luxury sailor's timepiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"The carpenters signal the birth of punk.","review":"Now this is one trippy, existential album! Wow, I guess I can't say I actually like it, but checking it out you sense the vacuum of Richard and Karen's worldview. From it you see the roadsign arrows: one way points to empty, nominded valium melancholy, a shopping mall nightmare of consumer zombies. The other points to the _only way out_: the blaze and fury of the metal jihad. But hey, seriously, this is a psychotic album. Goes well with molded jello salad, heavy doses of barbiturates and old Albert Camus books with small print, read under the dim glow of a 5 watt desk lamp at 4 in the morning. God bless Karen and Richard. God rest Karen's soul. This is some twisted genius that stares directly into the abyss. Yikes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Courageous Memoir","review":"In this courageous memoir, Dr. Hinkle weaves a mesmerizing tapestry of sensuality, longing and self-discovery. We are invited into his world by an image that is with me still: Appearing from the mist, ethereal and angelic, a blond boy on a hill, sent to teach acceptance of one's truest self. A clinical psychologist, Dr. Hinkle relates his history with riveting prose in an uncompromising, yet compassionate manner. His journey encourages the reader to discover their own unrealized selves - to challenge their own limits and bravely put one foot in front of the other. I have tremendous admiration for the life he has lived and the love he has found."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Farewell Tour","review":"This anticipated DVD is a must have!

My little guy is just 5 lbs and his twin is sister is 7 lbs they were HUGE on both him and her and to get them tight enough I had to overlap the tabs- my little guy STILL leaked all over the place. The backside of his pajamas were literally soaked from buttocks to shoulders and the diaper was totally dry- I tried to reposition his little area and that did not help. However my daughter didn't have the wetness issues we had with our son.

We put ours in the shower house, which we locate on a slope so the water can drain. To level the toilet our I just took an old towel and rolled it up and placed it underneath. If you are looking for a potty, I would spend a little more and definitely get the larger tank. We camped for five days and emptied only three times.

About 3-4 weeks later it was returned to me repaired. Along with it came an $8 bill for shipping. Now the watch cost approximately $32.

I asked them if they could just send an return authorization (like many companies who back the products they sell) and was told \\"If we did that for one person, we'd have to do it for everyone and wouldn't stay in business.\\" Doesn't convey much confidence about this product or the way Timex conducts it's business. Sorry to be negative but this sort of thing drives me nuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase this watch!!","review":"The watch itself is a nice piece of jewelry for the price. However, the band is a mess. It comes as an extra large band. You need a special tool to remove the links. If you're looking to buy the watch and wear it right away. Be prepared to make a visit to a jeweler and pay money for a band. I was so disappointed when I or my husband couldn't remove the links. This is a warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy","review":"I bought this watch and its nice, but a little heavy.

Fell off my arm because a pin mysteriously disappeared. I had had it adjusted (removed 6 links - it's a very large watch!) but the pin that fell out was close to the face, not the clasp, so I doubt the adjustment had much to do with it.Perhaps it's just a fluke, but I definitely wouldn't spend my money on it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great watch","review":"I had one similar to this and after many years it bit the dust. This is about the same size and for me the dial is easy to read, and always have loved the deployment clasp. Just pinch and pops open. No struggling.

I just finished listening to this fantastic collection of songs for the nth time, and it is as fresh as when I first listened to it in college 35 years ago. Supertramp has always been one of my favorite rock bands. I can hardly call them rock -- rather symphonic geniuses who blended the best of orchestral instruments, rock and that great British sound into this masterpiece. Released in 1974 at the height of the rock era this is one for the ages. The recording quality of the re-release is superb -- as good as any digital recording and maybe better. Sadly I supposed, rock began a slow enexorable downhill march starting in the mid to late 1970's. I am a confessed prog rock fan,and I guess Supertramp sort of fits that genre, but not quite. Prog Rock has a tendency to take itself too seriously, and Supertramp is both playful and serious at the same time. Fabulous. 11 on a 10 point scale as Nigel would say! (-:"},{"rating":"2","title":"MFSL 24K gold review.","review":"Not as good as other MFSL releases, the kick drum and snare lack bottom end, cymbals are a little aggressive,, piano thought doesn't overload like the 2002 remaster (check Bloody Well Right), there's more dynamic range. Not bad but could have been better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"By far Supertramp's best","review":"This is where the Supertramp formula really works for me-- perfectly-crafted songs with pompous, but expertly-written arrangements. \\"Dreamer\\" is a light-pop tune which sort of breaks up the mood, but the harmonies on that tune make up for it. The rest of the album is perfect, the best song being the wonderful buildup song \\"School\\" and the least-great song being \\"If Everyone Was Listening\\" which is still pretty good. How that one guy can give it a -one- I have yet to understand, especially because on his reader reviews page he lists other Supertramp albums as partial favorites of his. The album? One of my favorites of all time. I usually don't like '70s mainstream FM-oriented stuff but these songs really work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stranded on a island good!","review":"Wow! This is Supertramp's 3rd album and how they have grown! The first two albums Supertramp and Indelibly Stamped were good and leaps and bounds ahead of what others were doing at that time. Something apperently clicked and a super band was born! Every song stands strong on its own merit here. If you are looking to start a Supertramp collection, buy this first. So if you end up stranded on an island and some genie grants you musical wishes, well now you know what to wish for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rock Classic","review":"This album by Supertramp is their best work and a true classic which will go on and on. It can be compared with \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" by Pink Floyd in this regard.The songs are dynamic and and vary dramatically throughout the album. There are no losers on this album, each song adding to the total value. A \\"must have\\" for any rock album collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supertramp's 1st Classic","review":"From the blazing opening harmonica note to the final, beautiful symphonic instrumental, Supertramp has created a majestic, maddeningly dark look at human emotions. The band overshadows their sometimes nonsensical wit by supporting it with lush melodies, harmonies, and lyrics. Both Hodgson and Davies get a turn displaying their remarkable talents, alternating positions each time. The final number is the best and most beautiful Supertramp composition ever written, period. Buy this.NOTE: Listening to this album on headphones, unlike any other Supertramp record, will rob it of its listening quality. Not technically, but emotionally.-NC"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"It seems absolutely incredible that this album, which it seemed everyone had in the 70's and 80's, hasn't encouraged more opinions.

It's slower, softer, and more polished, it may not be for everyone, but it's definitely my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helarious!","review":"This series is one of the best satires ever done! It mostly makes fun of gundam and evangelion, but it also takes stabs at many other mecha anime. If you are not familiar with any other mecha shows it is still a good time. The story and characters are off the wall right from the start, and then the story will grab your attention. What makes this show sooo good is that while it will have you laughing till you cry at the beginning, the story actually sobers up and becomes generally good by the middle and end. Definitely a show to watch with friends, and also a good one of the few shows that has a good English voice cast.This particular set is a knock-off version with bad video quality. But as this is an older show, and the visuals are not of particular importance it is worth the cheaper price than the 'official' version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I bought this series mainly because I was looking for an enjoyable mech series and on the strength of the reviews I've read about it and ended up liking it even more than I thought I would. Nadesico is a series that has several of the elements I enjoy in an Anime, there's action, adventure, sci-fi and even some romance, all the time never taking itself \\"too\\" seriously and never above poking a little fun at itself. Without spoiling anything I'll say that I think the way the ending was done fit in perfectly with the rest of the series and I am looking forward to the eventual (hopefull) release of the Nadesico movie. I wish there was a way I could rate this series 4 3/4 stars. To me, 5 stars should be a rating reserved for something close to perfection. Nadesico comes very close."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FUN!!!!!!!!","review":"I love this show and I give it 5 STARS!!!! My favorite character is Ruri Hoshino.

I found this authors intent to be deceitful.. the weakest arguments from the opposing viewpoints are stated and then refuted. It is common sense that if you want your argument to be taken seriously you should always attack your opponents strongest points. On this the author fails. The author has also failed to show where objective morals come from?? Do we have an authenticated record in Gods own writing? Failing this, all documents are men's words, and men being fallible means there are no objective morals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indescribable!","review":"This is the greatest comedy anime I have ever seen. The humor is great, and if you like Japanese humor you will LOVE this video. It takes a few minutes to get into the format of show, but after that it's nothing but non-stop laughter.

You have to see it for yourself, and be amazed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Says Dragons Can't Be Cute?","review":"I have one word for this tape: HILARIOUS! Though the animation isn't anything special, and the story isn't that deep, this comedy will keep you rolling with laughter! And the characters and music are just spectacular! And the fact that the majority of the time this series had SD (super-deformed, but I prefer chibi-sized ^-^) characters just makes this two part tape all the more....!!! My only major complaint was that there are only two episodes (at least that have been released in the US). But none of its faults kept me from giving it a 5 star rating! I would recommend this anime to any and all anime otaku."},{"rating":"2","title":"What counts are the final seconds.","review":"DeNiro stands in front of a bright curtain, an almost ghostly image, and says \\"I don't want to lose you.\\" His character is talking to the audience of how he tortured himself and his friends just to please the viewer.

The only reason to see this sleeping potion, is to see the scene that shows at the same time the screen legends Robert De Niro and Jack Nicholson. Beside that, there isn't another highlight.Recommendable only for Robert De Niro fans or Jack Nicholson fans, but most likely they will see this movie only once."},{"rating":"1","title":"An All Star Cast Dud","review":"This film was produced by the legendary Sam Spigel, written by the British playwright Harold Pinterand directed by the legendary Elia Kazan with an all-star cast headed by Robert De Niro, hot afterwinning Best Supporting Actor for Godfather II.The resulting film was a lifeless failure. There was no story and everything seemed fake.The first one to blame was the producer who picked an English playwright to adapt F. Scott Fitzgerald'snovel. Even the normally dynamic and charismatic De Niro wondered through the film looking foran anchor. Ditto for Jack Nicholson.The only stars who managed to shine were Tony Curtis who played a fading star in the moldof Ramon Navarro and the young British actress named Boulding.For films based on the novels of F.

Thanks to IMAGE, the original network commercials are intact and do not feature the crappy new-style computer imagery that was made to substitute the opening and closing credits. Wade Williams, who claims to own the rights to this series, re-edited the episodes so he could copyright the new versions. Those were put out on VHS and TV airings for years but thanks to Image, these are uncut and unedited. Only flaw is some of these episodes were already released commercially (and on dollar store DVDs) such as \\"Ice From Space\\" and \\"Frankenstein\\" so there isn't a lot of new stories here. Image did not put out all the episodes from the first season as they skipped to the second season after putting out two-thirds of the first season. Apparently they only want to release the episodes with name stars. This is sad as this is a landmark science fiction series from the live television era that needs a complete release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set of freaky tales","review":"If you like Twilight Zone, Outer Limits, The Veil, and One Step Beyond then you'll like this.

I expected the fuzzy technical quality and uninspiring sets, but the episodes lacked some of the tension, suspense, drama, and message I hoped to find. The presence of Lee J. Cobb was one of the things that made me buy this collection, but he wasn't at his best. In fact, many of the performances seem to have needed more rehearsal. The story lines were not very strong in many cases. The collection is interesting in terms of the evolution of television, and two or three of the stories had some good suspense, tension and meaning. Still, I couldn't honestly recommend this particular collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tales of Tomorrows","review":"The dvd was in good condition and very clear to be so old.

He can count up to 9. He picks up his toy cars and counts saying: WA (1) COO (2) FEE or TEE (3) FO (4) FI (5) SEE (6) WAWA (7) AY (8) NA (9).This happened today! He is exactly 18 months old.

I've read this book out loud to my children twice, once when they were almost teens and again before they went off to college. It's the story of a determined young woman who struggles to make her own way in the world. Her choices drive her downward until the book is so depressing that I wanted to throw it away. Then by the grace of God the story changes as Eleanor begins to gain back much of what she lost and learns the hard way the two meanings of \\"not my will.\\" My wife and I both cried for long stretches while reading this. One day I read it on the way to work on the bus and a coworker wondered why my eyes were all read when I arrived. He couldn't believe I had been crying over a story!

The author presents the story in a much more real way than many of the modern Christian writers do today. In many of the contemporary Christian novels, the characters are either so perfect that they don't seem real or so have very filthy minds. A good Christian novel is one that is somewhere in between.Francena H. Arnold, in Not My Will, keeps it real and presents characters with real problems that only God can solve. Contemporary Christian authors should follow her example in the novels they write. Parts of it are sad, but it is well worth reading.You may also consider readingSearching for Mom, which isn't nearly as bleak, but it is a more recent book that explores the will of God in the family relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!

These are your typical female army with exposed legs and a woman's usual 24 inch waist.In one scene Jeff brings a gun to a knife fight, but then uses his fist. The film also has prisoners in glass cages, women being tortured, brief girl/girl action, and the worse soundtrack I have heard in a long time. There was a background buzz for much of the film, plus the music was horrible with terrible lyrics. The pink phone with the long extension cord that can be dragged through a swimming pool was funny.

I watched the first five minutes of it and then I just had to turn it off.First of all it had on it was all this junk about Porno stars and everything. I think the only relation to blink 182 this would have is their name on the video and that Janine from their album cover used to be a Porn star. This movie is horrible and I think if Mark, Tom, or Travis saw this they might find it a tad bit funny but might be annoyed by the fact that their name is on it and it has barely anything about them on it.

The movie has practially nothing to do with Blink 182, except for a few 2 or 3 minute shots of them runing over some bottles in a car. The DVD is really about the girl in the Josie video, a porn star, and a bunch of British people. And to top it all off there is no Blink music in the whole DVD. So I'm not saying don't buy this movie, I'm just trying to warn a few people before they make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD is STOOPID!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"You do NOT want this DVD. Here's the what it basically is:-it begins with a picture of all 3 guys and scrolls their names in front of each band member. problem is that whoever made this stupid DVD mixed up mark and tom, so immediately the whole DVD is ruined-a long-haired idiot who wears glasses trying to talk like he's cool and knows blink-182. he periodically shows up throughout the DVD with his stupid hair-interviews with a jonathen davis-wannabe, a porn star, a tattoo artist, and two random nobodys-a 15-minute piece on the girl who kissed travis in the \\"All The Small Things\\" video and how she feels about it now-clips of a random skater-clips of fans from englandthat's about it. the band's apperance on the DVD, when all put together, lasts about 5-6 minutes. the music's not even by blink. spend your money on something less crappy."},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away from this one","review":"i purchased this video and it was horrible. it was so horrible in fact that i broke it. it has no music or concerts by blink and if it didn't say on the cover you wouldn't know it had anything to do with Blink 182. if you're considering buying this, don't, buy the Urethra Chronicles instead. i have that and it's great. don't buy this. it is a waste of plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price of postage.","review":"This DVD is just not worth the price of postage. Not only that, but mine came with scratches all over the play surface and no info card inside. This film was obviously made to capitalize on Blink's success. It does not have one shred of goodness for the fan. Even a hardcore fan would be bored by it. They got the rights to some British interview that lasts all of one or two minutes and interspersed that with two guys from no-name bands talking about themselves and this two-bit \\"erotic actress\\" shaking her breasts. All of which has nothing to do with the band. If I were the band, I would commission some attorney to come up with a way to keep this thing off the market. No music videos, no substantive interview, inane interviewees talking about everything but the band. What an awful video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent medical encyclopedia","review":"Compact and knowledge FULL. Great item that I wil mpt resell. Its a rare \\"keeper\\" for a school required book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not everything is in this Encyclopedia","review":"I barely used this during nursing school, and when I did, the topic wasn't in the book. Save your money and just \\"google\\" things."},{"rating":"2","title":"T.C. Fry has written a very eye-opening book.","review":"If you think you know the cause of disease, then think again. T.C. Fry's \\"The Great AIDS Hoax,\\" is one of the most eye-opening works I have ever read. It's not just about AIDS, but the cause of all disease, which will make you think twice the next time you think you can catch a cold or the flu. Even sexually-transmitted diseases don't escape Fry's logic, which is right up there with the greatest of scientific minds."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for the Dr's to read.","review":"I have followed the writings of Mr. Fry for many years when he was publisher of several health magazines. So I am sure that he knows what he is talking about in this book. I just wish that all the Dr's would read it and follow his advise. There would be less concern about AIDS."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of space and paper","review":"when my friend told me about this book, i laughed, i read some extracts from it and laughed even harder. i have never ever read a book as funny as this one. and then reading the reviews were really funny. those who believe in this book really need to sit down and read a bio book. the last post, the outstanding one is the funniest, get a life people AIDS is real and is not going away any time soon. who ever published this book is also a waste of space..."},{"rating":"1","title":"idiots","review":"i hope more people like the other people who have written reviews on this waste of paper read this book, so they'll die of the aids hoax they dont have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such Tomfoolery","review":"Alas, this tome is filled this tomfoolery and idiocy.

Doubt I'll ever use the heart monitor in the mountains but it is excellent for training. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Functional but cheap feel","review":"The watch does everything it's supposed to do, but it's got a cheap feel to it(does not feel rugged like you would expect from an adventure watch). Would have liked to have a calorie counter with the heart rate monitor. Menu's are difficult to navigate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't lose your receipt","review":"I've had my Suunto Advizor for 16 months. I am now in Iraq and the bezel is broken-off, like the other reviewer. I dont have my receipt. You can go to the Suunto website, but one thing you won't find there is an address with a note that says:\\"send your broken expensive plastic watch here and we will fix it.\\"My G-shock, by comparison,lasted longer than I wanted it to and cost one-quarter of what the Suunto cost.So I give the Suunto one star, for being adventure-cool for a while. A lot of other Infantrymen own these, so I jumped on the bandwagon.
