There is some remarkable detail in this book about the history of the Ninjas. In fact this book is may be the first popular introduction of the Ninjas to the West.In addition, there is an exceptional section detailing the history of the Kamikaze pilots and the damage they inflicted during the Second World War in the Pacific. Fleming's background as a journalist and later a Naval Intelligence officer in the war provided him with the ability to provide a colorful perspective.The writing is crisp and fast-paced, as in most of the Bond books.

The only sameness is the Japan setting.The story: James Bond is a mess after his wife was murdered. His boss considers firing him, but changes his mind and gives Bond a different kind of assignment: to get a device known as \\"the vacuum cleaner\\" from the Japanese. After much interesting negotiation, Bond is told that he can have the machine in exchange for a favor. Bond accepts the terms, and soon realizes that this favor involves an old enemy: Ernst Stavro Blofeld.This book was well-written, and was Fleming's last finished novel. The new characters are great, as well. The only trouble is that the book reads too much as a travelogue of Japan. The ending will surprise many. Personally, I think Fleming should have stopped here, and not gone on to the disastrous Man With the Golden Gun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gift book that brings warmth and guidance to the reader","review":"I saw Sally Sharp on the NBC special: Angels II Beyond the Light and shortly thereafter purchased both 100 Ways to Attract Angels and Angel Prayers.

Probably Lotus has made the exam harder, and the questions in this book are very easy. However, the book gives you a hint of how to turn Lotus Domino into a web server.

Third, the adult cup holder broke off the very first time I took the stroller out of the car. Fourth, you can only open/close it with both hands, impossible to do otherwise.

If you can get past the non-offensive use of the word \\"turd\\" in the first poem, you will be fine! As a first grade teacher, I have no problem explaining that while it is not a word that I want to hear from them, it is not considered profanity.

I mean, it's not so bad that I'd recommend it as skeet for trap shooting, however, if you are a Die-Hard FSF fan then this album is for you (if for nothing else to complete your FSF library). For someone who may have only one of their firt two albums, purchase the other of the first two which you do not have and borrow this one.

He had so much passion, and you felt every word that came out of his mouth... not to mention his live performances were incredible! Even fans of FSF who were sad to see Chris pursue his own career cannot arugue that Jason was an amazing singer and performer.

We thought about the long range antennae for our roof, and we were willing to put in the time and labor to make sure it would be installed well. Yet, we wondered whether an indoor antenna would do just as well. From the research, the indoor options cost less, required less labor for installation, and had the convenience of easy manipulation for directing towards multiple signal sources.After reading a number of reviews for the Terk HDTVa, we decided that we would try it out. So far, it's been great. We pulled the antenna out of the box, set it up on the mantle, wired it to the TV following the instructions, and immediately got all the major stations.

After looking up which direction I should point the antenna (most stations were in the same direction at about 20 miles distant), I simply attached the antenna to the base and plugged it into my tv. It took about five minutes of trying to find the optimal direction to point the antenna, and where to locate it, and that was it.I now get all the network stations, and a few others, in beautiful HD. Versus the basic cable I was paying for, this is much better. The signal does go out every once in a while (the image gets pixelated and distorts) but it happens rarely and lasts just a few seconds.

For some reason my TV just didn't find them during the first scan, but if you try what I did, hopefully it will work great for you too.All antennas are ugly, so no comment there.

Please read!","review":"I got the Terk, the Leaf, regular old rabbit ears, and the Philips SDV6122. The Philips runs circles around the others. The Terk did not work at all- I did not get even one channel tuned with it, and I returned it. The Leaf (non-amplified version which costs more than the Philips) works somewhat, better than the old rabbit ears, but you have to literally tape it to the window to get any uninterrupted channels. The Philips was able to find 13 channels in my kitchen, which is in the middle of the house; the Leaf did not pick up one channel there. In the bedroom, the Philips picked up 27 channels, and it is not near a window. I am using the Leaf for my stereo now to pick up better FM channels, and am buying two more of the Philips! Hands down, the Philips is the best antenna of the four options I've tried. You should strongly consider getting the Philips instead of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good antenna, but not spectacular","review":"After reading the reviews on this product, I thought that I would be picking up new channels that my rabbit ears could not, but that is not the case. I live on the second floor of an apartment building and most of the signals I receive come through the adjacent apartment from a tower ~2miles away. The channels from that tower I get just as well as I did with rabbit ears. But I do get a little better signal from a tower further away. Overall, a more consistent signal, but for someone who lives close to the broadcast tower, it is not really necessary to purchase an indoor antenna. Good quality product thus far, and fast shipping"},{"rating":"2","title":"This product works well enough","review":"I live in SF and in direct line of sight with TV tower about 3 miles away.

Excellent pictures and a lot of channels. After I installed this antenna, I got like more than 30 channels from channel 2 to channel 55. This is a great product.

They worked okay (in the Arlington, VA area), but some channels were inconsistent. I hoped that highly rated Terk HDTVa would do better, but it only brought in 4 channels (my old cheaper one got about 20). I moved it around the room, tried dozens of different positions, but alas it still didn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Antenna just minor exceptions...","review":"This is a great antenna, don't get me wrong. Just remember this is directional meaning that if your broadcasts are all coming from one direct location, which can be found via antennaweb.org, this antenna is for you. Like the other reviewer said, the VHF dipoles are rather dull. Yes, they do work but not nearly as well as the UHF. ABC is the major player in this for me in Miami. ABC is VHF and I get interupption sometimes.In conclusion, if you live between 0-25 miles from the towers this antenna is for you. Usually if you're looking for just the digital HD channels they all come from one direction and this will work great (my instance). However, if you are looking for all the analog and digital channels you can get since you don't have cable or satellite, get a multidirectional antenna like the Terk TV5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Signal is worse than using cable line as antenna","review":"I was using my existing cable line as my antenna (which runs outside my house and up to the 2nd story) for a while which worked OK most of the time. However, I decided to try an antenna to boost reception after my local NBC station started flaking out in poor weather. I bought this antenna based on the positive reviews and I am less than impressed. I could never reliably get all my local stations at once even though they are coming from basically the same direction (and in the same city in which I live). I'd skip it and go straight to an attic antenna if I had to do it again. This is already back in the mail for a return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Indoor Antenna Solution","review":"The wooded area makes reception here tough at times, even on a hill. The nearest broadcast station is about 15 miles away. This antenna picks up stations well up to about 40 miles away in my area. Setup was very simple and the instructions were clear. A little adjustment of placement and it was down to business. A pet caused the unit to drop several feet and that didn't seem to cause a problem with reception. If not for this item I would be forced to use an outdoor antenna with all the hassle that implies. You only need a couple of square feet for this compact radio wave catcher. It gets very high ratings on the technology review sites in comparison to other similar products. A good value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Antenna","review":"I had a basic uhf/vhf non-amplified antenna and was able to pull in 12 channels in the Bay Area; with this Terk HDTVa antenna, I could receive 60+ channels!

Plus this thing is huge when you extend the onboard rabbit ears. Extremely unattractive so unless you have a closet to hide it in, go with something else. I bought a Philips antenna (Philips SDV2740/27 HDTV/UHF/VHF/FM Digital Indoor TV Antenna) at Wal-Mart for like $30 and it works way better than this thing AND it's tiny and attractive too! Don't waste your time on this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't get a better signal","review":"Using this thing made no difference in my reception over rabbit ears. In fact, I ended up getting less channels.

We cut the cable cord and went to over air HDTV. This was a great deal through Amazon, and the other reviews we read were spot on. The only drawback is the size of the antenna...it's kind of cool at first...all star treky looking, but actually making room for it was tricky. Would probably be able to mount it hanging upside down on an interior wall with some creative hook placement, and maybe call it modern art? But since the appearance is the only drawback and we're saving several hundred dollars a year without the cable, it's worth it. Looked around at some of the smaller big brands, but the consistent reviews on this one sold us. We live in the center city of a metro area so cannot review for out-in-the-sticks reception."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't work.","review":"Bought this back when I lived a couple miles of my local transmitters, and it worked just fine - but really, no better than a $10 walmart antenna or even a homemade coat hanger antenna.Then I moved.Now I'm 28.5 miles from the four networks (CBS, ABC, Fox, and PBS) that broadcast on UHF, and NBC, which broadcasts on VHF from 30.2 miles away. I'm in a rural desert area, so there's nothing between me and the towers as far as trees, buildings, etc. Know how many stations this gets? None. Zip. Zilch. Zero. I've tried a couple other antennas since this one, with moderate success. At one point, every station that's supposed to be available has been obtained with one antenna or another, but not a single one with this model. Worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"indoor digital antenna","review":"After installing, this antenna would not stay upright & did not give any reception on my local stations.

Several stations have weak signals and kept freezing up or going out altogether. So I hooked up the terk and... NO SIGNAL said the screen. I hooked up the old one and got the station to come in. The amplifier was plugged in and it did boost the signal as I tested it on the stronger stations. But in the end the old one did just as good and even better on some stations.

I get 39 channels overall, 10 of which are HD. I tested it with the antenna sitting on a coffee table next to the TV. I live about 25 miles from the broadcast tower (see antennaweb.org).I gave the VHF 'dipoles' a quick try but they are 3.5 feet wide and not practical use.I'm now planning to drop my satellite service (yee haa!).

Quite the opposite, pleasantly enough. I get almost as many channels in my basement with this antenna as I do on the 2nd floor of my house with rabbit ears. This makes me very happy because putting up an outdoor antenna is on my things to do list, but not real high up on it, so having an indoor antenna that actually works is quite nice. Not sure what possessed me to try \\"one more antenna\\" but this one I will be keeping.Downsides - it's pretty large, and the built in rabbit ears are large as well, and I found that I needed to have them extended to get certain channels. So this antenna won't win you any style points. But if you live in an apartment or rented house, or like me you just haven't gotten around to putting up an outdoor antenna, this one works quite well."},{"rating":"1","title":"total failure","review":"This product managed to bring in two stations in a location without impediments in a major metropolitan area.

I was not disappointed. Not only do I get clean, crisp reception, I now receive several more channels that I wasn't able to get with traditional bunny ears. My only complaint is the unstable base.

Now, I have at least 50. It's much bigger than I thought it would be, but it works. Actually, if I want to extend the rabbit ears, I'd need a whole corner of the room, about as much room as I'd give an indoor tree.It came with wall mounting instructions and also a little note, like an afterthought, to not mount the product horizontally. I was confused, the web site says I can mount it on a wall. I thought that means horizontal, and why did I get mounting strips? But I don't need to mount it on anything anyway.The antenna is directional. Some channels come in better with it pointed one way and other channels come in better with it pointed the other. Once I can get the majority of the channels I want, I stop touching it. That can be frustrating for some people, but I don't watch a lot of channels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great antenna","review":"I got this antenna based on the reviews I've read on here and I must say they were spot on. I don't have an HDTV yet but I got the $40 coupon and got a DTV converter box. I live in Queens which is probably about 10-12 miles away from Manhattan. Set up was a breeze and once I turned it on and even on my SDTV the picture was amazing. I have the antenna set up in my living room away from the window facing NW towards manhattan. Without the amplifier I was able to pick up 12 channels and with the amplifier turned on I was able to pick up 38 channels on my dtv box.I'm about to go get a hdtv now as the pictures I'm getting now on the hdtv channels are just awesome.

Bought this after hearing it was a great antenna. It is not a great antenna. After one week of trying every angle and direction the cheap antenna with a 50db booster out performed this antenna hands down. The cheap antenna got all but one of the channel at a time. This antenna all I could get was three or four at a time. Took three or four positions to achieve all the channels that the cheaper one got with two positions. Too unidirectional, which might be ok if all the towers are in one direction.

Great Buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...go with an outdoor antenna","review":"Didn't have any luck with the indoor antenna despite only living 8-9 mi's from where the stations are transmitted. However, as soon as I stuck the indoor antenna out the upstairs window i picked a solid 20 digital stations with strong signal levels. So I then went with an outdoor antenna from radioshack (model 15-2187 - $80), spent a day mounting it and running cable, and it works great.I think my problem was mostly because my house is solid brick and RF signals can't get through. However, I would recommend just starting with an outdoor model versus buying an indoor antenna and then, when that doesn't work, an outdoor model. It's well worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"I had previously tried going the cheaper route with a HDTV antenna, but it ended up with poor picture quality that would stutter and skip every couple of seconds, resulting in an extremely poor TV experience.

Depending on where you live, you might not even need to pull the dipoles (rabbit ears) out, at all. The UHF antenna (the main, funky looking one) is very directional and gets great reception. If you can't pick it up with this, you can't pick it up with any indoor antenna and will have to look for outdoor options!The only downside is that it's a little bit bigger than expected, and doesn't balance well on carpeted floors. Cable management is also not ideal. All over-the-air antennas are a little ugly/tacky/cumbersome, but this is probably the best you're gonna find!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great results in the city","review":"I originally hooked this up without knowing there was a signal booster included, and wasn't impressed. After reading the instructions and finding the electrical booster still in the box, the results were amazing. I went from 3 channels to 16. All crystal clear.

After reading positive reviews I bought this piece of junk for $30+.This is just a piece of crap plastic assembled together to look like a high-tech device.This antenna gives me no more than 10 channels, and the built-in signal booster does no help.I switched back to my old $10 regular RCA antenna that I bought a long time ago from Walmart.The other bad thing about this antenna is that it is too heavy for its own base.You just can't make it stand still for a long time.

Though the actual reception when the unit was in a good spot, was brilliant, you are still limited due to the type of construction you live in and the buildings around you and the clouds on that particular day. What was very poor about this product is how the cord that connects to the TV unit runs through the base of the Terk. There isn't a manner of securing it safely in place. This allows for the thick cord to wriggle out and tip. The antenna is a not a replaceable part of this unit and it breaks easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"This unit did not work for me.

I first bought HD bunny ears antenna from Walmart for $20 and it only got me three channels. So I decided to try this antenna because it was only $10 more. Once I connected it to my TV it got me two more channels! That was pretty cool. So I returned the first one I bought. There are two downsides: (1) The base is too narrow/small for it's design. It DOES stand on its own but I feel like if a gust of wind passed through it, that it would EASILY fall over -- like cow tipping. (2) It's HUGE! I feel like it's a Seagull flying towards me -- it's takes THAT much space. I swear it have a 6ft span. Other than that . . . I'm keeping it.

My current antenna didn't seem strong enough to keep channel reception and I wasn't getting too many channels. So I thought this eyesore that plugged in and is powered would do the trick. Its big, bulky and falls over constantly. It helped me get slightly better reception on one channel, but that gets spotty at times and I gained no additional channels.

We were using a $50 radio shack antenna and not very happy with our results. After doing some research we settled on the Terk you see here. We were not impressed at all. The signal strength was as weak if not weaker than the Radio Shack Antenna. We live very close to the broadcast towers as well. They are about 5 miles away on top of a mountain. Our house has a clear line of sight to the towers and we still have trouble picking up certain stations. You can't sit or stand in particular places in the living room lest you lose the signal.Another thing: look at how small that base is compared to how gigantic the actual antenna is. It's incredibly awkward and it tips over constantly. It's a ridiculous size. There's just no place for such a silly, bulky antenna in an average size living room. I'm just astounded at all the positive reviews here."},{"rating":"2","title":"got all air channels no problem","review":"I do not have cable and have been using the best amplified antenna I can find from store (e.g. Target) and it worked for most part.

If you are interested in purchasing an antenna for high-definition reception, I strongly suggest you do a lot of research before purchasing. While this particular antenna is excellent for it's intended purpose, it may not be the right antenna for your needs. You may need an outdoor antenna or perhaps another type of indoor antenna based on the location of the television station transmission antennas in your area.

While it boasts of an amplication of signals, I found that to be an underwhelming feature. Granted my area has very poor reception, which is why I choose this particular antenna to begin with, but it did little to improve the digital signal to my older model TV. A strange facet of the Antenna was that the connection to the TV didnt seem to screw on at all. I had to tape it in place. Lastly it needs to be plugged into an outlet which takes up space and uses electricity. You also need to press the little switch for the amplication feature which is very small. Over all I think you can get the same reception over the air with an antenna that costs less than the 40 dollars I paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terk Antenna","review":"This antenna is a science fiction looking version of rabbit ears. The high tech design and the electrical boost from the plug in wire do nothing to increase reception beyond the signal from the low tech rabbit ears (for under $10) it replaced. The UHF antenna is the \\"futuristic\\" looking part and the VHF antenna is still old fashioned rabbit ears, though a little thicker than the one that came with your analog TV. The antenna works better than no antenna, so I gave it two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward design makes it hard to stand free","review":"The amplification makes this pull in a lot more stations, but the design is lacking. It looks like they chose to make it look modern rather than considering functionality.The cord comes out of the bottom of the unit and can be moved to the front or back, but either way you move it there is difficulty getting it to stand up straight. The base is so narrow that the antannae has a hard time sitting on a flat survace, constantly falling over, with risk of breaking the antenna when it does. Normally you might fix this by screwing it down, but the base is not designed to allow that as well.Pull in stations nicely, but frustrating design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good HD signal in an urban area","review":"My husband bought this antenna about two months ago and we're pretty happy with it. After years of paying for cable we weren't really watching, we decided to downgrade to broadcast tv. This antenna was easy to set up, stores relatively compactly (compared to traditional rabbit ears), and picks up good, clear HD signals for our local tv stations. We get ABC, CBS, NBC, public television, FOX and a couple of other random stations. The HD picture is amazingly crisp for broadcast. We live in a 100+ year old brick house, and we have no trouble getting a signal, even in our basement.I would recommend this antenna with one caveat--we do live relatively close to all of our local tv stations broadcasting towers. I'm not sure how well this would work further away from the broadcast point."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much interference and choppy signal","review":"I got this one based on the good reviews.

I got all the channels like ABC/NBC/CBS/PBS/FOX and several other local channels. Now I do not need to be irritated by the choppy signal with the Terk antenna."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage-- buy the Leaf HDTV Antenna instead","review":"This antenna did not work at all; we could not get a single clean channel. In addition, it was both highly directional and actually quite huge, plus prone to falling over due to the ridiculously tiny base. I've seldom used such a poorly designed product. Purchasing it was purely a waste of time, though many thanks go to Amazon for their painless return process.TheLeaf indoor HDTV antennais much better. It's MUCH more sensitive (we get 20+ channels with ease now) and it's so tiny you can tape it to a wall or window. I highly recommend the Leaf antenna plus amplifier over the Terk antenna.

SOme Points: 1) Yes it is a bit wobbly but as long as both ears are pulled out to an equal length this is not a problem and 2) it is HIGHLY directional. Literally 1 inch can make a huge difference.I Can live with those things though because this little antenna is POWERFULL.

I've already repacked the Terk and it's going back. I'm sticking with the rabbit ears, which are about 10 years old & not HD, but they get 33 channels with MUCH better picture quality. In South Beach, rabbit ears appear to get better reception than all my neighbors more expensive HDTV antennas.Also, the cord comes from the bottom of the antenna, and I could not get the antenna to stay upright, not even on the floor.

I gave it four stars because it can get finicky on what direction it faces. If it is turned a certain way, I lose signal for a couple channels. Other than that it is a dream. It really works well with our 720p LCD TV. The HD signal is very clear. I also like the design. It comes with a fairly long coaxial cable so you can have some play in where you want to put it. Now, the picture doesn't really show it, but on the opposite side of the horizontal antenna \\"fin\\" there are two other extendable antennae that are adjustable.Since this is normally priced at $70 dollars in the store, the price here is not bad at all.

As most guys do I never looked at the instructions, just started to connect cords, plug in this and BANG, there were all the channels I'd only heard you could get with a good antenna. It likes to be as close to a window for the best reception. If you can get it into the attic and near the side of the house where your local broadcast signals come for that works great too. It worked so well I bought one for the grandkids living in an apartment. They couldn't afford cable right now so they are learning about how it was 40 years ago, except they don't have to stand next to the TV like i did while your parents told you to wave your arms in the air...now stay right there! With all the options of updates of news or sports over the Internet these days to get the networks and a few other local channels for free is the best choice I made in a long time.

It is off balance, and so difficult to position. It worked well for a few months, then the signal booster, which is wired to the adapter, developed this problem: the male end of the coax cable connecting anntenna to amplifier must be balanced on the rim of the female connection, not inserted and certainly not screwed in, to receive any signal at all. You should see the contraptions I've come up with to try to hold this tiny connection in place for the brief periods it doesn't need to be repositioned. The annetenna seems to function OK, but it's no good if an amplified signal can't get to the tv. Spend your money on a different brand; get the component parts so they can be connected by coax rather than being wired together. I bought this because it had good reveiws on Amazon -- joke's on me. good luck, M."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than others but...","review":"The Terk works better than others that I have tried but I still have to mess around repositioning for different channels ( even though all of my towers are in the same place).

Other than channels from the TV tower 10 miles away, no other channels are picked up. What surprise me is that when I try to apply the pre-amplifier, there is no effect on the receiver. The signal strength is exactly the same with or without the pre-amplifier. This makes me wonder what is the functionality of the amplifier? I paid 20 more bucks for the amplifier, how could I make my $20 working?Of course, it is not bad, that is why I put 2 stars there.

By contrast, the Antenna Direct Clearstream 2 produced better-than-cable quality video. In fairness to the Terk, the transmitters in our area are at the limit of its stated reception - 40 to 45 miles; also the Clearstream is a somewhat more expensive antenna and was given about an 8 foot elevation advantage (attic) over the Terk.

This antenna requires a huge amount of space to be used properly; imagine a 5 foot diameter footprint; that is what you need. Once aimed it does indeed receive quite well. The problem is that it is an engineering nightmare and needs to be taped down otherwise it tips over if you look at it; no weight in the base. Another problem is that the cables are also a mess; they are stiff and never relax and straighten out, so they too do not help the antenna to stay in place and stand up.

It wants to fall over and move depending on how the cabling is laid out. Makes it near impossible to maintain a clear station as is. It may work to use velcro to hold it in place.Tuning this thing to bring in a station is next to impossible. Even a slight movement throws the picture off.Now, I will say I'm about 25 miles away from the TV transmitter towers, which is actually well within the specifications of this antenna, but I think you need to be much closer.

We live in the Washington area and we were really disappointed, expecting to have a wider selection. It didn't pull in the multiple HD versions of WETA or MPT public TV channels. We purchased the Elgato Eye TV at the same time as this antenna and found that when connected to the cable TV wall plate it alone pulled in a much larger set of both HD and analog channels.

Bad Design. As to reception, it was 30% worse than my $20 dollar radio shack amplified rabbit ears (9 vs. 13 channels) which I plugged back in when I returned HDTVa Antenna. When I called Customer Service I started to get instruction by which I might have set up my own Global Positioning Network. What happened to Plug and Play?? Then I bought one of the more expensive of the highly hyped amplified 'leaf' paper thin antennas. That antenna gets the same 13 channels as the rabbit ears but needs somewhat less shifting to clear up some channels. Final opinion: I think they all still suck relative to cable which makes me think about the role of cable at least as much as why multi-billion dollar electronics and communications companies that can tune in a cell phone in China from outer space can't come up with a better tv antenna."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not good when a cheap $8 antenna outperforms this one","review":"I bought this antenna to start with, and I was generally satisfied with it's performance, but it did have a few hiccups in signal quality.

I was very surprised to find out that the cheap $8 antenna actually received a stronger and more reliable signal than the Terk antenna, and I actually received a few extra channels. Even with the amplifier turned on with the Terk I still had issues, yet the $8 antenna is unpowered, looks really flimsy, and gets a much more reliable signal. For $40 and for something twice the size, I would expect the Terk antenna to far exceed the capabilities of the cheap one, and it's clear to me that the $8 antenna puts this one in its place.

The Terk HDTVa fit the bill so I gave it a shot. I now pull in 100% of my local HD stations.Setup was easy. The key as always is getting the correct compass orientation established. Then spread the rabbit ears and voila, excellent reception. I don't have the rabbit ears extended all the way either.Because of the HDTVa's smaller footprint I can have the antenna close to my TV and hidden out-of-site behind a chair.

The sound quality was bad and felt like you are hearing someone from underwater. It was not the best wireless reception since we needed to use a few cables. The signals were not of forty miles away.

When pointed in the direction of the towers the signal is choppy at best, however when it's turned 180 degrees it picks up the reflection off a building on the other side of the courtyard well enough most times. The only time it really stuggles is during overly overcast and rainy days. Right now I have this connected to the built in tuner on my TV (Sharp Aquos LC-42D62U) and it has a much more stable picture than when I had it connected to my HTPC (Hauppauge HVR1600 Tuners) but that could just be because the PC is a little underpowered.

You may have to adjust the position of the antenna, but once you find the right position you will know it. The only station over the air I do not receive is NBC because of the dorm room.

It was unable to receive some important channels in our area, no matter how it was aimed. I bought the antenna for my daughter, who lives about a mile from me. The antenna performs little better than the VHF/UHF rabbit ears I use on our own second TV. We are less than 20 miles from the transmitters. The antenna is also misrepresented in the ads. It is said to be directional, and it is directional for UHF channels, but the VHF portion is plain vanilla rabbit ears, which are a simple dipole, and thus non-directional. Since the problem here is multi-path interference, as it is in many places, a directional antenna is essential. My daughter had to have an outdoor directional (yagi) antenna installed to get acceptable reception. This antenna, and probably all indoor \\"HDTV\\" antennas, is greatly overrated, and in my opinion, unsatisfactory."},{"rating":"2","title":"it actually works!","review":"Comes with everything needed to view over the air HD except for the TV itself.

No real difference! Both performed the same, which means that the rabbit ears are the better deal, as they don't have to be plugged in, and are less obtrusive, and much cheaper. I can't speak for anyone else's circumstance, obviously, but in my neck of the woods, in the Hartford suburbs, the Terk antenna didn't out perform my rabbit ears. My advice would be, if you have an old set of rabbit ears lying around, try them with your digital TV, the reception may surprise you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good reception for downtown in the mountains.","review":"Big let down.

It does have issues if you live in a building surrounded by other large buildings or if your building is stone/brick, and some (closer) stations come in better than others. But in general, you'll either get great reception, or no reception. If you live in a house, and not too far away from your stations (within most city limits) then this should be fine for most people, but if you can't get signal, then you may want to consider and outdoor version. Due to it's semi-directional design, it can pick up harder to reach stations from indoors better than most, but you may not get a station facing the opposite direction as well. There are website that help you find out where your stations are in relation to you, use those sites to determine if you need a directional, semi-directional, or omni, and whether you'd be good with indoor or outdoor.

I don't get CBS, NBC or anything pertinent except FOX. Pretty much useless.UPDATE: 9/18/2012I bought the LEAF PLUS and it worked a bit better than the Trek. It is WAY more aesthetic though.

Set-up was easy, although the base isn't very stable. After scanning for channels it didn't pick up any extra channels than my rabbit ears. What's worse is that the reception was just about on par with the rabbit ears. Which I guess is fine but the Terk costs 3x as much as the RCA.

It is now hooked up and pointed in the correct direction, which is critical to success for this antenna, and most channels come in crystal clear.

As soon as I turned on amplification, the reception went down the drain. Literally, the screen froze up. When I turned off amplification, it was better. But to get the best picture, I even had to take of the power plug. So much for an active antenna... As a result, I decided to return this antenna and stick with my cheap and passive antenna.Not sure what the problem was... Maybe I am too close to the transmission towers and with amplification my TV tuner saturates...

The storyline is about how the alphabet travels to find treasure, but it's definitely not an abecedarian. It will not teach your child his or her letters. It's just silly fun.Do note that it's a longer book (as picture books go), and that many of the jokes will sail right over the head of younger readers (\\"We sure spent our times roamin'\\" springs to mind).As a book for older kids or adults, though, it's completely indispensible.

Actually, the story was intersting. But, the writing sucked. The points that could have been climaxes in the book were either too short or too drawn out. I wouldn't reccomend you pick this book up at all. Epiphany was one of those females that makes you want to throw up. I'm not even talking about the fact that she was a straight gold-digger that's neither here nor there. But, the broad had no goals about herself. Throughout the whole book all she wanted to do was find someone to pay all her bills. Come on now then the girl who fell in love with a stripper.

I was not feeling her whole little hustle while K.C. was locked up but she was not sheisty to her friends at all. She was cool but i was mad at how that girl was stalking her but besides that whole situation she was cool. Keisha was just ok to me i ain't have to do Tucker like that. That was just dirty.

The latter section, \\"Dealing With,\\" is a short 'book report' based on a few sources. It doesn't read well, and it doesn't present much information. The first section, 'Identify,' wastes a lot of paper, presenting one idea on each page. It is reminiscent of \\"you know you're a redneck if...\\". Many are redundant; the last several are lame. There is a solid use for this information, but I believe it was presented poorly. The title is also misleading. \\"Toxic People\\" is too broad a category.

Looks like a headshot for a pornographic entertainer. Her nom de plume is also a stripper name -- \\"Amorah\\"? Too close to Amoral. She's wearing shades -- can't see her eyes, which doesn't engender trust with the observer. Cheap cleavage shot. Ugh. Obviously she doesn't want to be taken seriously. Or she's laughing at people for buying the book when she's one of the toxic people she writes about. As for the material, it's generalized. I thought it would be helpful for workplace situations, but it's just the same old garbage of \\"Don't let anyone disrespect you.\\" Full of quotes from other people. Returned it.

I'm not all that interested in books based on the events prior to the classic trilogy but I'm a Star Wars freak and I own every Star Wars based novel so I had to buy this one. This book was terrible. It is almost as bad if not worse than Children of the Jedi. The storyline was disjointed and bland. The new characters were shallow. I especially couldn't stand the bloodcarver. The chapters were so short that it was impossible to get into the pertaining plotline. Because of the short chapters I was never compelled to continue to read. A Star Wars book usually takes me two to three days to read. This one took me a week. The only high point was Tarkin. It was interesting to see this character, who had always compelled me, expanded on. Sienar was also an interesting guy but that was about it.

It really stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent read, but nothing spectacular.","review":"I'm a big fan of the Star Wars novels, and am really enjoying the New Jedi Order storyline, but the novels based on Episode I have been really disappointing. Rogue Planet is an OK story about Anakin and Obi-Wan that really doesn't matter in the overall scheme of things. There is an aspect of the story that ties into the New Jedi Order storyline, but aside from that it's a pretty forgettable book. I guess I'm just used to better from the Star Wars franchise.

I think I'll opt for the paperback editions of these EpisodeI/II tie-ins in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rouge Planet","review":"Rouge Planet, like most STAR WARS books is pretty good, but I think it was missing some good action. I enjoyed reading the book, because I loved the way that the author foreshadowed the events that are to come later in the STAR WARS saga. It introduces some new and exotic alien species, along with more familiar characters, which was pretty exciting to see, especially because of the way their personality was so exceptionally portrayed. What most fascanated me, was how the author so neatly blended in the story with another book which takes place decades in the future of STAR WARS universe. As for the other STAR WARS fans you must read this book if you have a desire to learn more about how the movies are interlocked within each other, and for some of the reasons for Anikan's behavior. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope the new movie will be this good.","review":"Okay, I know it was not the best book ever but I liked it a great deal.

I like the way the book took off from the last story (The Phantom Menace) and left the story open for the third episode.

I wont ruin any of it for you but if you are a Star Wars fan you should buy this book, it is worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"Well the long waited book came. I was disappointed to say the least. I found the characters and story line to be rather unusual and strange. Strange or sort of dingy... nothing like a follow-up to the first episode.

On the whole, this is a good novel, but Star Wars it is not. Star Wars movies and books are supposed to be action packed and exciting Space Opera, not hard sci-fi. This one, while interesting, is neither exciting nor action packed. It hammers plot developments into your head without the proper action framework to keep you interested. While I am sick to death of every Star Wars novel involving some super weapon or new menace to the Republic, I was disappointed with this effort at doing something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rogue Planet","review":"This is one of the worst Star Wars books I've read. It's confusing, nebulous, hazy. It has no depth, no background.

I was very disappointed and hope the next movie isn't this bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Almost Complete Waste of Paper","review":"I really didn't like this book to say the least.

I was looking forward to reading this I thought it would go more into the relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin a few years after Episode 1. I thought it might include some insight on Padawan training. I couldn't have been more disappointed. Overall it was a really stupid story that wasn't at all believable, even in the realm of the Star Wars universe.

Also, if Raith Seinar is the designer of the Death Star, this contradicts with the \\"Jedi Academy\\" series in that the scientists in the Maw (who built the Sun Crusher of this series)designed and built it.

The story is slow, the characters are bland and the outcome was totally predictable. It is apparent that George Lucus has no desire to continue this series anywhere beyond what he has stated.

They were wrong! This book did give some insight to the future Death Star and other helpful info; yet it was an awefully boring book to read just to get these limited facts. There is almost no action at all until the last few chapters. The author goes on and on about this seemingly important spaceship for the whole length of the book and come to find out it is NOT IMPORTANT AT ALL. The author does do a good job describing the setting and the characters, but other than descriptions it is completely uninteresting.

Very little time spent on Anakin's struggle and Obi-Wan tutoring. Way too much time spent on describing the seeds/ship building. Very rushed at the end, no suspense at all.The describing of the ship building and the seeds was way too detailed (like Vector Prime's description of the bad guys). I am concerned the Star Wars Saga is being diluted with inferior products. I have read a lot of books on Star Wars, the last paperback was great.

Rogue Planet takes them deep beyond the Republic to the planet Zonama Sekot. Most of the details have been revealed so their is no need to explain them again. Just some of the important details shall be revealed. First off, Grand Moff Tarkin is introduced. The idea of the Death Star is first brought to life. Also we are told of an living existance beyond the galaxy called the Far Outsiders. They will come into play later in the Star Wars saga. Finally, we get a first glimpse of Anakin flirtting with the dark side. The books downfall is its lack of Jedi action. Anakin does not even have a lightsaber, so that says enough. I much prefer the prequel stories in which Anakin is grown up. But I still recommend this book if you would like a nice tale about Obi Wan and Anakin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly Planet","review":"I will not repeat what has already been said that reflects poorly on this novel. All I do have to say is that if you liked the novelizaions of the movies, including the most recent, THE PHANTOM MENACE, you will NOT like this book. Mr. Bear seems to try too hard to add to the Star Wars universe and fails. The middle third of the book drags horribly and then the end is rushed and, I am sorry to say - silly. I cringe whenever I read a STAR WARS novel that feels \\"Star Trekie,\\" and this one is the worst. If you go for that type of universe, be my guest. However, I feel ROGUE PLANET was a dissapointing sequel to the prequel. Mr. Bear should take some writing tips from Mr. Brooks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AN AVERAGE OUTING FOR THESE JEDI","review":"The basic problem with Star Wars: Rogue Planet is that it is just a so-so adventure for Obi-Wan and Anakin. Now, in defense of author Greg Bear, it is a well written novel with some very creative and original concepts. Mr. Bear does what he can to introduce new aliens and to incorporate some characters and conepts that we (as Star Wars fans) love. The chapters dealing with General Tarkin were the strongest in the book (here is a character who can be quite fascinating). But let's be honest until Episode 2 comes out...the characters of Anakin and Obi-Wan aren't going to come across anything \\"life changing\\".So, if you're going through withdrawl from the Galaxy Far, Far Away...then pick this book up and read it.

It gives some insight into the past Tarkin had. Also, find out the origins of the Death Star. All in all though, nothing too important.Not a very exciting book by any stretch of the imagination.

The relationship between Anakin and Obi-Wan was poorly displayed, as the author made Obi-Wan a meidocre, inexperienced, weak Jedi. The dark side of Anakin is too obvious. Tarkin is not even interesting. The storyline was boring and confusing, with very little action. In all, the book had weak dialogue, poor character development, and a weak plot.

For about 100 pages, I was hoping for something to happen, only to be pummeled with useless facts and details about a people and planet I had little interest in. I expected the relationship between Anakin and Obiwan to develop, and at times it did. These were the best parts of the book. I was hoping to gain an insite into Anakin's mind, and at times I did. Unfortunately, there was that middle section that did little of either. Anakin likes to go fast and he has a lot of potential. This obvious fact was told to the reader with irritating frequency. It was a great novel at 150 pages, but hard to get through at 250."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst SW Book ever","review":"I am a big star wars fan and let me tell you if you like star wars you will hate this book.

After reading the first 3 at breakneck speed, this yawner ground me to a screeching halt.How anyone could make Star Wars so boring is beyond me. There are a grand total of 2(2!) action scenes in the whole book. This is Star Wars?If that weren't enough, the book is filled with new age strangeness throughout. It's almost as if Bear had a story already written, and changed the main characters to Obi Wan, etc and called it a Star Wars book.I barely, just barely, got through this thing.

It could be that I have set a higher standard for Mr. Bear's works as the man is truly a great thinker and writer.

Let me warn you: I love the original three SW movies, the Han Solo trilogy by A.C. Crispin, and Shadows of the Empire by Steven Perry. Perhaps my excitement of an addition to these \\"classics\\" caused an inevitable let-down, but this book was far from impressive. No action, bad descriptions, a boring plot, character development? I don't think so, and cheesy usage and description of the Force make this a pretty bad experience. Sorry, I don't want to burst anyone's bubble, but this book is not good, and it is definetly in the lower realms of the Star Wars universe. I just hope this is not what Lucas thinks is quality material these days.

I listened to it and listened again and again. This book is one of the best in the Star Wars series. You wouldn't think it would be, but it is. It takes place on a living planet called Zonoma Sekot (which plays a huge role down the road in the Vong war). The description of the planet and the seeds that make the ships are awesome. Once you get past the oddities of it, it truly is genious. It is different and excellent. Not only do we see the very beginnings of Anakin's turn to the dark side, but we also get confusion and concern from Obi wan and an intro to the future Moff Tarkin and the designer of the first Death Star Seinar. There is even a reference to Darth Sidious. This book is exciting, original and entertaining.

But instead they built a ship, more than half the book was spent talking about building this ship. In fact that is all that comes to mind about this book was building the ship.

In fact, I was reading it every night until 3:00! Well as I was reading, I found the \\"evil\\" characters to be much more than boring. Every chapter they were involved in made me want to put the book down. The use of language was horrible, considering that the beginning of a chapter was Obi-Wan slept.

The story wasn't bad, and Greg Bear is an above average sci-fi writer. But take out the words Jedi Knight and change the main characters' names and you will see the book has little to do with the Star Wars universe and the characters who populate it.

I enjoyed this book very much, seeing an older Anakin and Obi-Wan was a treat, especially seeing how Obi-Wan has grown into being Anakin's Jedi Master. How he realizes he still has much to learn.

This is unfortunate as I have bought the first 7 seasons and they were all a laugh a minute. This series seems to be laking the quick wit in all the previous series. I dont like the non story lines between Darlene and David or Becky and Mark, also, the fact Jacki has broken up with Fred is never really explained ?? Not happy at all with this season :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Roseanne Season 8","review":"Excellent show - excellent season.

Otherwise, it's a great season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to watch.","review":"Roseanne - Season 8 is so horrible, dreadful, and painful to watch. Roseanne was such a funny woman but she lost her spark and somehow her acting took a dive as well. The only good episode is when Darlene and David get married and Dan suffers a heart attack. Season 8 and 9 are so stupid and pointless, I highly recommend seasons 1-7 instead, that's when this show was pure magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of Great Ideas","review":"Larry Mueller's Speed Train Your Own Bird dog is full of great tips, trick, and inventive tools to use when training your pointing dog.If you are short on training space, don't want to keep loads of training birds, and not bedecked with all the latest training gadgets, this book will be extremely informative.

All it took is for me to flip through the pages and see the trainer recommending giving a knee to teach the dog not to jump up and then the very disturbing picture of him teaching \\"whoa\\" using a rope thrown over a tree while tied to the dogs neck while standing on a barrel.I have worked around horses and dogs for many years and certainly advocate force when necessary. However, I feel that there are many more ways to train a dog than using the types of methods mentioned above-hence why I returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daylilies in review","review":"As I started reading it, many of my impressions and assumptions about daylilies disintegrated and a whole new concept was formed. They originated in Asia and there are more than 32,000 cultivars. Some consider them to be the perfect perennial because they tolerate a variety of conditions. Culture, pest, and propagation is covered along with requirements for registering new cultivars. It gives advice on which cultivars are best suited for your soil. Lists of cultivars are useful for selection since they indicate what size they are and how hardy they are.

Reactions predictably were mixed. The majority seemed to find it at least interesting, even intriguing. About 1/3 (my guesstimate) were as spellbound as me. A few hollered in protest or walked out - a good sign that here is something to get your teeth (not exactly, let's say your mind & heart) into.The music is top Messiaen. I have no idea how to describe it, it's so extraordinarily inventive, moving & unlike anything else. For me it is a work of heart & mind & I suppose I should add the obvious: soul.But one doesn't have to be religious (I am far from that!) to appreciate % love this work. The story is dramatic but there is humor too. The performers are just fine; Gilfry is a wonder in every aspect of this, I imagine, difficult role. - I could quibble about the scenery, but it works well enough. Besides I am not one who goes to operas for the sets & costumes.Give yourself an expeience likely to be unique."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Starcastle","review":"Having been a fan of Starcastle since the first album I eagerly awaited the release of this album in 1978. Much to my chagrin I was extremely disappointed when I heard it for the first time after purchasing it. It was a mish-mash of \\"wannabe\\" AOR pop songs that sounded nothing like the first three albums. This was the record company executives trying to change them into something they were not: radio stars. To make my point Starcastle themselves tried to get this album buried. It's so bad that I refuse to complete my collection by buying the cd. So, a warning to all: if you are a fan of the Starcastle sound just keep listening to the other six albums and don't waste your money on this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A travesty of the music industries greed.","review":"With three fantastic albums under their belt, and no radio play, the music industry was dying for a top hit. Somewhere along the way the band absolutely crumbled under the industries pressure and produced an absolute flop.It was not worth the vinal they put it on, much less the CD's that later followed.Do yourself a favor, do not buy this album! But by all means, do yourself a bigger favor and buy their first three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shirtless, Starless, and Sans Cojones","review":"This album seems to be (almost) universally disparaged. According to W. Sheppard, \\"STARCASTLE THEMSELVES hate this album! Starcastle didn't even want it released. The record company had rejected their more progressive demos and FORCED them to make this awful pop album.\\"\\"Forced,\\" eh? Starcastle released an album they personally hated?So much for backbone and artistic integrity.I'm glad the band is letting everyone know they're not to blame for their album. It would be just awful if accountability was something they aspired to."},{"rating":"2","title":"I guess I'm a fanatic...","review":"The previous reviewer says to leave this to fanatics and completists. I, therefore, must be a fanatic. I like this disc...a lot. I was a big Starcastle fan from the beginning. This album shows growth from the previous album. Perhaps it's growth in a different direction from what some wanted. I think it takes skill to write and perform AOR as well as progressive. It's unfortunate that Starcastle fans bad-mouthed this album to the point that no one listened to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonreview","review":"I'd like to review this.

Came in very good shape, looked new!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the man is interesting, not the house","review":"Forget the other Great Autobiographies like Paustowsky and Proust. Ved Mehta and his Continents of exile is far better then anything in this field of writing. In very elegant, humorous English he gives you the story of his life, and the angle differs a bit each time. That counts for the disappointed readers that expect a book about The New Yorker or A House On A Maine Island. What you get is the fascinating story of a blind Indian man that grew up in India, came to America, went to England and back to America, and combines all these influences and continents with humor and an intelligent attitude.A great series and another great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quirky, Equivocal Man Builds Ugly House on Beautiful Island","review":"Mr Mehta has a gift for writing much about nothing. To put it simply, the reader is left feeling like his psychotherapist.Here is a man who's building a house on the coast of Maine yet wants the walls to be utterly soundproof--to lock out the slurping and crashing of the coastal waters. Sheetrock is a recurring demon that plagues his adult life. Throughout the book, Mr Mehta gives up and decides to sell off his investment. In fact, this theme is so frequent, you begin to wonder if he wrote the book to simply help market the house.While the book holds some undoubtedly poignant memories for Mr Mehta; for the reader, it lacks any sense of coastal Maine. There is no feel of wind or fog; there is no smell of salty pine; and you certainly don't hear the crunch of sticks and rocks beneath your feet. You spend most of the book stifling in his New York apartment while he argues with himself, his architect, and his builder."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I found this book to be tedious and far too concerned with the parochial, and frankly dull, details of Mr. Mehta's feelings about having a house built on an island off the coast of Maine. Not enough about Maine. Too much about Mehta. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man's Work (?)","review":"The pictures are colorful and bright and the dad and son do look like they are having a good time working together. I am disappointed the book does not include any pictures of them doing what most men consider \\"man's work.\\" Where are the pictures of them raking the yard, cleaning the car, using tools to fix something, washing the dog, etc.? My husband was actually offended by the feminization of the pictures. There are a couple of pictures where the man looks like a female."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as the O'Reilly book","review":"I saw the mixed reviews on this book and went over and checked the ones on O'Reilly's Windows NT TCP/IP Network Administration by Hunt & Thompson. I didn't want to buy both so I went down to B&N at the mall and sat on the floor reading through them. The O'Reilly book is much better. This one is a typical New Riders book. In other words, not as as good as the O'Reilly. I wonder if all the anonymous reviews for this one were really written by the author. This isn't really a horrible book, but if the O'Reilly book deserves 5 stars this one only deserves one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing. Get the O'Reilly book instead","review":"Amazon gave this book it's networking title of the year for 1998 but it's hard to see why. The book is shallow and disorganized. It covers a lot of topics but doesn't give enough detail to get the job done. O'Reilly's Windows NT TCP/IP Network Administration covers the same material and does a much better job of it. Another reviewer implied that this book was \\"just as good as an O'Reilly.\\" It isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work and had to return it","review":"I could link up via the wired portion to my DSL and it was fine. However, the WiFi was damaged. Tech support (from India) was helpful and help diagnose the problem. It had to be returned for a new one. I just ended up sending it back for a refund.I'll probably keep looking for something a little cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good till it last","review":"For the private/small office this unit has good features but defenitely lacks on RELIABILITY. It would be the third unit I get replaced in over a year. If you need something that's reliable this is NOT the firewall / router you want to buy. Unless you like calling Netgear tech support, and getting frustrated over and over. Let me give you an advise. When reding reviews, check for how long the person has been using the unit. Good luck to anyone out there who still wants to try it or go with Netgear."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke down the 3rd time. I give up (although under warranty","review":"I have mine broke down 3 times. Twice before Netgear replaced it for \\"free\\", since it still under warranty. But each time they charge $10-12 for shipping. At this rate I could have bought a new one instead of putting up with the inconvenience. I think this box is very sensitive to power on/off cycles. It broke first time during the east coast power outage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Device should be recalled","review":"Don't buy this device. Neither firmware version 1.3 (Release 05) or the 1.4 (beta release 22) will work for any length of time. Yes you can call support (nice guys 4 stars) and tweak it by hard coding IPs, etc and make it work for a few hours but eventually it WILL go out to lunch. The first one I purchased was returned because the print server failed to function. The replacement, DHCP failed to work for any wired connection. I waisted hours myself and on the phone with support. Not to mention... The MA401 REDHAT 7.2 driver download contains no binaries and although the make worked the device was never recognized. Netgear wanted me to pay them $...to debug and fix the Redhat driver problem. Ya right! Hope this saves just one person time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not buy it again","review":"The 'content filter' is a useless string match within URLs and does not work for IP addresses. The FM114P does not work when connected to a micro repeater, support is not existent and my box died after only 2 month."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so performer for the price","review":"The Netgear FM114P is easy to set up and administer via its built-in web interface. The rest is problematic.We have had intermittant lock-ups where the router simply stopped working and we had to reboot the router to continue connecting to the web.We have had nothing but grief from the built-in print server, which likewise has sporadic failures requiring reboot. (We are looking at buying a separate print server to solve this problem.)The wireless works OK, although the throughput seems quite variable.Overall, I'm unimpressed, and will not likely buy any more Netgear products. Giving it a 2 may be a bit unfair; a 2.5 would be about right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 10 months. Still on hold for support","review":"I bought my FM114P 10 months ago. It stopped working couple days ago. Manual advises to contact Netgear support. I have been waiting on hold for nearly 45 minutes now; haven't spoken to a real person yet. At this rate I think I am going to chuck Netgear and go to another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke after 6 months","review":"just like a bunch of other people wrote here - the thing broke after 6 months of light usage. It's not a bad router, but kinda flaky - kept rebooting it at least 3-5 times a week under light usage (playing games and browsing web mostly). Beta bios upgrades are numerous, but very few of them worked well - although I don't mind it that much, since flashing its bios is a breeze.I think this router is very sensitive to power fluctuations. I'll put the Netgear's replacement router on my UPS - hopefully it'll get more stable and won't break again.Gosh! this thing generates a ton of heat just sitting there, doing nothing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great features, but unreliable","review":"The Netgear FM114P is almost a perfect firewall, wireless access point, and print server. Good price, decent features.My only complaint: I've had mine die on me twice, each time after about 2-3 months of use.So the question is: What good is a firewall when you can't depend on it to work the next day?This would be a great product if Netgear can fix the reliability issues. Who knows, perhaps my third unit will last till the summer.Update: My third replacement unit failed after a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overheats","review":"I had this product for almost a year with no problems, except that it was hot to the touch. But then came one major problem. Somewhere between 8-9 pm, different time every night, the internet would slow down to a impossible crawl. It would start working correctly after 1 am. I tried everything to stop the problem. Nothing worked. So I gave up, bought a new router and the problem disappeared. The odd thing was that when it was not working correctly it was not hot. So my guess is that it was over heating. Seems that it is a problem with this model. By the way I bought the Netgear MR814v2 and so far it works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heat Warning","review":"I had a great time with this router, easy to setup, decent WiFi range. But It is so poorly vented it burned itself out. Really this thing would be 140-150 degrees during little to no usage. I recommend the newer netgear routers, cheaper, lighter, and they don't overheat at all. I hope mine was just a lemon, I always recommend netgear over linksys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply simple to install","review":"I had zero trouble setting up the FM114P router. I have a cable modem and the set up wizard handled it with ease. I have my main PC running off a patch cord to the router and 2 remotes, a workstation and a laptop, using the wireless connectivity. All were easy to set up."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 routers = 2 failures","review":"I have had two of these routers both of which have failed shortly after the warranty expired. I kept the router on 24/7 but for some reason if the router gets unplugged from the power outlet it is difficult and finally impossible to get the router to come back up after plugging back in (after the warranty expired no less). The test light stays on continously now on both routers. No amount of resetting/unplugging has brought them out of the test mode. I'm guessing that they are using poor quality components to keep the price so cheap. I also use a very expensive line conditioner that it is/was plugged into to no avail. Will be looking at a SonicWall device for a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blues","review":"Hersey's Blues is an excellent fishing, science, cooking and philosophy of Blue fish.

Poor Execution","review":"As a fisherman and someone who lives near the setting of this book, I loved the subject and the concept (I particularly liked the recipes at the end of each chapter). But I found it very difficult to read because the voice of the Fisherman was too pedantic and preachy. The Fisherman came off as a bag of wind rather than someone to be admired.

Chapter 14 & 18 are really good, however book has some grave mistakes. For instance the answers of the Quiz at the end of Chapter 13 are totally out of place. Moreover, in another Chapter all variables declared in general decalrtion section of a Class Module have been declared Public with associated Public Property Get/Let Procedures.

Besides the many errors (typos, wrong answers, etc.), my biggest gripe as that important areas are discussed about VB but the information provided rarely went beyond the scope of information already found in MSDN and the VB help files!

It has all the hallmarks of having been rushed into print. It is riddled with typos but worse still is the information which is just plain wrong. Sometimes it is obviously wrong but sometimes you can spend hours working out the truth. Furthermore, the authors do not seem to know at what level to pitch this book: in some places they make a meal out of drumming in some point which is blatantly obvious and in others they glibly skim over a topic leaving the reader to attempt to infer their meaning. Get Hawhee's book from New Riders (ISBN 0-7357-0002-8): it is not perfect but it is miles better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars","review":"If you are looking for a good book to study for the VB 6 exams, this is not it.

(not the same) Sorry this is SLOPPY coding. They tell you to set class members created with \\"New\\" to \\"Nothing\\" when you are done with them, yet in the example starting on 393, they don't do it themselves....Very Sloppy, this book is going back.

A more accurate title would be: \\"...A Biblical and Historical Attack on Roman Catholicism\\". How could it be considered \\"Christian\\" to implicate as evil the faith of over a billion Christians world-wide? Please know that many of the references, although extensive, may not be reliable. Quotes are taken out of context, and the result is distortion of their original meaning and intent;(i.e., pg. 430, reference 82). Common misconceptions abound, especially regarding papal infallibility and \\"Mary worship\\".Ironically, this book dedicated to knowing the \\"truth\\" is guilty of the same literary manipulation decried within its pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"a problem: contemporary fundamentalism based in the enlightenment","review":"The problem with this book is that contemporary fundamentalist Christianity itself (which this book embodies) is based in the Enlightenment and the movement toward \\"reason\\" that this book seeks to attack. Fundamentalist Christianity originated in a movement called Scholasticism, under the theory that the Bible is literally true, and the reader is able to determine the one, true coherent doctrine, by reason, if s/he reads it correctly. Before this period, the Bible was read significantly more in metaphorical and allegorical terms (see anyone from Augustine to John Calvin), and not as a linear, literalistic, reason-based, scientific, doctrine and proof-oriented, historically accurate textbook, as Fundamentalist Christians read it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game Except....","review":"I played this on game cube, and it rocks. 100's of upgrades for your vehicle, beautiful tracks, and amazing graphics make this game great. Not much better than cruising with a 705 hp Lancruiser riding on an 8 inch lift and 38s. As you race you gain reputation and can qualify for teams, getting special parts and trucks. Also, 14 inch lift sucks. I tried it on a tacoma and i rolled over backwards going up a steep hill.No damage when you roll over or drive into the water took this game down a star. Also, there are 4 vehicle sounds. small suv, large suv, light truck, and heavy truck. The vehicle modeling is a little off too. you can turn tighter than you should be able to at 60 mph.Overall, the fun of upgrading your car, the racing, and the graphics almost completely outweigh the cons.

Interestingly enough, this was supposed to be the Collection Volume 3 (which would have had some remixes, unrealesed stuff off East1999/Eternal, and other colaborations they did) but I guess was scrapped at the last minute for this mediocre CD. If you don't own all their stuff or are missing some songs, then get it, otherwise just get the DVD with the vidoes (which I noticed they left out other videos which were previously on volume 1 as well as never released at all: BNK, If I Could Teach the World, Days of Our Lives, World so Cruel, War and Weed Song)"},{"rating":"1","title":"GREATEST HITS????","review":"I been a bone thugs fan for a while now and I have to say this is not all the best hits.

So in this DVD, when I heard \\"Fat Old Sun\\" done traditionally with Rick Wright's organ accompaniment, and \\"Echoes\\" treated with the same reverence, I was enthralled. And lets not forget the great Phil Manzanera, (of Roxy Music fame) on guitar, who in my estimation wasn't given enough spotlight. Robert Wyatt needed more time and substantive material as well. David Gilmour's guitar was, of course scorching. It would of been a real treat to see one of his lesser known works, like \\"The Narrow Way\\" from Umma Gumma. Oh well. The light show was awesome.

Roger Waters fans take note he's in there, hanging out and talking on the phone with Dave. Footage I never expected to see! Very cool indeed!Audio and video quality are top notch.If I could complain about anything it would be the lack of a DTS audio track. Otherwise this is one of the best concert DVD's I've ever seen and I own many."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"When David's album \\"On an Island\\" came out, I was a little skeptical. It didn't blow my socks off (but of course it's better than the work by most other guitarists out there today). Well, after seeing the album performed live in its entirety on this DVD, I have a greater appreciation for the album. It's a superbly crafted piece of music, even with some of the lighter, fluffier lyrics. Gilmour truly shows his brilliance as a guitarist.This 2-disc DVD is crammed full of material. I bought the Best Buy version for $12, and it included an additional EP with a few live tracks. The concert footage and sound quality are excellent. David is joined on stage by David Bowie, David Crosby, and Graham Nash. The concert is long and satisfying, and there are lots of extras, including behind the scenes footage and songs from other performances.This DVD is a beautiful piece of work, and it offers lots of material for the Gilmour and Floyd fan. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is an excellent two disk set. True, the video quality is not fantastic in some places mostly I believe due to the interference of lazers and smoke effects on stage, but the sound is breathtaking. If you were ever a fan of Pink Floyd you will enjoy this. The guest appearances by David Bowie, Gram Nash, and David Crosby are icing on the cake."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Gilmour","review":"Fantastic!!

I do not recomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am and will always be a huge fan of David Gilmour and his work; that's why I gave this title 2 stars. The performance of \\"Echoes\\" was stellar. David Bowie in \\"Arnold Layne\\" was brilliant.Not so good: First, the video quality is horrible at points. Not a videophile but it is really bad. Second, David's execution is lacking at some points, almost like, \\"lets just get through this one so I can go back to the hotel\\". And lastly, David Bowie singing in \\"Comfortably Numb\\" was just downright painful.Skip this title and wait for Gdansk to come out on Blue-Ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"As expected!!!","review":"Excelent sound, picture and all. On my tv DLP 1080p looks great all the bright colours but not as well as the dark ones.It's worth to have it unstead of regular DVD. I'd buy it again if back in time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"This DVD is stunning, having seen, Pink Floyd, Gilmour, and Waters live over 50 times since 1983. I have to say that this concert blew me away, and beats out being in Berlin to see Roger! In addition, the production, sound, authoring, extras and packaging are top notch! Watching David Bowie sing C Numb is worth the price alone, or maybe it's Echoes, or maybe it's Shine On. I could rattle on for a few more paragraphs, but I shall save you. Do NOT hesitate to buy this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"50% of Floyd is 100% great!","review":"Another reviewer mentioned that having Echoes here was worth the price of the DVD alone. I would agree, and add that having Wots..Uh the Deal also makes this worth the bucks. Too many of these songs he has done before ad infinitum (do we really need another take on Coming Back to Life or High Hopes??), but having this great track from my favorite Floyd album \\"Obscured By Clouds\\", is just great! Since that album is probably their least known (and certainly most underrated, in my book), it may serve to convince people to go back and see where this beautiful song came from. Other than that, great picture and sound, and a ton of extras (not to mention what must be 3 1/2 hours of music), makes this one a must-have! And I only paid $11.99!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Great Audio, excellent video, and amazing extra-features, packaging and menues.The music is very intimate, an excellent representation of On An Island.100% recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect in every way !!","review":"So much more than on TV with extra content. Nicely done camera angles, and Guests make the experience absolutly perfect. Very talented artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Gilmour is a master!","review":"This concert is way better then going to a real one, besides you can pause it and continue without skipping a beat! The quality of the DVD is superb and the audio paired with a good surround system really does it justice. Amazon delivers well with price quality and performance, very happy with DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than Meltdown","review":"I'm going to keep this short. If you love Pink Floyd, you'll love this. If you can't get enough of David Gilmour's amazing guitar magic, you'll love this. If you liked Gilmour's previous dvd, \\"Meltdown\\", you'll love this even more because Richard Wright is in full display for the entire concert. Hearing the \\"On An Island\\" material live gives it a whole new feel. Fresh, relaxing and stunning. There's a brilliant version of \\"Fat Old Sun\\" that ends with some of the finest lead work DG has played in years. Oh... and he plays \\"Echoes.\\" That should say it all. Buy this or you'll be kicking yourself for letting it rest on the shelves at Amazon. Just buy it. End of story."},{"rating":"2","title":"David Gilmour Rules","review":"This is unbelievably Great!!!!

All the reviews that are giving it a 3 star or less, well, we know you can't see or hear well. I say 4, and giving it a 5 for it just being an array of great professional talent on stage together doing what they love and do best, make music together. The concert being in Blu-ray is a A+++.Oh and for the comment about viewing the concert on a 120HZ television, this is concert not a sporting event. A lesson for that comment user, 120HZ is used for purposes such as sporting events i.e., Nascar, Horseracing, well you get the picture, but apparently you didn't. I own a 120HZ and why watch a concert in 120HZ, I wouldn't. I bet the person who commented about this issue had freezing and grabbing of picture throughout the concert.

The book opens the door to an amazing world and is highly entertaining.I expected \\"Growing Up Pentecostal\\" to either try to convince the reader of the merits of the Pentecostal faith or to be an expose showing the shortcomings of Pentecostalism. It did neither. Instead, it is a brilliantly written \\"coming of age\\" story which sometimes had me laughing and at other times close to tears.Mr. Conn tells his story with an almost brutal honesty, especially when he talks of his own doubts and of his relationship with his father. Although he is (or was) a preacher, Mr. Conn does not preach or try to persuade in this book.

The other thing is to rename the computers workgroup to the same as the print servers workgroup. After figuring these things out, it works great. The problems were minor, and considering the price I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"A year of anger and frustration","review":"I have bought this print server for about a year, and it brought me nothing but anger and frustration every time I wanted to print something.First of all, you could not just send your print out to the server. You had to ping it first to \\"wake it up.\\" Otherwise, it wouldn't respond to the client.Then, sometimes even pinging wouldn't work. The server responded to ping but I still couldn't print. The client on my PC kept telling me that there wasn't a server. Rebooting the server or my PC would not always work.Worse, often when I tried to use their tools, trying to \\"shack up\\" something (there weren't sufficient tools in the first place), the tools sometimes crashed and the server port disappeared from my PC. I had no way to get the port back, but to uninstall and install the thing again.Do not buy it. If you really want it, I am selling it cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once installed - works well!","review":"I am computer savvy, the installation left a little to be desired.

Just make sure that the default IP address for the print server does not conflict with any other IP addresses on your network. Also, make sure to turn off the firewall on XP.I am using it on a network which has machines running Windows 98SE, ME and XP. It works well with all of the machines after resolving the issues above. Of course, I had to figure this out on my own since the documentation did not discuss these issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product Better than Documentation","review":"Once working, works well.

I guess it worked because I only tried to print some one and two page documents that week. Then I printed a 30 page pdf document. It stopped printing after 25 pages and has never worked again.

I was also not interested in a 'switch box' that either required manual flipping of the switch or paying much more for automated directing of your print job.For one thing, I wanted my extra printer (Laserjet 5L) to stay where it was -- on the extra desk, which is not within reach of a standard printer cable to the computer. Why couldn't I take advantage of the home network (Windows XP SP2) I'd installed which had a router box near the extra printer?So, I started my search for an affordable solution and found the Netgear PS101. Reviews led me to believe that setup could be touchy, but for the price, I decided to give it a try.Well, it's worked out great. Setup turned out to be not that difficult. I now have a seemless connection to the second printer from all 4 computers on the network. Works great! (Be sure to shop around a little, as I think the price varies greatly on this product.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"The print server was very easy to set up, using the CD provided. No special training is necessary. Just follow the simple instructions. We bought it because the network card for our 2 year old HP laser printer failed. A replacement was about (...), which is ridiculous. This product does the same thing for much less. The response time from when you click-to-print until the printer actually responds is slower, but only a matter of a few seconds. Our small office has a peer-to-peer network with everything going through a switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible software, possible the worst tech support ever","review":"On the second PS101 Print Server (the first was defective), It only took me 5 hours over four nights and 3 tech calls to get it to work. The tech support only made it worse. Netgear should be ashamed of its tech support. Lazy and looking for any excess to dish off the problem. First they blamed the laptop, and then they blamed the printer and then the router....THE NETGEAR Router which has been work seemlessly for a year and a half. I finally scrapped the software and tech support, who were barely comprehensible, and installed the print server via the Router software and Vista. Seems to be stable and working for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste the money","review":"While I can applaud the effort it takes to produce and edit a video, this is little more than a poorly done home movie. If it were my father's home movie of a trip he took, I might watch it simply because I would have a personal connection to the individual. The video quality is incredibly poor, with many scenes admittedly shot with a first generation video capable cell phone. There are random pictures and videos of places, building and events with no narrative to explain what they are or perhaps why they are significant. I have watched many motorcycle tour videos, and this is by far the most poorly done I have ever seen. If home movies are what you are after, go to YouTube and watch Atlasrider's series on his trip through Central and South America. They are more entertaining and free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Author/artist Kenneth Harris offers a unique perspective.","review":"Kenneth Harris (1904-1983) punctures the pretensions of the dilletante and the high priced snob/artist with this highly readable and often witty book. Harris recommends a pragmatic \\"what the market will bear\\" approach to pricing and selling your art. His approach, however, sacrifices none of the artist's honesty and emotional connection to his work. Rather, he advocates getting the art into the hands of the people who want it, at prices they can afford. Harris also gives his opinion and advice on such things as securing an agent, staging one man exhibitions, New York Galleries, entering open exhibits, and others.This is a very useful and perhaps, attitude-changing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quantity Incorrect","review":"There are not 50 in a pack, only one.

I have a Win 98SE desktop and an XP desktop, both went online with no problem. The print server worked just fine after installing the print server software on both machines. The router automatically received all info from my ISP (DHCP, DNS numbers, etc) and was up and running while I was making my network connections.

Have played Unreal Tournament 2003, Quake 3, and Soldier of Fortune 2 straight out of the box. It's sooooooooo nice not having to f**k with network settings when all you want to do at the end of the day is play a round or two of a game. DSLReports.com actually shows a slight increase in upload/download speeds, so there's probably no difference compared to my previous PC/firewall machine, and from what i've seen, my software firewalls are all reporting about 99% less activity.

I have a Canon i850 on Windows XP, and it drags the print speed down so low that you want to cry. While printing graphics it literally pauses for a second or two after each pass of the print head. After installing via the recommended method (Netgear's virtual firewall printer port), I found a tidbit of two cryptic sentences on their website that suggested installing the printer via the Windows LDP/LPR port as a remedy for slow printing. This made no difference. Tech support then suggested turning off print buffering on the Windows printer settings. This only made matters worse as it still printed slowy but now also ties up the computer until it's done!I returned the FR114P and will now try the D-Link DI-704UP which has a USB print server.

The AP and the POE switch have been excellent choices. Not so with the router. Although it has features you don't find in a lot of consumer routers, like stateful packet inspection (SPI), logging, and email alerts, it just kept dropping connections to my home PCs for no apparent reason that I could find, and no support from Netgear. The DHCP server would seem to die, and all my home PCs would then lose their IPs and revert to private IPs (169.254.x.x). At that point my only recourse was to restart the router.

However it is not quite up to the high standards seen in The Robert Bruce trilogy. The story of how a relatively low-born sailor's son became so successful to be a friend of two scottish kings and their High Admiral is not very as convincingly related as Tranter's previous books. The perspective does not seem to be that of fifteenth century England. Also, there is no 'nautical' feeling to the story. Acustomed as I am to previous books such as 'the isleman, The Bruce Trilogy, Sword of State...etc, this has been a letdown"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Elvira Quintana movie!","review":"This is a Mexican traditional Western gun fighting type movie, featuring Elvira Quintana, Mexico's most beautiful actress ever. It has several very good songs, a hallmark of Mexican movies of this era. It has a lot of gun fighting, which is a little wearisome. But all in all, it was a very good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough for an introduction -- and entertaining as well","review":"Readers should have a little background in physics and some algebra to understand the subject as it is presented in this book.

The illustrations are pretty good, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"great outline, poor execution","review":"I'm afraid I disagree with the other reviewers. The book was not well written. The illustrations were of marginal value -- I guess it's always nice to know what these guys look like. Most troublesome to me, however, was the manner in which the explanations were utterly substandard.

Then he goes on to describe the different games that can be played. Pretty simple, pretty basic.

The various descriptions of DC being a woman in high heels and yet in a business suit, and riding in limos and also sleeping on the streets, etc. were hyper annoying. I enjoy good prose, this was not it. And it's a travel book, not a harlequin novel. Aside from the tone, I found the information offered was often lacking.

We follow them as they place their surveillance equipment and then monitor Castellano's day-to-day activities. Along the way they pick up juicy information about the boss's personal life, particularly his love for the family maid and the lengths he will go to please her. Some readers have complained that the book is more soap opera than true crime, but I think that's a big part of its strength. The authors show the godfather as a real man not just a power on a Mafia throne. The book is also good background on the conditions within the family that led to Castellano's assassination and the ascent of John Gotti."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendously entertaining and insightful","review":"There have been several outstanding accounts about The Mob (Pileggi's, etc.), but this book ranks among the very best. Boss of Bosses presents an unusually empathetic portrait (--for a cop-helmed book) of Mob boss Castellano. It's a full-bodied portrait of both the crooks and the lawmen pursuing them. Much credit must go to the otherwise uncredited ghostwriter Lawrence Shames, a terrific mystery novelist in his own right.

The authors, two ex-agents set themselves up as the heroes in this cops-and-robbers tale.It's too bad that the story ends up being an almost complete fabrication, because there's some truly entertaining \\"tales\\" told in this book. Forced to resign from the FBI, O'Brien and Kurins probably made more money from this sham of a book then they did in their crime fighting careers.Maybe they learned from the criminals they watched for so many years, eh?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"I felt that Boss of Bosses was a great Mafia book. If you enjoy The Godfather then you'll love Boss of Bosses. I think my favorite part of the book was when the FBI had to plant a bug in Castallano's house. The tricky part was that Paul never left his house. One thing that was nice knowing, was that the authors were the actual detectives assinged to the case. This means it's true to life, no embelishing! One slow part in the book was the hours of tapes that were meaningless to the story that the FBI explianed. This is what kept me from giving the book five stars. I love hearing about mafia and this book was great for that. I knew I wasn't getting rumors I was getting the real scoop on things. I think everyone should read Boss of Bosses by Andris Kurins and Joseph O'Brien."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wants to be a movie","review":"This book is written as if it were being shaped for the movies, which makes me doubt its credibility. What ever happened to good non-fiction book writing based on multiple sources, research, etc. People should know that the two FBI agents who put this book together (using a ghostwriter, probably) were fired by the Bureau for using confidential FBI information and for inaccurately glorifying their own roles in the investigation.

It has many excellent songs on it. But for some reason Nina is not at her best.Her singing just does not get across the emotion she is capable of. Many of the songs have a 'pop' accompaniment with vocal backing, which takes the punch out of them.'My Way' has a frantic beat throughout, which to me just does not sound right.Only 'I Loves You Porgy' and 'My Baby Just Cares for Me' showcase the real Nina Simone, and these tracks are available on other CDs.

This is the EXACT SAME, high set, saddle mount, single chain adaptor being sold by everyone else. The only difference here is that this sellers misleading pictures show the adaptor is a lever mount, mounted down inside the jack levers, and also shows two chains. What they send you is a saddle mount with one chain. It sits way, way too high to be useful. If that is not enough, this seller overcharged me by 10 pounds for shipping per their own shipping chart, which already includes a handling charge. After 3 e-mails and no response from the seller, I contacted Amazon. Wouldn't you know I get a curt, incompetent service person who does not understand what the problem is and thinks I should be responsible for not only the overcharged shipping to me, but the signature verified shipping back to the people who caused this problem in the first place.

At the tender age of seven, her parents took her to the airport so she could find her own way to a Broadway show and back. Her parents never worried about her, even if she disappeared for days. They believed Wendy could do no wrong. Wendy grew up to be pretty, caring, with high grades, and about to go to college.Paul Randall was the ultimate bad boy. Even the gangs steered clear of him. Wendy and Paul found themselves deeply attracted to each other. Against his will, Paul fell in love with her. However, he knew he had to let her go or she would give up all her dreams for him. Problem was that Wendy did not want to be let go. Paul would have to hurt her, badly, for her own good.**** Wendy is a bit hard to believe, but she and Paul suit each other well.

Since his book was written, all of these \\"flaws\\" have been researched, considered, and taken care of. For example, the FairTax \\"prebate\\" plan totally untaxes the poor, by giving every legal person (but not illegals) in the US a check (or debit account deposit) each month.

You can also click on an individual word in the phrase/sentence and hear it repeated apart from the sentence (since all the words in French sentences seem to run together, this is very helpful). Not to mention, you can also slow-down each word/phrase/sentence in order to clearly hear how it sounds. I have some other French self-teaching material, and unlike those, this one teaches you the grammar from the beginning instead of just throwing you into the language (which is very frustrating).

I picked up Closing Time at the library because I liked Catch-22 so much. Closing Time is a good piece of literature, but it does not stand up to the power of Catch-22.Closing Time picks up in the early 1990's with Yossarian and other Catch-22 World War II veterans nearing the end of their lives. It is a satire of New York life like Catch-22 was of war. Closing Time is a catching novel, but it does not live up to the humorous and intriguing nature of Catch-22.If you have not read Catch-22 then you should pick it up before trying Closing Time. If you loved Catch-22 then give Closing Time a try.

I plowed my way through most of this just to see how it ended, reading it was a painful experience, however, so I just ended up flipping to the last 2 pages. Heller seems to be trying too hard to mimic the style of Catch-22 and the result was as if he had strewn the work with exclamation marks, bold font, and bawdy pictures. There was nothing refreshing, entertaining, or rewarding in this book. Just utter redundancy and rehashing. For the sake of full disclosure, I love Kurt Vonnegut's stuff as well and it took me 6 or 7 novels but I did notice a bit of the same effect. Please, stay away from this, read or reread Catch-22 and don't let your opinion of Heller suffer the way mine has."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Yawner","review":"This is only the second book I've owned that I have never read all the way through.

After I read \\"Closing Time\\" by Heller, my suspicions were confirmed. \\"Closing Time\\" tries to capture the irony and punch of \\"Catch-22\\", but fails as a novel written too long after the \\"first part.\\" \\"Closing Time\\" rambles on and lacks any sort of direction. Sure, \\"Closing Time\\" has Heller's funny redundant sentences and roundabout conversations, but wasn't that in \\"Catch-22?\\" It is not apparent at times who is speaking in the book, and it is never apparent why the reader would care about Yossarian and his peers' older life when clearly Yossarian and his fellow veterans \\"made their point\\" in Catch-22.

Some of the old characters are back, but the style just isn't the same.If this book were released seperately from Catch-22, with all new characters, I might have given it three or maybe even four stars. Instead, the book has a \\"kludged\\" feel, almost as if it were written before deciding to make it a sequel to Catch-22.

This book would be poor as a stand alone work; as a sequel to the ground-breaking original, it's dreadful. We're presented with an older Yossarian, Chaplain and Milo, with no mention of what happened at the end of Catch-22. Readers are not told how Yossarian escaped from Italy, or his further adventures. The book varies between a dull pondering of the significance of war and an ill-advised turn to science fiction/fantasy. The plot revolves around a new US president who is a clear parody of former VP Dan Quayle. Since Quayle was a political non-entity by the time the book came out, 'Closing Time' became instantly dated.

However, it has two major flaws which would keep me from recommend this unit:1. The router randomly locks up several times a week. It requires a power off then on in order to start working again.2. The router times out idle TCP session after a few minutes, and there is no way to disable or change this timeout. After the timeout the connection is dropped and has to be re-established. This is a *major* annoyance for people like me who use ssh or telnet to log into outside machines, but it can also cause problems with chat clients or other network applications if you are idle for a few minutes. This behavior has been confirmed by Netgear tech support, and they don't have a solution.Between these two flaws, I recommend against buying this unit.

He disabled my ethernet card so he could use a USB modem configuration and therefore made the installation far more dificult than it should have been. Once the cable tech service guy got that sorted out and we reconfigured the card (uninstall and allow Windows to reinstall) everything was and is perfect. The router replaced a Netgear hub and life is as it should be. I had originally bought the hub to save the money thinking that I would never use a highspeed access but that was a false economy.

Never heard of Sweex before but their products do exactly what they say they do.I have seen on the internet many others who have not managed to get the RP614 working and then I have seen just as many who are happy with it.

It is slow and sometimes the whole system collapse. I ended up to buy Netgear Router RP614. It runs great without a problem. The network traffic is fast and smooth. I would suggest everyone to buy this Netgear RP614 rather than Linksys router. I still use Linksys Etherfast switch or hub with this Netgear router. It works great. I think Linksys have a long way to make the router very effectively.

And the problem has nothing to do with loads as it occurs with one computer on the network. I've also run every type of scan of my computer to be sure it is not a virus, etc and my computer is clean so the problem is with the router. I have a very simple system so the problem is not in the configuration. Now Netgear will not even respond to my support request email, they now required me to register and log the case in as new!

Yet, the new router still would not dynamically connect. Next, Netgear, after another 2 hour phone call with tech support suggested that it wasn't compatible with my Best Data CMX110 cable modem. So, I bought a new Motorola SB5100 modem. Still no joy with the RP614v3. Now Netgear is suggesting replacing the V3 with a V2, I think not, I'm going to look at D-Link and Linksys.

The card catches the signal (I held the iPaq right next to the antenna), however, it was almost impossible to establish connection. The signal indicator was moving from 0% to 100%, but the link stayed at 0% all the time. The connection with laptop (with Netgear's PC card) was excellent all the time.

However, they can send you one that has the same problem, since this issue has never been fixed by them. Before you consider, do a web search of this model and \\"spontaneous reboot\\" you'll see many have had this problem, and the final resolution seems to be purchasing a competitor's router.

Every 3-5 days, the user must manually release and renew the router's IP from their cable-ISP.

We were using Sonicwall, but they have really tight limits on the number of nodes you can have, etc (to get a comparable device from them, at a few hundred dollars, would limit you to 10 or so users, while Netgear allows 253.)

Our company uses these units to maintain a VPN connection between offices, and to our clients. They always seem to do a great job keeping a connection... It seems we need to reboot them about once a month to avoid problems. One drawback is that they do not include the client VPN access licenses, which are available separately, but at a cost.

This book was scary in its desire to regulate printed matter so that it confirm to \\"Christian\\" beliefs. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like preachy Christian books? Then this book is for you!","review":"I stopped reading this book after the first couple of chapters. I kept hoping that the obvious Christianity plugs would cease but they never did. The back cover never alerted me to the obvious Christian bias.Very early on the book has a cafeteria scene that makes it appear that Christians are somehow suffering socially by calling a Christian character a \\"goody-goody\\". That couldn't be further from the truth in the U.S.Then another character, a missionary, explains his hardship on trying to brainwash the spiritual minds of the homeless by confessing that he has trouble trying to express the true meaning of his giving. He gives because he wants to spread his religion, not merely because he is a good person. It's offensive to me to have religion forced in any capacity on the poor and the weak.This book (what I could stand reading) was terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't wait to read the sequel","review":"I thought Emily Ever After was a refreshing fun read!

I wouldn't have finished it, but I'm not a quitter. It made all Christians look self righteous and stupid. Jacob doesn't want to date a girl because she's a bartender! Maybe she doesn't want to date someone who is always looking down at her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure...","review":"My mom baught me this book because it has my name on the cover. I wasn't expecting this to be a religious book, and while I do consider myself a Christian, I was really surprised with how conservative it is. At one point, the main character informs a friend that he is \\"lowering his standards\\" by dating a bartender. I'm sorry, but is that particular job un-Christian? I don't know, it wasn't a terrible book, but I thought some of the opinions in it are very narrow-minded and naive. I'm only 17 and I feel like I'm more grown up than Emily in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short in so many ways....","review":"Hi - I am a twenty-something and I am a Christian. I really enjoy \\"clean\\" chick-lit books - Christian or not. However, this book had so much potential and yet fall so short of it all. I kept reading this book hoping it would get better and it never does. Emily just never gets it - she doesn't grow or mature in any way. In fact I think she immatures more than matures in this book. She lives a very self-centered life and never grows beyond that.2 stars for the supporting characters in the book, which I like far better than Emily. I enjoyed her boss, childhood girlfriend, and uncle the best.Overall, a very disappointing read - don't waste your time instead...If you are looking for good, clean, and entertaining chick-lit -check out author Kristin Billerbeck in her Ashley Stockingdale 3 book series. Very fun and enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, preachy and horribly written","review":"This book isn't worth the paper it was printed on.

But honestly, if the authors wanted to \\"spread their faith\\" or whatever, they failed. They actually trashed the religion. No way a real Christian acts like her. \\"OMG I LOVE HIM BC HE'S CHRISTIAN\\" and you know what? he was a total JERK and so was she. So cheers to the worst book I have ever read in my life. Oh yeah, don't buy it. It sucks. I can't believe the publishers agreed to publish this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emily NEVER after","review":"Firstly, it took two poeple to write this uninspiring book? Nowhere on the back does it state this is a Christian Chick Lit book.Basically I cannot finish this book because the character is such a dork. One of the authors graduated from Baylor, so that explains the Christian theme, but come on! Drinking is not a sin! I guess my Catholic alcohol infused upbringng just can't relate to teetotaling Baptist types. I'll pass, now hand me a glass of wine... I'm moving on to read Smashed instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But Consider Lilly is Better","review":"I truly enjoyed this book, but their second book is better. While I agree that I would like Emily to be a little more \\"forceful\\" in the book, I believe it truly depicts some of the struggles a young, Christian woman would have in NYC. I found it funny and inspiring. I would recommend it as a gift for any young, Christian woman who is going off to college or life after college. Asks some good questions, that are not always easy to answer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful and seriously cliched","review":"I am a Christian 20-something woman living in NYC and O MY GOSH this book is awful! The cliches are just too much. The book takes Christian ideas and goes too far with them to where they just look silly. I could barely finish it. I would say this is much more young-adult-reader than actually-adult-reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the best chik lit I have EVER read!!","review":"This was the absolute greatest book! I totally identified with the main character Emily and her struggle to remain true to herself.And yes, to second one of the reviewers below, this book is filled with moments that are so funny that I had to laugh out loud in public(something I normally don't do)--people stared at me at the coffee shop where I was reading it.While there is a Christian element to this book, it isn't like in-your-face or preachy or anything--this is just a great, fun story!Please, please, please let there be a book two! I am dying to know what happens to Emily after the big you know what."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emily Never Again","review":"Sheltered, small town girl moves to the Big Scary City and has her beliefs \\"tested.\\" This book is categorized as Chick-Lit. No mention on the cover that this really is a Young Adult Christian novel. The authors are very heavy handed with their depictions. I think the fact that Miss Emily is a Christian is mentioned on every page of the book except for probably the back cover, luring unsuspecting readers in. Except in this case being Christian means that there's no sex before marriage, and more judgments than come out of most courtrooms. Lane, a minor character was probably the most tolerable. Jenna, the hyperactive BFF back in California was obnoxious. This is not a book for the average reader looking for a light Chick-Lit read, this is preachy dogma and should be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"I've read a lot of 'chick lit' in my time, but this is my first Christian themed novel. I bought it on a whim the other day and settled down to read it with high hopes. However, soon I was mumbling and getting frustrated.Emily Ever After is clearly not the usual chick lit. It's much more... reserved than what I've read. Emily, the main character, seemed bland and weak. I wanted to push her, as she always seemed to hold back. Also, I found the plot to be very predictable, and even guessed the \\"twist\\" ending while still in the first few chapters of the novel. I doubt I'll be reading this again. Instead, I'll probably pass it on to a friend who might enjoy it more than I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Math is fun!!","review":"I've always been in love with math, and I'm so tickled to see a book that teaches Roman numerals in such a delightful (yet thorough) way.

Here are the tracks:Track 1: The Hampsterdance Song (Radio Edit) This version is short with no intro like the Extended Version.Track 2: The Hampsterdance Song (Extended Mix) This version sounds like a new song at the beginning, but then it returns to its original tune.This song is okay, but don't waste your money on this one unless you really, really, want to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Le Orme suonano New Wave","review":"L'album \\"Biancaneve\\" di Le Orme, in Italia rilasciato con il títolo di \\"Venerdí\\" ci ripropone la band nella sua formazione originale, quella triangolare. Niente a che fare con il classicismo sperimentale di \\"Florian\\" o \\"Piccola rapsodia dell'ape\\", i suoi due album precedenti. Qui si tratta di esplorare l'elettronica, con moderazzione. Sequenziatori collegati a sintetizzatori danno nuove sonoritá e rinnovano le proposte musicali dei musicisti già oramai non tanto giovanotti. E così che splorando nuovi orizzonti si allontanano dal progressive-rock a qui ci avevano abituati e forse perdono la sua strada.

Lucien was one of the most tortured and yet thoroughly endearing characters I've had the good fortune to read about in a long time. This book delves into areas I never suspected an historical would, but will clarity and no overdose of pity on the part of any characters. Bravo, Ms. George! I can't wait for the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opium, Lies and Murder","review":"The base of the story is that Lady Francine's (Fancy) lies to her quardian that she is not the Lady Francine but a servant. Lucien falls for the 'servant' and then is very angry when he finds out the truth. The depth of the story deals with Lucien demons and how Fancy help him -- in so many ways. Melanie George is becoming one of my favorite writers. Check out M. George's 'Handsome Devil' as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so naughty, nor nice","review":"Highly anticipating this book after adoring \\"The Pleasure Seekers\\", I expected the rousing, emotional read George provided with her previous release. Unfortunately, this book did not live up to its predecessor. Naughty or Nice uses the most over used plot device in historical romance: the feisty ward and the jaded guardian, and does nothing to change the cliched-ness of the hackneyed plot device.Fancy and Lucian are cliched from the beginning of the book and by the end, are just plain carictures of themselves. The reasons for Fancy's disguise are inane and silly and Lucian was nearly over the border of cliched embittered rake. But the biggest wallop I had to swallow was the book's lack of historical wallpaper. TPS was obviously set in the Victorian era, but NoN was all over the place. If you've never read George's historicals, this isn't the book to start. Try The Pleasure Seekers, a compelling and sexy read. I have hopes that George's future work can be as touching as TPS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful toy.","review":"Hi,I would like to tell you how wonderful this toy is.I couldn't wait to get it out of the box,and when I got home I played with it all afternoon.The ripcord wheel is really fast, but the Barc trooper can't really move that well.The guns are a little wobbly on it,and it was painted really good to.Over all it's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A couple different songs from the original LP,but still good","review":"I bought this LP way back in 79, and it had more songs.It included Abba-does your mother know,Elton John-Mama Cant Buy You Love,etc.It seems all the Ktel reissues are a little bit different from the original vinyls, as are the beach music series on RIPETE.But nevertheless, it's nice to see them on CD.This was a great various artist LP. To this day I dont know why everybody laughs at Ktel albums, some of them were great.Like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"This book had a lot of essays, but most of them were really not uplifting, and only perhaps 2 struck me as funny or laugh-out-loud hilarious. It seems that every knitter whose writing was featured in this book endured some sort of hardship, whether they miscarried, had someone or loads of someones die from cancer, or some other horrid tradgedy killed them off. I would not recommend this book as way to beguile anyone into the craft - it made me worry that some horrid piece of luck will befall me just because I knit. I'm taking it back to the bookstore. I don't need this horrid energy in my library. I understand that these people worked through a lot of grief, and that's great, but since I am not surfing that wavelength, reading about their problems is just depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stories","review":"The stories are good and well written.

The first one was defective. After a few hours with Netgear tech support and with online retailer tech support, returned the unit for another one. Second unit was defective as well. After a long time on the phone with Netgear and Online retailer, returned that as well. Retailer was nice enough to refund me the original shipping cost as well as the cost of shipping the defective items back to them.Setup seems quite straightforward, if only the hardware would work. I would suggest buying it from a local retailer only, that way if it does not work, returning it will not be such a hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works - but it's SLOOOOOOW....","review":"This print server works - but buyer beware: printing is slow if anything large (like photos or other graphic objects) are printed. All Netgear print servers have only 64 KB (!) buffer (according to their Web site), and this shows. So if performance is a primary concern, look elsewhere. The manufacturer's claim that this device would remove any bottleneck is FAR from the truth - in contrary, using a PC and sharing the printer attached to it gives MUCH better performance. Due to this, I'm still contemplating whether to return this thing or not. Luckily I got it much cheaper than the current Amazon price :-)Another thing is that since the printer is hooked up through the print server, the printer status monitor does not work for some reason. So I can not see how much ink do the cartridges have, for instance. This is annoying, but I could live with it if printing wasn't this slow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy cheap - Buy Twice","review":"There's a reason why this product is so cheap.

The generous \\"filler material\\" Cline included about day to day submarine life read more like a fictional account. The author has conveniently taken many questionable liberties writing about a submarine that was lost with all hands. Since there were no survivors, there is no one to verify anything Cline presents as fact in his book. There is some reliable information probably taken from official war patrol records when the author at least made the attempt to include something worthwhile.

If you plan on putting any of these songs in a playlist with stereo recordings, the degradation in sound will be very noticeable when tracks change. Having said that, some of the better songs are Steam Heat, I Can't Tell A Waltz From A Tango, Keep Me In Mind, Piddilly Pitter Patter, and the kitschy Go On With The Wedding.

Fox's alleged discrepencies are so \\"already been there\\" that I wonder if he took the time to read any of the leading works on the subject (for instance Gleason Archer's works).I doubt Fox did any study of the answer to Biblical criticism, as I'm sure he would have left a few of his points completely out of this work.\\"Pagans and Christians\\" is much much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piss poor prose and rampant colons","review":"I couldn't, I think, stand, under the circumstances, this book.

The camera angles and inside information gathered by the show often surprised me as I was watching the show, and I found it quite enjoyable. However, the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because they didn't thoroughly cover each subject, and I especially thought the manufacturing episode was rather weak. The data presenting in that episode didn't support the documentary's conclusions very well. Additionally, they only mention hydroelectric power in passing during the electric episode.Overall: definitely recommend to watch for a broad, and perhaps enlightening perspective. However, don't expect any detailed or thought provoking analysis of the subjects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Shooting Bench-rest","review":"Not super sophisticated like some of the fancy rests out there, but still flexible to use and the price was right.

Why? This book will teach you how to effectively apply what you believe to how you live. Here is a courageously articulated plan for bridging the application gap between intellectual belief and heartfelt conviction. Includes case studies of real people caught in conflict, lively anecdotes from the author's own experiences, and pertinent Scripture references. Get off the \\"perfectionist\\" treadmill & experience the feeling of being truly accepted. It will help you see how a proper understanding of just who God is, can lovingly transform all your relationships, and how to get rid of fear and anxiety about the future. This book is easily readable and clearly structured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally my own copy of the finished product.","review":"I designed the costumes for this and now I finally have my own finished product version to use in my resume.

I think if Odom had written one more paragraph about how Skater was so good at running the shadows because he never got personally involved I would have puked! The only good part of this novel was that it contained an actual Shadowrunning team. The characters keep telling us how they are professional because they never show emotion, I say that Odom can't write characters with emotions and uses their \\"professionalism\\" as a crutch! Professional? If they were professional they wouldn't be running the shadows they would be working for a megacorp! The characters were flat, the writing was poor, and the plot was so convoluted that it made reading Dante's Inferno seem pleasent! The last scene with the train made Volcano seem plausible. But, hey what do I know, I've only been reading Shadowrun for the last eight years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing sense of scale!","review":"I really enjoyed this program. I agree with the other reviews I read here, that it has a lot of controls to figure out and it is just a bunch of galaxies. On the other hand, no one knows much about what's inside those galaxies and I bet nebulae and such will appear in version 2.0!The movies and tech talk are very informative, and interesting even if you know most of it. You need to have the CD in for those, but you can run the simulation program just from your hard-drive, which is cool.The best thing about this program is the sense of scale you get in the simulation. You have to be travelling at ludicrous speed, like a billion billion times the speed of light to get anywhere in a descent amount of time. The universe is a really big place -- perhaps one of the biggest!I recommend this program for the educational mini-movies and the thrill of piloting around 30,000 galaxies.

I found it again after many years, and the enjoyment is still there. Sure the book is a little rough, and a bit dated and formulaic. But if you think about when it was written, it was the beginning of serious fantasy. Dragonlance was very popular, and RPG's were gaining serious momentum. Take it as a great example of its time and go from there.That being said, I enjoyed the story then and still do. Ms Wrede's characters jump off the page and her descriptions are outstanding. I would love it if she would revisit Lyra after all these years and write more about the history of the world. You can tell there is a lot fo backstory development that isn't included in the books.

When the parachute charge goes off the planes are pushed off the booster rocket and glide back to earth.From my several trials, I think C engines with a very short unpowered delay C6-2 would be best as B6-4 don't take it very high and the long delay time brings it too close to the ground before the planes deploy.

It is a very pretty book, with great photographs, but, sadly, it is organized by butterfly family instead of being organized by caterpillar body type, color, pattern, etc. The section for moth caterpillars is very small, only a few pages, and does no more than identify the moth it will become.

'Diggin On A Road' falls back to the roots of Sonia Dadas Chicago Blues sound, but the other songs are just as good.

He uses good examples and excellent looking graphics. However, once you start doing the problems they soon become quite difficult after doing four or five of them. I have spoken to a different Calculus instructor, not mine, and he says the same thing.

I don't know what causes that, but there's no way these cables can be useful of they can't be secured into the audio source. I am on my second cable as a test, both suffered from the same issues, surprised these would pass any quality tests from Belkin. Amazon has been great as always to deal with the issues, but save your time and buy a different cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice stereo extension cable","review":"This extension cable works well to connect my upper-end headphones to my speaker system.

These cables have a secure wire connection and are properly shielded to prevent crackling the audio signal. My only complaint is that the wide base of the connector makes it difficult to connect to my cell phone which has a rubberized cover on it. I can't get the plug fully inserted without taking the cover off. But I don't usually use the cable for that application anyway so its all good.

The Cables To Go model lasted less than 8 weeks...but their warranty wouldn't take it back, no way (see the review on file with Amazon) so I ordered the more expensive Belkin model. This turned out to be one of those \\"ya get what you paid for\\" situations (except, of course, with the Cables To Go version.)The Belkin is doing the job, delivering clear sound with excellent points of connection. It's a little heavy, but it's shielded and takes everything I dish out. I'll continue with the Belkin cable line. Looks good too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, does NOT work","review":"Briefly put, looks great and is sturdy in its built but does NOT work. It decreases the sound output by >50%. What was audible has become a whispering sound. I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not work with headphone/microphone combo jack","review":"I'm giving this one star not necessarily because it deserves it, but because I think more people will see this if I do. I purchased this as an extension for a pair of Klipsch Image Ones, but I experienced what many other people have with the very poor sound quality. I found that with other headphones/earbuds the extension cable worked fine. The Klipsch have a built-in microphone, so the jack has 3 rings, separating it into 4 sections: L audio, R audio, microphone, and ground. I found that any other headphone jack with just L audio, R audio, and ground worked fine. So, if your headphones have a built-in microphone, I would advise to stay away from this extension cable, if not I think you'll find this cable to be sufficient. The build quality seemed reliable, but I did not spend much time with it as I had purchased the cable for use with the Klipsch. Thus I did not really use it much before I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CABLE DOESNT WORK WITH IPHONE/IPOD HEADPHONES","review":"I tried to use it with my headphones from Iphone and it doesnt work.

However, something as simple as an audio cable, something that I didn't think could be screwed up, was. No matter what i try, this cable simply kills any quality that the original source had. Sound comes out tinny. Strangest thing is it seemed to remove all voices from the music, so I guess all it's good for is making every song you own an instrumental track.I am returning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds Horrid","review":"I purchased this item to extend my headphone cable a short distance from my laptop. I'm no audiophile but that makes the sound even worse. All the bass and mid sound was muted. It sounded as if I was listening to all of my music with a pillow over my head.

That being said, I've never had any issues with any other products and the headphones I've tried.Get what you pay for I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"This cord, from a usually reliable manufacturer, is heavy.

To cut to the chase it lasted about a week. The over sized connectors are as heavy as lead and this put extra stress on the cable which detached from the connctors in about a week. There was absolutely no shielding that I could see and the wires were as thin a hair. I consider it be a complete piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective design; do not purchase","review":"My first cable was defective and when Amazon sent me a replacement, that one was defective too. The problem has to do with the flawed design of the female end of the cable: when a plug is fully seated (i.e. it feels like it's clipped-in properly), the metal contacts are not correctly aligned with the jack's, so only a small range of audio frequencies are transmitted. I was able to get full audio by partially unseating the plug, but then the whole connection was one small wiggle away from coming completely undone. I'm pretty sure that the flaw has to do with the third band for the microphone that is now standard on so many headphone plugs. I had better luck with headphones without a microphone, but the issues were still occasionally present."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"lasted 2 weeks, used only as a replacement extension for my shure earbuds. cable ended up failing in the connection to the end connectors. the end connectors were overly heavy and big probably resulting to the wiring failure at the solder point. these are junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Audio Cable Ever","review":"This is the first time I have used an audio cable where the sound quality was instantly noticeable... for the worse. The cable simply lacked the ability to transmit the entire spectrum. Upon further inspection, I found that both connector ends were not fully tightened this was correctable as it is an assembly of metal parts not one piece of molded plastic. Belkin is famous for good packaging of mediocre products but they have excelled at being subpar on this one. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's just so open ended...","review":"Morrowind, is an amazing game.

If you get tired of searching the game for great weapons or other stuff you can just use the editor to make yourself the extra super-powerfull weapons that you need to beat the final enemy: Dagoth Ur.

Combat is also kind of weak, not much fun. If you played Diablo, it was much better in that game. I guess I found the whole game just a bit \\"clunky.\\" I have started to play Dungeon Siege, and that game is much better, better graphics, better combat, easier to use, etc. I was also a big fan of Diablo.

I think I've probably played for about 50 hours, and I have only had two crash-to-desktops. The only reason I am not giving the game a perfect 5 is because there were small bugs -- like the local map/character portrait not working. Still, while that made things a little more difficult, it didn't make them impossible, and I enjoyed the game immensely. Beautiful graphics, lots of plot lines, very engaging; and the ability to configure different characters gives it replayability. The game world is huge. Still, this is a game about finding things and killing monsters . . which could get tiresome for some people after a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I've been an avid gamer since the 70's.

The gameplay itself is superb, with open-ended character development and a large game world which allows for countless hours of exploration.And also countless hours of desktop crashes (which require a reboot), horrendous lag/framerate problems and everybody's favourite memory from 'Daggerfall,' the fall through the world. Actually, PRIOR to the patch, I didn't experience much by way of CTD, but now it occurs after about 15 minutes of game play, and without fail. Maybe in 6-12 months the game will be sufficiently patched to achieve stability, allowing me to return to the wonderful world-setting Bethesda has created. Until then, however, the CD will have to collect dust. Even with a high-end system configured to run this game efficiently, I have yet to be able to experience \\"Morrowind\\" without extraordinary frustration and disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better games out there","review":"Morrowind is so huge its mind boggling with thousands of decision to make which some big time gamers may see as a plus, but i personally think it is overwhelming and gets EXTREMELY BORING! Plus it is bug written and the game crashes everytime i try to play it after about 10 minutes.If you want a good single player RPG buy \\"gothic\\" instead. Its much easier to get into with equal to or better graphics and the requirements aren't nearly as huge. \\"Gothic 2\\" comes out April 17th and i'm literally counting the days until it comes out. So save your money and buy gothic and get to playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morrowind doesn't run, don't buy this game","review":"Not only does the game not run, but Bethesda's tech support offers only the opinion that my video card might not be correct (all my hardware meets or exceeds the specifications on the box, incluidng my NVIDIA video card), or the notion that I should reinstall Direct X 8.1. I have reinstalled Direct X, both from the Morrowind CD and from Microsoft's site; the game still doesn't run. When asked to either offer a repair that will make the current game function, replace the defective game with a functioning one, or refund my money, tech support doesn't even respond.

The graphics are great and when the game starts out there is so much potential. Then you discover the dagger in the first room and find out that the fight scenes are going to be very stupid and your movements are not human-like.You will get killed so very quickly so make sure you take lots of potions around with you. The night-time option sounds good, but you can't see a damned thing.The quests are also nice and there are many of them, but I think that there are games out there like Dungeon Seige that are better equipped. Dungeon Seige is way more repetitive than this game which is about it's only plus.I will be selling mine ... so come buy it....I thought it [was bad] but you might enjoy it..........NAH.RECOMMENDATION: COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY"},{"rating":"1","title":"what the #%^#$^","review":"After all the hub bub of great reviews. I've played just about every fantasy game out there and this one bites big time. It's slow, ponderous boring unimaginative. Played for an hour and was hoping that the store would take it back. For fifty bucks I think I'd rather have someone give me a flogging. Anyway, the graphics are okay, they slide all over the place and are really inaccurate. Very blocky looking, its a 3D game of the genre of 3D games from 5 years ago. If you want fantasy or roleplaying stick with Ice Wind Dale or the like, or Everquest or something. Save your money and get a game that you will enjoy and have fun with. If you buy this game well you'll want your money back and since the game cd is fine there is no refund. Sorry you're out fifty bucks. I can't say enough negatives of the game, I've seen and played alot better before and all the \\"great reviews\\" are from the company not from consumers.

I've put in as many as 40 hours a week on this game. I've had it for almost 2 years and still play it about 8 hours a week. I've beat the main quest (Tribunal and Bloodmoon as well) yet its always fun to get side-tracked in the hudreds and hudreds of other quests. BEST GAME EVER!!!

The game is engrossing due to the fact you can play it any way you want to and there is rich content that changes based on your actions. Most important, what I found absent in role playing games on line is that no one role plays. In Morrowind, because the many NPCs are computer generated, they are always \\"in character.\\" So you can really lose yourself in a fantasy environment without anyone ruining it by showing up with \\"Dude I am uber I pwned this zone.\\" If you like total immersion in a fantasy world with an actual storyline that has twists and turns, as opposed to the mindless pursuit of levels and gear, this game is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want a game that works out of the box: DONT BUY THIS","review":"If you've played many pc games in your life no doubt you are quite used to buggy games that don't work of the box.

Also, how many other games have you played in which you can pickpocket anyone, attack anyone, and even get your own house?!?!?All I have to say is if you haven't done so already, go out and buy yourself a copy of both Morrowind and Tribunal.

I was a huge fan of Daggerfall and spent countless hours playing that game. I expected more of this game.* The world graphics are amazingly realistic, but are drab in color.* The NPC's are lifeless and drone like. The world feels very empty and dark.* Soo many things seem to be randomly generated or at least created with no uniqueness. Names, dungeons, items.* The Character models are all ugly. When I say ugly I do not mean bad artwork, I mean (If I met this guy on the street I would jump)ugly.

I played all the latest MM games and finally gave it because it got really boring and keep getting no improvments (MM8 and later). It took me awhile to get used to the real-time combat system but (I guess) it is more \\"real\\". The graphic is unbelievable, the game space is huuuuuuge. You can be anything your hearts desire. Well, unlike MM, you can only be 1 person. Otherwise, it is very similar - quests, buy & sell, fighting, magic, etc.The downside - system resource. My 256MB RDRAM just isn't enough.

The stories (originally published from 1981 to 2002) have a freshness, perhaps by asking questions about how we humans would react to future realities. These 17 stores are not hard on scientific details, but rather focus on human reaction. There are no rigid forms and Maureen McHughs \\"Lincoln Train\\" could be thought of as alternate history. Greg Bear's \\"Tangents\\" tells a story of a young boy interacting with an older experimental couple, and the boys reaching new worlds that the couple could only glimpse. Philip K. Dick (creator of Blade Runner) short tale of cat-kibble and boredom is easy to relate to. Orson Scott Card's \\"Salvage\\", perhaps updates the James Dean story of restlessness and homesickness.

Yes, alcoholism IS a physical malady; however, the author's insistence that it is ONLY a physical illness weakens his presentation. Clearly alcoholism is a very complex problem and one that is multifaceted. But while the physical aspect is of unmistakable significance, genetics and psychology are of equally significance factors in alcoholism as well.

Finally, a \\"mere\\" slap causes extremely harmful psychological damage to the abused partner.Then the author goes on to state that it was the husband's alcoholism that caused the violence. WRONG!!!

Just when I'd had enough gore and battle, there I was in the serenity of a beautiful stable heaped with barley. Just when I'd had enough desert, I was in a stream. Just when I needed to get off this putrid boat, there I was in an English meadow. I see movie written all over this book -- the instincts of the Turkish groom, the intelligence of the English gentleman and the soul of this 17th century horse, played out against a violent and vibrant ancient world.

However once I began to gain a handle on this tool it gave me the ability to create my own MSTS locos, freight cars, buildings, or almost anything else that can be added to MSTS.While the price seems pretty high, it has provided me with with a creative outlet that has given me many many hours of entertainment.

I get similar, or better, results using Paul Mitchell shampoos, which are much cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally a shampoo that works on my hair","review":"I have had such a hard time with my curls since we moved to our new house. Our water is high in minerals and despite a water softener, every shampoo I tried left my hair flat and with little curl. I have very fine hair that even the slightest bit of mouse or gel would weigh it down. Then I started using the Playcurl and wow, what a difference. Not only does my hair look fuller, but the curl is fantastic..back to having spiral curls again. I use the shampoo with the Botanical Boost as a leave in conditioner and couldn't be happier with the results. I highly recommend it. It is a bit on the pricey side, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars, but given the results, it is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"where has this book been?!?","review":"I have been cheering my whole life and am now our league cheer coordinator and coach my two young daughters.

(and Intuit customer support sucks big time).","review":"I bought this back in November (and paid full price for it) before the state tax was available. Deluxe has always allowed you one free state in the past so was assuming the same for this 'Deluxe'. I'm not sure the customer service people even know this since I've talked with them three times about trying to get my money back for the state download. Why not just create a new version rather than trying to confuse people with two 'Deluxe' versions -- one with Maximizer and one with free state.One hour wait to talk with an Intuit customer service rep on the phone! 30 minutes to 'chat' with someone online! 24 hour turn around for email but apparently all they did was sent me an email that asked whether the customer support response was any good (although I never received the customer support response).

It does not say, nor does Amazon, that the State tax download is not included, nor does it tell that it will be 29.95 to purchase afterwards instead of the $5 that it costs upfront.

These aren't the final forms?!?","review":"TurboTax worked very well for pointing out possible deductions and walking me through questions on everything from income to expenses--but at the end, it threw an error message telling me that I couldn't actually file my returns yet, because TurboTax didn't include the final version of the actual tax return forms. When I called their 1-800 number for availability, the recording said that the final versions wouldn't be available until mid-March. Yikes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Free State Download Included!","review":"Be careful selecting the version of TurboTax that you purchase. If it doesn't state \\"Federal + State\\" then you'll have to pay an additional $29 to download the forms for your state return. The \\"Federal\\" return version is only $5 cheaper than the \\"Federal + State\\" so if you need the state forms you'll end up paying $20 more total to buy the state to use with the \\"Federal\\" version than you would if you buy the \\"Federal + State\\" version.There are a handful of states that don't have a state income tax so those people can save $5 by getting the \\"Federal\\" version. So why does Intuit charge people with the \\"Federal\\" version $29 to download a state form package? People with the Federal version should be able to download their first state for $5 with any additional state downloads costing $29."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangit!","review":"It should be more clear that this version does not included the state download!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I used the product as instructed and ended up with a huge payment to the IRS. I then went to a well-known tas firm and, although I still have to pay the IRS, I was able to reduce the payment SUBSTANTIALLY.

Bait and Switch as far as I am concerned.I do not need to pay for software to prepare my return just to mail it in. I can do that easily and much quicker with free forms from the IRS. I purchase these programs for the free e-file.Turbo tax does not make it clear that when you buy these products that e-file is not included their disclame is an afterthought in small print.Beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but extra for state taxes?","review":"I am a fan of TurboTax it's great, easy to use in my opinion.

I purchased a copy because I wanted to file online... of course I was able to file online, but only after paying a SECOND time to use the product I paid for.Simply put, if you are paying to use this product all you are getting is an electronic tax form. If you want to file online, you will have to pay additional charges. If you want any real help you will have to pay additional charges. Their online help for tax questions isn't particularly helpful, in depth, or well organized. If you want \\"audit protection\\" you will have to pay additional charges.Add up all these charges and you have what you would pay to a basic tax preparer/professional. In my opinion, your money would be better spent with a tax professional than in spending your money on this product and being subjected to the barrage of solicitations for more money for services you thought you had already purchased!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Religions Explained: A Beginner's Guide to World Faiths (Henry Holt Reference Book)","review":"I DID NOT receive this book.

Ok, I'll explain why I am laughing. I have been working on this book and everything has been good until chapter 11 page 211.

That is why I am laughing. The author really does just give up after chapter 10! Although there are a few errors in this book, it's a pretty ok book.

Maybe it'll work for you, but if you're like me and REALLY need this stuff taught SLOWLY step-by-step (meaning no steps skipped), then try another book.

When they started to die I got a high pitched loud noise that ruined several recordings and the preamp clipped. This never happened with any other battery. They must be real junk to cause the preamp to clip when they die - as soon as I put a new pair, the noise disappeared, only to return after 2 hours, when the battery indicator showed \\"low\\" (they are supposed to last 5 hours on that preamp.)

In that respect, BLACK DOG certainly doesn't disappoint. The acting in this movie is terrible, especially Swayze's neverending wooden facial expressions. The plot is equally bad, and is never very engaging. However, the one thing that saves this B-movie from being so bad it's unwatchable are the scences with Meatloaf quoting Bible verses while trying to kill Patrick Swayze and the hilarious bits about the black dog. So, don't expect a quality piece of cinema, but if you're bored and need a laugh, it's worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond silly","review":"I watch (and love) zombie movies, so my ability to suspend disbelief or to enjoy mindless mayhem is extremely high. I don't even mind Mr Swayze in the right film. Red Dawn or Point Break? Watch them anytime. Road House or Next of Kin? Well, maybe not all the way through, but I can always make it to the next commercial break if I'm channel surfing and I see one of them. But this is so absurd, with such endless data dumps where Mr Swayze has to explain to the other characters his own back story or the inner workings of truck brakes (yawn on both counts), and with villains who are beyond comic relief to being just Darwin award winners, that it's impossible to sit through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pirated copy?","review":"My DVD player won't read the thing.

He may have felt compassion towards the estimated 1,000 brutally murdered people, but he did not express it in his words. For practically the whole book you learn about the politics involved but not the people, the real people. The lack of enthusiasm and compassion make this book dry and uninteresting towards the younger audience.

It is quite boring! Only about 10% of the book is interesting. It is so oddly written. The writer goes from personal experiences, to historical facts, to \\"Did you know?\\" facts and then attempts to tie it all together at the end of each chapter. Yes, some of the facts are interesting, but you don't know if they are true. He hardly talks about the Indians of America. He always refers back to the Incas or the South Africans or some other weird \\"Indian\\" that I have never heard of. I couldn't stop falling asleep while reading it either!

I wish I had come across it sooner in my journeys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical and sensible guide","review":"Faced, today, with such a proliferation of books promising to Impart The Secrets Of The Craft, choosing who to listen to can be daunting, even impossible. Yet the aspiring Witch is unlikely to have a seasoned practitioner in easy reach from whom to seek advice; most of us have little option but to rely on books, at least to begin with.In light of this, you can do a great deal worse than pick up a copy of Moorey's book, if you can find it. This remains one of the best short introductions to Witchcraft (and, to an extent, to many of the concepts of modern Paganism, too) out there: clearly-written, non-nonsense, filled with practical advice on how to celebrate and live your beliefs - rather than sitting around with a pentagram and a few joss sticks, feeling faintly cheated. For the poetically-challenged of us, there are also nicely-expressed suggested verses for sabbats and esbats.At every stage it is practical, helpful, and (hurrah!) largely non-fluffy.

The ghosting wasn't that bad (ghosting, per the tech support guy at Belkin is minor shimmering of everything on the monitor...). Anyway I have put up with it for the convenience of having one keyboard and mouse. Lately however the ghosting has turned into barely legible and has created other strange problems.

This book does not have much valuable insight on Albania. The book for the most part is very brief and gives the reader just a quick introduction on the country.

The main charachters Ali Baba, played by the charming French comic screen actor- Fernandel and Morgiane played by the winsome Samia Gamal are enchanting. Samia was the foremost Egyptian dancer of the 1950s and is simply a real cutie-pie, displaying the artistic true Egyptian roots of classical Oriental Dance in a couple of dance scenes througout the film. The background music features a mix of theatrical orchestra pieces which are perfectly suited to Gamal and her signature graceful, glamourous dance style and some fellahin (country-village style) inspired Egyptian music.

It was like a discordant hymn, or festering lilies, or a choking taste served in a crystal chalice. I found it hard to rate and would recommend it only to those readers who can take emotional horror. Montero is a great author but she can be dark and dreadful in her imagined happenings."},{"rating":"1","title":"good reading for the ladies tea club","review":"Captain of the Sleepers: A NovelKept waiting to \\"get hooked\\" on the book. Never happened. In all fairness to the author, I either ordered this book by mistake or it was just sent to me by mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth 99c","review":"The storyline has promise, but the story-telling doesn't do it justice. Overall the book is probably the worst I have read in many years. The writing is stilted and jumpy and makes me think junior high creative writing student. I persisted to the end because I hate wasting anything and hoped that maybe the author would improve as things went on, but I should have wasted the 99 cents rather than the hours of my life I will never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"An engrossing tale that lacks continuity.","review":"The read felt like an abridgement. Description was sparse and it was very often difficult to see the story in the mind's eye. Charachters often had an omniscient prespective and their decisions and conversation left little to the imagination. Dialog seemed almost contrived and full of words. Almost no use of descriptive body language and cues to better understand charachters and their personalities. The story itself could have been a masterful tale of high adventure and wizardry, but it lacked any definition and cohesion throughout the book. Things just happened for narrative causality in order to progress the story. At one point, the main charachter is suddenly sidetracked as if the author on a whim decided the book needed more pages. It was difficult to finish and there was no emotional attachment to any of the elements of the book. If you've ever wondered what the bare minimum of detail and immersion was required for a high fantasy book, This is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic read for even a \\"non-fantasy\\" reader","review":"I don't typically read fantasy so I was surprised at how quickly and completely I was drawn into Maggie Bonham's world of magic, dragons, treachery, and heros. I read the majority of this book during a (unplanned) four-hour delay at the Atlanta airport on my way home from a conference. Thank God I had this book! The time flew by and I was actually annoyed when it was time to board the plane because I'd just entered a high action sequence and didn't want to stop reading.I highly recommend this book to fantasy and non-fantasy readers alike. There is a depth and excitement to the characters and writing that transcends genre. I look forward to many more novels from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I tried getting into this book today, and for me it isn't readable due to the poor paragraph formatting. It just seems like a rushed job with no followup editing.For the small portion I was able to get through the book has the majority of it's paragraphs left justified, but then mixed in are the occasional indented paragraphs. Reading dialogue is especially difficult when there is no indentation since it is difficult to tell when it transitions from one speaker to another, it just doesn't flow the way a novel should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful High Fantasy","review":"Ms. Bonham hits a homerun with this book of epic fantasy. You are hooked from page one and kept spellbound to the last page. I would highly recommend this book and author to those looking for a tale of grand scope."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Prophecy of Swords Utterly Unpolished","review":"I bought this book accidentally but decided to keep it since it only put me out .99 and I'm a gambler. The money wasn't worth it. Fantasy is supposed to take you to a place where you can forget all of the rules and become absorbed in a place where everything is different. That experience is only successful if the reader isn't pulled out of the author's world by an immature style and ludicrous word balance every couple of sentences. A shame, because the idea wasn't too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Stilted Dialog Batman!","review":"I read mostly fantasy these days, and I'm a pretty forgiving reader. I read for enjoyment and escapism. The last book I read (Robin Hobb's \\"Soldier Son\\" trilogy) left me wanting a faster pace and more action, so this looked promising.The overall concept and characters are a good start, but it never goes anywhere. No character development, and the dialog is completely flat, it's terrible.As you would expect in a fantasy story there is an entire world of races and geography and cultures that surround the story. Usually these are developed and built, in this case instead of being a tapestry woven around the characters to add color and help understand their motives it end up being literary flotsam that obfuscates the story.Bottom line, save your $0.99 and put it toward anything by Brandon Sanderson, Robert Jordan, Terry Brooks, Terry Goodkind, Robin Hobb (Farseer books), Ken Scholes (Psalms of Isaac series)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent fantasy!","review":"This is an outstanding book! If you enjoy fantasy, you will love Bonham's writing.She takes you from the first page on a fast paced adventure ride that doesn't stop.I hadn't read any work by Bonham before and was very impressed.

I also found the old English accent of the staff set in the Highlands of Scotland to be out of place and cumbersome to sit through."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the hype about?","review":"I actually somehow managed to get through half of this book before putting it down. Contrary to sexual tension or emotion, I found the book boring and predictable with very little character development. I could've cared less what happened to the main characters because they were so lifeless and dull. They fall into bed almost immediately and then someone keeps hitting the hero over the head and trying to kill him. Oh, who could it be? Of course, every 'conflict' is tidily resolved and there are some sex scenes with the requisite 'dirty' words. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"erotica -not romance","review":"This book was the first and last that I'll read by the author. Nothing new in the plot. Girl in trouble. Hero to hide her and convince her he loves her. But, from the first page, our \\"virgin\\" is having very erotic dreams and these explicit scenes continue throughout the book. Not much depth. I wouldn't recommend reading unless you are \\"just reading for the sex\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst","review":"This is the first and last book by Melanie George I will ever read. The book starts out with an Erotic scene that belongs more to the Erotica genre than romance. Top that with poor charater developement, more lousey sex scenes(not the romantic ones romance readers love), and to top it off, Historically Inaccurate. For example, It only takes them two days by carriage to travel over 500miles from London to the Scottish coast near the Isle of Mull. Average speed of a carriage at that time was 30-40 miles a day that would have put the trip at 13 days. I didn't finish this one, much too painful. Don't waste your money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah...","review":"I've read Melanie George's books before and this one is BLAH!

I used it to put together several shelves, let me tell ya, like butta! This gun push clipped head nails through 2x4's like nothing.

My boss recently decided to buy the N88 for our shop and my days don't seem nearly as long now that I'm using a nailgun that weighs less than eight pounds. There are two reasons I am not giving this product five stars. First, the light weight makes this gun recoil. If you're not prepared for it, it'll bite you, so be careful. Once you get a feel for it, it's not a problem at all. The second drawback is that the anti-slip foot for the gun is made of plastic and easily broken. It is also easily replaced. Beyond these two problems, this gun is a great product. I would recommend it to anyone, with a small warning to watch out for kickback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Between Tension & Horror - A Very Good Read","review":"Tananarive Due twists the reader through an emotionally charged spoof about the grey area between life and death.

Very satisfying ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Between keeps you guessing","review":"Due's first novel gives you a ricochetting pinball trip through the tortured life of a man trying to protect his family from something unseen and unknown. The author does a great job of melding you to the main character's experience, and you share his pain, confusion and desperate desire to protect his wife and children at all costs. While many novels with African-American characters seem to focus on inner-city turmoil, Due's upper middle-class family represents a somewhat forgotten group.

After calling Customer Service, we were told that they could not supply a switch, that the kettles could not be repaired, and that your only option after two years was to replace the unit.

I was drawn to another'spiritual growth' movement when much younger and had some agonizingly lonely separation traumas myself once I questioned where it was leading - so I found the account by Milne a genuinely valuable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Disillusioned","review":"So the Bhagwan gradually became insulated by an inner circle of advisers and was corrupted by fame,drugs and endless adulation.We read of this happening to people time and time again.Let's not lose sight of the fact that many of his early discourses put into book form are profound and insightful.He and his followers created a city in the middle of nowhere, an incredible accomplishment."},{"rating":"1","title":"more like a demon that accomplished what he set out to do","review":"How could this Bhagwan be \\"wise\\" when he was literally *killing* people???? Unfortunately, the book does not give much insight into how \\"normal\\" people get sucked into this kind of horror. And it would be nice if it also *named names* so we could know who the people were who cooperated with the Bhagwan's terrorist activities - there are probably many who are still at large ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Few live albums can top this","review":"I am a Manson fan. But despite that fact, i can tell you this is one of the best LIVE CDs ever. It contains all the feelings from the tour, the speeches, the hard sounds, the audience screaming, everything. I really like \\"Panorama\\", but everyone here just forgot to mention that the live version of Last Day on Earth, is one tear dropping moment. Maybe the best one from the album, along with Great Big White World. I gave it 4 stars for not including Coma White, Man That You Fear, Dope Hat, and Tourniquet live. nuff said"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dope LIVE show.","review":"I'm not the biggest \\"Manson\\" fan, but I'm enough of one to really love this cd. It's pretty much a live hits album. The early favorites \\"Sweet Dreams\\" and \\"Lunchbox\\" are here. It has \\"Get Your Gunn\\" from the \\"S.F.W.\\" soundtrack. Most of the big songs from \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" and \\"Mechanical Animals\\" of course. Plus the closing studio track from the \\"Celebrity Deathmatch\\" soundtrack. It all flows together very well, and stays true to the originals without totally sticking to them. Also included is some between song preaching from the man himself. Overall an excellent live album, and really the only \\"Marilyn Manson\\" I need. It will go great with your \\"Nine Inch Nails\\" and \\"Rob Zombie\\" cd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nicely done.","review":"Now, I am a pretty big Manson fan, and have been since sometime in '95 or so, and I must say that I really enjoyed this album. I have to disagree with the general consensus that the Beautiful People is better here than on Antichrist; I personally prefer the studio version due to it's itensely pounding synthetic beats. I like drums, don't get me wrong, and if I didn't ahve a pre-existing version of TBP in my head I may hav felt differently. As for the rest of it, it is very good, and manson's antics are highly entertaining. I absolutely love End Times, but can see why it was cut from Antichrist. It is superior to many of the songs on that album, but serves the same purpose as The Reflecting God in terms of storyline, which is a masterpiece. Astonishing panorama... however, is a marvellous bridge between Antichrist and Mechanical Animals. All in all, a highly enjoyable purchase, worth every penny and worth listening to again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grreat","review":"So much to enjoy here,so much to appreciate,and so much to love.The song that did it for me was the Last Day on Earth track, Never heard so much passion come from a man who is hated to the fullist.Why do you hate him?Why do you laugh and make jokes about a man you don't even know?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marilyn Manson LIVE!!!","review":"This is my 6th Marilyn Manson CD! These are some awesome compilations of Manson's live performances! I thought most of the songs were pretty good! I loved the live version of Sweet Dreams (Are Made of These) If you are a goth and love Marilyn's music, you'll love THE LAST TOUR ON EARTH!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one \\"Dope Show\\".","review":"Like many live albums do, this also serves as a \\"Greatest Hits\\" in a way. Sure it's missing some of his best stuff, but the popular songs are here. Besides numerous songs from \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" and \\"Mechanical Animals\\", it also includes a studio track, a soundtrack song, and the cover of \\"Sweet Dreams (are made of this)\\". The actual performance here is pretty good, with some preaching from the man himself, but not too much. I'm not sure if this is my favorite release of his, but if you've seen him in concert, or wanted to, this is an absolute must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality","review":"The sound quality and production on this recording is mediocre.

If he came out with a CD entitled Songs From Disney Movies, I would probably still buy it. However, I must admit that this is not my favorite Manson CD. Despite this fact, it does include many of my favorite songs on one convenient compact disk! SO...if you like Manson, and you don't mind a live CD, add it to your shopping cart. You won't be disappointed with the selection of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE FIRST TOUR WORTH BUYING","review":"I bought the box set of this CD and the video and I was really happy with it. The songs on the live CD are harder when they are hard and funkier when they funky than Manson's albums. \\"I Dont Like The Drugs...\\" is a real stand out and so is \\"Beautiful People.\\" The album makes you feel like you are at the show, however, I wish they had just recorded one whole concert without any edits. I found the fact that all the songs are from different live shows a little inconsistent and distracting. However, I think this live CD is really worth buying to anybody who loves this band and/or live CDS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manson gives a taste of his live show","review":"I've never seen a live Manson show (except for the DVD), but this sure captures the madness behind it. It took me awhile to get into Manson, once I got past all the crap that your parents tell you about him, and this was the 2nd album of his I'd ever owned. It blew me away, I realized that this was a true performer and I found myself rocking out to songs that I'd never heard before. It begins with a simple opening, that has a nice sound to it.Manson hammers into the first track, the band is really doing well on this one, and you can hear the intensity. This continues throughout the entire CD, climaxing with the final track (while not live, it certainly contends with the other songs). I highly suggest this CD if you're looking to get a taste of what Manson is live.BUY THIS CD NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not the same as going to a manson show but...","review":"still a great live album. i'm not giving it five stars because it's got sweet dreams and beautiful people on it, i long for the day when they don't play these damn songs anymore. if you're a collector like me you'll want to get the import version with the bonus cd. the acoustic coma white is suspiciously the same length as the LP version of coma white, leading me to think they just delete a few tracks from the LP version and called it acoustic, but it still sounds nice. even if you buy the domestic version you still get the best song on either cd, the live stripped down version of Last Day On Earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Do You Wanna Spell It, God?","review":"This is one of my personal favorite Manson CD's. I really love hearing the live tracks, because it gives you a feel of the atmosphere, unlike studio tracks, plus, it shows Manson's complete control over the audience members. He practically has them eating out of his hand. To Marilyn Manson (The band AND the dude), keep it up, and don't die before you get a chance to make your next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"An alright album","review":"You have to admit, that no matter how much you like Marylin Mansons music, that he is an idiot.

Sound quality is very good (**** stars), picture quality is great for a small LCD TV (**** stars), and I can use the remote control to my VCR/TV Tuner to turn the channels and monitor the source from the TV tuner that is built in to the VCR.

I live in a suburb of DC, not an outlaying remote area. When turned on the TV gives only total static. I tried an external antenna & still get not one single channel, only total static. I've tried the antenna in different positions & locations & also at work in Bethesda. Non stop static & no sound at all wherever I try & use it. This is when it's plugged in.

I signed up with our local library, months before Day of Reckoning was to be released, so that I could be one of the first to read this book. Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment. I kept giving it another 50 pages to get better but that never really happened. The characters were just shells, the dialogue was downright boring, and the situations were contrived and lacked any spark. I hope Mr. Higgins will redeem himself in his next writing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short and disappointing","review":"I have been a Jack Higgins fan for quite a number of years. Unfortunately, I found his latest effort to be sadly lacking. The novel has exceedingly wide margins and is double-spaced. It is a very quick read and has practically no character development. There is also a dearth of any real descriptive writing. Overall, the book reminded me of a quick draft of the dialogue for a screenplay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jack phoned this in!","review":"Am I the only woman reviewing this? Oh well, Higgins is a favorite when I want intrigue and action and a fast read. I am big fan. I love Sean Dillon and the rest of the gang, but this book was a little lame. However, having said that, please know that I bought and read this book with relish. I can see why the 'guys' were disappointed. This was really not his best but it got me thru a plane trip!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keystone Cops vs. Apple Dumpling Gang","review":"In a suspense thriller where the characters are unashamedly one-dimensional, at least the details of tradecraft should be convincing. But here Higgins sleepwalks through an embarrassment which lacks credibility, never mind artistic integrity, in every way possible. Should disappoint even the comic book enthusiast."},{"rating":"1","title":"day of reckoning","review":"The day of reckoning started off very nicely. A good mafia book always gets my interest but after the first 25 pages all the characters in the book did was talk about how they loved their work in the secret police in England and eat. I will say it was an easy read but very very predicable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Characters are Cartoonish","review":"I have read most of Jack Higgins' books, and he has been one of my favorite authors back to high school (over 20 years). I have enjoyed his older books and new books, and purchase them almost immediately upon publication. Unfortuntately, Day of Reckoning is terrible. The story lines and sub-plots are full of cliche's, and the characters are cartoonish. No one is likable in this book, or believable. It almost seems like a knock- off author tried to write this book and pass it off as a Higgins work. As much as I like Higgins and the Sean Dillon character, this book is not worth the time it took to read it. The only plus to the book is that it is a fast read, much like a bad comic book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I didn't enjoy this book very much. There's a large number of characters in the book. These characters seem very underdevelopped and it can be hard at times to remember who everyone is. Plus, at least to me, the whole plot and series of events seemed rather predictable and not overly exciting. It just seemed like the \\"good guys\\" did too much damage before the \\"bad guys\\" even realized what was going on and decided to retaliate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible","review":"Day of Reckoning read like a cliff note for a cheap novel.Like the other reviewers, I couldn't read this book fast enough.

A nightmare of narration","review":"The story is predictable Higgins. A depressingly bland regurgitation of old worn out plots and characters. This, however, is not the real problem. Whatever residual entertainment left behind in these tapes is strangled by Mr MacNee's astonishingly bad narration. He has never been a good reader and has detracted varying amounts from other novels. This attempt is quite awful. The accents are insulting and the tempo agonizing. This is one of the very few audio publications that I have been genuinely unable to finish. While I doubt I will ever pick up another Higgins effort I can say with absolute certainty that I will never buy another MacNee narration."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lunch-time thriller","review":"You can read this latest Jack Higgins book in the average lunch hour - formula characters, formula killings, and formula ending.

I renew my pledge to cease reading Mr. Higgins new offerings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't wait to put it down","review":"I have enjoyed several of Jack Higgins other books but I could not wait to finish this one. Nothing in the story got me interested in the characters or what was happening to them. I am used to, and often enjoy, suspending belief when reading these types of stories but there is a limit to how much one can take. When the \\"good\\" guys win every battle, even when teaming up with inexperienced \\"bad\\" guys, the thrill is gone.There was also too much dialogue in the book and not enough writing setting-up the characters or the story. It appears Jack Higgins may have run out of steam. Maybe the next book will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this book!","review":"This has got to be the most shallow and contrived book that I have read in my adult life. I've commented to my wife several times that this book is written at a 5th grade level. The characters are developed only superficially at best. You never feel any connection at all to any of the characters. \\"Hokey\\" is the word that comes to mind that best describes the plot and action in the book. This is a real disappointment"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the day..","review":"It takes to read this sophmoric novel. Cliche'd, predictable, abrubt, summarized. Reads like cliff notes. Worst Higgins novel I've read. Please take your time with the next book Mr. Higgins"},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt like I was reading a Hardy Boys book","review":"From the 'Eagle has Landed' Jack has sunk to a new low. I accepted long ago that someone in each Higgins book always has \\"a Mauser with a bulbous silencer buried deep in their trenchcoat pocket\\" - but this book is far too shallow. I was surprised that none of the other reviewers mentioned that the NY characters in this book spoke using British phrases - very amateurish. Like other reviewers, I've sworn off him before - I'll try harder this time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's about as bad as they get","review":"I'm not sure I've ever read a book as bad as this. It's as if Higgins sketched out a brief plot in a couple of days to give his publisher a glimpse of a future novel, but ultimately forgot to flesh out the outline. I feel cheated by Higgins and his publisher. They can obviously do much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak...Limp....Empty.....","review":"I thought this might be an interesting read, but boy was I wrong. This book reads like a bad condensed version, and that's being kind. The story unfolds at a break-neck pace, almost too fast. No thought is put into character or plot development. The characters are boring, and predictable. Honestly, I couldn't finish this book. I read the 1st 100 pages and couldn't connect with any of it. It seems like not too much effort was put into this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many characters, not enough characterization","review":"There are more than 75 -- count 'em, 75 -- characters with speaking parts in this book. The author spends most of his time moving them from place to place. And the characters are hard to tell apart because they're all made of oak or maybe hard maple. Some of the action is okay, but that can't make up for the wooden people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old Same Old","review":"The Jack Higgins for the new millenium is identical to the Jack Higgins of the old. Clear cut heroes and villains. A tale of delicious revenge, exacted by a group of superheroes. But oh, how boring, how incredibly predictable this tired plotline is. Go read some earlier Higgins, or grab some other, newer author's action thriller off the shelf. This one is all washed up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I can't belive that a grown man has written this. It's stupid and the caracters are thin and boring.

But this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up To Higgins' Standards","review":"As a long-time fan of Jack Higgins, I can only think that someone else must have written this dreadful book. The story lacks the depth and tension, so evident in earlier books. The characters are shallow and their dialog adolescent. Higgins fans are advised to avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book","review":"Not even same, same. Clearly Higgins and publishers have resorted to churning out mediocrity written by school children for pocket money under the brand name of Higgins. Obviously the best work is now behind us and like so many authors who have established themselves and then cease to respect the readers who established them (Clancy, James Patterson, John Grisham et al) we get insulted by teams of nobodies trying to write a book under a known name using stale ingredients mixed together in a drunken stupor. That's the last Higgins I read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Day of Reckoning","review":"This was the worst Jack Higgins book that I have evey read. The Sean Dillon storyline is ripe and needs to be retired. Dillon, the charming Irish rogue,is now just a pale immitation of the early books. By the way, how many times can Hannah express her disagreement with Dillon's tactics, but remain with Ferguson's team? How many times can she look at Dillon lovingly, but realize that his past is too much to overcome? How many times can she say, \\"Damm you Dillon?\\" What a \\"remarkable woman.\\" Also, why all the profanity? In a 295 page book, is it necessary to use over 40 different versions of the \\"F word?\\" Higgins did not use such langugae in his early works. I found it very distracting. Since this is my last Higgins novel, I will just have to reread The Eagle has Landed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing read","review":"It could have been an exciting and suspenseful book but the dialogue was so contrived, the action so predictable, and there was such a total lack of descriptive narrative that it was boring. Ho hum, and we all knew the heroes would survive! Sorry Mr. Higgins, this one isn't up to your usual par."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat Formula","review":"No doubt, the ingredients of a great thriller exist in Day of Reckoning. The villains are evil, the locations are exotic and the heroes are gallant. Unfortunately, all of these assets are thin and flat. The villains are dunces, unable to appreciate or even emotionally react to threats and disasters. The heroes are cool, almost bored. While revenge for a brutal murder is at stake, no real danger threaten them. It's a sleepwalk to the final page.Please understand, I am a big Higgins fan that found the Dillon/Blake partnership to be entertaining in The President's Daughter and The Whitehouse Connection. As a paperback, Day of Recknoning offers some value. I trust Jack Higgins can boost the emotion around a successful formula in future yarns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Higgins Losing His Touch!","review":"I have never missed a Jack Higgins novel. But the last couple of his books have been extremely monotonous reads. Same characters, same predictable conversations. I know I am not going to be reading his latest books more than once. But these books may still provide for exciting reading to those who are not used to his work. I hope he can come up with a better book next time around (and with different characters)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give it Zero Stars","review":"This could be the worst book I've read. Jack Higgins surely did not write this book. The author did not develop any character, location or situation. The story was lame, the dialog short and clipped and there was no attention to detail ( a 25 millimeter pistol, give me a break!). You can't expect Clancy type technical detail from everyone - but let's do SOME research. Do not waste your money on this one. It would be money ill spent. If you are a Higgins fan and feel you must read this, get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable Trite","review":"It's been several years since I read a Higgins book and it will be several more before I pick up another. The hero's actions are unrealistic, the gadgets fake, (a Howler, give me a break) and the dialog childish. I found myself rooting for the villians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Day Of Reckoning","review":"Not only is this the worst book I have ever read by Jack Higgins, it is the worst book I have read in recent memory. For such an accomplished author to pen such a terrible unrealistic story must be only for the money he receives from the publisher. Not only is the plot unrealistic, the story moves so fast the characters never get a chance to develop. The main character soon takes a secondary role and soon after all but disappears from the story. The print is so big and inserts of blank pages used to fill up empty space certainly must be meant for the reader to take notes on. A waste of $18.17"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Jack a Ghost Writer on this one?","review":"I, like most people who have read and reviewed this latest novel by Jack Higgins, have read and own every previous story he has published. This one confused me, and it was almost like someone else was the author of this one or he was in a hurry to finish it. None the less I will be looking forward to his next one and wish that he would get back to his WW11 scenerios."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate to say it - disappointing","review":"Like others who have reviewed this book, I have read every Higgins book, no matter what name it was written under. This is the first time I was truly disappointed. The story was incredibly predictable, the dialogue trite. In general, the novel was thrown together without his usual flair. I thought his twist at the end concerning Hannah Bernstein was sadly out of character for the person we've seen in previous books. How old is Feguson at this point and when will he retire?On the positive side, it's an easy read and filled up my time flying cross country."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a page turner...","review":"Like so many of the other reviewers, I grew to love Jack Higgins through \\"The Eagle Has Landed\\". I bought this book by the author. Now I wish I had read the reviews. The characters are incredibly shallow. The dialog rarely ventures below \\"well if you are a friend of Sean Dillon's, then you're a friend of mine...\\". Boring reading with a lackluster ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't make this book sound any better","review":"I actually did not read the book, but listened to the audiocassete narrated by Frank Muller. Anyone familiar with the audiobooks industry knows that a bad narrator can make a great novel sound absolutely terrible, while a great narrator can make a terrible novel sound great. Frank Muller is a great narrator and can make magic happen with less than average stories. Unfortunately, Muller just could not make it happen with \\"Day of Reckoning\\". He could not hide the long and monotonous description of characters that Higgins portrayed, which actuallly proved to be a moot point with a lot of the scenarios anyways. This book doesn't even come close to an anticlimactic ending and in laymen's terms, this novel (isn't good)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sean Dillon is at his very BEST!","review":"Another action packed book by Jack Higgins featuring Sean Dillon at his BEST against the mafia. I couldn't put it down and you won't be able to either!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How bad can a book be .....","review":"This has to be one of the worst books I have every had the displeasure of reading. First and foremost there is no character development at all. In an effort to write a book that moves along at a quick pace he pushed the story along at a pace that nothing is enjoyable. As to what characterization he created was in many cases offensive. Especially of people of Italian decent. I think Mr. Higgins has let his prejudices shine through in his work. I would suggest he do a little more homework on his subject matter if he is going to create a believable reality for his stories. This is the first book I have ever read by Higgins and I think it will be the last. Thank god I purchased this book at the bargain table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak","review":"I really like the Sean Dillon character, but the books are getting worse and worse. There is no suspense. There is total casualness in every character because they know they won't die. They could face the Red Army single handed, any one of them, and come out unscathed. So what is their motivation? None. What is mine to buy the next book? None.Also, I am not what one would call a liberal, but the way Ferguson and Blake Johnson run around like judge,jury, and executioner offends even me. If they think you are a mobster or terrorist they kill you, and apparently the PM and President trust them so much that they would never reign them in. I'd really like it in the next book if Blake Johnson would find dirt on some guy who gave a couple of million to the presidents campaign, and plan to indiscriminately kill him. It would at least show something that I could beleive when then President told him to just cover it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formula work - only fair","review":"There are some plots which can only be described as formula. One such plot is the revenge novel - the antagonist has done something so bad the hero is out to kill or destroy him in return.In this overdone genre, for a novel to be worth reading either the characters or the specific situations of the chase must be well drawn and different from what we have seen before in this type of novel.Unfortunately, this latest novel of Higgins offers nothing new or exciting in this regard. The work is pure formula from start to finish. Futhermore, while I have no objection to a novel opening with a flashforward scene, (it is usually an exciting moment, - grabs our interest and keeps us reading) - I hate it when it takes 95% of the novel to reach that first scene in the first chapter.Alas, even the last 5% at the end is unsatisfying.\\"Flight of Eagles\\" was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay ... so what?","review":"Here's the cliff notes version:Within the first 10 pages of the book, the reader learns the good guy wants to ruin the bad guy by doing A, B, C and D. Two hundred plus pages later, the good guy has done A, B, C and D. The end.Next book, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally superficial claptrap","review":"What suckers we mortals be! I've no idea whether the author has been or is able to write a good book. Apparently he has developed some following among readers of formulaic derring do. But that aside, every book should stand on its own, and this one was obviously tossed off in a week or so by a bored and complacent writer and produced by an equally bored and cynical publisher confident that the author's fans would shell out once again. This piece, aside from its cardboard characters, ridiculous plot, and total failure to develop any atmosphere for the numerous locations among which the protagonists hop, is replete with grammatical and typographical bloopers that no self-respecting writer or editor should commit. However, this quality of work is becoming more the norm than the exception in pop fiction. The state of modern fiction of this sort may be one good indicator of the state of our educational system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This book was not entertaining in the least. Predictable. Boring. Trite. At times ridiculous. Big print. Almost double-spaced. Much of the plot was just unpalatable. I will not purchase a new Higgins novel in the future if this is what he's cranking out. Ugh, I couldn't finish it fast enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and cliche","review":"This book was so forgettable I had to search Amazon on the names of the lead characters to find the name of the book only a few days after finishing the novel!You see this book coming a million miles away. Higgins simply phones in the effort.I've read other books as part of larger series and I never felt left out. This book was the exception. Unlike the Master and Commander series, or the Leaphorn/Chee mysteries, this book depends on previous books. At least that's my assumption since this book is so lame on its own. For example, you start this book with a lead character, but once we meet the series' principal characters, the first character gets third billing.This book is NOT recommended. I gave it 2 stars because I was entertained moderately and did finish it. (If it was really bad, I would have cut bait!) The character Dillon is somewhat interesting, perhaps more so if you have interest in the IRA, Northern Ireland, and all that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Lame","review":"Not very well developed.

All in all, mind numbing and predictible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book","review":"The Day of Reckoning is an exemplar of a novel at its worst.

Although the book did cover many bases, the book was very disjointed and in my opinion unreadable in many sections. Repetition is rampid within it's pages. I passed the exam, but I used multiple resources before I took the test. I would highly recommend consulting other resources in addition to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A exam supplement - but not very well written","review":"The author has an annoying habit of throwing in things that aren't explained - until later in the book.

My boys loved it and it was something they both could ride on and I would pull them around in it. It was hilarious when they would slide off and try to get back on. The only problem we've had is that it is irresistable to other children and as soon as they spotted it, they wanted to play on it too and it was hard making sure everyone got on a turn on it, especially my kids! As far as durability, we've had this for almost 3 years now and even with dragging it on the sand, it is still going strong. I would recommend it but beware if you are in a busy public area, any kids within seeing distance will come flocking to it like magnets!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor","review":"This release is something of a mess. The most glaring problem is the total absence of subtitles. French is the spoken language for about 90% of the film, yet no subtitles in any language are available. The menu is basically non-existent. The only buttom is for \\"film\\". There are no chapter points available, certainly no extras.All voices appear to be dubbed (badly), even for obviously French-speaking actors, including Delon.The print is passable, but not much better than what you would see on a VHS copy.It is difficult for me to comment on the film since my skill in understanding French is limited. It appears to be a noir-ish thriller with few jolts. Fans of Delon will enjoy seeing him at his athletic best in some exciting chase scenes, but please do wait for a DVD release properly presented. My copy of \\"Les Felins\\" arrived yesterday. It's being returned to Amazon today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Joyless Exercise","review":"This meandering noir brought to my mind a French word...ennui.

Forgettable in the extreme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dorothy Garlock is still the BEST!","review":"It took me one day to read this book. I Loved It!

Why this series hasn't been grabbed for a mini series is beyond me... it has all the best qualities!!!!The romance is so powerful and strong, I couldn't put the book down. I read this one in two days, and was left breathless for more! Luckily, \\"After The Parade\\" was waiting for me! You won't be disappointed. If you read any of Ms. Garlock's books, read this one!!! You do not have to read the series in order, there is enough information cleverly included so that you don't miss a beat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book deserves 20 stars","review":"This is an excellent book.

I haven't really been fully on board with the Bats for a few years now -- iffy solo stuff, etc. -- but this lush, dreamy set of drony guitar songs swept me away...

Very nice, very mellow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bats second wind","review":"The Bats were an integral part of the odd jangly pop of the New Zealand 80's south isle: lovely, often pastoral songs that never seemed to age at their high points...Who could ever grow tired of the inscrutable \\"The Other Side of You\\"? But after The Law of Things the band seemed to go into decline, with cleaner and more conventional sounding records that stepped away from their Clean-ish roots.At the National Grid is a terrific return to form, albeit a different one than the early records that made their name. The songs have less of the nervy hooks and catchy immediacy, instead offering lushness and hazy mood. Technically they never sounded this good in the studio before and they take time to stretch out and enjoy the sonics of songs, many of which are gilded with a slight psychedelic haze. But this is no shoegaze outing, and this is still the band behind those great early records.

Montecino makes them work well, oh so well, together, and also convincingly pulls them apart.

All too often, Mythos imitators misuse the conventions of the genre, with the mysterious elements brought right into the open so the writer's hero can solve them with some half-baked solution. This is in contrast to HP Lovecraft's stories, which mostly ended with the protagonist getting eaten by something or shooting himself. This anthology does not add much to what could have been the richest horror genre of them all. Instead, it just piles on more so-so stories that aren't innovative or all that memorable. It's not that the stories are universally bad, they're just so much less than they could have been, given the material the authors had to work with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovecraft Did NOT edit this","review":"HPL died in 1937. This book was published last year. He did NOT edit it. If he did, the contents would have been much better than the tripe contained therein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty goods","review":"I've used these strings for the past 2 years and they usually last for ever. I purchased 4 sets from Amazon a couple of months ago and they are faulty, the 2W snapped on 3 of the sets when fitting, not good. I'll stick to Guitar Center in the future! Awesome strings, watch were you buy them from!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last, could be my fault though","review":"These strings are great when I put them on my Breedlove Atlas, sounds bright and different from the popular phosphorous bronze strings.It works great and sounds right; however, after I applied GHS fast-fret onto the strings, I feel there's something different about the strings, it becomes dull and kind of sticky feeling, not as bright and fresh as it used to be. After couple days, the strings are just dead. It lost it's bright color and the tone was just muddy with no high's and no definition on the low's, basically a corroded, dead strings' feeling.As a comparison, the fast-fret works great with my MXR and Elixir phosphorous bronze, so imo it's not likely to be the fast-fret's problem.It may be my fault to put string oil on it, but I'm not so sure if that's really the problem.Anyways, if by any chance I need to use them again(during emergence situation i guess), I would leave it w/out the string oil and come back for more reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Backroads is a complete waste of your $$$","review":"Do not order this. It is a child's level scribbled guide that is useless. I threw it in the trash after 15 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"no ending in sight","review":"I read the two books in tandem (Hannibal's Children and The Seven Hills) and thought the second especially drifted. Submarines, flying soldiers, very far-fetched...but what really irks me is the third book is nowhere in sight! It seems like after 4 years one could read the conclusion...but the author has chosen to leave the readership dangling after happily cashing our proverbial checks...if you are looking for good alternative history, stick with turtledove, flint...who give some resolution or at least a next book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rome is back","review":"Hannibal's Children is an excellent work of alternative history. His Roman characters show the complex mix of patriotism and backstabbing ambitions that made the Roman Republic master of the world (well a good chunk of it) in our timeline. His new Cleopatra is also excellent. The Carthagians were less convincing, simply coniniving rich folks with little competence. That future for a victorious Carthage is credible but it made the story less interesting. The new mechanical technology of the Archmidians was a bit much, I mean a submarine in the first century??All around it was an excellent book, lots of good action and credible historical detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"As a bit of a Roman history buff, and a fan of alternative history in general, this book was a joy to read. My favorite period in roman history was the late Republic before the rise of Caesar and the later emperors. In this book, that is how the romans are portrayed. Expanionist, ruthless, but still having legions made up of landowning citizens.I don't know how plausible it would have been that Hannibal would have offered the Romans exile, which is is the premise for the change in history, but it makes for a good story. Parts of the book seemed rushed. Which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It should have been longer. It appears this may be a trilogy, based on what I've read so far of the sequel, The Seven Hills."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good for pasta","review":"Pot and insert are too short for the diameter. Pot with insert must be filled all the way to the top to have enough for things like spaghetti, fettucine, linguine and the like. Inceases danger of boilover and makes pot too heavy for easy handling. Pay more to get a pot that's smaller diameter for the height. It's still a good stockpot but get a better one for pasta."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good collection, nice bibliography, nice notes on stories","review":"In this collection, Kevin Crossley-Holland tells a number of folktales from across the British Isles including areas which have primarily Norse, Celtic, and Anglo-Saxon heritage. The stories are broken up into categories (fairies, animal tales, ghosts, enchantment, etc), and the introduction to each section describes the sources for each story included in that section.This collection is a great collection for the whole family to enjoy but it also is of use to those studying the mythology and culture of the various peoples who settled these islands. Some of the stories connect quite strongly with Norse myth. Others connect quite strongly with Celtic myth.I particularly found the bibliography helpful. While I own several books in that bibliography, I expect to find it useful in further fleshing out my folklore collection. Bibliographies are somewhat rare in these sorts of books so it is well appreciated here.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks like a Junior High School science project","review":"This book appears to have been slapped together with less than two weeks of work. I was constantly confused by discrepancies between the descriptions and the photographs. Lichens described as bright green, chartreuse, orange, red, etc., were all about the same dull shade of gray-brown in the pictures. This may be due to poor photography, poor reproduction, or the fact that the lichens pictured are old dessicated herbarium specimens rather than living lichens in their natural setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"There is a lot of variety on this CD. There are some good songs that I have never heard of on this CD that probably haven't been released yet..I wouldn't say that this CD is worth the extra money that you pay because it's an import. It's best if you save your money and buy another CD you want. But, if you do get this CD, it's pretty good..about average I would say..not extremely good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Overview of Life as a B-52 Pilot in SAC","review":"I flew BUFFs (I prefer the longer acronym) from 1970 - 1974 towards the end of the author's story, but his descriptions were right on. Helped me recall some memories that had faded. For the former crewmember or sustainer, or for someone trying to understand what flying B-52 missions was like in the '70s in both the States and Arc Light this book is a must. Does a nice job of showing the lighter side of crew life while keeping the story suitable for a general audience. Charlie and Ned you guys are still great! Only thing I would have liked to see was some photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"True BUF Memories","review":"It's difficult to add to the previously written reviews of this book, since those reviewers already said it all. I can only concur with their opinions and thoughts, and add that the book brings back a flood of memories. Since my particular experience was mainly with the BUF, I immensely enjoyed reading this book. From the boredom of alert duty to the tedious flights from Anderson to SEA during Arc Light, all may not have been glamour or glory. However, excitement and drama certainly did occur during those war days. The camaraderie and friendships that developed were deep and lasting. It's a \\"must read\\" for any former SAC mamber, especially B52 personel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Where The Buf Fellows Roamed","review":"This book is a must for all B-52 fans and military aviation enthusiasts. Col. Hooppaw chronicles his military flying career in SAC beginning with the B-47 and then moving on to the B-52. He flew every model of the Buff from the C through H models. His book is well written, informative, entertaining and hits the mark as far as flying in SAC from the 1960's through the 1980's goes. He covers the ARC Light missions of the Vietnam war and really puts the reader in the aircraft with the crew while giving an insiders view of what it was actually like to take the Buff into combat. I consider this one of the best books I have ever read on flying the B-52 and life in SAC. I highly recommend it and give it five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over priced for what you get","review":"I bought this DVD expecting more content than there is. I thought the listed running time of 15 minutes was a typo, NOPE. Any search on YouTube will provide you with much longer clips on each character than is provided on this disc. Save your money and watch them on YouTube! Total waste of money!!!!! DVD was not mass produced, but a BURNED copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basics of Islam","review":"I think it is good for those who don't know Islam and Muslims as well. It is conducted in a question-answer method which I found boring but probably the author thought it is best in order to explain all this ambiguity around Islam.A very easy read. The explanations are simple and to the point from Muslim scholars from different ethnic backgrounds.A good start for understanding Islam."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for dress up","review":"My 4yr old son is a BIG Harry Potter fan.

Plus, it came with glasses and a wand. Now, my kids already have real wooden wands we crafted out of plum wood, and they use those the most, so I wasn't too concerned when the wands in this pack seemed a little sub-par. The glasses are good. The robe is a very cheap material, but that's fine. If the material was a little better, the wand a little more realistic, then this would be a 5-star product. As it stands, it's a 3-star product. I gave it 4-stars because of the value. I got a great deal, right here on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great costume","review":"When my 4yr. old said he wanted to be Harry for Halloween I knew the perfect costume and this is it.

True to the books title, most of the content is not much challenging for a 5th grader.

You have all the answers in the back (so if you get stuck teaching the lesson you can remember how to do it). Math is not my son's favorite subject, by using this book and taking our time on each page (sometimes doing one page for 2-3 days) he is really learning the key skills he needs to master. The book has pages on the front to put gold stars when your child masters a skill. This reinforces to them they are doing good and shows you what areas you still need to work on.

However, Barrons (the publisher) doesn't make a book/CD package available that incorporates the Beginning Japanese Part 2 book, much less anything beyond Beginning level such as Intermediate or Advanced. The package is taped shut so you can't examine it in the bookstore, and it doesn't give detailed list of the contents or any indication that this is just a Beginning Japanese Part 1 course.

Although the album contains many soulful and uplifting moments, the overall effect is undermined by insipid lyrics and musical cliches gleaned from the worst of 70's pop.

Mediocre acting (with the exception of Andrew Lee Potts who absolutely MAKES the movie), cheesy special effects with even cheesier dialogue, and too many characters and plot lines make it somewhat difficult to follow. So why did I give it 4 stars? Honestly, I really don't know. There is just something charming about it.You have to go into the movie with the understanding that it is a sy-fy movie and is going to be campy. Once you accept that, it is really quite fun. I enjoyed it more than \\"Tin Man\\", probably because it is not quite as dark and has the romantic-comedy story line weaved in it (also, being 2 episodes instead of 3 makes it easier to watch in one sitting).Like I said, it's campy and cheesy, but if you like adaptations of classics, I think it's worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"The syfy channel is at its best in this movie.

Thank god we even DVR'd it. It was fantastic. It had comedy, action, romance. Well done! I watched it so many times on DVR and even protected it so it wouldn't be deleted. I couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD. I bought it as soon as it was released. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a modern day twist on the Alice in Wonderland story.Buyer beware, it is not like the Disney story, so if you are expecting certain sequences you may be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAY Better than Burton's Alice","review":"This is one of the most amazing movies I've seen in my entire life!

There's very little CGI used and it's a much grittier version of Wonderland that parallels the gritty changes our world has made since the period when \\"Alice\\" was first published.I would highly recommend this to anyone I know.

The cast is excellent, and I was surprised to find myself truly caring for Alice and the other characters in the midst of this psychedelic carnival ride. There is a connection with Lewis Carroll's story, but only as a springboard into an original science-fiction story.This is not just a rehash of fantasy cliches. It's original at every level, from art design to the story. There are a few underused characters and storylines, and a clunky scene or two; the CGI is what you'd expect from a TV show, but the special effects are in the service of a good story. It might be too intense and weird for pre-teens.Very few shows in any genre have made fans out of everybody in my family, male and female, teenagers and parents. This one got six thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Series","review":"While I will admit that some of the acting is a little over the time, the series itself was really good.

So this book was incredibly enjoyable. Paul Johnson is a historian with a staggering intellect. If there is some important, or trivial, item during the 100 years between 1900 and 2000 that was left out of this book I don't know what it is. His prose is almost as good as his intellect.One of the (sad) distinctions of the 20th century,as the author notes, is the rise of the \\"gangster-statesmen\\" such as Hitler, Stalin, and a host of other lesser known evil men. Academia today often looks at communism with a somewhat sympathetic view or draws a moral balance between the Soviet Union and the United States (and the rest of the West.). Johnson doesn't, thank goodness. With his vast knowledge of facts, he also has keen moral insight.Johnson's history of the 20th century is one of the finest books of the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"manna from heaven for conservatives","review":"This is a book truly worth owning for serious and conservative students of history. I was first attracted to Johnson by reading some of his newspaper-style columns. As I learned more about him, it was clear his reputation as a conservative historian was deserved, and this book doesn't disappoint. It's particularly refreshing to hear a Brit, a denizen of an island nation that's been socialist since 1945, speak approvingly of the use of military force and of market economics.Regarding the book, Johnson produces serious depth, considering he covers most of the 20th century in less than 800 pages. He doesn't fall into the trap of many conservative historians, and present history solely as a product of the decisions made by so-called \\"great men.\\" Johnson delves into economics and sociology to make his points, and he manages to discuss often-neglected areas of the world, such as South America, Africa, and Africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comphrehensive and Thoroughly Entertaining","review":"The great philosopher Hegel once said (or so I've read) is that, \\"The only thing we have learned from history is that we don't learn anything from history.\\" That aside, I still feel it invaluable to read and re-read errs of the past, especially of the 20th century. This book is insightful and illuminating for those who, like me, are interested in the times in which their fathers and grandfathers and great-grandfathers lived. I am only 23, and found it both helpful but also sadly tragic, as man continues to struggle with himself and the same old problems in new and improved ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other Side of the Story","review":"Johnson creates an exciting alternative history of the 20th century. He presents the conservative view of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, the New Deal, the Great Society, the Vietnam War in a consistent and intellectually thrilling way. This book was tremendously influential in the '80's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"\\"Pseudodionysius\\" is right: this book poses as history but is no more than sourish, simple-minded propaganda.

A good part of the blame ofcourse falls on me for expecting a good coverage of the entire world's history by one author.Mr. Johnson is certainly not an expert at many of the topics he covers (and pronounces judgements on). In addition, there are no references provided for many of his interpretations.Given this, I think it is better for someone looking to learn world history to pick up a number of books and develop his/her understanding based on that."},{"rating":"1","title":"An anti-relativistic author who freely employs relativistism","review":"This book is meant for the easily duped and for those who wilfuly close their eyes to hypocrisy. Mr. Johnson does not attempt to analyze and understand history, he tries to turn into a battle between good and evil. He criticizes relativism, yet is extremely relativistic himself. An example: Mr. Johnson claims that the Soviets committed a wilful act of terrorism when they shot down a Korean airliner. Yet merely a page earlier attributes the American shooting down of an Iranian airliner as a mistake attributable to the extreme tensions of the Persian. The author fails to mention any of the \\"red-baiting\\" in 1950s America, yet freely condemns others for similar repressions. For Mr. Johnson, Anglo-America can do no wrong, even if it is similar to others that he condemns. When trying to condemn relativism, it doesnt help to be relativistic. Hypocrisy does not prove your point right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by the engaging literary style of this book","review":"This is not a work of history, it is a polemical tract pushing a conservative, Euro-American centered, exclusionist political agenda. The \\"facts\\" are often wrong, and the conclusions frequently absurd. The most blatant example of this is the representation of leaders of the post-WWII Third-World liberation movements as being little more than thugs. Anyone wishing to read a worthwhile history of the twentieth-century should consult Hobsbawm's recent AGE of EXTREMES."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right wing propaganda of an extreme form","review":"This book is flagrant, biased right wing drivel at its worst. Paul Johnson admires dictators like Pinochet and Franco and criticizes JFK for ending the Cuban Missile Crisis without a war. He loves some of the worst of American presidents like Coolidge and Nixon. I read this book before in my late teens when under heavy conservative influence. Now, reading it with an open mind, I realize what a crock it is. I have five books by this blatantly pro-Catholic reactionary in my library, and I am giving them all away (or, if no one wants them, using them as kindling for my next fire)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Readable, Informative, Brilliant","review":"A brilliant narrative connecting the seminal history-making dots of the 20th century.

The ending was a bit confusing. Who did David's girlfriend kill and who did the convict kill? Some of the way too many murders were too corny. It is naturally hard to make a good slasher flick anyway with a male as the main victim. The movie did not inform us that the police officer who stopped David's parents had ESP, since they never told him where they lived, yet he led them home. Aside from mastering murdering poetry, the male killer obviously did not master basic acting. Aside from all the negatives though, this movie was entertaining. One negative was also a positive-a male hero is unique for this genre. But it takes the correct ingredients of writing, directing, storyline and climactic struggle for life and death that lasts more than ten seconds. Not a must but, but it is worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well designed","review":"I bought this item and used it for only one month before it broke.

Even though All-Clad is much more expensive, you're better off going with their chicken fryer because they bolt the handle to the basin (whereas Innova just staples the handle on). In fact, most other brands bolt the handle on to their chicken fryers.

I really enjoy their music because they seem to incorporate other styles of music that I like, for example Alice Cooper. This album includes the majority of their hits, but of course live. The live audio is raw and captures a true product of a live performance. There are no touch ups such as overdubs or what nots. The CD sleeve makes notes that the album is very raw and you get what you hear. The live recording song selections varies from approximately 1989 to 1996. I think they sound as good as any live band that I have ever heard because you get the rawness of the performance. I think they pulled off \\"Gimme No Lip\\" very well. Dangerous Toys stayed true to the recorded versions of the songs for the most part. All-in-all I think it is a kickin album that any Dangerous Toys fan would appreciate.

It is ruled by an evil ice queen, and Narnia hasn't seen any signs of spring since she has begun to rule the mythical land. I don't want to give anything away, but this book is full of twists and turns and it will keep you hooked until the very last page.

The characters were one dimensional, you don't get to know them at all. It seems to be written by someone who thinks children are innocent little idiots who will be fascinated by anything with talking animals. There was also far more Christian allegory than I ever realized the first time I read it, not a bad thing necessarily, but it wasn't all that skillfully done. The main problem I had with it was that I cannot love a book without loving the characters, and these left me cold. It has none of the inventiveness of, for instance, the NIMH books, and made me wonder why CS Lewis ever tried writing for children when he is so ill-suited, though there are hundreds of reviewers who would disagree."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Book~ Taylor Layne ~ Ozark Arkansas","review":"I loved this book because it was full of action.

In the book an evil witch wants to take over Narnia. But the good lion refuses to surrender along with Peter, Susan, Edmond and Lucey.

To find out more about this book go buy it at the book store.The theme in this book is that Jesus is the king of all and He conquers anything.

Lewis strikes again he is such a amazing writer,in which he writes The Chronicles of Narnia Series, This Review is on \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.\\" It is such an exciting, emotional,and a very detalied magical story. It's described with such beautiful imagery, cool battles, and sacrifice, the story even though its an exciting book it is a really childish book. This book reminds me of how me and my sister used to pretend we can fly and go in different worlds and fight monsters. It really had alot of imagination, which actually had me sit down and think of how cool it would actually be if in real life we were able to. I got really into this book, i give it an A!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully entertaining!!","review":"Last year I read The Magician's Nephew, the first in the sequel, which I enjoyed immensely. Although I knew the storyline for The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, I had never read it before. I found C.S. Lewis' style of writing descriptive and creative which really held my interest throughout the story. Narnia and its whimsical characters were vividly illustrated in my mind through his colorful and expressive words. The \\"good vs. evil\\" theme is apparant throughout the story which increased my emotional involvement. I encourage others to read this book and travel to the magical world of Narnia with Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"whaaaack","review":"this is one of the worst rappers of all time from what little bit i heard i wanted to throw up i wish i could give negative stars because he would get it. but all you wannabe gangsters will probably buy this chumps album he suxxxxxxxx"},{"rating":"2","title":"Isn\`t necessary be swedish...","review":"I am spanish, my english is not so good and i never hear swedish before, but for casual reason, i have this cd and is really very good, you can feel fantastic sensations, specially if you are in love, it,s 5 stars sure... ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Isn\`t necessary be swedish...","review":"I am spanish, my english is not so good and i never hear swedish music before, but for casual reason, i have this cd and is really very good, you can feel fantastic sensations, specially if you are in love, i can not understand swedish but i use my imagination, it,s 5 stars sure... ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't judge a video by its cover","review":"I purchased this as a used video.

He's constantly being pestered by his family (of gods) to take up the Bright Sword and defeat the new evil god Jegu who threatens mankind and the gods. It's a funny and witty story that kept me reading through the end.In Tranquility, a huge birdlike thing is mutilating cattle. Only Tranquility is a bit odd with people with special powers including one who knows what's going to happen before it does, another who has good luck, and yet another who can talk to animals. The place is simple a bit off-kilter. But that's ok, it makes it fun.Buy this book! You'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference","review":"This was a catalog for an exhibit in NY.

Kerri Russell is beautiful, Michael Vartan has depth, but neither of these fine actors are given the opportunity to show their wares. The director tries some slick camera moves with disastrous results. He has a poor eye and lousy voice for story telling. There script was apparently touched up by someone other than the director. There are moments of real depth, but the majority of the film is less than lackluster, trite, simply mean-spirited with no redemptive flaws or vulnerabilities.

The only things you have to supply are plastic cement, white glue, and the engines, which you can purchase at most hobby shops or sometimes your local WalMart. The best part of this kit is the fact that the rockets are two different skill levels so you can determine exactly how involved you wish to get into the model rocketry hobby. The larger \\"Amazon\\" rocket is skill level E2X, which only requires glueing a few pieces together and slapping on the decals. The smaller Crossfire ISX is skill level 1, which requires a little bit work to put together and you have to paint it yourself. This set is perfect for both adults looking to get into the hobby and children/teens with the appropriate adult supervision."},{"rating":"2","title":"very fun","review":"this product is awsome! the only downer is that it takes a while to put the little rocket together. the only supplies u need are scissors and super glue. i would definately buy this product again.

I tested it in my back yard. It will not tune in the three strongest FM signals from the closest transmitters. They tune in clearly on the wimpy little radio card that plugs into my old Palm Zire PDA. (That PDA has been superseded by a more powerful one with no over-the-air receiver capabilities.) Instead, the Coby attempts to tune in weaker signals from more distant transmitters that are barely audible even at high volume.Unfortunately, it comes in plastic clamshell packaging that has to be cut open. Because it has been opened, it cannot be returned for a refund. Strictly speaking, it is not defective, so it cannot be returned on those grounds, either. Fortunately, it is so inexpensive that I do not feel too terrible about putting it in my stash of items for the next electronics recycling collection day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reception","review":"I generally wanted this for use while jogging.

After listening to the clips and buying \\"Put Some Style Into It\\", (performed by an entirely different group of musicians). I thought this album would be a real hoot. It delivers all that and more. The arrangements are cool and Eminem himself would probably be proud that his music is reaching a different segment.This is a real shocker when you consider most of the explicit language is retained to mostly hilarious lounge arrangements.There is a clever use of percussion throughout though unlike that used in rap. Vibes and guitars glissen, and theres' a touch of brass on a couple of selections. This is not really a tribute but a good natured spoof to Eminem! To all you rappers,heres the perfect way to introduce yourselves to salsa, lounge/jazz and soul. Sorry that this rendition will likely outlast the originator as time passes on."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extraordinary book","review":"This is an extraordinary book. It shows the reader how to approach the study of Sufism. It does so by highlighting the blocks to learning, blocks that abound in our own distorted thinking processes. But, like Shah's other's books, it does much more. It helps the reader gain access and insight into the part of her than is capable of learning. In so doing, the reader, prevented from using faulty mental wiring, is encouraged to bring the other, 'learnable' part into focus. The result is greater understanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp, Provocative, Challenging","review":"Over the past few years I have read and reread this book several times.

Consequently one may acquire an unmeasurably increased understanding of oneself, people, encounters and events, to a degree unparalleled by any other, known, methodology.

He portrays the average person's mind as a closed system which new information can't penetrate. Fortunately, Shah also casts light on ways people can break through their customary patterns of thinking. His suggestions, rooted in an ancient tradition based on observation and experience, may surprise you, as they did me. This is more than a book about \\"creativity.\\" It is about the prerequisites needed to become fully human."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Liberating Book","review":"The idea that higher learning is not something that automatically takes place in the presence of a teaching influence, but that how to learn may itself have to be learned before real learning can take place, may be new to many people. But on careful consideration it makes a lot of sense. For the fields of psychology, sociology and education provide us with ample evidence that such things as wrong assumptions, incorrect approaches and idées fixes can pose formidable barriers to knowledge. In this remarkable and fascinating book, Sufi author Idries Shah shows how these and other seemingly innocuous factors can be every bit as hindering as high walls and locked doors - indeed even more so, since they are far less obvious to those whom they impede. I found LEARNING HOW TO LEARN to be a breath of fresh air and - as with Shah's other books - strongly recommend it to anyone interested in the development of higher forms of understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good representation of Sufism","review":"I found this book very annoying. Shah essentially says, \\"If you have to read this, it's because you haven't been paying attention to everything else I've already said. Besides, you can't learn anything by reading.\\" I eventually agreed, at least that I wasn't going to learn anything by reading THIS.OK, there are a few nuggets of wisdom here, essentially trying to get the reader to step outside of your usual way of thinking. Not worth reading a whole book for, particularly when it is written in such a highly condescending tone. Shah wastes no opportunity to put the reader down and expound on his own greatness. This is nothing like the heart-opening Sufism I know and was seeking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Graphics","review":"Here is a wonderful intro for children to the fabulous potential of computer graphics.

Secondly anyone wanting to get rich won't be able to do it quick or easy especially if they are poorly educated and unskilled. A degree really does matter. Think about it.

Or perhaps you have loaned out the book and never had it returned.There are some updates that are worth reading. Overall this is the all time real estate classic for buying real estate with Nothing Down. I also recommend Real Estate Money Machine by Wade Cook for cash flowing real estate.

The pictures are numerous and informative; the text is instructive, and sometimes witty. This pictorial history 's strongest point is also its weakest: it is brief. This is good, in that it sparks the reader's interest to delve deeper into Cincinnati's past: how sudden was the '37 flood; just who WAS Boss Cox; what ever became of the defunct subway system? But these things are not explained in this brief history, and leaves the reader wanting more, yet not pointing him or her in a direction in which more can be found.As a beginner's guide in the histories of a city, I rate this book rather highly, because of its brevity.

Not to be listened to completely alone, this is the sort of music that needs a story or a picture. It is a soundtrack that creates an atmosphere; and, to get the full impact of such a CD, one must be doing something (reading, writing, or simply thinking) that requires such a ghostly and haunting atmosphere.

I'm not even sure the songs on this album are up to standard.

However, Midnite's subject matter is more adult--with Beck's quirky take on the intimacies. Also, he lets some of his influences come through with nods to the Stones and Prince (his falsetto is strong). He's the post-modern poster-boy shaped by alternative rock, electronic, and hip-hop genres. As always, his stuff is never really heavy, but his skill and creativity are very serious. In the end, Midnite has growing, crawling appeal with repeated listens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just your usual Beck disc...","review":"Like The artist formerly known as Prince--another musical genius--Beck may occasionally misfire (as he does a couple of times on Midnite Vultures) but he will never be dull or uninteresting.Overall, this disc isn't quite to the standard of say, Odelay, but it still merits a purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"I can understand why people get scared off, they're trying to take this album too seriously.

There's kind of a snide quality in this album that refers to the 70s sort of the way Mutations riffs off the 60s. But I can't really listen to this album too much. I keep listening to Mutations endlessly, hearing more, feeling more, being amazed at Beck's musical genius and sense of fun.Now I'm worried because Beck has stated he hates the music of the 80s, which I don't. I disliked the 70s a whole lot more for the lack of inventiveness which Beck managed almost on his own to bring back into the 90s. But perhaps everyone else will disagree. That's cool.

What an album. You wouldn't think a loser like Beck could party so hard, but he pulls it off quite well. Fans of Odelay may be dissappointed with this record, but any openminded listeners should get a lot out of it. Beck's offkilter rhymes are bizarre as ever, but this time, they're backed up by ridiculously tight funk grooves instead of guitar rock. My favorite song is Mixed Bizness, offering more sick rhymes, a sicker break (I want to know if I'm worth your time..) and further embellishments. It kind of sounds like Kraftwerk if they ever incorporated heavy funk into their electronic drones. This album basically departs from all else Beck has ever put his name on.

Odelay was great, Mutations was very good, and this one.... Let's just say that I have given it 6 listens and it just isn't working for me. Must be my fault."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beck Mutated, Once Again.","review":"Once again Beck has mutated. Changing his style of music from Punk Rock then to Alternative then to Ska. Honestly I think he should keep his style of writing music in one genere. The album alone is extra cool. The songs have a great touch of sense and personal feeling. The album has a great blend of style in it's songs. The style stays the same throught the album which is really important. A great song is \\"Sexx Laws\\" which combindes Ska and Alternative to make a great mixture. This album is one you will want to get your hands on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a few listens","review":"At first listen, I thought this was a goofball effort, but it was enough to hook me. After about 5 listens, this CD really sinks in, especially when listening with headphones. Beck didn't outdo Odelay, but he came close. Definitely one of my favorite CDs of '99. If you like 70s and 80s funk, then you should like Midnite Vultures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD","review":"This is one cool cd. I heard the songs \\"Sexx Laws\\" and \\"Mixed Business\\" on MTV and wanted the CD. I got the CD and those songs became my least favorite on the CD. The whole album features trippy synthesizers and just a whole bunch of other cool music that interests your ears. This CD isn't coming out of my CD player anytime soon. My final thought: Great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet","review":"this cd by beck is incredible. the content and emotion are explict and exceptional. this is better than his other cds it doesnt even compare to odelay wich i thought was the best cd beck had. boy was i wrong this one is more graphic and it has a even sweeter beat to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"new tagent","review":"-only beck could use a banjo for dance music.if you just loved dancing to Odelay at your frat parties, then be careful. we don't want anyone to get hurt while jumping back on the bandwagon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to BECK","review":"We haven't heard from Beck since his Mutations album, and now he's back with something completely different than his usual style: Midnite Vultures. But what is Beck's style? An artist too innovative and fearless too define his style, we can only look to what he puts out next. Midnite Vultures, in my opinion, is pretty retro; the beats remind me of the disco era. The songs have great rhythms, but are sung in a range that doesn't sound like Beck at all: its pretty high. I'm in love with his smooth hypnotic voice, and I missed it on this CD! One song even features a women's voice. Oh well. My favorite song is Hollywood Freaks, and Sexx Laws is pretty good. The lyrics are something else, though; they leave me to wonder what he really means. But overall, what we have here is a good cd that any true BECK fan would appreciate. It's like nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"More overrated garbage from the most overrated artist in music today. There is nothing innovative about Beck, he's actually quite average. The abstract lyrics that he is known for actually go a long way in proving he can't write anything meaningful. This whole attempt by him to come off as this \\"cool guy\\" really gets in the way of any good music he makes. So he throws a couple beats together in a studio...now all of a sudden he's a musical saviour? Give me a break....and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A very disappointing album compared to the early albums. Sounds too much like the usual Beck trademarked sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proboscis Up the Sleeve","review":"It is my professional opinion that Beck, with each new album, falls deeper and deeper into a whirling vortice of insanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"stop that comparing to prince","review":"this disc is lame and beck hasn't hit hard since odelay.and though prince has been wack for now 10 years he was never wack like beck.prince is a musical genius and has proven himself.what has beck proven?all the critics love his stuff.he has a better chance being a beastie boy than prince.cuz beck just ain't on that talent level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Haves","review":"By far, my all time favorite Beck album, Midnite Vultures brings in hip hop, soul, funk and every other genre this little genius can wrap his words around. The double punch of Sexx Laws and Nicotine & Gravy is just the beginning as we are melted in Beck's ever increasing tongue in cheek-ness and fun, deliberate or not. This is one of those must haves."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is more like Kraftwerk than Prince","review":"This album is about 8 million years old as I write this. Who cares. I think it's pretty good and sounds better than alot of the material that anyone might still bother to listen to from that time.I've read a bunch of the reviews for this album. It sounds like the critics haven't gotten out much.If you like white funk, Beefheart, Prince, Beck and Kraftwerk, then this is a good album. 'Mixed Business' is a highlight.If you can get it cheap, buy it. It's a good listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"one I'd need if stranded on a desert island","review":"I never get tired of listening to this CD, and I like all of the songs on it. His lyrics are so weird and interesting. The music is so original. Great anywhere... in the car, cleaning the house, during a party, working out, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beck. Bringer of musical goodness to the world.","review":"Boy, when I first heard about this one, I was really up in the air about it. How could he pull it off? After being tagged as the \\"Mr.Prolific-90's-Guy\\", after blowing up the grammies and music magazines by singing of death and rotting things, and being nothing but cool since 1994, how could Beck Hansen pull off a carefree party record that wreaks heavily of 60's/70's lounge and his own sexuality? The answer is Yes. And pretty freakin' well. This whole record easily takes \\"Willenium\\", \\"Ricky Martin\\", and \\"Genie in a Bottle\\" and scraps them, compacts them, adds spice and makes a greater party record than any other artist ever could, while maintaining something that has been alarmingly absent in recent recordings: Lasting Power. This just gets better every spin it gets, and hence gets my highest rating of 5 stars. An instant classic by an amazing artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beck IS!","review":"I also thought that Odelay was the end-all-be-all to alternative music in this day and age, and that everyone should own a copy of it. That's still true, but this is sooo much more.Groove on, my plastic garlicky brother."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fine Art of Blending an Era.","review":"Midnight Vultures is truely inspired. This clever aural concoction delivers a powerful surge of creativity that will surprise even the most jaded of listeners. Yes, timeless music is being made today. I spin this CD from start to finish and never stop rollin' with that funky vibe spawned by an artful blending of life's experience. Lyrically, Beck continues to hone his extraordinary imagination into a well oiled machine that becomes an amazingly well produced conundrum of sound. Great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beck cooked up a sexy stew, 70's style.","review":"The only way to describe this funky masterpeice is that it's like doing the wild thing with eric estrada watching and coaching you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beck has turned into Prince","review":"A very disappointing album from the man who brought us the best album of 1998, \\"Mutations\\". It seems that Beck has now decided to sing like and make music like Mr Symbol himself, Prince. Apart from the first track, the excellent banjo-driven \\"Sexx Laws\\" (which itself could be a title of a Prince track), Beck has completely lost his identity. I believe he is trying to be something he's not, and I am amazed that none of the reviews in any of the music magazines I have read picked up on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun!","review":"This album is a total blast! The lyrics are hilarious and the grooves are addictive. This is a good CD to listen to if you want to have fun or cheer yourself up. Funny and funky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beck is all that...and then some... with slaw...dot com....","review":"Y'know all Beck albums on first listen are a disappointment and this album was no exception. The feeling that Beck is a poseur of some sort,that he stretches too far, that he's... silly seems to be plastered on his albums. Usually half of the album borders on unlistenability. THEN something happens... the campy songs and singles grow on you- big time. The songs that were previously neglected are soon realized to be the best on the record. You gotta give it up for this guy... if you write him off then go back and listen to your old boring Tricky or 'new' Prince and think you're a smart one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing....","review":"This is entirely a musical orgasm. Once again Mr. Hanson has found the perfect blend of rhythm and precise, incredibly detailed sounds...all wrapped up in a seductive, funky, fun and funny cacoon. (...step into my Hundai..) Addictive at its very least...sensuous through and through. I love the Kraftwerk bits. The exotic rhythms at the end of Nicotine and Gravy ARE LOVEMAKING. Gotta gyrate! The whole album flows as one great and groovy masterpiece.....get your headphones out, lie back and cancel plans for the next few hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beck: Master Satirist","review":"Only Beck can release an album that is full of what sounds like Saturday Night Live sketches but is stll so slick that his fans think he genuinely wants to be Lenny Kravitz or Prince! Poking fun while also paying homage to the best of r&b, soul, and rap, lyrics like \\"i cold stepped to you with a pack of gum, you looked like you wanted some\\" made my roommate and i laugh out loud several times on the ride home for thanksgiving. This disc will definitely be a mainstay for awhile--very playful, very unique, very Beck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Way of Beck","review":"Still a favorite.Midnite vultures is great songs.Beck's sounds are unique and sometimes exotic.Wonderful listening to the odd poetry .It's vast,it's spacey and genuine sounds. have you hooked and that isn't a bad thing in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexx Change","review":"If you've heard of his earlier work 'One foot in the Grave,' 'Stereopathetic..,' + 'Mellow Gold,' ...then give up. He's obviously appealing to a different sort of folk. I gave two stars for the slim possibility that he did this as a way of getting back at DGC.....for they have had some legal disagreements over his contract. If that is what he's done then power to him...otherwise I'll try to maintain a deep respect for him- as his earlier work is amongst the best! At least he didn't put another glamor shot of himself looking F%4@-able on the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Talented Mr. Hansen","review":"While some of the other reviewers measure Beck's talents in relation to those of Prince (The Artist); he never quite reaches that level of ingenuity. However, his composing skills are well represented here, and his homage to Prince and others should be viewed as a tribute not a parody."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is horrible, just ignore the \\"positive\\" reviews!","review":"Midnite Vultures is a very bad album. My advice to you is, do not buy this album! The music sounds so forced and is not enjoyable. Beck's lyrics are really going down hill, it's as if he doesn't have anything to say. I was very let down by how unoriginal the music and lyrics were. Where beck has succeeded in the past, with albums like \\"one foot in the grave\\" and \\"mellow gold.\\" Midnite Vultures is almost a sort of devolution of sorts. There isn't one song on this eleven track disk that is even remotely interesting. It is now obvious, that beck is trying way to hard for people to like him, his forced cool attitude and everything in between, is a major musical turn off. DO NOT BUY THIS TERRIBLE ALBUM! If you still would like to buy a beck album, i would suggest \\"mellow gold\\", stereopathetic soul manure\\" or perhaps, the recent release of his first album \\"golden feelings.\\" Which you can buy at parasol.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it was just me . . .","review":"Thank GOD some others think the same way I do about this guy. I from day ONE have never understood what the pants-wetting deal is about Beck. Average to boring alternative radio music flaked with stupid lyrics does NOT a genius make, and I'm sick to death that critics and fans alike label him as such. It's a pretty good indication that music is in a state of excremetal stagnance when overrated unemotional pap like this is considered an artistic achievement. OOohh, he assembles songs from different genres of music. THAT hasn't been done before. Like the one reviewer said, it's almost like he tries too hard to top himself and everything else out there, and it just comes off as convoluted, pretentious and forced rather than fun and pleasing like Mr. Bungle and Ween.Can you people please put down your SPIN and Rolling Stone magazines for once? Maybe explore a bit?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Excuse For A Beck Album!","review":"So, you really want to know what \\"Midnite Vultures\\" is like? Well, I am going to tell you. This is a horrible piece of garbage. Beck is no \\"soul man\\"...his lyrics on this album are not at all \\"sexy\\", but rather insensitive and childish. I strongly urge even the most zany of beck fan, not to buy this album! Every single song on this album including the single \\"Sexx Laws\\", absolutely has no meaning whatsoever!However, if you really want to a buy a Beck album for whatever reason you might have. I suggest you give \\"Mellow Gold\\", or \\"StereoPathetic SoulManure\\" a try. For these albums are true works of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real turkey, but the main ingredient is ham","review":"If you want to listen to a Prince album, buy Sign 'O the Times.

I have been a Beck fan for several years now. If you're a Beck newbie, you should buy Odelay. But anyway, Midnite Vultures is a powerful set, but without all the variety shown on Odelay. This album is cranked up and party-style. The way the instrumentals are arranged is amazing, though, and if depressing music isn't for you, this is some premium stuff from America's favorite beat-crazed wordy rapping guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funkin Groovy","review":"Midnite Vultures not only rocks your body in motion, but seduces you with songs like \\"peaches & cream\\" and my personal favorite \\"Deborah\\". Beck.....is he really a man or the enchanted wizard of rhythm?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Label's Label","review":"For those of you noticing a change in Beck's style, it's this: his last album(\\"Mutations\\", people, look alive out there) was back with bong load records and only distributed by geffen, as per his contract. therefore his last album was a pure, unfettered outpouring of creativity. this album was back under standard label restrictions, and our fun loving beck decided to make, in his own words, \\"a dumb party album\\". he satires the entire genre and spills over into a few others as well. when you stop trying to compare this album with his others(none of the other albums compare very well to each other either), you'll realize that while this may not be odelay or mutations, it is a very good album in it's own right. you can groove away to the music, or you can stop and listen for a moment and start to peice together exactly what he's done that makes this album as brilliant as the others(i'll leave that part up to your own personal perceptions, tho)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beck Does It Again","review":"With perhaps some of the most progressive musical talent in the industry, Beck again shocks his fans with a complete change of style and format. Every album seems to be a refreshing departure from the previous recording, keeping everyone guessing. Buy this album and those prior if you want to ride along while Beck rediscovers his roots."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll massage your soul...","review":"Beck is the ONLY person who's albums i buy the VERY day they come out. i even went a week early to buy this because i heard a rumor it was coming out then. when i finally did get my copy of Midnite Vultures i was not surprised at all. Beck constantly puts out great albums. Everyone said Mutation was a derivation from his prior stuff, but it wasn't. Run-of-the-mill Beck fans had just gotten use to the poppy stuff radio stations had picked from the montage of songs on his albums ie: only playing Tropicali from Mutations. People say \\"ooh Beck's back!\\" umm... as far as i know he didn't go anywhere. Heaven forbid an artist be versitile and always evolving...every album he's released has had a different sound. That's why he the musical genius he is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really hate this album","review":"I think Beck's \\"Mutations\\" and \\"Odelay\\" are brilliant albums. \\"Midnite Vultures\\" is too much of a departure for me, so much so, that I can't even listen to this album. It's really bad. I'm no fan of motown, so I suppose that's why I don't connect with this music. Listening to Beck sing in funky falsetto voice is really painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I like Beck...a lot.

It all sounds the same, there isn\`t any creativity to it. Hopefully this is just a phase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kickin","review":"Great album. I like the differing tones of each of the songs, but, at the same time, this album is much more listenable than Odelay ever was. Another words, Odelay was 10 or so good songs, Vultures is a good cohesive album. The prince connection, i.e. Beck sounds a little like prince on some songs, means nothing to me. I detested prince, but hearing Beck sound slightly like prince doesn't bother me at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but a bit short","review":"Except for track #5 (which is good in its own right, it just doesnt fit the rest of the CD), this is a superbly produced album, easily matching Mellow Gold in excellence. \\"Sexx Laws\\", \\"Peaches & Cream\\", \\"Get Real Paid\\", and \\"Out Of Control\\" are probably the most notable tracks.The big problem with this CD is that it feels way too short (even though it is over 50 minutes)... the songs are great but you just wish they wouldn't stop.Overall, this CD is well worth the buy. It is not perfect, but well worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype","review":"I bought this album based on the fact that Beck's last two albums were great. Midnite Vultures has a few good songs, but much of it is pretty cheesy. It's a fun cd to listen to, just don't expect a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This is the best Prince album since Sign of the Times! Yes, you heard me right.

It was offensive to women and to the south. All the compromise was on Raney's part. Charles may have been a sweet man in many ways, but he was entirely inflexible and rude to Raney's family.to me raney, but for her racism, was an endearing character. I don't see why she needed to be reformed in every sense of the word.why should she have to have her baby baptised when her religion clearly did not believe in it and charles was hardly even religious. ridiculous?"},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK","review":"I despise this book.

I know many Raneys...who have always baffled me. This helped me understand the world through their eyes. Read this book if you'd like a little insight into your cousins from the small-town south."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming Voice","review":"I picked this up after watching the film version of Walking Across Egypt (which I loved!). This story does not quite live up to Walking Across Egypt - I found it charming just the same. The writing is so subtle - the images just sneak up on you. Yes, one just goes on with their life as another reader said - but feeling just a little bit better - a little more hopeful. That's why readers like Clyde Edgerton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read it for the Dialect Capturing","review":"While every characer in this book (including Raney and Charles) rubbed me the wrong way, Edgerton's beautiful use of local color and regional dialect in the end was his saving grace--because of that I remain a loyal fan to his work.I felt the book was disorganized and inconclusive in terms of character development and plot structure. The characters do not evolve throughout the story, although the issues that plague them are significant and deserve more attention than they are given.I hated the feeling that I was being left out to dangle in the end. I was unable to determine whether to feel happy for the couple, or angry at the fact they were still together without resolving any of their problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible for Ms. Macomber","review":"The characters in this book were largely two-dimensional and quite aggravating. The plot itself is a well-used but solid one - lonely single woman seeks new life with mail-order husband who is caregiver to darling orphans. However, this rendition of it is not satisfying. Travis is annoyingly stubborn, and Mary is nearly as bad. And, the fact that neither of them even think about birth control in this day and age (and their age!) is far-fetched as well. The obstacles in their relationship could have been overcome with one good conversation, with either party acting rationally.I like other Macomber works (Dakota Born for example) but this book is not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"good quiet reading","review":"It was just the book I needed during a crisis in my life to help keep my mind in check, a simple story that I truly enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really A Good Book","review":"A little bit of romance, mystery, sadness, reality all rapped up in a feel good story.Yes it's not a unique story it's been repeated numerous times... he needs a caregiver for his orphined neice and nephews she needs love...but it was unique in that it is modern day Mail Order Bride story with a slight mystery.Travis was moody and Mary was to nice in my opinion. The children: Jim (12) had way to much attitude he needed more attention or a good counseling session wouldn't have been a bad idea, Beth Ann was way too in tune for her age and at times you wanted to put a sock in her mouth but she was adorable and Scottie was just too grown up for 8. It was an abstract family that somehow worked because of all the issues they each had.I enjoyed Tilly and Logan's character's. He was sooooo in love with her and she was such a lost soul you wanted to get them together soooo bad.The ending was a good one but still not exactly the way I wanted it to end but all in all it worked.

This pathetic remix amounts to nothing less than musical necrophelia; taking the work of a great but dead artist and over-dubbing / remixing that work with flavor of the month \\"artists\\". This same kind of defilement occured when elevator musician Kenny G overdubbed on the great Louis Armstrong's music. Marley's great music/message should not be defiled by marginally talented artists; most of whom represent the exact opposite of what Bob Marley stood and fought for. But Hey, Bob Marley is no longer with us to make the musical decisions, so let's just go ahead and remix his music as we please and make some quick bucks. Skip this cd and buy the original recordings because they are light years better. I recomend Survival as the greatest Bob Marley cd and after that Kaya.

The artists who worked together to create this did an excellent job of breathing new life and creativity onto the Bob Marley tracks. The arrangements/remixes are unique and refreshing and show that the artists have a true appreciation for Bob's music and were musically inspired by him to create something new. As a musician myself, I too have found the same incredible creative inspiration from Bob's music, so I relate to this album whole-heartedly. I love that they used the original tracks of his voice and mixed in the new ideas. I also love that each track starts with a spoken word snippet by or about Bob that puts the context of his life and mission into the music. Heart-warming...Absolutely beautiful...One love!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what Bob would have done","review":"Bob Marley was never one to do covers or collaborate with many guests. Busta Rhymes and the FlipMode Squad go against the ideals that Bob respected. I'm a fan of hip hop, im a fan of bob marley, but i dislike the both of them together.

This is not really a reggae album, but it is unique to see how each modern artist puts their spin on each song and turns it into their own without taking it too far off from what Bob had intended. It would have been nice of the original Wailers in the band would have had a bigger part, but overall this cd has some pretty good work by some modern artists. Get this cd if you want a twist to the workings of a great man."},{"rating":"2","title":"A seemingly just tribute to a wonderful man.","review":"Bob Marley's music is pure bliss in any form. This album, though inferior to Marley's original works, does a wonderful job of bringing the enchanting lyrics, beats, and messages to a new audience of Hip-hop and R&B fans. The blend of artists bring new life to Bob's already amazing songs and show a fresh \\"face\\" to the music, a \\"face\\" many would not expect to see Bob wearing. Erykah Badu and Lauryn Hill's vocals highlight Marley's wonderfully, and the version of Kinky Reggae, performed with Marely's sons was incredible. I do wish however that more respect had been given to maintaining Bob's original message of unity, pride and peace. The truth of Bob's lyrics seemed to be somewhat lost in heavy beats and jibberish rap.

However, the re-make artists' vision and the Bob vision clash horribly. Bob had a completely different approach to fighting for rights and equality than these re-make artists do, and I find it very disrespectful to Bob and his life to twist his songs in this manner. As I said, there is some good musical stuff here, but I find it unpleasant to listen to because it's not right to do something like that to Bob's vision.

THere is good information in here about Thoth, the Oak and Holly Kings, the Green Man, the Horned God, and so forth, but given the books size, it was all very quickly imparted, and as such left me with the feeling that I'd delved only a little, not reaching any real depth.Still, that said, there is a great beginning in this book. Were the Mooreys to put out another, in depth title with a similar topic, I would not hesitate to go buy it.

Damnation And A Day (one of my favourites) had the melodies Cradle Of Filth are famous for but there was this real metal riffing theme emulsified with it. This was further explored in the album Nymphetamine and perfected in Thornography.Over all... great record. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I hate the final track Temptation. I think on the whole it is just a horrible song, the original and the COF version. Dani Filth is way too intelligent to be screaming the same word \\"Temptation\\" over again and it sounds like they got Britney Spears to do the female parts.On the whole... a must have, love the album.

Cradle Of Filth is simply great. Sure their style may fluxuate somewhat but they will always rock. All twelve tracks on thornography are superb.

These are all classic stuff and the quality of all is Excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO Stars","review":"The package arrived in poor shape and the contents were crushed and unplayable.

Think wild woolly western travelling lawman with plenty of snow (the cold and wet kind) and no female companionship whatsoever. Richard Simmons stars as the requisite handsome mustachioed Mountie, derivative of the 1930-1950 Challenge of the Yukon Radio series. Small parts were actually filmed outdoors. There are dogsleds, steamships, telegraphs, Eskimoes, Indians, plus French and English speaking Canadians. Not quite the usual Classic Western, but produced by the same people who did The Lone Ranger. Fun series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Tank is cooler than the terrain","review":"This playset includes small sort of snap together peices of terrain with flimsy soft plastic attachments.

One of my CD's actually still had a \\"Tower Records\\" price tag on it.Overall, the CD's contain average to below average trance, IMO.

The previous reviewers have stated it so beautifully that there is not much to add, except to re-iterate that EVERYONE should see this film.

Pink does NOT sing on it. The people singing on it are unknown bands who want to be heard.

For some labels, it's a quick cash-in.\\"I have listened to samples, and they aren't very good. So please do not buy this just because it's labeled PINK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lighted Mirror","review":"magnification side of this mirror is distorted and hard to view. If you can stay centered in the reflection you can make out the image reflected but any movement from side to side distorts the relection. Light is good, extention arm is good and connect is good. Non-maginfied side is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality poor","review":"I was optimistic on this product, naively thinking the upgrade would provide better quality. Not even close. The maginifying mirror is useless. One can't even see the distortion is so bad. After frustrating periods of trying to get it in focus without significant aberration of the image, you forgot why you are there.I would not recommend this 10X mirror. Perhaps the 8X is better, but this is way too useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shattered Mirror","review":"I was so very disappointed to received the dream mirror I had looked for everywhere. I paid extra for shipping due to the fact it was for my birthday. When I opened the package, I pulled the mirror out and pieces of glass landed on my lap. At the first glance the main mirror appeared to be in perfect condition. When I examined the back mirror it was completely missing off of the mirror frame. I examined the box and found broken glass and a round shattered mirror that was covered with a protective seal. I was so disapointed. I think it is best that I not order mirrors on the internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"i NEED this album","review":"well, peoples reviews are sooooooooooo long i get bored. mine isnt. all i need to say is this album is great! just by hearing the samples i am hooked! the songs are catchy and so are the tunes. my advice is...... GET THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish it was worth more than two stars","review":"I really hope this band gets better in the future...they have talent, they just don't use it. You'll find yourself saying \\"Wow, this is just like the last song\\" Repeating the first verse and chorus two times can get pretty old....fast. Two good songs: \\"Moper\\" and \\"Miz\\". Stick to bands like Homegrown and The Ataris."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop-punk Screeching Weasel style","review":"It's impossible not to LOVE this fun, super-catchy, instant sing-a-long style punk-filled CD.

Their perfect three-part harmonies in the Backstreet Boys cover will give you goose bumps."},{"rating":"2","title":"super rock stars, and nice guys too","review":"Allister's CD starts out strong and keeps it going for the whole album. Standout songs include \\"jimmy's dream girl\\", \\"moper\\", \\"jacob\\" and of course \\"fraggle rock\\" and \\"i want it that way\\". i think the middle of the album is a little weak, with many of the songs sounding similar. you might often find yourself asking \\"didn't i just hear that song?\\" but overall, i think the strong songs make up for some of the middle \\"filler\\" songs. also, allister is from the chicago area, so i have to love them, and they're really great live too, which is all too often not the case with punk/emo-ish bands. so go buy the cd, have fun, break stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This band is really down to Earth and they are really talented.

At first listen, I noticed that the songs were kinda short, and that two of the original members hadn't been on \\"last stop suburbia\\". At times, it seemed almost like a different band. All the members sing, and each has atleast one song where their vocals dominate. I guess that can be considered a good thing, except for the fact that if you're not familar with the band, you sometimes forget you're listening to a full-length rather than a compilation. all in all though, this is a good, melodic piece of pop-punk work, with an early blink 182 ( dude ranch) feel. I'd also recommend getting last stop suburbia, cuz its just as good..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"Cheaply made, as the price would suggest. The legs don't move freely when you release the leg locks; they bind and have to be pulled out. The most annoying thing is the absence of a quick-release plate.

Unfortunately this rocket is so flimsy that on of the tail segments broke off as soon as the plastic was removed. I repaired the styrofoam tail and we went off to launch. Before we could get it off the ground the other tail section broke off at the same place the first one did. I think there must be a stress areas in that portion of the tail to have both break at the same spot, but again I repaired the tail and launched. It was a very lack luster flight. When we got home it was shelved for future garage sales. At least the launch pad was acceptable. I'll buy other rockets and use the pad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wagon Train","review":"I wish that ALL of the episodes with Ward Bond had been included with this DVD collection.

Video and audio quality are great, but it's the shows that are worth their weight in gold. Where on TV today could you find something like this: Barbara Stanwyck turning a young woman toward a church to \\"find\\" her Father there, after being disappointed in her earthly parent? I'm not a Bible-beater, but I hate most of the crap on TV nowadays. I loved this show as a kid, and now, as soon as the theme song comes on, I'm catapulted back to that much more simple time, with no swearing or nudity or lewd behavior - just good old fashioned morals and a happy ending. That's what entertainment is - to me, anyway. I HIGHLY recommend this set!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wagons, Ho","review":"What I really wanted was the Wagon Train episodes from start to finish.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The serious guide to spring, lever, and muscle projectile weapons","review":"This is not a simple 'how-to', this is graduate level discussion of all manner of implements for launching projectiles without combustion.

The books focus is devoid of the theory of beans and is really a how-to book. Trouble is, the directions are so hard to follow that confusion becomes normal.

I didn't want her to develop my fear so we've been reading this book and I also try to point out spiders we see. She really loves this book and it was one of the few we packed on a recent plane trip. Lots of stuff to point out for her in the pictures and she also likes talking about the spider being 'happy' or 'sad'.

Unlike the mellowed out album \\"Woodstock 2,\\" this 3rd general Woodstock album brings back some of the fire of the first album. \\"Love City\\" is intense soul, with Sly at his rockin' best. \\"Somebody To Love\\" is unrecognizable until it hits the chorus, but it totally cooks, with Grace Slick's soaring voice sliding in and out of the rock guitars. \\"Southbound Train\\" has a very powerful rock sound, with terrific guitar sustain on the lead solo. Other tracks didn't impress me nearly as much--a lot of cover tunes, ballads, and sleeze. \\"Blackbird\\" is sweet with all its vocal harmonies. \\"If I Were A Carpenter\\" has Tim Hardin's voice breaking constantly, maybe intended, maybe not, but very distracting nevertheless.

Yes, this sequel is simply horrendous, lacking any of the psychological and visceral scares of the original, and certainly missing any of the intriguing storytelling. Tony Todd is still an imposing figure as Candyman, but Derrico is awful, and why didn't she realize the only thing that could have made her performance bearable was showing some nudity?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It shouldn't of been made","review":"WHat started off as a cool horror film has dwindled down to a cheap slasher film. THe candyman is back hunting another decendent but in essence he is more like an ghostly stalker. He still wants to take her back to the grave with him and in teh process rip up a few bodies while he is at it. THis sad piece of work leaves little to the imagination and instead leaves you weeping at how pathetic it is.

It basically has the same plot of the other two installments, but still has lame murder sequences and poor scripting that doesn't make it anything special. Its rather ironic that every sequel always ignores the end of the previous Candyman movie. How many times do they have to kill him? When will he just die and this cycle of depressingly average sequels finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst horror movie I've ever seen!","review":"If you think that for example Friday the 13th is low budget, then rethink!

The acting was pretty bad - even the Candyman himself was not that intimidating or scary. Of course, the Baywatch beauties are an eye-feast but when it comes to intriguing characters no way - I could have cared less about what was happening to them.

Candyman (1992) is a very scary film, Clive barker's story was frightening and interesting, this second hand follow up turns the hook handed phantom into a sixth or seventh rate Freddy knock off, I found myself praying to get a glimpse of the BEAUTIFUL female lead in this movie naked, for that would of helped the proceedings along a little bit.

This Dvorak \\"New World\\" from Muti and the Philharmonia Orch. is a case in point. It doesn't rank with the very best for good reason: Muti seems indifferent to making the work sound anything better than a familiar warhorse.But then you stand back and look at the price, and his conventional reading is very competitive. It's civilized, nicely recorded, and performed by a world-class orchestra.

It was long on explaining Mr.Hart's personal opinions and short on explaining Thomas Jefferson's philosophy behind his idea of \\"ward republics\\".

Guns n Roses was the ultimate live experience and so to truly appreciate them, one must hear them in their natural environment on the stage. This is something this 2-disc collection captures very well. Hold out for hope on Chinese Democracy, but true fans should pick this one up in the meantime. Come on, Axl, show us one last time you still have what it takes to make the world stop, put down what they are doing, and listen to what you have to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and very disappointing","review":"I love Guns and Roses and i am still an objective music fan. This is by far, the worst live recording i have ever heard. Uninspired and a terrible mix. Take the soundtrack to the Use Your Illusion DVD's as being better than this. Obviously this was overdubbed to death without Slash, Izzy or Duff."},{"rating":"1","title":"not nearly as F**KIN ROCKIN as the originals","review":"ahhhh... YES, cool cover, but a disappointment. this just ain't as ELECTRIC as the versions on 'Appetite' or 'Illusions'. Axel's 'cleaned-up'vocals and harmonies (read: re-recorded)really let the air out, for starters.and, yeah: i saw these guys on the upswing at the Whiskey 87, Pasadena's Perkins Palace 4-nite stand 12/87, etc. and they really WERE amazing... sadly, this set just doesn't capture it at all. (then again, maybe it was the whiskey and the spirit of the time...)if you buy this, G'n'R fans, you'll be entertained for a couple listens; but, you'll end up spinning the originals by new year's..."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the Power of Guns n' Roses","review":"This album is great, and does not just work as a greatest hits collection as some might claim. When I bought it, I didn't expect anything new or different from their albums, but was just desperate for new Guns n' Roses stuff. I turned out being really surprised at how great this stuff is. Every song is different or better than its original version except for Sweet Child o' Mine and Paradise City which were the lone downpoints. Your Crazy is at least ten times better than on Appetite, and Welcome to the Jungle is simply unbelievable. No song isn't worth listening to, and this album is just as great for diehard GNR fans as someone looking for a Greatest Hits Collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guns 'n Roses prove they're american heroes with new album","review":"Guns 'N Roses Live Era 87-93 is probably the best sounding live album I've heard since Iron Maiden's live album (can't recall the title but it was recorded on a 48 track or some other ridiculously good equipment). This sounds really amazing to have been recorded live. All the songs on the albums are really good (well except it's so easy - I hate that song). The only real mistake was not putting The Civil War and putting on November Rain. That song is good but not really a good representation of Guns 'N Roses. Overrall a pretty good album but it would be nice if it were a little cheaper and had a few more songs (even though it is like 2 hours long) plus it would've been nice if the booklet A)was longer - a lot longer and B)talked about the music or Guns 'N Roses or performing live. It doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"GUNS AND ROSES - LIVE ERA 87-93 REVIEW","review":"This CD is like a Guns and Roses Greatest Hits album but its 2 cds and its live so that you can experience all of the rock and roll emotion from their concerts. The first song \\"Livin on a Nightrain\\" starts off the album with a right feel to it. Also on disc one is the awesome song \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\" and the incredible ballad \\"November Rain\\" which is 13 minutes long. On disc two is their first hit \\"Sweet Child O Mine\\" and the remake of Bob Dylan's classic \\"Knockin On Heavens Door\\" in which Axel asks for major crowd participation and he recieves it. Also the very last song is \\"Paradise City\\" in which the fans are showing their appreciation by yelling their name. Its a good song to end an good album. If you like Guns and Roses you will like this album. If you have every other Guns and Roses album dont bother with this one because the only diffrence is that its live."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Decent Attempt","review":"I saw Guns n' Roses live before they became headliners and didn't enjoy the show but have enjoyed their music over the years since.I was surprised at a few songs that were not included here that were (from what I hear) staples of their live shows.Songs like....\\"Live and Let Die\\",\\"Civil War\\" and \\"Hair of the Dog\\".....songs that would have made this cd a whole lot better and much more enjoyable.Most people have said that songs like \\"November Rain\\" and a few other songs shouldn't have been included on the cd but in my opinion (although I personally don't enjoy their ballad style songs)they are there to represent the entire career of the band.I rate this cd at 2 stars not because of poor musicianship or sound quality or anything that is on the cd,I rate it that way because there is so much this cd could have been but never made it to its full potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Key to GNR's live performances is missing","review":"I bought this CD expecting to hear some of the versions of the songs I remembered in concert. Unfortunately, the free styled guitar solos, extra verses and improv antics are missing. Sweet Child O' Mine does not include the extra verses on this double disc, and the version of Knockin' on Heaven's Door was not taken from the Club Ritz. The people who put the album together got it right on some of the tracks--like including the extra long intro to November Rain, however I feel it a necessity to include all of what made GNR an excellent live band if they are to truly capture the \\"Live Era\\" that was Guns N' Roses. This is a good CD to add to the GNR collection, but its no loss if you do not go out and purchase it. I suggest holding out for \\"Chinese Democracy\\" in the new year, or if you are craving some live music now, pick up Metallica's S&M, that truly is what live music should be about: noise, dynamics, musicianship, and emotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"gun this rose","review":"I generaly don't care for live albums but I really like this one. It's full of good energy from the audience and good music. The songs don't follow a timeline from their early days to their later ones so one song will be from their earlier days and it will have a raw sound to it then the next song will be from a later concert and it will have back up singers, horns and the piano. I like that aspect of this album but it might bother some listeners. Whether you're a casual fan like me or a die hard fan you should get this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"You wanted the best, well they didn't make it.","review":"Thus begins a great live disc, which really could be considered a greatest hits package, since all the classics are there. Whether or not you like live recordings might influence your opinion on the album, but Axl Rose's yellings to the crowd make this CD worth owning. Let's start to recognize GNR for what they were, the best damn Rock and Roll band from 1987-1993."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can answer your Question","review":"The CD is messed up, so I have heard.

Please AXL we need somthing NEW ."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one is a dog","review":"This is far and away the WORST album I have ever heard, and I enjoy alot of songs by Guns N' Roses. The problems with the album are many, but I have outlined the most egregious offenses herein.First, the crowd noise overpowers many of the songs, which should have been cleaned up before releasing these live performances. Second, the music overpowers many of the vocals. Third, the melodic tone of a number of the songs is just lost, either because Axle is trying to scream rather than sing, or GN'R is just plain lousy in concert.If you wish to add a CD to your collection of \\"those CDs rarely listened to,\\" then by all means buy this one. Otherwise, stay away ... very far away from this dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"its gnr but","review":"its got alot great gnr songs live but heres my problem the sound quality sucks this has to be one of the worst sounding live cds ever made u get around that u get a glimpse at what guns n roses once were the rolling stones of this generation not just an 80s band they continued on and had thier biggest hits in the 90s like november rain they grew as a band into legends and until they finally release the new cd this will wet your taste buds a time that seems like yesterday but is almost 20 years ago"},{"rating":"2","title":"VIEW FROM OZ!","review":"I noticed a couple of comlpaints regaring this Gunners album, namely because sweet child was missing. well here is my view, buy the australian version. it includes an elctryfying version of sweet child, plus a version of patience which leaves a bit to be desired(the crowd singing ruins what otherwise sounds like a good version) i agree with the view heavens door sounds a bit dull. and i am no expert on guitar, but heavens door is not really a complex piece of music, so in defence of slash, there is not much you can do with a song which has very little depth. i am a die hard fan, so this view is probably a bit biased END RANT"},{"rating":"2","title":"GNR=Excellent Live CD","review":"It is about time that this live double CD came out. With all the boy bands & teeny-boppers ruling the airwaves, GNR came at the right time. This album has all the hits plus some surprise tunes on it (i.e. \\"Dust 'n Bones\\", \\"Move to the City\\"). I wish they could've added the Stone's cover \\"Wild Horses\\", but oh well. Anyway, this is a great live cd.....much better than Aerosmith's by the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta have it!","review":"If you liked Appetite and needed more. Here is the ultimate Gn'R collection. Two albums with the best hits of Gn'R, mostly concentrated on AFD and Gn'R Lies. The guitars are raw and hard, Axl's voice sounds all right. The album makes you wish you were at the concerts. Knocking on Heaven's Door is turned into the ultimate live song by the band. Other hits such as Welcome To The Jungle, You could Be Mine, Sweet Child O' Mine, Don't Cry, sound great live. Thanks God for bringing Gn'R back live in 2002.I highly suggest it if you are a rock fan. highlight: Knocking On Heaven's Door interlude, lowlight: Move to the City interlude"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BUT DOESNT SHOW OFF WHAT GNR CAN DO LIVE","review":"5 stars for the music 2 stars for the selection of preformances. Where are the intros and solos huh?It sorta annoys me with this cd, i mean sure, it's great, it's got most of the best songs but where are the intros and solos that make a gnr show so great in the first place? Also it's missing the best guns song civil war. So if you are a bootleg trader email me and we can work out a trade. I have to offer soundboard shows that show off what guns can really do live..."},{"rating":"2","title":"EVERY song you need!","review":"This CD is incredible. I'll start by saying that Guns is one of those bands who just sound better live. Like some of my favorite bands (Metallica,AC/DC) GNR is incredible live. Today you rarely get a band who is better live because the sound is so polished. With Axl's blistering lyrics and Slash and Izzy's double guitar attack you get a great CD. This CD has all of their hits and also has songs that didn't get much airplay. If you want a CD with all the hits and great songs by this CD. Because lets face it, Guns N Roses were the best band to come off of LA's Sunset Strip in the 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"GUNS N'ROSES MUSIC THAT NEVER GETS OLD","review":"\\"The Live Era 1987-93\\" is exactly what it says, in this time period bands sounded better live, then they did on there albums. This concept today is unheard of, in my opinion. With all the mixing equiptment used it is a very rare thing to listen to a live band and be impressed. As I crusied down the streets of downtown Ottawa along with 7 of my close hockey buddies in our limo, Guns N' F_@#'n Roses Pounding, screaming along to the song \\"Nightrain\\". I couldn'd help but be amazed with this album,\\"Axel Slash,Steve, Izzy, (Dizzy)\\" sound amazing, if not better then they do on there albums. It is like your teleported back in time and become one of the screaming fans at the best GNR concert ever preformed. If you appericate rock'n tunes mixed with some of the most talented musicians of that decade , you will fall in love with this album at first listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY BELOW EXPECTATIONS","review":"This cd is by no means worth the money. The perfomance for knockin on heaven's door featuring backing vocals is depressing. Some of the songs were taken from the Illusion Home Video (live in Tokyo), which is old news. If you're looking for old raw GNR, you better try a bootleg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"In addition to other comments: the versions of the songs presented here are far from the best ones available. Sometimes the band sounds like they desperately need to sober up/get their act together, or as if they're just bored.Mastering is bad: when you get crackling during solos no need to reach to check your speakers - it's on the recording.Contrary to what I was expecting this album sounds completely uninspiring, and it has Civil War missing. Look elsewhere for GNR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor instructions","review":"I love Denise Austin but this workout is not so great. I think if I were a dancer I would have gotten the hang of it and enjoyed it. But since I'm not, I found the instructions to be very poor. The moves are not explained and it was hard for me to follow along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor instructions, weak workout","review":"Perhaps this workout would be OK if you have ESP -- Austin only gives you a cue that you're changing steps about a second or two beforehand. I didn't feel like she gives the viewer enough time to do the routines either. You just rush from one thing to another. Also she doesn't pay attention to symmetry, so at times you're only doing a particular exercise on one side.Finally, this may sound petty but I found her breathy delivery incredibly annoying. It grated on me terribly and by the end of the workout I was in a fairly bad mood that could only be lifted by a nice post-exercise glass of wine (don't worry -- it was in the evening)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I have tried this video 3 times now. Normally I like something that i can pop in, it will give me a decent cardio workout and at the end I feel as if I've accomplished something. If you feel the same, then this is not the video for you. There is no intructional portion to familiarize yourself with the moves before hand, you have to figure it out as you go. By the time I watch to see what foot they're starting on, the full body movement, and get the hang of that move, she's onto the next step, where again, I have to figure out what she's doing. I spend more time watching the video than actually moving. Definately not something you can just jump into and have fun. If all her videos are put together this way, I will definately not be buying another one ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not thrilled with video","review":"I was disappointed in this dvd. I like Denise Austin but I really didn't care for this one. The pilates was ok but the dancing was not my thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good for diving back in","review":"I've done a couple of other videos before and after having to sit out a while due to various things, I picked this up because it looked like something I could do, have fun with, and get some exercise. Not so much. As some of the other reviewers stated, the steps are called out right before she switches to them and they are not demonstrated. If you have a background in dance (like maybe you were drill team or a cheerleader) then you will probably breeze through this, catching on quickly and really enjoy it. For the coordination challenged, look elsewhere. I may try the Biggest Loser video I've got, or I may go back to Kathy Ireland - I can actually follow those. And I KNOW you want something that's challenging - if it's too easy it's not a real workout, right? But I need something I can actually DO, rather than marching in place trying to figure out what the heck is going on.....(Next day: not good for bad knees either!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Effective Workout","review":"This is one of the most fun workouts I've done in a long time. I love the dance portion (she moves quickly with little explanation so you just kind of have to jump right in). Luckily there is enough repetition of the moves that even a novice dancer can catch on. When I started getting down the moves I was having a blast and actually caught myself smiling a few times! How often can you say that about a workout? The pilates portion of this tape is excellent, too. Really great moves that I could feel firming and toning my body from the first few seconds. This is a fun and effective workout that I would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video!","review":"This is a great video as it has three different segments. The dance moves are easy to learn, plus you do get the standing and floor pilates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Band","review":"I really liked the look of the watch, but after wearing it for several months the band broke and there are no replacements available other than sending it back to Nike and you know how that goes.

I have used this speed and I have worked in a photo lab and developed it. You should not use 800sp. film on bright sunny days!! It over-exposes your negatives and makes your pictures washed out. I would only used 800sp. film if I was photographing something that was very fast motion, like a car race. I think the reason Kodak tries to push this speed of film is because it is their most expensive, not because it's the best. 800sp. film is also very \\"grainy.\\" If you get a photo that you really like you cannot enlarge it and have it look good because the film grain is so noticable. Generally, I tend to use 200sp. film most of the time, and I never have any problems. It works well outside on sunny days and with a flash in low-light situations. However, this is just my opinion. I am not an expert, just a consumer."},{"rating":"1","title":"updike overwriting as usual","review":"Updike for me is a very inconsistent writer. Loved his In the Beauty of Lilies, Rabbit is Rich, Rabbit at Rest,Witches of Eastwick but couldn't finish his Rabbit, Run and don't even want to start Rabbit Redux.The problem with Updike is overwriting like in Rabbit, Run.Roger's Version seems bit dated and argument seems trivial. Of course, there is always lots of sex in all his books but cringe-inducing quasi-incest ( sex with daughter-in-law or niece) is a turn-off. In this book, there is a sex scene that is best I've ever read. I own almost all his books but I don't think I'll or want to continue reading him. I rather reread Martin Amis's books.I recommend a review of one his later books (forgot the title) by David Foster Wallace. Look it up. It pretty much sums up problem with Updike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Held my attention from the very first line","review":"The best Updike book I have read so far. The distance with which Updike tells the tale and the very simplicity of the situation allow for an incredible amount of relating to the situation.Pick up this title whenever you get the chance, and read the first page....then you will know what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and tasteless","review":"Having enjoyed a few of John Updike's books, I pounced on this at the library. I forced myself to read until the end, but it was so depressing and so cringe-worthy that it literally choked me to finish it. The storytelling I can find little fault with, and perhaps it's this very talent which was so good at making me cringe and turn away in disgust at many parts of the book. I'm quite open-minded in my selection of reading material and the erotica in this is nothing to what I have read in many other books, but some things just cross the line of humanity and I was shocked that he was allowed to keep such terrible innuendo hinting at the worst possible perversion in this book. Read only if you don't mind being further affected by the worst of humanity in our current world. I have regretted few books as much as I regretted this one and I may as well just read a daily newspaper depicting the same stories to get the same depressing effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This is definitely one of my all time favorite Chopin piano concerto recordings. I've purchased few copies for friends over the years and everyone loved it as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a league of his own","review":"In my opinion, Weissenberg blows everyone away with these Chopin concertos. I've never heard anything more poignant and profound than Weissenberg's reading of the romanze in concerto #1. Weissenberg's octaves in the rondo are beyond belief. His precise ringing tone and uncanny dynamic control throughout are without peer. The orchestra does sound a tad boxey and the low string sections are occasionally boomy especially in the fortissimo passages - consider for example the opening of the 2nd concerto - in contrast the piano is bright and crisp. Overall, the sound quality is not bad. These performances are in a league of their own, embodying Chopin's youthful exuberance and passion. Two geniuses collaborate, Chopin and Weissenberg - don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent introduction to Prolog and concepts in AI","review":"Professor Bratko has done a tremendous job of putting all the fundamental concepts of Prolog and its applications in various areas of AI. Although this book is focused on Prolog, the concepts that he has discussed are so fundamental that they can be implemented in other languages like Java as well.I recommend this book to everyone who wants to learn Prolog. I would also recommend the readers to use a Prolog system to work out the examples and exercises as s/he goes through every chapter. A DEC10 Prolog system (like SICStus Prolog) would probably be the best companion for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"No companion WEB page","review":"First page provides link to web resource page where Prolog code should be available.

Reba's voice is more relaxed than it has been in along time. The best song is Back Befrore the War. The song is so full of emotion that it has strong potential to be single of the year. Other highlights include the title track, I'll Be, She Wasn't Good Enough For Him and What Do You Say. The Spanish/English duet was an added bonus. This album should have stronger sales the her past few albums, and should put her back in the spotlight."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER LET DOWN","review":"Some songs are o.k. on this but not enough for me to give this CD more than one star. Its just more crossover stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT EVEN ONE STAR IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THIS!!","review":"In my opinion this is the worst CD that Reba has ever put out. The background music is so loud and so poppish that I absolutely cannot stand it. There is one good track and thats her cover of \\"We're All Alone\\" a duet with Jose and Durval. But its inconsequential and doesn't justify being on this album. Even what seems to be a plaintive, traditional country song \\"Roses\\", is drowned out by the overproduction and they ruin it. \\"I'll Be\\" is a Diane Warren tune and Diane Warren is a pop writer, not a country writer. That should tell you the whole story here. This is a CD for lovers of that kind of music.

I listened to this piece of junk at a friend's house. (I stopped buying Reba music long ago) There are some traditional sounding tunes here....one or two.....but if you're looking for REAL country music you'd better look at what she recorded before 1988. I'd skip this one altogether...unless you're into pop music because that's the audience she's aiming for. If you like real country try her \\"My Kind of Country\\", \\"Have I Got a Deal for You\\" \\"Whoever's In New England\\" or \\"The Last One to KNow. If you want great stuff from her years with the Mercury label try EVERY CD she recorded under that one....her debut recording \\"Reba McEntire\\", \\"Out of a Dream\\", \\"Heart to Heart\\", \\"Feel the Fire\\", \\"Unlimited\\", and \\"Behind the Scene\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER MISS FROM REBA!!","review":"Most of these songs sound the same, and as to the reviewer who noted this as a \\"traditional\\" gem....I think he was listening to the wrong CD. If you want a traditional gem get her 1985 Cd \\"Have I Got a Deal For You\\" because I can't hear the steel or fiddles here except for \\"The Roses\\" which won't even begin to match up to the best of her traditional songs. All I hear are synthesizers and drums. Another disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS ONE WAS ONE OF HER BETTER 90s CDS","review":"Which isn't saying much because most of her 90s projects were all losers in my book.

The Enhanced CD part includes a full video for \\"What Do You Say\\", along with interviews and 3d pictures - definitely worth watching. I've taken off a star for the part where this guy says \\"the third verse would be better if somebody died\\" during production - you don't have to make the songs SO depressing (the graveyard returns in \\"Roses\\"). Overall it's great, you can really tell these people worked a lot and spent tons of money on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reba out did herself this time!","review":"This is the best Reba CD that I own. The music is terriffic. The duet \\"We're All Alone\\" with Jose y Durval has to be the best song on the CD. The others that really hit home with anyone include \\"Before the War\\", \\"She Wasn't good enough for him\\" and of course \\"What do you Say\\".

The worst two songs on here are the title track \\"We're So Good Together\\" (my ears hurt from the guitar licks) and \\"Nobody Dies from a Broken Heart\\" (one of the ugliest songs I've ever heard in my life!!! A good song will stand up with lyrics AND melody...not just lyrics!!!) I'll give this release 2.5 stars because half of it is good and the other half isn't. She could have released half a CD for half the price, couldn't she??"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!!","review":"I only like one song on this travesty...\\"The Roses\\".

This CD is terrible!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"REBA'S LAST CD OF THE MILLENIUM IS UNMEMORABLE","review":"Most of the songs here are ballads of which there are two that I really like: \\"Back Before the War\\" and \\"She Wasn't Good Enough For Him\\". The rest of the stuff here is unmemorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb CD","review":"This CD is absolutely wonderful. Reba's song choices are perfect for her beautiful voice, and she is in top form. This is a must for fans and would surely tip fencesitters. Hail the true Queen of Country!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best since \\"Read My Mind\\"","review":"Reba's finally matched my favorite CD \\"Read My Mind\\". This album displays her talents, mostly on the songs \\"'Til I Said It To You\\", \\"I'll Be\\", \\"What Do You Say\\", and \\"We're All Alone\\". A clever collection of ballads put together the best CD in a long time... \\"So Good Together.\\" Keep up the great work REBA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT COUNTRY MUSIC!!!!","review":"When I think of country music I like to think of a rich vocalist (Reba McEntire) with good material backed with steel, fiddles, acoustic guitars and some good piano thrown in. We do not have that here except for maybe one or two cuts. McEntire needs to reassess her musical direction because what she has been putting out now for twenty years is pure garbage!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reba's so good on this!!!","review":"Reba McEntire has once again proved that she still has it. Her first single,\\"What do you say,\\" brings tears to your eyes. It tells the story of a family who's future is being ripped apart by an illness. The next single,\\"I'll Be\\"is the ultimate friendship song. It's the perfect way to express what that someone special means to you. The songs' title is uplifing, and just wants to make you dance wherever you are.It was used as part of Reba's tour,\\"A singer's diary.\\" The rest of the songs are very good as well. If you are a true country fan I suggest you add this to your collection. it's well worth the money.Great work Reba!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MORE POP PLEASE!!!!","review":"Reba loves doing this type of material. Or maybe its her record company that thinks this is the only thing that will sell for her. In reviewing this album, it does have a couple of traditional sounding songs on here but not enough to quench our thirst for her return to real country. I believe that Reba has a great range but the choice of material to expose that range leaves something to be desired. As is evident in most of the songs on this Cd, her range is not explored fully or adequately because the material is not as good as it could have been for her. Too much spice in anything is bad and Reba is losing something in the mix here. This is particularly evident in the uptempo material. But for those who like pop music, this offering will have the right amount of spice!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SALTY","review":"This is just some more of Reba's delving into contemporary music. She has lost so much of her appeal to me because everything she does is so overdone. I like it simple and nice. Chateaubriand and caviar are not my style. Caviar is too salty for me and this is what this CD is....salty."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!","review":"Reba didn't do herself any favors using three producers to get this mixture of pop goulash out of the studio. Everything is so mixed up here its hard to tell where its going!! I didn't know if I was listening to country, rhythm and blues, celtic, rock, jazz or new age. Reba is obviously struggling to find an identity here trying to cross all musical bridges but not quite making it!! To state that her album out put is prolific is accurate, but calling all of them brilliant is a decided overstatement. This CD will attest to that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"REBA at her WORST.......","review":"This CD was a HUGE disappointment.. I am with the previous REBA fan and say get an earlier album.. It has too much of a non-country sound on some songs... I would not recommend it at all...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll Be","review":"I can not wait to buy this album, for I truely enjoy all of Reba's music, and one day when I become rich I would love to meet her in person for she sings songs from the heart, and there are so many of them that get to me for I am always down, though when I play Reba's music she picks me up somehow and I would like to personally thank her one day."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd Skip This One..........","review":"This effort is so mediocre...though not as bad as most of Reba's latter 90s material. There are a couple of songs I like on here...and I'll give the Cd two stars for those two songs. The production values are over-the-top here for material that is inferior by all counts."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GOOD TOGETHER!!","review":"If all the music forces got together to make Reba and them sound \\"So Good TOgether\\" they failed miserably. I found this to be a waste of time and money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reba is SOOOOOO Good!!!!","review":"This CD is really amazing and underrated! Reba shines on the ballads and uptempos. For the first time Reba sings love songs such as the smash \\"I'll Be\\" and \\"Till I Said It To You\\" and she also breaks your heart with the tear-jerkers like \\"Back Before the War\\" and the debut single \\"What Do You Say.\\" She also rocks the house with the spunky love song \\"We're So Good Together\\" which she has dedicated to her fans! Thanks Reba for continuing to release amazing music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new Reba fan","review":"My tastes tend to run closer to the mainstream country genre. Dixie Chicks, Shania, and others are more to my taste. That was, until I purchased this latest album by Reba. With great songs like\\" What do you say\\" and \\"I'll be\\", this album puts Reba on my list of favorites. It is a great CD and one that will be enjoyed by a wide range of fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MIXED EFFORT","review":"I can take this or leave it. The first song is so terrible that it almost made me want to throw the CD in the trash. \\"So Good Together\\" was just plain awful. Loud noise..that's all it was. But things got a little better. Some of the songs on here are pretty good. They are mostly ballads the best of which are \\"Before the War\\", \\"Roses\\", \\"I'm Not Your Girl\\" and \\"We're All Alone\\", a cover tune done with some Mexican guys by the name of Jose and Durval. That last one is actually very, very good!! Overall this Cd is a mixed effort that could have used more imaginative production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving music from a true star","review":"What a wonderful CD! Reba shines with her uncanny sincerity and musicality. I am moved to tears every time I hear the song \\"I'll Be.\\" As I have struggled with the illness and finally loss of my mother this past year, this song has a special place in my heart. It put into words what is so difficult to say and remains a powerful testimony to the cycle of life. Reba's ability to convey the deepest emotions with such simplicity shows why she is truly a genuine talent! Thank you for such a wonderful song and CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Songs","review":"Reba's latest effort, So Good Together, is a great collection of songs about love and heartbreak, and what both can bring to one's life. She sings with such passion and emotion that you can feel it in her voice. This is a respectable album, which you could almost call her best album, but you cant, that title first goes to Read My Mind, then Starting Over. However this album is very very very good.The best tracks include What Do You Say, the positive sad song about losing a loved one. I'll Be is another positive song on here. Back Before The War, in my opinion the best track, is a very sad song about getting a divorce, and remembering all the good times in the marriage. Im Not Your Girl is one of Reba's best songs that she's done, very good. Other mentionable songs include Til I Said It To You, Roses, Where You End And I Begin, and more. The only song I dont care for is Nobody Dies From A Broken Heart. Go out and get this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"What do you say\\" about a woman with no flaws?","review":"man, I LOVE REBA! she is soooo awesome! i have been to 4 different concerts.... i have traveled all over the world just to see her.... i loved this album.... it inspired me soo much... especially the song \\"ill be\\".... that is mine and my best friend's song.... reba has inspired me in soo many ways... my one wish in this world is to meet her in person... there was one time that i went to her concert, and i was in her fan club,(at least i thought i was), and i went back to see about getting a backstage pass, and i was let down when they said i wasnt on the list.... my best friend and I, when we were younger, we used to pretend we were reba, and sing in a deodorant bottle to her cds.... reba, just a little personal note, NEVER STOP MAKING ALBUMS, AND ILL NEVER STOP SINGING IN DEODORANT BOTTLES! lol... well, people, go out and buy this cd today, it is soooo awesome!love you reba! sara lynn smith"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Reba Album Ever!","review":"Every song on this CD is bound to reach the top of the chart!

That is why I gave a four star rating instead of the top five."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best country albums of the last decade.","review":"Archer/Park \\"We got a lot in common\\", is one of the best albums of the last decade. It received some air play after it was released in 1994. I have listened to this album for 8 years and still enjoy listen to it. The music is as fresh today as it was when it was released. If you don't have this album your country music collection is incomplete. Randy Archer is a great songwriter. I look forward to hearing more of his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Good. Much Too High In Calories.","review":"I was in a local grocery store that has a lot of items imported from England when I saw cans of Heinz Spotted Dick Pudding. Well, I'd heard of it. Hasn't everyone? The name sounds more like a medical condition than a type of foodstuff and it must lend itself to a certain middle-school-level humor, not necessarily limited to those of that particular age. In any case, I had about a half can (too much) after lunch. I heated it up in the microwave and, after heating, coated it with a veneer of Devon custard. The combination was quite good. It's much too high in calories (from fats and sugars), of course, so I'll have to watch my consumption. However, it was an interesting treat and now when I hear the snickers, I'll understand a bit better.Gary Peterson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes like wet fruitcake to me","review":"Very odd product. Can says No GM ingredients (Genetically Modified?) but the ingredients include partially hydrogenated canola and palm oils. Yucky source of transfats so be aware that thsi imported product contains 2g trans fat per serving...and each can has 3.5 servings.Taste wise - in my opinion, tastes like soggy, wet fruitcake (not in any good way at all). WAY TOO SWEET and I even got a few bites with a sandy, gritty, crunch texture which was horrible and I can only hope it was from the raisins?!This product is not pleasant tasting at all so I am just not sure about all the other great reviews. But for my taste, I couldn't choke down even a few bites of this stuff. Only thing I appreciated from this was the few laughs from friends/family over the name of this Heinz product."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is one dick to pass up on","review":"Look at some of the main ingredients: Partially Hydrogenated Canola and Palm Oils.

The chocolate and sticky Toffee and Treacle are all good too - when you can get them.I know the name seems a bit naughty--it just adds to the fun of offering some cultural engagement to our wonderful world. I do slip it into gifts and offer to bring dessert to friends.

The one that was a staple of my childhood (English working class) diet is a steamed suet pudding. It is made from suet, flour, sugar, currants and raisins, and is usually served with treacle.The Heinz canned version is a very different animal, a member of the sponge pudding race, containing no suet. It is nice enough, and is especially good with English-style custard. It is tasty, filling and easy to prepare, and its name makes it great fun.But if you are a fan of the Aubrey/Maturin stories and want to eat like them, be warned that this is not the real thing. The genuine Spotted Dick (or Dog), described in O'Brian's books, is the glorious suet pudding of my youth.[PeterReeve]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spotted Richard","review":"This pudding is delicious and I guess because I grew up in England and didn't emigrate to the US until 1964, I couldn't understand what all the fuss was about regarding Dick; it must be the spotted part that made people so silly. The name was changed in 2001 to Spotted Richard because, apparently, some women were embarrassed to ask for this when shopping. However, after the name change, the product sat on the store shelves. No one was buying Richard; too bloody boring. Heinz realized it had made a mistake so changed the name back to Spotted Dick and the rest is history."},{"rating":"1","title":"this product is dangerous","review":"I ordered the spotted dick.

Thanks Al!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old School Ministry","review":"Honestly, I haven't been able to tolerate anything Ministry has put out since Psalm 69. I always listened to a few songs of each release to see if they every returned to the sound of \\"Land of Rape and Honey\\" and \\"Mind ... Taste\\". This album is as cloase as you can get to a return to that aggressive, politicized, nihilistic style of music that made Ministry worth listening to in the first place. Awesome!

Gone is the slow, heavy mud that was \\"Filth Pig\\". Al is back with speed, chest pounding beats, and most importantly, samples. Sure, it's not quite as clean as \\"Mind..\\", but this is the stuff that made people like Ministry in the first place. I mean, let's face it, \\"Filth Pig\\" and \\"Spoon\\" did not attract new followers; all those albums did was irritate the old ones. The sound of this album is closest to \\"Psalm 69\\". As for the whole political statement, I think it's kind of silly, but I could really care less. Al could sing about unicorns and rainbows, and I probably wouldn't know the difference, as long as the music is there. Al's political views are only clear when you read the lyrics.

Whether or not you can appreciate the politcial commentary overtone the album has, any longtime or newcoming fan to Ministry can appreciate the sound of filth and fury by one of the best and fastest bands over the past 14 years or so. While the last few releases seemed to have something missing, even with the departure of Paul Barker it didn't hinder Ministry's inevitable return to the top of the sh*tpile, which is right were they belong. The vox, the guitar, the synth and the distortion all take you back to the days when the sound of Ministry had no rivalry, and the genius of the noise could only be appreciated by the select few.

Paul Barker's absence is obvious while not devastating. I have been a fan for about 5 years, but I see no reason to be \\"loyal\\" to any band, if loyalty means giving them your money for every album they release (not even including going to concerts). In my opinion Al should have quit while he was ahead. He was really scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one. For example, he uses very unoriginal and common liberal political sentiment, causing me to really question his sincerity on this album. The lyrics don't say much in the way of artistic thought or sincere feelings alike. I listened to a friend's copy of this and have yet to buy it myself. I doubt I will.

For many years musically they just NAILED it, deftly straddling the line between heady, spacey electronics and heavy guitars and jackhammer beats. And their lyrics still had a sense of irony or humour about them, or they were simply inconsequential, a small piece of the larger puzzle. But this one...where to start ? NO hooks. NO subtlety. NO variety. NO sense that it was created for any other purpose than to bash George Bush. As another reviewer here noted, I neither need nor do I want to take political advice or direction from a burned out junkie musician, even if I DID agree with him. Listening to this album is like going to family Christmas dinner and having to listen to that one crazy ranting uncle that no one likes but puts up with anyway.

However, Mr. Pump, the Golums, and Otto Creik were disappointing represented.If you enjoy this movie and that enjoyment leads you to read and discover the awesomeness and joy of Sir Pratchett's Discworld, then this vesion of \\"Going Postal\\" can be forgiven it's shortcomings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"I bought this movie because I love David Suchet. I made myself watch about thirty minutes thinking it would have to get better, it didn't. Save your money and don't buy this terrible movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Pratchett","review":"I am a huge Discworld fan. It would be great if they would take more of the books and turn them into movies. Down the road, maybe someone could even take it to the television for a full series that goes through the entire series instead of tackling books here and there. This is a must have for any heavy Pratchett fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant film adaptation","review":"This production does justice to Pratchett's delightful Discworld adventure. The cast, the production design, the writing--all contribute to a thoroughly enjoyable romp, as reformed con artist Moist tries to save the Ankh-Morpok post office. I hope the whole creative team--including the cast--go on to film the sequel, MAKING MONEY, when Moist takes over the Ankh-Morpok Mint. Til then--buy this DVD, and enjoy your sojourn on the Discworld!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Adaptation","review":"While there will always be nit-picking to be done when a book as complex and wonderful as Going Postal becomes a movie, this film is still wonderful. The visual interpretation of the clacks, it's mechanisms, and it's workers is dead on.The only real problem I had with it was the character of Reacher Gilt was oversimplified and kind of dumbed-down compared to the character in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far one of my favorite stories, but...","review":"I love Going Postal. It has to be the funniest and one of the most insightful parodies of new technology since HG Wells!This movie has nothing to do with that book. It's not a bad movie, but it is the most ham-handed adaptation possible. At first, I thought they were going for campy, but then decided somebody must have felt it necessary to dummy down the story.And that's a damn shame. The movies made of Hogfather and The Color of Magic stayed true to the novels and were witty and funny and brilliantly entertaining. This could have been. With the talent on board for this movie, it should have been great.Don't know who was thinking what, but next time - don't mess with the story! You're not going to get better than Pratchett!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn good","review":"It isn't \\"Hogfather\\" but it's pretty darn good. Adorabelle is spot-on, except when she quits smoking. A couple of people told me a viewer would be confused if he hadn't read the books, but I have, and I'm glad precious time wasn't wasted on stuff every Pratchett-lover already knows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to see Pratchett brought to life","review":"My wife and I have been Terry Pratchett fans for many years and own many of his books. We enjoy reading them to each other on long car trips. We love the mix of humor and fantasy that he brings to every selection. It's been fun watching his books brought to life on the big screen. The Color of Money was entertaining but ultimately they didn't have the budget to pull off the book. Going Postal however, is pretty true to the book and the acting is first rate. It is an exceptionally fun movie for any fans of Terry Pratchett and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome!","review":"Awsome! If you are a Discworld fan, I need say no more. For anyone that is new to Terry Pratchett's Discworld, it is a highly entertaining story with great actors. I have gotten other Discworld movies and Going Postal did not dissapoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much more","review":"i have followed the pioneers from way back; this album is good but not the best.it does not qiute reflect their best performance. I recommend the album entitled : \\"I Believe in Love\\". find this album if you can, its worth yr money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning for Undergraduate Probability Students","review":"Ok this book is a great book for actuarial studies and self study. I had the unfortunate luck of having this book assigned for a Probability undergraduate class in college. WOW! this book was useless for an intro class. I don't want to speak bad of the material inside this book, which is great for actuary exams and such. This is just a warning to anyone who's taking probability in college and is assigned this book. I would suggest picking upSchaum's Outline of Probability, Random Variables, and Random Processes, Second Edition (Schaum's Outline Series)this is a better source for things taught in an undergraduate probability curriculum. If on the other hand you are studying to take your actuary exams this is a highly insightful book that is easy to read and very entertaining at the same time assuming you already have a grasp of basic concepts of probability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very hepful","review":"The book is not very helpful. I used it in my first Probability class, and it isn't written in a simple and understandable way. The author jump from one section to another and then return. I had some knowledge in proof, and I was able to understand. The majority of the class only had Calc 2, and for them some parts were simply another language.Also, it has some terrific typos!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get it","review":"The things they do explain are explained ok. BUT, they only cover the basics. Like conditional probability. They'll tell you the formula and rant about it a little and that's it. The formula they give is not the one you can always use. Often times it can get very complex and long. None of that is mentioned, showed, or explained. Or when they talk about jumps in 4.1. They never really tell you what it is or how you recognize it/get it. It's vaguely explained and you need to consult other sources. The author must be thinking everybody is a math major. Covering the basics is NOT enough. Hugely disappointed in this book. All the other chapters are the same. Often times I try to to the practice problems and can't even find where they talked about it in the book... because they didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good learning book","review":"Some gaffes in this book, I don't think the author has any real understanding. He even messes up the definition of expectation, and it doesn't get more elementary than that. There are many better probability books out there, don't choose this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, high energy.....FUN, FUN, FUN!","review":"After seeing the info commercial about the video I was ready to order but with a price tag of 59.99 + shipping on the website promoting the video I checked and found the 2 dvd set on Amazon for only 17.99! True it doesn't have the booklet and additional soundtrack but who cares? I love it! I am overweight and 50 and would of prefered to see a few other similar bodytypes. They were all young and skinny but what the heck, they make you feel young. I did have to alter it slightly to my abilities but even the 20 minute intro tape is a great workout. I highly recomment this for anyone tired of boring aerobic tapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"this isn't the same enrique..","review":"this cd isn't enrique's usual style. he's added a touchof pop, to appeal to his english speaking audience, which isn't common against his other cd's. there are some beautiful songs on here, like 'can i have this kiss forever' and 'your my #1'. i've been an enrique fan for 3 years, and i'm glad he has a new english cd, enrique is my #1 singer. this cd is an excellent buy. te'amo para siempre, enrique!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"could i have this kiss forever\\" not the proper version","review":"I sampled this CD prior to purchase and was misled of course, I did not know it at the time or I would not have wasted my money). The version of \\"Could I have this kiss forever\\" on the CD is slow, morbid and horrifying to listen to--THE ONE ON THE SAMPLE WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT--AND MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE. The 2 versions therefore do not match, which is very misleading to customers. Amazon offers the option of sampling songs prior to purchase so as to inform customers of what they can expect to hear upon purchase. In this case, however, that did not happen, which is very deceiving. When selling music, the seller should make certain that the song samples match the actual songs on the cd, so annoying situations like this do not occur. Dissatisfied customers lead to zero profits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enrique Iglesias: Enrique","review":"'Enrique' is still an excellent album, on a par with the most recent release from Enrique Iglesias: 'Escape'. Tracks that stand out are Rhythm Divine (and the sexier sounding Spanish version called Ritmo Total) and of course, Bailamos. Apart from Could I Have This Kiss Forever - with Whitney Houston - a lot of the remaining songs sound quite similar, although they come together to give the album a relaxing yet sensual feel. Many of the tracks are emotional, for example Sad Eyes, but the overall tone is upbeat, which makes this album a pleasure to listen too whatever the time of day."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS CD !","review":"Wonderful music, wonderful voice,and a wonderful artist. Beautiful music , very soothing . Every word seems to come from his soul and he sings straight from the heart. Yet, he backs all his soulful ballads w/ upbeat dance numbers , that make you wanna SHAKE IT ! You want this Cd #1!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent songs!","review":"I rarely come across an album that I enjoy almost every song. This album is filled with romantic ballads such as I Have Always Loved You, and Killer dance tracks such as Be With You. Enrique may not have the greatest voice but he has got the songs, and in the end that's all that matters. Other standout tracks include a duet with Whitney Houston Could I Have This Kiss Forever and the latin flavored Oyeme. If I had to pick low points it would be the hits Rythym Divine and Bailamos, only because radio played the hell out of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better and better Enrique","review":"I love this album more and more each time I listen to it. There are dancable songs on here like \\"Rhythm Divine\\" and emotion filled songs like \\"Be With You\\". The album has everyhing you need to fill your day with music! Erique Iglesia is amazingly emotional, caring and gives his music everything. Buy his music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop Album of the Year","review":"I had never bought a CD by a Latin performer before, because I thought the music would be nothing more than silly pop a la \\"Living La Vida Loca\\" and \\"Shake Your Bon-bon.\\" But then I heard \\"Bailamos\\" and loved it, even though I have no idea what the hell Enrique was singing about. When the CD came out, I grabbed it and was pleasantly surprised. This is the best pop album of the year - memorably choruses, lush arrangements, pleasant melodies. The singing is a little overwrought at times, but that's a minor criticism of an otherwise wonderful album. Except for Spanish-language versions of several songs, there's nothing about this album that's particularly \\"Latin\\" - anymore than Celine Dion's albums are particularly French. It's just great pop music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Artist & Music","review":"Enrique is an excellent artist. He sings musically with all his heart, emotion, and feeling. He is a true artist who knows and understand the expressions and meanings of music. His talent can easily be sense and heard from his musical styles, expressions, and presentations."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have not felt this way since the Beatles","review":"I never thought I would be one to follow popular music stars around the world just to catch a glimpse or scream an extatic, \\"I love you!\\", but now thanks to Enrique, I am. I have played this album for a wide range of friends and relatives (example: a girl of 23, a man of 33, a man of 61) and they have all been thouroughly impressed. The reason is that Enrique's music is uplifting, powerful, romantic, enegetic and simply joyful. Be the first of your friends to discover him."},{"rating":"2","title":"¡Absolutamente Maravilloso!","review":"This CD has some of Enrique's best songs on it. My personal favorite is \\"Be With You,\\" all of the songs are great though! This Cd is good when you just want to kick back and listen to some music or anything else. I listen to it when i'm cleaning my room or when i'm on my computer chatting with my friends. I even searched at GOOGLE for the lyrics to some of them. Overall its a realy good CD and i suggest buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Romantic!","review":"This CD has to be one of the most beautifully romantic CD's ever produced. The songs are wonderfully written and sung, and really make you want to fall in love all over again. The up-tempo songs have a great catchy beat, and the slow songs are meant to be sung along with while you are thinking of the special someone, or even just looking at the magnificet sunset and night fall. The combonation of the two can just give you wam fuzzy feelings all up and down your spine! I definately recommend this CD to anyone with even just a hint of romance in their blood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD yet!","review":"I've been a fan of Enrique's for some time now, and I own all of his CD's. Although his voice is absolutely MADE to sing en Espanol, this is his best CD as far as the \\"music\\" goes.This CD doesn't really have any of the ballads that Enrique is best known for, but these are the best uptempo songs (with a Spanish flavor) that I've heard in a very long time. If Rhythm Divine, Be With You, Alabao and Bailamos don't have you up and dancing around the house, nothing will. He also did the impossible, which is to make me actually like Whitney Houston; their duet is one of the best songs on the album.Plus, there's a huge change in his lyrics - still very romantic but much more explicit and racy. Must have been SOME woman who inspired this album...que mas da, atravesare el planeta tras de ti."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Songs By A Talanted Artist!","review":"Enrique has such a great voice and it shows throughout his singing. All of the songs on this CD are excellent, especially Sad Eyes. That is an outstanding track to listen to! Enrique cowrote most of the songs on this album, and let me say that he did a very well job. The only reason I didn't give this CD 5 stars is because I am not too fond of the spanish versians of some of the songs, but the rest are good. Buy this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ENRIQUE LOVES HIMSELF MORE THAN HE LOVES HIS MUSIC.","review":"Why does this CD keep getting 5 star reviews?First \\"Bailamos\\" and \\"Rhythm Divine\\" are the same song! ....Even when they start on the radio I don't know which one is which until he sings the title.On \\"Be With You\\" he sounds like a wounded moose in heat....\\"I just wannnnnna beeeeeeee with yooooou\\", moaning through his voice.The only song that shows any promise vocally and musically is the duet with Whitney Houston - \\"Could I Have This Kiss Forever\\".Otherwise between Inglesias and Martin...I say Martin has the upperhand vocally and dances better too.I recently saw Inglesias on the Today show performing and he trys to be so serious....Enrique you are just singing pop...anyway your dad Julio is much more talented.This CD is fair at best with run of the mill tunes....Whitney saves it with her vocals and range.P.S. Can somebody please tell Enrique to remove that mole from his face, its distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music is fine until he opens his mouth.","review":"Music is fine until he opens his mouth. The singer has a very unpleasant and irritating voice. If you like to listen to your squeaky door then his albums are your cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap","review":"PLEASE!!>......whatever happened to good Rock 'n Roll. This (...)is forced down your throats by the music industry and radio stations and goddam TRL. Please open your minds up and realize what is happening out there........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Top contender for worst pop album of 1999","review":"Due to agressive marketing campaign by his record company and management team and his fans, this cd will be a commercial success.However, this album is further proof that he can't sing a lick. The talented Whitney Houston reaches a career low with her participation in this cd.The correct rating for this cd is - 1,000,000 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enrique spans the generations","review":"I have had this CD for close to a year now. I cannot get enough of Enrique. I even wake up to his wonderful voice every morning. There is a quality that Enrique has in his voice that makes the words he sing feel so sensual. He gives me chills every time I hear him sing. I love every song on the album. Even though I cannot understand Spanish, the Spanish tracks are just as wonderful. I let my mother listen to this CD and she loves it also. She thinks that Enrique is so much better than his father. And when Enrique goes on tour we will be in the front row together."},{"rating":"2","title":"BREAK THROUGH","review":"An excellent first English cd from Enrique. A mix of love ballads and dance pop tunes along with 3 of them also in Spanish.Includes a great remake of the Bruce Springsteen song SAD EYES. A lot of chart topping hits, including BALIMOS, RYHTYM DIVINE and BE WITH YOU.A must own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot!","review":"After i heard \\"bailamos\\" i knew that i wanted to get this cd, and when i bought it i wasn't disappointed. Enrique Iglesias uses danceable latin beats and passionate, sexy lyrics, and pulls it off without sounding cheesy. The best tracks are \\"Bailamos\\", \\" Be with you\\" and \\"i'm your man\\". i liked the last few tracks in spanish, too. so if you like latin music and pop, get this cd! ( oh yeah, check out the hot pics of him in the cd jacket)"},{"rating":"2","title":"ENRIQUE TRULY IMPRESSES","review":"At first, when I bought this cd I thought to myself, oh no, another Ricky Martin wannabe. But I was so wrong. Although Ricky Martin's English cd is good, this recording by Enrique is far superior. His voice is incredible with touches of Julio and even Chris Isaak on a couple of tracks. Sure, most of the songs are catchy pop tunes, but that suits me fine when I want to listen and drive and sing along. Great cd with the best tunes being \\"Be with You\\", and \\"Sad Eyes\\". Congratulations for a great first English cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent album!","review":"This is the first Iglesias CD I've ever gotten, and I love it!My mom was a fan of his father, and always says that Enrique looks as though he's inherited his father's looks and voice......and charisma!Nearly every song on this CD is great, which is very unusual. His voice is so great....it is sensitive(the tremble), and deep and rich; it just flows around you.Enrique is VERY good looking; tall, dark, and handsome! He is the hottest Latin guy I've ever seen...Ricky Martin is great, but he's not Spanish, which makes Enrique seem more exotic.This CD is excellent, and I would reccomend it to anyone. I just wish I saw more of Enrique on TV and in magazines!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome! Don't resist buying this one","review":"This CD is really a great buy. Bailamos and Rythym Divine are definitely the best tracks, but they all pick you up. They have awesome lyrics and a great rythym. Get it, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't bought it","review":"I haven't bought this album yet, and I wonder if I will. I was listening to the samples offered on the Amazon web-site, and can tell that, like Ricky Martin, Enrique is much better in Spanish. To hear Enrique at his best, buy Cosas del Amor instead. My high school Spanish teacher used his CD's as a teaching tool, and everyone in the class loved his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Large and impressive!! Great for 7-8 year olds","review":"My son wanted a truck or vehicle for his GI Joe and this seemed to be the best answer. When we gave it to him, he was so excited that all the other toys just sat there for hours before he came back to them. Not the most intellectually challenging toy, but still a hardy, traditional toy for boys and girls. Sort of expensive, but seems worth it for such a big impact toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding cd!!!","review":"i'm agree with most of the reviewers, and i'd like to add something:does anybody notice the song \\" lift me up\\"(jeff lynne ex ELO)? is a masterpiece!!! i'm sure this is the kind of cd everybody should have in our houses"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my Pot Rack!","review":"Limited kitchen storage space prompted me to look at pot racks.

Very impressed at the gauge of this metal, very thick and robust. Cuisinart did a good job of hiding the weld location where the ends are joined, I can only make out a small bump. The only thing that could be improved on is hiding the mounting bolts after installation is completed. The chrome finish of the bolt and washer sticks out against the brushed stainless steel.Also, the height is 15.9\\", not 5.9\\" as Amazon describes.
