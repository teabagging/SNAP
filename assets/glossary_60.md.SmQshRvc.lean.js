Nextly, why is the deaf woman attracted to a toon-graphic nerd who loves music? And what does he see in her? She's too angry to be sexy.How convenient they lose their jobs in time to chase the bad guy and how odd they have no idea what to do when they catch him.By the time their affair fizzles out, this reader was very happy to close the book. Plenty of fancy food but not enough meat on the story. Suspend my disbelief, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls flat in the end","review":"This is the first time I've ever felt like reviewing a book. Actually, it is more of a warning to potential readers. While the character development is good and parts of the book make you want to keep turning pages to find out what happens next, the ending completely falls apart. There were also a few parts where there was too much detail about something that ended up not being very pivotal to the plot, but I would have forgiven that had the story ever gotten wrapped up.If you like a book to have an ending where either the good guy or the bad guy prevails, then don't read this book. Pretty disappointing. This was my first book by this author and I will not likely try him again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly perfect...","review":"Boyle's most recent novel had such a great premise - and a well-executed and engaging beginning and middle... Unfortunately, the ending fell a bit flat for me. The epilogue failed to serve as a satisfactory conclusion to the book. Including it all felt pointless! There was no justice in the way it ended... And the relationship between Bridger and Dana felt incomplete and left hanging. The book just ended without much of a hopeful feeling for these characters that Boyle so skillfully created. Peck's fate along with Natalia and Madison's seemed uncertain, too. The book just felt very unfinished... unsatisfying in the end, which was such a shame because I really loved the rest of it. It was surprisingly exciting, filled with great writing... but without a better ending, it missed the greatness mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great storytelling!","review":"I have not yet read much by TC Boyle, but what I have read I've enjoyed immensely, and this book is no exception. Briefly, it involves a hearing-impaired woman and her boyfriend and the man who stole the woman's identity. The way Mr Boyle gets into each character's head, shows his or her most primal motives, is just genius. The plot moves along, the characters are interesting, the writing is crisp, funny, smart, and sometimes mean (in a good way!). Others have given more detailed reviews; I just wanted to add my voice to those who liked the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as good as \\"Drop City\\", but a very good read","review":"T.C. Boyle is one of the best writers in the US today. I think thatshort fiction is his strongest suit, however he has written severalvery good novels. As in his other novels, the character in \\"Talk, talk\\"are members of an american subculture. The book tells a fairly convincing storyof identity theft, and uses it to provide a study of the three mainprotagonists: Dana, Peck and Bridger. As the book progresses, itappears that the plot is there mainly to put these characters intosituations far out of the ordinary and examine their behavior. WhilePeck is certainly a borderline sociopath, there are really no heroes inthe story. However, sufficient background is provided to motivate theaction of all the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I normaly love the techno trax, I don't know what this was","review":"Every single song sounded the same.

The problem is that Dante's Italian--because of the rhyme scheme & stanza structure--is simply not translatable into English. Our language does not have enough rhymes avilable to use the same pattern as Dante, or anything like it. Many have tried--Longfellow, Sayers, Pinsky--& all have failed to some extent or other. Sinclair's prose translation tries to show you what Dante says, without trying to imitate his poetic structure.This, unfortunately, may be the best & only way to get a good feeling for the content & meaning of this remarkable work. Highly recommended--but if you're really interested in pursuing this further, try to learn some Italian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, poor fit.","review":"If you think that by spending a little more money will get you better quality you're wrong. The worst of which being the adjusters, out of the box the adjusting screws were almost frozen in the plastic retainers causing their poor quality to strip out almost immediately. I was using Snap-On screwdrivers so tool quality was of no concern. I spent almost 2 hours just trying to get them to fit decently around the headlight doors and alignment was still an issue.

However, Army General Partridge (Kelsey Grammer)will do anything to keep Burton from learning the truth in an absurd attempt to push an unsafe, untested and faulty vehicle into production. Smart, hilarious and clever, HBO skillfully took this outrageous story and made it into one of the best comedies it has ever done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Painful because it's so true...","review":"I love this movie mostly because I am a DOD civilian employee. I have a lot of sympathy for the engineer who has to deal with all of the scope creep that comes along with designing things for the DOD. The sad part is that the military/government hasn't really ever learned from all of the mistakes that happen. The culture of \\"everything is fine, there are no problems here\\" is still pervasive in the military specifically because the military leaders haven't learned the first thing about positive reinforcement. People who make bad decisions are rewarded with promotions and new contracts, and people who make good decisions are \\"forced to retire\\".

I especially like the Fischerspooner remix.The CD itself comes in a neat foldout cardboard case with new artwork by a guy named Shag who's doing work for the Pink Panther 40th Anniversary this year.

The imagery in the Dollhouse is very realistic including fabric curtains, and it includes parents and twin baby dolls.Con: The cost, which was $230. in August 09 (and this didn't include shipping!) is not commensurate with the quality, i.e., this dollhouse is NOT wood, but plastic. Although I like the dollhouse, it was definitely over-priced!Overall, I would have given this dollhouse five stars if it wasn't for the high-end cost. You can find an equally engaging dollhouse for far less--even dollhouses crafted in wood."},{"rating":"2","title":"great dollhouse, but don't pay $250","review":"My daughter plays with this dollhouse all the time.

But shop around and don't over pay for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Survived our fire","review":"Santa brought this dollhouse to our daughter for Christmas '07. In February of this year, our home caught fire and we lost everything. While cleaning & trying to find items to salvage, I came across this dollhouse. It was covered with ceiling debris, insulation and had been water-logged like most things in her room. Though the window panes, sheetrock and carpet in her room melted from the intense heat, that dollhouse was still completely intact. Once I washed it out, it didn't even have that lingering smell that comes from smoke damage. The colors are still bright and true, and it's as pretty as it was Christmas morning. The furniture and dolls however DID melt and now we are replacing one room set every other month. (Santa had to save 6 months to even buy the house and furnishings the 1st time.) Anyway, I have recommended this particular dollhouse and the furniture sets to many people. I feel they are well made and a good value for the money. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Girls Love It!","review":"My 3 and 4 year old girls love this doll house. From a parent perspective, the accessories are too expensive, fairly useless and the extras (flower boxes, curtains) come off too easily. It is difficult to get the people to actually sit on the chair or couch. While it is durable and I like the ability to fold the sides in to make it more compact, I wish the \\"extras\\" snapped in a bit better so they weren't so easy for my 1 year old to toss around and put in his mouth.

The twin babies were a big hit and the girls love covering them up with the little blankets. The house has 8 rooms, 10 if you count the two roof sides; so Santa's elves had to purchase some additional room furniture for Christmas morning.

I would have preferred the same thickness as the older version, but since I don't plan on trying to rip a double-sided laminated item in two, it'll probably be OK. My main concern is that it will still be as waterproof; which is probably due more to the adhesive and the size of the border, not the plastic itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as they used to be","review":"I bought exactly the same item a few years ago. It's only about half the thickness of the previous sheets, but they still call them \\"heavyweight\\". Now, each sheet (without the backing) is about half the thickness it used to be, or maybe even less than half. It's even thinner than the plastic shipping tape I use to seal boxes with.Also, this same item used to be a full 9\\" by 12\\". They still are, sort of. There is a line across one end to indicate which side is the easiest to separate, so it makes 1/2 inch of each sheet unuseable unless you don't mind the line being there.I only bought these because I didn't want to take a chance on any of the other brands that I don't have any experience with, and these were okay the last time.

In use, the stuff expanded and dripped out. The solution is to wash by hand and not submerge it.2. A steam escape hole is between each of pair of poaching cups. Because they're small, five jets of steam shoot out at high pressure. I use tongs to lift the cups out to avoid scalding. If I had designed it, I would have put a large hole in the center to reduce the pressure and the number of jets.3.

But anyone who has ever used stainless steel knows that sticking is usually an issue with stainless. I like this product, but compared to the stainless poaching set that I inherited, it's not anywhere near as sturdy. I expect that it will hold up just fine, but don't think it's going to become an heirloom. The plastic handles on the cups get HOT and cannot be used in a practical way.

This is the only non-Teflon product I found on the Internet for poaching eggs. It works well. One lesson is the small circle vent holes on the plate the cups set on can get you with steam if you're not careful when removing the cups. the interesting thing is I use real butter for the cup prior to adding the egg, the stainless cups actually clean up better than the Teflon style. The Teflon type always seems to allow the egg white to adhere to the Teflon. Some of the Stainless cups were almost clean after use. After using it one time to make two batches back to back, I no longer regretted the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stainless Cups!!","review":"Was determined to find stainless pan and cups with tight-fitting lid or to stop eating eggs. This is a quality product and I have \\"sold\\" a few of them to friends who see it and want one. I do find the black handles to be extremely hot so one needs a mit or cloth to remove the cups. Small price to pay for the best eggs on earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the poacher I had perviously","review":"I like this set. I'm still figuring it out and trying to get the right consistency. But overall I like this so Much more than my last poacher. I don't have to ever worry about steam burns or getting burnt by the lid or handle. I'm glad I purchased this, my only complaint is the water gets out underneath the lid and splatters everywhere, not safe for little ones running around in the kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"I bought this pan not knowing what to expect. The pan has good weight to it and as long as you give the cups a little swirl of butter or olive oil, the eggs come right out without leaving a mess.

Each of the 5 removable inserts have a handle. Handles get hot but they cool fast when removed. Use caution.

Exercises are provided to help the reader's decision making. The way the book is put together the authors quite effectively coach the reader toward the possibilities and the joys of coaching.

It's the most heart-wrenchingly beautiful thing you'll ever listen to. I believe that the first three seconds of \\"Cleaning Apartment\\" is probably the most jarring sound I've ever heard, and thrillingly addictive in it's simplistic horror.

Make sure you've got your wits about you if you're going to listen to it, or it will eat you alive. Just to psych myself out, I listened to \\"Summer Overture\\" and \\"Dreams\\" while driving on a badly lighted street at night. Then I turned my headlights off. I got so scared that I nearly crashed into a tree. This soundtrack is dangerous! It gets in my dreams. It makes me feel like I've experienced things that I've never experienced.

Almost all of it is pointless electronic garbage. One 20-second-long track is actually just three slow, electronic beeps played one after the other. I felt nothing after hearing this soundtrack. The only tracks on this album that are worth listening to are the overtures. But even they are boring; each one uses the same dreary theme over again. It starts to sound like the composer Clint Mansell is on the same drugs that characters in the movie use. Only get this soundtrack if you love techno/electronica music. Clint Mansell's effort to be original for this soundtrack failed horribly. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Score","review":"While i found the film painfully disturbing, the score/soundtrack evoked many memories from the film, without the tragic pain associated with viewing it. Not an easy CD to listen to, as it is a score, following the musical progression of the film, as opposed to a soundtrack organized for easy/flowing listening.

It gives a wonderful view into early Puget Sound life (e.g. Ivar's \\"Keep Clam\\" motto comes from an 1890's Depression song \\"Acres of Clams\\" -- \\"When the tide is out, my table's set\\"), and into the Yankee industriousness (shown here through its slacker son) that built so much of the country.It's a lively story, well told and highly insightful.

Finding out the place they used to hang out at has been turned into a gay bar, trying to keep a job and causing a riot at an old folks home are all really cool. The two (Lancaster and Douglas) play their hearts out in this movie, too bad it was their last together.Even though it was great to see the gruesome twosome working together again in a comedy, it was Eli Wallach (of \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\" fame) who stole the film for me as the blundering and also aging Hitman, Leon B.

The very first chapter--\\"The Night the Bed Fell\\"--begins with the laconic observation, \\"I suppose that the high-water mark of my youth in Columbus, Ohio, was the night the bed fell on my father.\\"Thurber goes on to explain how his grandmother felt that electricity leaked if not plugged up, a preoccupation that kept her busy filling in every gap in every lamp or outlet in the house.All the chapters are pretty much entitled with the name of some highlight of Thurber's Ohio youth: \\"The Day the Dam Broke\\" and \\"The Night the Ghost Got In\\" and that sort of thing. What the chapters all have in common is that Thurber is a brilliant storyteller who manages to make the most plebian, everyday happenings matters of sparkling humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is really quite amazing","review":"Unlike most autobiographies, My Life and Hard Times is short and extremely sweet. Despite its length, however, you can pick it up again and again and always be delighted by it. As Thurber says, he talks \\"largely about small matters and smally about great affairs.\\" And the great affairs he talks about are quite meaningful, adding yet another dimension to the book. After reading it, I had the feeling James Thurber was somewhat depressed because of the limits of life. He only hints at this at the beginning and end of the book in his \\"Preface to a Life\\" and \\"A Note at the End,\\" but it is there, and it is powerful. As for the nine anecdotes that make up the bulk of the book, there is simply no equal: they are very funny, displaying the occasional and humorous insanity of people.

Diane Keaton does a good job, but the movie leaves one depressed and wondering why they just wasted 2 hours watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great acting - terrible story!","review":"This is really a very sad, sad story. I remember watching it and thinking at the end, \\"This really sucks!\\" I won't give away the entire plot, but if you can think of a woman in her 20's, with a job at a school (so she should be leading a somewhat low key life) and tons of men that treated her like crap, then this is your flick! The worst part must be the ending. Some movies, you suffer through the whole thing, and then you get a really good ending .... but this one, you just get a crappy story with an even crappier ending. As much as I love Diane Keaton, and her acting is great by the way, this movie is a real downer. If you are in the mood to get depressed, watch this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BRUTAL","review":"This movie is an absorbing if skewed melodrama that takes a vicious, if expected turn in its final brutal moments. The whole movie has a supremely sad, repressed feeling and look, though Diane Keaton is the perfect choice to bring a zing and zest to the lead role. The double life she leads seems more than believable today, and has the sting of authenticity as it unravels horrifically. This film is nearly impossible to view more than once -- the finale is that difficult to stomach. Watch for edgy newcomers Richard Gere and Tom Berenger; Tuesday Weld and Richard Kiley are excellent in their more melodramatic, single-shaded roles. The disco classic DON'T LEAVE ME THIS WAY will never again sound playfully seductive to you again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please release on DVD or BluRay soon!!!","review":"I have a handful of films I am still waiting to come out on digital format. This is high on the list!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm, Wendy??I don't know...","review":"I have been listening to Wendy Williams since I was in elementary school. My friends and i have always been fans ( my bestfriend won her very 1st CD player from Wendy on KISS!!). SO when she started hyping this book, I was expecting a grandiose tome of her life, the whys the hows, and of course celebrity talk at it's best. What I got was a poorly written bio about her drug addiction, that fat girl thing, and no real celebrity dish. Every thing that was worth knowing, she made a \\"blind item\\".Most of this stuff we learned just from listening to the darn show. The only thing I learned about her is that she must have really learned from her mistakes, because a lot of the advice she gives on the show is completly contradictory to the things she's done in her life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Whole Lotta Wendy","review":"I didn't buy this book expecting War & Peace; I bought it because I used to listen to her show in New York and I was nosy. Sue me.Ms. Williams is an extremely provocative radio personality with a tremendous on air energy and fearlessness and I had hoped to find out in her book how she came to be such a person. I'd also hoped she would provide a Zelig-like look at the evolution of hip hop. This is where the book disappoints. Ms. Williams is heartbreakingly candid, especially on the subjects of her miscarriages, her struggle to have a child and her husband's infidelity, but she offers little insight as to what drove her to excel in radio, other than a strong desire to hide her cocaine addiction and show up to work on time. She seems to have no real opinions about the nature of hip hop and its impact on her career and popular culture. Still, her folksy, breezy writing is like a book version of her show and fans should find it enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"I recieved the book in great condition. If you listen to Wendy's show, this is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"you won't be able to put it down","review":"This book is not as bad as other reviewers say. Yeah, it would have been better if Wendy revealed the true identity of some of the characters. I guess the Gossip Queen doesn't want people gossiping about her. All in all, the book was very captivating and entertaining. If you listen to Wendy on the radio, it will make you appreciate her more. If you've never listened to her, you'll start after reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Girl, Please","review":"First off, the cover art is horrendous. If that is in fact, Wendy, she looks better as a DRAG QUEEN. The cover is the first mistake. The second mistake was even writing the book. She is a wannabe celebrity, nobody outside of New York really even cares about her diva-less self. The third mistake was mine for even reading this error-filled pack of garbage.Wendy, do us all a favor and don't ever think about a sequel!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"words cannot describe...","review":"what an utter piece of useless garbage this book is. If you like Wendy's brand of \\"Look I know about a star's dirty laundry\\" gossip, that's your entitlement. Taste comes in good and bad. But this book revealed Wendy to be exactly what she is: a pathetic, parasitic, completely false wannabe who honestly (and delusionally) believes she's a show-biz diva.If there's any real humor in this book, that's it. Save your money and your time. This is one of those books that had no reason to be published. The writing is atrocious, the language obviously planned, and the point nonexistent. If, as one reader said, this was \\"the best book you ever read,\\" please RUN to the nearest bookstore with all the cash you can spare and head for the literature section!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother... !('Just Us Girls' Book Club)","review":"The ladies of 'Just Us Girls' Book Club reviewed Wendy's book in October '03. At times, Wendy was too in-depth but left the most important parts out (two sides to a story but we only read Wendy's side). The group also felt Wendy came across as a shallow person. Her story was repetitive as it related to her drug abuse. The story also lacked specific details and actual names."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poorly Written Book","review":"The writing in the book is so poor all I could do was to put in down in disgust. The book opens with such sentences as \\"I am not hating on\\"... and there are street words and slang used throughout the book that made me wonder if the book had an editor. Later, there are comments from the author that if a woman can [perform certain actions] she will get somewhere in the radio business. I mean really. The book I am sure captures the author's voice, but to put that voice in a book and expect people to pay for the poor English and horrible writing is an act of wishful thinking. Also, the cover that is displayed on the Amazon page is not the cover that is on the book. The actual book's cover is much more provocative and it is as disappoiting as it is stupid. I don't care about he author's breast size. Finally, the lines in this book are spaced far apart and what one is really getting is a half a book that has been stretched to look like a whole book. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wendy's Got the Heat","review":"I read the book this past week and the book was not all that great. I felt like I was listening to one of her shows except I was reading it. She kept referring to her past drug habit through out the book. I definitely give her props for putting herself out there like that but it seemed like she was just making unnecessary references to her cocaine addiction. The references just seemed out of place in certain chapters. The book could have been better written out. The book seemed like it just dragged on and on. However, I do give her credit for being able to speak on her drug past, infidelity, insecurities, and all that stuff the women experience everyday. The book just wasn't well put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wendy should be paying me to read this...","review":"For starters, the cover of the book makes her look like a porn star. I was almost to ashamed to buy the book because I thought people would think I was reading porn. Second, this book was one of the most poorly written books I have ever read in my life. I found myself skipping pages and trying to find the good parts. I was EXTREMELY disappointed especially since she hyped the book so much on the radio. Also, some of the stories just didn't make sense because they were so underdeveloped. Wendy presents herself as a well-spoken sophisticated woman, but the only thing I saw in this book was a weak addict w/ low self esteem. It was obvious that this book was a rush job. Don't buy this book. Just get it in the library for free....and if you want mine....take it...I won't be reading the book again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story - Poorly Written","review":"Wendy Williams has an excellent story to tell. I found her life, trials, and tribulations to be entertaining as well as inspiring. I found good advice in her book. I would have enjoyed the book more if it was more in depth. It only touches upon most areas of her life before moving onto another one. There are some misspellings and occasionally the book jumps back and forth and its hard to follow. Wendy, I think you have had a hard and fabulous life. You have so many stories to tell and can elaborate upon. You need a better writer to assist you and a much longer book to tell it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wendy is beyond amazing but this book was the worst ever","review":"Sadly, the story of her growing up and chalenges as an adult were not interesting, surprising, enjoyable, absolutely no humor or anything imaginative or interesting....a very boring tale to tell us. However, I wanted to know more about her growing up but now know it is identical to millions others, nothing fascinating whatsoever. What a shame I bought this quickie easy read, it was extremely boring and I couldn't wait to throw it in the garbage bin....thank God it only cost $4.97. I now know I would not want to read any other Wendy books, I'll continue to be a fan of her hilarious old radio show in NY as well as her EXCELLENT talk show on Fox every day. I love that gal, HOW U DOIN?MOST HORRIBLE BOOK EVER, I HATED IT, LOVE HER, THOUGH.SUCH A YAWN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still looking for the heat!","review":"I am a regular listener of The Wendy Williams show.

It was just all over the place. But i have to say, I still Love Her....Please do not write another book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Stupid!!","review":"This book makes no sense. It is not steady reading and there are a lot of errors. This book was published by a major publishing company but while reading it, I often thought it was self-published. The cursing in the intro was just stupid. Her editor should have guided her better than he/she did. The writing style is also corny. Wendy I know you were excited about getting published but you should have went to a different company. At your publishing company, everyone guided you in the wrong direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wendy Fans Won't Be Disappointed...............","review":".......as she gives us more than just a peek into her private life, and how she became the radio diva that she is today. I respect Wendy because although she has no problem discussing any celebrity's private life publicly, she is equally as revealing about her own life. This book takes you through her childhood, college experience and early days in radio detailing the struggles that she's faced that have made her the media success that she is today. I have a renewed appreciation for her as a personality, and her radio show....she is definitely \\"doing the d*** thing!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it","review":"As a person who listened to Wendy during her inital hey days, used her now defuct 1st and 2nd website (there is a 3rd) in all honest I must say this book was HORRIBLE.I was expecting her to get down and dirty in her books like she has done to so many guests on her show. This was pure floss and was just an extension of her current show. I cannot believe how she disrespected everyone by using racial slurs in the introduction. As a avid reader I can say this is a waste of anyone's time. If your interested in a radio career read the introduction and your covered.We all know she's a former addict, and we now know she's delusional to believe her own hype. Cheating husband and she accepted that and want women to think she was strong in doing so to keep her family together. Sorry but she's looks like a women with self esteem issues who was lucky enough to land on her feet.Get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I wouldn't waste my money on this book if I was you, you're better off borrowing it from someone else. This book was wack, she mainly talked about her coke habit. She kept repeating things that was already discussed. It was a boring read, the only reason I kept going is because I had to pay for it, matter of fact I want a refund. Wendy if you see this, please stick to radio. I think people bought this book out of curiosity."},{"rating":"2","title":"I finished the book in less than a day...","review":"I'm a Wendy listener so my review maybe somewhat biased, but I really connected to Wendy's story. Listening to her daily (well as much as I can) I feel she's an associate of mine. While reading the book, if you know Wendy's voice, you can picture her telling the story to you, like 2 girlfriends catching up over dinner. I admire her ability to be so honest and forthright with her drug addiction and the infidelity of her husband -- something that many women go through but are too ashamed to admit. It boils down to the fact that you have to be in the situation to truly understand why the person chose to stay with their mate after infidelity. My favorite part? The whole thing, but especially the end, when she offers advice -- for relationships and life in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wendy's Heat Is Cold","review":"I have to give it up to Wendy Williams. To be a black woman in the same league as Howard Stern is impressive. However, this book is NOT impressive. First of all, why all the cussing and ghetto talk? What is she trying to prove with by writing like that? Secondly, I think her comments about single parents was too harsh and totally unfair. I do agree with what she is saying, because I am waiting until I get married before I have kids. But I have friends who are single parents and they do a D@MN good job with their kids. She talks alot about self esteem, but in my opinion she lacks it. In fact, her book left me feeling depress. Also, some of the stories felt rushed and not well thought out. And please, don't EVEN get me started on the cover of the book. That was a sign to avoid this book. I should have trusted the sign. Rent this book, but don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Junkyard on Paper!","review":"Her miscarriage aside, it's hard to have any sympathy for Wendy Williams after reading this book. It essentially tells the story of a spoiled middle-class brat whose parents bail her out of (almost) all of her self-inflicted problems. The only thing positive that anyone can get from reading this book would be if they changed the title to a more suitable, \\"BOYS AND GIRLS-DO NOT FOLLOW ME!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written","review":"Wendy hyped this book up on the radio so much that I just couldn't wait to read it. After reading the first paragraph I thought, \\"what the hell is this?\\" but I kept reading. She mentioned nothing that she had not already talked about on the radio. She did give further details in regards to her addiction and a deeper insight into her personal life but nothing really juicy!! In addition to content, the story was not put together well AT ALL!! It was a waste of money. I do not recommend buying this one. If you must read it, borrow it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Complete First Season of the X-files","review":"In short, it had a great picture, great feeling to it just like you'd want The X-Files to have!

The series shows such promise yet it was as if Chris Carter had'nt found his niche on what to do with the show. I found that some of the episodes dragged a little, but were thrilling enough to keep my interest. It picked up toward the end of the season... when the viewer sees a moderate amount of characterization (Mulder and Scully)... but although the first season was choppy at best, which most first seasons are, I very much enjoyed it, with the exception of a few not so good episodes like \\"The Jersey Devil\\", \\"Space\\", and \\"E.B.E\\". They were outweighed by the great episodes such as, \\"Squeeze\\" and \\"Tooms\\" (which featured a very eerie X-Files villain), \\"Ice\\" (my personal favorite), \\"Shadows\\" and \\"Born Again\\" which take on a more ghostly storyline. All in all The X-Files shows promise... which I'm sure will blossom in later seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Mulder met Scully...","review":"AH!

No alien takover cover up conspiracy stories here, just the self contained stories of the bizarre in each episode. (The producers were not sure there would be a second season to carry that storyline along). There is not much in the way of extra content, mostly dubbed clips in other lanquages. I do like watching a complete episode in 40 minutes. My wife and I put a CD in when there is nothing worth watching on TV and watch two episodes. Video and sound quality is great.

The first few episodes have their awkward moments. The episode that appears to be a sheer ripoff of one of my favorite horror movies is what ticked me off, but that must have been a fluke. By the middle of the first season I was able to remember what appealed to me so many years ago: the plots are bizarre, interesting, and for the most part not horribly overdone with cheesy effects.

The design of the box is a sort of \\"digi-pack\\" that folds open. This is the same style used in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer box sets. The most recent season of Buffy (season 4) had 6 dvds but knocked down about 70 bones in price. Meaning I can get 2.5 seasons worth of material in the Buffy boxed sets. What's going on here? Does Fox use some sort of alien-gold in the manufacturing of their dvd discs that makes them cost so much more? I smell a conspiracy here and it's costing X-Files fans a lot of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"An okay season.","review":"Season one of The X-Files plays mostly like a monster-of-the-week show. There's plenty of mutants for TV's most popular FBI agents to battle, including ghosts, killer computers, pyrokinetic psychos, and human-eating insects. While great on the suspense and loaded with atmosphere, the season lacks the mythology that makes this series so great. Still, it introduces us to the characters and establishes the show's formula and great writing. Not bad, but certainly not the best season, either. It has great moments though. The pilot episode is great, as well as \\"Squeeze\\", \\"Ice\\", \\"Eve\\", \\"Beyond the Sea\\", \\"Tooms\\", and \\"The Erlenmeyer Flask.\\" Mulder is established as the unconventional believer, and Scully the skeptical scientist. This season suffers from a lack of drama and character development. Until \\"Beyond the Sea\\", Scully isn't given the chance to shine as a character. And Mulder trods through the season chasing one monster from the next. Great TV, but nothing compared to what's to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst episode yet","review":"This episode was not as forward looking as one would have hoped.

However its very clear they had to make some sacrifices to fit 4 episodes per single sided, single layer disc. The video ranges from excellent to below VHS quality, exibiting almost every type of DVD video defect there is at one point or another. I also experienced some chops and jumps which I have not seen on any other DVD. The sound is excellent however.

Think about it, two shows equal 90 minutes. Thats a whole movie worth of X-File intrigue. Multiply that by 12. Thats right, 12 movies worth of X-Files! Don't forget the additional material like interviews and behind the scenes information. That is one hell of a bargain. I know some of you are saying I've got season one on VHS already. No you don't.

Not great, but we get someone more interesting than the antagonist. What's more interesting than a guy who can start a flame with his finger? Well, an woman who will rekindle an old flame with HER finger! While the story for \\"Flame-boy\\" is fun, we're too busy wondering how the \\"new\\" girl is going to fair off with Mulder after so many years...and seeing all the annoyed reactions of Scully dealing with the two \\"lovers\\". That alone is worth watching the episode (even though the \\"human torch\\" is still worth watching, too).

Now yes there are exceptions, but the majority of TV shows just don't compare with the X-Files. I loved season one, because it hinted at bigger things to come.

Highly reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"In The Beginning...","review":"I used to have most of the series when they first released them by season in the ridiculous fold out packaging. I got rid of them years ago when I moved to another part of the country. Anyway, these slim sets are much better in terms of packaging. The extra stuff from the original releases are mostly gone, there is still the occasional deleted scene though. The picture quality is excellent, but the sound is still meager two channel Dolby.

The only flaws present would be that the episodes aren't in widescreen and they're not in 5.1 sound. But again, the series provides intelligent, errie entertainment, not to mention the beautiful Gillian Anderson. Highly recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"need a progressive scan DVD player","review":"I was initially very disappointed with the quality of the video on the DVDs. I had (past tense) a Panasonic DVD player, which did not have progressive scan mode. I happened to give the player to the in-laws and replaced it with a Sony capable of progressive scan mode.

Shame on Amazon, and I am a Prime member too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive","review":"For $7.99 per month, you can watch the entire serieis on Netflix instead of spening $2 per episode with Amazon.If each season has 20 episodes, that costs more than buying the entire season on DVD.Your decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Dreadful!","review":"A simple review for simple people. The X-Files is a dreadful, unimaginitive show with a bad cast. Carter is talentless. He is the TV equivalent of M. Night, though even Night made one good film (Unbreakable). If you are going to spend money and time, buy the best TV series in history (aside from Patrick McGoohan's \\"The Prisoner\\"), The Twilight Zone. You will never find better acting, bigger stars, better writing (can you say PULITZER PRIZE WINNER?!!) or better visuals. Rod Serling created the genre.The X-Files is a well made box set filled with a bad TV series. Even \\"Millenium is a better way to go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning","review":"Before The X-Files became a global smash hit for Fox, it started as a modestly budgeted Friday night thriller that soon became a cult classic. Then virtual unknown actors David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson starred as FBI Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully respectively; both of whom are assigned to the X-Files: a division of the FBI which investigates paranormal activity. Like many of Fox's other prime time shows at the time (except for The Simpsons and Melrose Place), the future of The X-Files was uncertain; so the on going plot lines and self-parody hurmor would not take full circle until later seasons. This first season isn't the best in the series' nine season run, but it is a step into one of the greatest prime time telivision dramas to hit network TV in years. Standout episodes include \\"Darkness Falls\\", \\"Ice\\", and \\"Squeeze/Tooms\\" which guest starred Doug Hutchison (The Green Mile, Salton Sea) who was one of the most underrated and creppy villians the series would ever have."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Holy Grail","review":"I have just received this box set and i can't put it down.Any fans who haven't already bought this,well all I can say is it's time to throw all your vhs copies away and revel in the commercial free,mint and flawless presentation of your favourite show.The memories come flooding back to remind you that this is some of the best television EVER,and Season 2 cannot come fast enough.An essential purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"This could be the start of something big","review":"Wow, what a mix. Take one part of \\"Kolchak, the Night Stalker\\", \\"The FBI\\", and \\"The Outer Limits\\" and stir carefully. The X-Files was fun watching, especially at the start. It is a hoot to watch the development of both characters and plot thread that will eventually be woven into a tapestry of myth. Scares, they are in there. Look for a lot of humor also. This is not just a monster hunt.This set is in the slim set format that I really like. It is space saving with no lost of content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heidi Chronicles","review":"The movie was just as dull and frustrating as the film. Relationships are alleged but not developed.

Thomas Pynchon, whose superior fiction focusses on entropy, spends untold brilliant words discussing Maxwell's demon in \\"The Crying of Lot 49,\\" his most accessible work. A chapter devoted to Pynchon's theories and how well they correllate with Maxwell's and, perhaps, an imaginary debate between Pynchon and Maxwell, would have added immeasurably to the faint enjoyment I derived from the book. He also missed the clear musical salute to Maxwell by the Beatles in \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer,\\" which allegorically compares the demon to English common law."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good song","review":"\\"Goodbye To My Homies\\" is a good RIP song from Master P, but I like \\"I Miss My Homies\\" a lot better.

Compare to the new concert I would rather prefer this one, so would any \\"true cream fan\\" I guess people were expecting some light show with perfect camera work, of course back then it really was about just jamming out till you passed out.Cream is all about playing some genuine blues songs with a mend of rock, not about good camera work. If you heard white room or spoonful and got hooked on...this is a great performance where it's all about the music. Clapton's massive blues solo's, bruce's howling vocals, and let's not forget the amazing hardcore drumming from baker. If you just want to see a true rock band jamming out in their early years this is the legendary concert...just look at the audience and see for yourself why cream is one of the greatest of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like talk over on all of the songs this is it","review":"This is one DVD by a great artist/band that I would shred. It is a dog. Its like a BBC biography of the band. If it is not the band members discussing their performance then its the director that is talking over the music. It seems like nobody on this DVD can help but interrupt every single song which hey do. It would have been nice if it was a concert not this biography of Cream. This doesn't even mention sound quality. A total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"Sound is horrible. Remember those \\"tape recorders\\" you had when you were a kid (I'm 38). This sounds lik it was taped on that."},{"rating":"1","title":"[Bad]","review":"Dont buy this video if you hope to see a great performence by the best band in the world, Cream. The editing of this video is terrible, and so is the camera work, they switch the angle every second, you cant even see what they are playing because the cameras are focused on their faces. Also they start showing the performences in the middle of each of the songs. Do not buy this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the face","review":"I'm not going to comment so much on this DVD as all the previous writers have covered all the bases. I would like to comment on the whole Cream package, movies, records, cd's etc. Cream was one of the best bands ever, I love them, but I haven't heard one recording that ever did them justice. I think the whole RSO organization used them as a money machine and then cast them aside. None of the recordings or moveis had any real technical know how behind them. One typical feature that has irritated me on a lot of British films are why in the world do they focus on the guitar players face during a solo (Clapton, Hendrix et al) and forget that they ain't singin' man they are playin' that thing they are holding. Anyway I have bought all of the Cream videos I could and just suffer through it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wretched botch of a historic concert","review":"No way to sugarcoat it: the director ruined this film, completely bungling his job. He must have thought he was part of the band, or that Cream needed his help to rock the audience. All kinds of cheesy '60s camera effects are deployed--rapid zooming in and out, rapid focus shifts from foreground to background, editing that looks like it was done by a food processor--showing a total lack of repect for the musicians. Buy it, if you must; but you can enjoy it just as much by playing it through the stereo with the picture turned off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Music, Weak Video","review":"The narrative comments regarding guitars and rock music are so odd and out of place that they could only have been made in 1967. This had to come from some news reel, or documentary from 1967 regarding Cream and the final concert. The interviews are okay, but they were unecessary. I don't believe audiences in the 21st century need to learn what a wah-wah pedal is, or how to use the tone controls on a guitar. And the editing is just dreadful. It's worse than the standard MTV music video 1/2 second edit. Too bad, because the playing is simply awsome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite What I Expected","review":"I love Cream,so I was really looking forward to seeing this DVD.I was disappointed by both the extemely poor sound and video quality. The sound was particularly bad. I couldn't even hear Jack Bruce's vocals becase of the distortion. My favorite part of this DVD was interview part, where each band member spoke about the music and even gave a lesson on their instrument. That was really cool. I recommend that you rent this just for that part alone. This is not worth the purchase price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why cut it short?","review":"Do you own the rights to Cream: Farewell Concert? Well listen here pal. How dare you pay somebody to edit Cream. Sure you might have suckered me to buy your chopped up over-edited video but right now I'm telling thousands of people not to. Maybe it was cheaper for you to make a 48 minute video but you ruined the concert with your cut-it-short approach. Someday when I own the rights to this movie I am going to put this video out properly. I encourage CREAM fans to wait until they can buy this video in the complete format the way a \\"cocert\\" should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cream Farewell Concert 1968","review":"If you are a die hard cream fan then this video isint for you. Buy starnge brew. It inly has clips of each song and not the complete backsatge interviews. Also it has vocie overs. Being a huge fan of them this video was the worst.

Sounds are incomplete and interrupted by narration. The sound and video quality isn't pleasing either."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment for fans.","review":"The video documenting Cream's Farewell Concert is an extreme disappointment. First of all it is only 50 minutes. For a band that is known to play twenty and sometimes thirty minute songs, this doesn't leave much time for the music. There is not one complete song on the whole video. If they show a full song it has some bad narration over the beginning. Not to mention the many songs that were played that night that must have been forgotten(Sitting on top of the World & Crossroads). If your looking for a good Cream documentary on video, I suggest Cream's Strange Brew. It has all the good stuff form the Farewell Concert and a lot more. There is also The Fresh Live Cream on DVD that just came out. It sounds really good too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly interviews-little music","review":"This is a documentary on Cream. It looks like it was made for British TV. It is about half interviews and half music. It is only 47 minutes long. There are no complete songs. The songs start in the middle or end abruptly. The announcer talks over large portions of the songs.The picture and sound quality are poor. The actually camerea shots were poor. It looks like it was pulled from an old video tape. The DVD has no special features.There are some interesting parts to the interviews, where each band member explains how they play their instruments and how they acheive their sound. But, most of it is a gloss over without really getting into the band. There is no mention of how they formed or what tore them apart.There are some nice bits of them playing, but it isn't enough to justify buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best choice if you're a Clapton fan rather than Crea","review":"If you are absolutely crazy about Cream then there is some Ginger Baker \\"How I do it\\" tricks to watch, some Clapton guitar tricks explained, but music-wise not the best of Cream I must say.

It's actually upsetting to look at if your a fan and that's what this is. No redeeming value whatsoever (not even for the listening experience), just alot of nose hair, teeth and fractions of songs.

The editors even had Clapton change from a 335 to a Firebird in the middle of a solo. I knew he was good, but seriously folks!! In spite of all the drawbacks, it is the most complete record we have of a Cream concert in a large venue. However, there is room for hope! PLEASE, if anyone out there with the wherewithall will listen. Please record all nights of the upcoming Albert Hall series of concerts and release a box DVD set including every performance, plus rehearsal footage in a pristine, unaltered form using state of the art recording equipment!!

Amanda does not recognize her voice, and in the middle of my daughter playing with her, she will say she is sleepy, and close her eyes to take a nap. Amanda will say it is time to eat, and then after my daughter gets the food Amanda wants, Amanda will say she wants something else.This doll is not what was expected, and I would not recomend it to anyone until all of the kinks are worked out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Toy Mistake Ever","review":"The baby doll I was told to get my daughter for Christmas was sold out. I saw rows and rows of these \\"Amazing Amanda\\" with the computer chip. So I thought \\"cool, she'll love this!\\".From day one the doll has never lived up to our expectations. We've reprogrammed her several times and she always thinks my daughter wants her to go potty.Her lips started wearing off within a day or so as well but my daughter really hasn't noticed.I would not recommend this doll to anyone. For the price I can think of a lot better toys/things to buy. Spend your money else where. The doll is not worth it's current price in my opinion and does not work as advertised (voice recognition, responses, etc)."},{"rating":"1","title":"another disappointed daughter","review":"We bought this doll for our daughter. It's too difficult for her to use. It takes forever to program and then once your batteries run out, you have to do it again. Additionally, the doll has never recognized my daughter's voice. She gets so frustrated that she turns it off. It only works if I'm helping her & saying the commands precisely and slowly, but it takes forever to get the baby to recognize your voice, the command, confirm that it's the action you want to take, ie. snack time, then do the action. . . ugggggggggghhhhhhhh."},{"rating":"2","title":"I too was skeptical, but found this doll to be very intrigueing,","review":"although I read outragous and extremely negative reviews...I went ahead and purchased the doll. I think it's important to play with it with your child at first....it's so interesting to see how real it is. My daughter loves it and hasn't put it down in a week. Sure, the batteries need replacing about every 3 days...but that's continuous play time...I think it's fair considering the size of the batteries. Get good brand batteries.The doll is worth it. my daughter will be 5...in two months. This is my daughters favorite doll by far. I can't see these small batteries causing a fire. LOL"},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to upset my daughter","review":"Im so angry. I bought amazing amanda as soon as it became available. It was horrible, and I though something was wrong with it and I exchanged it for another one. The second one was just as horrible. My daughter is very bright and speaks loud and clear and yet the doll never recognizes her voice. I took it back much to my daughter's dismay. Please dont waste your money. I am going to wait for the maker to get a clue fix it and make it better then maybe it will be worth 100 dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your continuous negative reviews had me return this doll...","review":"Thanks to all who submitted reviews. I initally bought this doll in November for my 6 year old for Christmas, but returned it having read all the continuous negative reviews. I instead am writing a letter to place in her stocking from Santa about how Amanda needs to go back to the \\"toyshop\\" for refurbishing. I did notice however, that PLAYMATES is trying to improve the battery situation. Amanda initally took 3 \\"C\\" batteries, now she takes 4 \\"C\\" batteries. I am holding out for when the doll can walk over to an outlet and plug her self in to recharge. A $100 dollar gameboy can be recharged, why can't a doll?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I read some reviews and now this","review":"this amazing amanda is just scary and 101 dollars i mean seriosly its crazy amagine waking up at night you forgot to turn it off and when you wake it says mommy lets sing toesies 1 little 2 little 3 little toesies maybe some might be defective but i dont know...might be good for halloween"},{"rating":"1","title":"totally evil doll","review":"hi i'm a 11 year old girl and this doll is so evil. one time iput her in the play pin with my dolls and she started being meanto them so i returned her to the store"},{"rating":"2","title":"my little girl likes her","review":"My six year old got Amanda for Christmas.

After feeding the doll once, the painted lips began peeling. As of right now, the doll has flesh colored lips and no eyebrows, they came off the next day. I contacted the company & apparently there is a problem with paint adhering to the face's materials. Aside from that, the doll is not educational, annoying & downright creepy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool idea for a not so cool doll ...","review":"This doll talks way to much! After my daughter begged my mother to buy her this expensive doll for Christmas, she has just agreed to sell it in next weekends garage sale. Amanda completely creeped my daughter out. She was constantly shouting Yes and No to Amanda and became completely frustrated when Amanda wouldn't follow commands. Consiquently, Amanda spent the next seven months with her battery removed. One funny note: My daughter was sick one night so she slept in bed with me. In turn, my husband slept in my daughters room. He woke the next morning to Amanda greeting him at 7am and asking him what he wanted to play - it was Chucky reborn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BATTERY EATER !!! Annoying.","review":"This doll is annoying. She eats batteries and has to be reprogrammed. I also do not like that the control is more with the doll on what she does. When we first tried her out, it was cute. But with the battery program overnight and having to reprogram her on Day 2, and then again and again, it is really more cumbersome than it's worth. Plan to spend about 10 minutes programming her EACH TIME. Anyhow, we tend to avoid this doll after spending almost $100 on her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very happy!!","review":"Well, my daughter wanted this doll so bad , and if you don't say the exact phrases loud or clear enough she will not respond to your chid correctly. I also noticed while my daughter would feed her with the spoon provided or brush her teeth with the dolls tooth brush, this was making the painted lips on the doll come off (peeling off).In my opinion not safe. This doll made my daughter (who wanted this doll in the worse way) so upset and frustrated that the doll sat on the floor until I returned her.Too bad she was cute!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary!","review":"I had a nightmare last week that Amanda came to life and spoke in that stupid voice of hers. \\"Hi.

We set it up for our oldest but both of them got extremely annoyed with her within a few tries of playing with her. She doesn't seem to understand what they are telling her, either daughter, and they get frustrated with it. She has sat on the shelf for the last year. Would probably be great for the kids if it wasn't so much work for them to use. They just don't have the patience for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daughters love it, I hate it!","review":"I recently purchased this doll for my 7-year old daughter. She absolutely loves it and constantly fights over it with her 2-year old sister. I cannot stand it, though! It is annoying, repetitive, and constantly announces that it's batteries are low. This infuriates me! I believe a doll that costs $100.00 should come with rechargeable batteries. Instead, we are putting three new \\"C\\" batteries in it every two days. This is no exaggeration! I would not recommend this doll until improvements are made on its battery efficiency."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not a kid, I just don't have an account","review":"I got this a week ago for my daughter to play with, because her stupid box fooled me into thinking she really was amazing.With Amazing Amanda, Jessica had to say her name for 25 minutes until she FINALLY reconized her voice. It annoyed us when Amanda said \\"You are not my mommy\\" over and over.It also annoys us when she wants Jessica to feed her \\"breakfast.\\" she'll giva Aamnda a pancake, but Amanda'll say \\"Silly mommy! Cookie not for breakfast.\\" Same thing with her potty...Amanda doesn't even reconize when she's on her potty and complain that she had another \\"accident\\" again.We didn't even get our money back when we sent her in!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying, cloying and frustrating! A case for doll abuse.","review":"This is hands down the most annoying doll I've ever had the misfortune of spending $100.00 on. How MANY times do you have to say her name and why do you have to continue to repeat it over, and over... It's so bad that I turned it off and now at least my little girl plays with it instead of throwing it in frustration. Agree with previous reviewer, it burns through batteries at the rate of lightspeed. This wouldnt be so bad if you could use rechargeable batteries, but nooooo. Not with this doll. Plus, if it runs out of batteries you'll have to repeat the long, tedious set up AGAIN!No Amanda, I'm NOT your mommie! You need to go home now.Save you money - this toy is the first one you'll hide or convieniantly loose after christmas. The frustration just isnt worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Say my name, mommy\\"","review":"My five year-old daughter just had to have this doll for Christmas. Santa left it for her. I set it up with my daughter's voice, but it never recognizes her. It constantly demands \\"Say my name, MOMMY.\\" My poor daughter loyally repeats Amanda's name, only to hear the heartbreaking \\"You don't sound like Mommy.\\" This doll is so frustrating that it has spent 10 months sitting in my daughter's room. She saw an ad for the doll, and pulled her out again- only to be frustrated once more. In theory, it is a cool concept, but hardly worth the disappointment on your child's face. It is completely unfair to spend $100 on a doll that just makes your kid sad. To those of you that have to watch your money, I would really think twice before buying this. My daughter was much happier with her dolls that are not interactive. We are all very disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't sound like your mommy??!","review":"After following the directions very carefully, even programming Amanda quietly with my daughter alone in a room, and using excellent batteries, at start up she continued to say, \\"You don't sound like my mommy. Amanda's sad. Can we play until Mommy comes home?\\" My daughter would raise her voice or even start crying, \\"But I AM your mommy!\\" It was just too heartbreaking to get through that one part, even though some of the other playing was OK. We returned her; Amazon is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we say bust?","review":"I bought this toy for my daughter in sept. She LOVED it..for about a day..then it got thrown to the side into the pile of unplayed with toys. She likes her chou chou SOO much better. Amanda wasn't that hard to set up..it took a little time, but not really too bad. As a parent, I liked it! If I was her age, I would play with the doll. I think the generation's are different tho. When us parents were growing up, we didn't have such interactive toys. I guess once you have come into a technological world, things kinda lose their value. I thought she would love this doll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and Cute!","review":"I too at first was afraid to purchase this after reading bad reviews...but we didn't want a messy \\"Baby Alive\\" doll so decided what the heck we'd give this a try for our 5 year old daughter. Well, this is her favorite gift from Santa this past Christmas! Apparently the company has fixed the glitches because she works GREAT!! The doll was so easy to program - we lost the instructions but all we had to do was read the Amazing Allysen instructions again (older daughter received her as a gift unfortunately) and 5 minutes later she was ready to play. She always recognizes my daughter's voice and the games, eating and even the potty thing is so cute and funny! My daughter loves her and once in awhile she'll get mad at her if she doesn't understand her but I just have to tell her to take her into the other room where it's quiet and wait a second before she speaks to her.Too bad the Amazing Allysen doll isn't anywhere near as good as this doll!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Disappointment","review":"Although my daughter tries very hard to play with this doll, I can't believe what a waste of money it was. I've already returned one doll because the coloring of the mouth was falling off and the eyelids broke and now the same thing has happened with the new one. When I called the the company they didn't care, they just told me to return the doll where I purchased it. It tells time however she tells you where the hands are on the clock. As an adult I can't figure out what time she is trying to say let alone my 4 year old knowing what time it is. Mostly she has to yell at it so it hears and my daughter asks why Amanda \\"never listens\\". I guess this is another one of those toys that just looks great on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"super doll","review":"I just got this doll, she is super, would reccommend her. Probably going to be a hot item at christmas time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think carefully before buying","review":"WE purchased this doll after reading the reviews. My daughter played with it on and off for a day. It annoyed her to death. Woke her up all night until she finally turned it off. It does what it said it would, but it just never shuts up and is like a burden on a 6 year old. I did return the doll in hopes of recovering some of the 69$ I spent. This turned my daughter off of baby alive, thinking all the interactive dolls would drive her nuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the kindergartener!","review":"My 5 year old opened the box, and we set Amanda up within 5 minutes! Amanda heard my daughter and recognized her voice. The only thing I have to teach my daughter is to wait a couple of seconds after Amanda speaks and moves, before she speaks back.

I highly recommend this doll to all who have kindergarteners!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Amazing Amanda is not so...I bought this doll for my 7-year-old. We followed the directions and played in a quiet room. The doll NEVER recognizes my daughter as her \\"mommy's voice\\"...ever! We've reprogrammed it at least a half a dozen times and still it never recognizes her voice. It also doesn't understand commands very well. Furhter, after just six months, her plstic arms and face began to deteriorate and get sticky. Her eyelids are tearing from the deterioration. This is not a wear and tear issue - it is plastic that is just poor quality. I have dolls from when I was a kid that are still in perfect shape. Save your money - this doll is not worth the expense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save money and buy Pooh - knows your name","review":"Amanda can't hook up to the computer. Amanda doesn't know your childs name, or even what food or color that your child likes. Pooh is priced better, and knows these things. We have both Pooh and Amanda, Pooh gets more playing time.

THE TOY MADE MY HEAD HURT AND I AM AN ADULT!","review":"It is Christmas morning and my 5 year old was excited as my husband and I both were. We had seen it on TV so we rushed to purchase this toy. OK, so the voice recognition part took some time but my daughter was quite patient.What made her upset, and I do mean cry was the Amanda did not recognize her voice and asked her over and over what was her name. It got so bad that my daughter said that she wants a doll that does not talk!I think its great that it worked for some parents, but you should not be angry with people who have had a very negative experience with this toy. Its a shame, but for me at the end of the day the idea of a toy that I spent so much money on is that my child should be having a positive experience, not a negative one.I will be returning this toy to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amanda has short-term memory!","review":"I bought this at TOYS R US for $100 (super big waste.) She looked very cool on tv, so I thought I would give her a try.

(after the inital 25 minute set up) Amanda kept saying \\"You don't sound like Mommy.\\" and \\"When will mommy be home?\\"This made my daughter very angry. She tossed the doll on her bed and I think she's played with it 2 times since. Both times ending the same way. After a few minutes of \\"you don't sound like mommy\\". Amanda gets tossed on the bed and Sydney picks up a \\"Normal\\" doll.My daughter accidently woke Amanda up the other day (she's been sleeping since October) and my child screamed like someone was trying to hurt her.

She does everything she is supposed to do. Once in a while she will not hear my daughter, but the doll is great at directing play. I would NOT give her to a child who is any younger because there are only certain phrases that are to be used to get Amanda to play with your daughter. The set up is NOT a big pain as people indicate. It might take a whole 5 minutes. My daughter loves her. She does wish her accessories had come out though. If you are thinking of this doll, I say go for it. One more bit of caution, if your daughter does NOT have patience, forget it!!! She also need quiet so she can hear your daughter. If you sit with your child and demonstrate and explain how to play, you should have no problems.

She was very annoying to us, the parents, she seems to never \\"stop talking\\" If you use the on off switch to turn her off then you have to reset her program each time you turn her back on. This caused problem between my impatient daughter and I because she did not want to wait for us to aswer the 20 questions before she began to play again.

I PAID SO MUCH $$ FOR THIS PIECE OF JUNK","review":"The only thing amazing about this doll is the fact that so many of us have spent this kind of money on a doll that is a total piece of junk....I bought this for my grandaughter for Christmas after she was totally excited about it after watching the commercial on tv. After one day the coloring on the lips came off, the eyelashes fell off making this doll look scary to a little child. After returning it to the store for another one, the same thing happened. Calling customer service is useless and they could care less....they made their money!

There is NOTHING that is fun about this toy. It takes forever to set up the \\"functions\\" (think setting your VCR....then triple the frustration and annoyance factor....). There is no opportunity for your child to \\"play\\" with this doll. Your child merely awaits Amanda's next command. Plus, ours must have a glitch because she kept repeating (after a maniacal giggle) \\"You look funny upside down, Mommy!\\" What the...???At first I just thought I would have to live with Disturbing Amanda, thinking that my daughter wouldn't want to part with her no matter what. (This was for my daughter's 7th b'day and all we had heard for WEEKS was \\"Amazing Amanda...\\") Guess what? Even my daughter became creeped out by her in no time flat.

My daughter speaks very clearly and the doll still could not understand her. Part of the time she didn't understand me. When you sit her on the potty she usuually doesnt recognise that she's there. Maybe the sensor should be on the outside instead. After only an hour of being on she said her batteries were low (brand new energizer max). Also she is only supposed to need the date and time set when batteries were replaced but the one we had did it every time we turned it off and back on(to save the batteries).Maybe ours was defective. Overall just not so amazing. The Julie doll I had about 10 years ago was better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amanda is Amazing but..","review":"My 5 years old wanted this doll so bad, I've read the reviews and had seen the doll before, it's pretty much like most people say but I still think she's amazing specially cause it's just a doll.I wouldnt pay U$[...] for it, so I waited for the sale.It's annoying when Amanda doesnt understand what you're saying but again, she's just a doll, and most of time she understands pretty well.I wish the doll could be fed more times, like, when she asks for food she only wants a bite, my girls kinda get frustrated cause they wanted to give like 5 or 6 bites for her, just like when u're feeding a real child, so they have to go all through the \\"mommy what should we do?\\" again to give the doll one more bite.Another thing, the paint on the dolls lips came out in the first day of use, it should be more durable, besides that, Amanda is fun and I'm happy that I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Doll for the Price","review":"We have been wanting to buy this doll for our granddaughter for a year now, so we finally decided to get it for her for Christmas. She's 3 years old now and although she drags Amanda everywhere she goes, she doesn't really enjoy the constant requests made by the doll to feed her, play with her and put her on her potty. I myself was amazed at how much this doll could do, but unless you have a child that is TOTALLY a \\"mommy\\" type that needs to be needed, this doll will annoy her. She's as cute as could be with skin that feels very realistic, but I think for our granddaughter, she'd be happier if Amanda was a mute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Bad Review!","review":"I purchased this doll for my 6 year old's birthday.

Also, she did not recognize my daughter - EVER, and the batteries went dead VERY quickly - within the first two days. We exchanged her for a new doll thinking we had a lemon, however, the new doll is doing the very same thing. I plan to return her soon. My daughter is very frustrated with her. The only time she's really been able to play with her was after the LONG set up on the first day. Not at all worth $100, maybe $10!

My daughter is 8 yrs old and speaks very clearly.It got to be so ANNOYING that my daughter simply refuses to play with it.So, this $100 doll has made an incredible dent in my daughters savings and taken the word \\"frustration\\" to a new level!DON'T BUY THIS DOLL, BIG WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!Coleen"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This!!!","review":"This was the worst gift for my 5 (almost 6) daughter. We bought it for her for Christmas and she was SO excited. I read other reviews that said that the children need to be able to speak well. My daughter talked early and speaks very well so I thought it would be great. It's supposed to recognize her voice, but never does. It says \\"you don't sound like Mommy\\" and says \\"let's play until Mommy gets home\\" and my daughter says that Mommy is holding you!!!

I still wouldn't recommend buying her - it's not worth the money and the frustration!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointment Doll","review":"I'm sorry to say that Amanda did not go over well with my daughter for Christmas. I wished I had read the reviews before I ordered it instead of after because the negative ones are spot on. My daughter turned it off the first day because it was so annoying and when you turn it back on you have got to reset everything which is also very annoying. I've asked her repeatedly if she wants to play with it and she doesn't even want it in her room. She is five and loves to play with her baby dolls, so maybe when she is older she will like it better. If I had to pin it down I'd say it was because Amanda is not a happy doll - it is very needy and the voice is whiney - not the kind of toy that invites play - they need to program it to be more loving and pleasant with a more pleasing voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing Amanda was not so amazing","review":"Amanda was purchased for my 4 year old. The doll was annoying. We set her up as instructed. The voice recognization feature is poor to say the least.

I left messages and never received a call back.After changing the batteries 3 times and re-programming the doll 3 times my daughter lost interest and said she didn't want to play with her any more.

So, I reset the doll, in a quiet room and read all the instructions but we still have issues with recognizing my daughters voice. I find her to be creepy and my daughter wants her to go away. I am surprised other parents find their children like her but I think more dont like her. We will return her to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bossy piece of junk Amanda is more like it!","review":"My 6 year old daughter really wanted this from Santa for Christmas, and against my better judgement I bought it. We programmed it over & over & it had a hard time recognizing my daughter's voice unless she literally yelled at it. She got so sick of it after a few days that she asked if she could take it to a friend's house & LEAVE IT THERE.As others have stated, her lips & eyebrows have rubbed off after minimal use.The main problem I have with the doll is that is it so bossy. It doesn't even give kids the time to have creative playtime, it just keeps teling them what to do. If the manufacturer really wanted to make a creative toy, they would make one that responded to the child, not the other way around!Save your $$$ and buy a American Girl doll or similar & your daughter will be MUCH MUCH happier!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for the Reviews","review":"I've been looking at this doll for a couple years wanting to buy it for my daughter but it's just so expensive.

I had to take the knife apart, use JB Weld on all the pieces, and let it set up before I was able to carry it.

Because she is Dunstan's employer and is accepted in society, Leila often has the upper hand. But Dunstan's acceptance and encouragement of her Malcolm gifts frees Leila to be the woman she desires to be.Leila can be a bit manipulative, but she has used her looks, her social skills, and, at times unwittingly, her magical abilities to secure her acceptance in society and eventually to aid Dunstan. He, on the other hand, comes across as gruff and unsociable, but his heart is sensitive and noble. The inner people are much better matched than the outer ones. The mystery of his wife's murder is kept at an interesting level and does not overshadow the romance.

She wasn't his responsibility--that is, until both his conscience & his lust were aroused.Half-human, half-vampire, Nicole's the first hybrid of her kind. The evil Bianca & the sly Gerard are both curious & devious enough to see which half will triumph as they initiate this fledgling into their vampiric world--to further their own agenda.For other vampire romance fanatics, I recommend Linda Lael Miller's \\"For All Eternity;\\" Jasmine Cresswell's \\"Prince of the Night;\\" Maggie Shayne's \\"Twilight\\" Series; Susan Krinard, & Amanda Ashley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampire novel set in Revolutionary France","review":"This seems to be the novel before Midnight Gamble. Nicole Radoux is the daughter of a vampire and a mortal. When she finds out about her father, she runs away to Paris, only to discover that she is more like him than she thought. She is taken in by Marchand Valois and his brother and finds herself in love with him. She also runs into some old \\"friends\\" of her father's, Bianca, the evil vampire who changed him and Gerardo, a puzzling mix of friend and enemy. Nicole needs to find out how to control her nature and they offer to teach her. But does Bianca want to help Nicole or destroy her father. Nicole also might not be able to save her mortal friends from the immortal ones.This is an enjoyable escape type of book. The setting is very good for the type of novel and the characters very vivid. An entertaining and fast read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Functionally, not that great","review":"Unfortunately, this game is not one for a board game enthusiast. The very fact that my friends and I have watched Simpsons ad nauseum since 1989 makes this game even less fun. I can only play this game with a close circle of a couple people since occational viewers immediately feel intimidated--not by me, but rather by the fan-oriented questions. Like other reviewers stated, this game works best simply as trivia cards to read through with other fans.If you are looking for fun classic games like \\"Scrabble\\" and \\"Monopoly\\" or new games like \\"Wise and Otherwise\\" are a much more reliable source. This game has too small of a target audience to have wide appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"simpsons trivia","review":"I think that this is a fun game for real simpsons fan like myself. Some questions are hard some are easy. This is a sort of game for a rainy day and it will keep you bizzy for a while.

Hope you all enjoy this game if you get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WARNING!!

Now I have to pay shipping a second time to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Fun Than a Barrel of Homers","review":"Three otherwise serious-minded grownups were reduced to helpless giggles by this game. We all agree that the Simpsons is the greatest animated TV show of all time. On a Geek Scale of one to ten with one being the lowest and ten being the highest, our cumulative Geek score is 29. So we had a blast with this. A couple of things: while the tin is a good, sturdy holder for the game pieces, the cast poster and the number key are flimsy and are going to wear out in no time. I'm taking them to the print shop to get them laminated, and I would recommend to anyone else that they do the same. Also, it is a major pain that this product can't be shipped out of the US. I have a relative living in the US, so I shipped the parcel to them.... Simpsons fans shouldn't have to work this hard to get their hands on a fifteen dollar toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A COLLECTOR'S ITEM","review":"I purchased this for a young Simpsons fan, and this game provided hours of fun trivia. Some of the questions are quite simple, but there are many others that you need to ponder carefully in order to arrive at an answer. If you wish, this also makes a fabulous collector's item, due to the fact that it comes in a tin which is beautifully decorated with those wacky Simpsons stars. Entertaining fun for basically any age, and you may be surprised to learn some interesting facts about the show when playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for all you Simpson Fans...","review":"My brother and I have been Simpson's fans for as long as we both can remember. Our obsession started when it became the first show we were aloud to stay up past bedtime to watch. Since then, it has become that thing we go around quoting to drive are less Simpson obsessed family crazy with. When I found this game, I thought it would be perfect for us. The game is played using trivia cards, and the first person to collect three character cards is named the winner. There are five different levels of difficulty, making it enjoyable for almost anybody. The only thing I didn't like about it was the difficulty level between the cards. Playing at level 3 was to easy for me, while moving to 4 was near impossible. Still, this is a must own for any Simpson fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sounding bass strings","review":"I've tried many types of strings over the years and am totally loyal to GHS Bass Boomers.

I normally don't write reviews; and I order a lot from Amazon. The Trudeau is not worth the extra money. There is hardly any mist, just a stream, and that is when it wants to work.

So just wipe the exterior witha paper towel. Since it seems I have to do this type of wiping with several products, I don't find this to bean issue. Also, have found that it is important to release the pressure after use before storing.Seems to give a better spray for the next time after the normal pumping process."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far So Good!","review":"Had a Misto, it NEVER worked properly. Believe me, I followed the instructions to a \\"T\\". The Misto streamed instead of sprayed and would occasionally leak out air. Despite the reviews of this product I figured I would give it a try.

Includes activities that can be completed in one day, and activities that involve observation over a time span of days or weeks. There is an elementary school edition for younger children. I wish it were still offered in the original spiral binding, though.High quality addition to traditional science curriculum or good as a stand-alone special course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to do forensic science labs","review":"This book has a lot great activities in it. The title says for grades 6-12, but I would say most of the activities are appropriate for 6-8 as is. You can definitley modify them and build upon them to make them suitable for grades 9-12. Would recommend to anyone who teaches forensic science or is looking for a way to incorporate forensic science into other science subjects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Use","review":"I teach a ton of forensics in my high school science classes and wasn't sure if this book would provide me with new ideas, but it did.

Hardie Newton has written a celebration of the seasons, of our senses (if we unclutter them), and the natural beauty all around us. It's a lyrical trip through the countryside of my college youth, a gardner's manual, an arranger's inspiration, a recipe book, a medicine chest and a philosophic guide.

We will definitely purchase more of this line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be put off by the cover","review":"I bought this book because it is the only history of The Drifters. I thought it would be some quicky PR booklet. It is far more. There was obviously not enough about The Drifters to make a whole book so the author pads it by giving an EXCELLENT history of Doo Wop from its origins in gospel to its many transitions in the 1950's and 1960's. It is a very, very well-written and insightful book. The photos are also first rate. This book delivers far more than I had anticipated. Keep in mind that it was written in 1972 so has nothing about the various Doop Wop revivals led by Sh Na Na and PBS."},{"rating":"1","title":"too small","review":"This backpack is way too small, eventhough it says it's toddler size.

It is very readable, as are all books by the Coreys. It covers a wide range of topics and it uses case examples to illustrate the points. It isn't a counselling book in terms of having alot of exercises on questioning or empathy. It does discuss counselling skills, but it is more concerned with the worker's personal development, in terms of ethics, self-awareness, self-care, etc. The suggested activities at the end of the chapter really help the learning process. My only criticism of the book is that a few of the chapters are a tad long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review: \\"Becoming a Helper\\"","review":"This book does a nice job of describing the counseling field.

It even has a cap that goes over the keyway to protect it from weather. Unfortunately, this item is incompatible with my Pullrite Superglide hitch. The diameter of the shank is fine, but the compartment which houses the lock assembly is too thick to slide between the shank and the bed rail. If the shank were 1\\" longer, it would have extended far enough where this wouldn't have been an issue.

I bought Robotor for my son. When we took it out of the package, it was already broken. The metal domes are held in place by plastic ridges that the dome is snapped onto (no glue). The plastic ridges for one of the domes were broken off, and it was unfixable. We took it back to the store and exchanged it. This one was fine coming out of the package, but in less than a day one of the domes came off. There was enough plastic left that we were able to superglue the dome into place. By the next day, another dome had come off. I think we can fix this one also, but we shouldn't have to fix it AT ALL. My son is not rough with his toys--he simply has been playing with it in a normal way."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!!","review":"No way to play with it. You can put it together sitting on a surface that can support it. Once you go to pick it up, even gently, it falls apart. VERY disappointing buy. My son got 2 for Christmas. I personally suggested them, but I never will again. Nice concept, but terrible design."},{"rating":"1","title":"neat idea, but doesn't work","review":"I bought these for my son at Christmas and we're taking them back because they do not stay together. The magnets are not strong enough to hold the limbs on and so when you hold upright, it falls apart. We tried two figures, same scenario. My son loves Magnetix, but these were disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best tape for dressings","review":"We need tape for challenging applications (applying dressings to all parts of hands, and occasionally other parts of limbs). We've tried about everything on the market, and this is the best by far. It bonds to itself so that multiple layers creates an extremely strong bandage, even though a single layer can be torn like thin paper (so it's very easy to tear off strips for application). Perhaps most importantly, it breathes far better than any other type of bandaging tape, so if skin breakdown is a major concern, there is nothing that comes even close to this. You do need to be sure the skin is clean and dry before applying, otherwise it won't stick. The 1\\" width is a very good all-purpose size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap foam, did not help","review":"These toe separators do not have any support or stability.

Luckily, almost everything that you as a 3rd year medical student ought to know about surgery is in this book, in a concise and enjoyable format. Carry it with you, read it every chance you get, especially the couple of pages relevant to your patient's case before you scrub in. If you master this book, particularly the 300 pages or so on general (as opposed to specialty) surgery, you will be well prepared for the National Board and any oral exam you school may have you take. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent book","review":"It's nice and concise, but not comprehensive by any means. I would suggest the Niederhuber textbook on general surgery (it's much easier reading than the Lawrence book, in my opinion, but a bit longer) and then use this as a pocket reference, especially if you need to find just a line on something fast. Nice section on practical stuff, e.g., the various retractors, sutures, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for Surgical Clerkship","review":"This book is awesome. It is clear and concise and covers about every need to know tidbit for a student doing surgery. I can all but assure you that you will be asked some of the very same questions worded the EXACT same way by your attendings and residents. Everyone gets it and everyone carries it like a bible for the 6-12+weeks you are on surgery. Covers all subspecialties as well. Perfect for the clerkship. However, do not use it as your only source for the Shelf exam as there is quite a bit of general medicine and management not covered in recall."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Strength of the Human Spirit","review":"If you liked the book Tuesdays with Morrie, you will love The Wisdom of Life Through My Patients by Thomas P. Waldinger. This uplifting reflection documents the strength, determination and enlightenment learned by Waldinger's patients through a variety of challenging life experiences. The individual vignettes, presented in an easy to read chapter style format, are heartwarming and sensitive. They give the reader a glimpse of the inner strength of the human spirit and what odds we often overcome through that fortitude. The stories also demonstrate how sometimes even the smallest event can impact our lives and philosophies and add dimension to our perspective.

This is a good thing. I loved the wit of the Detective, the mysterious elements of the Santeria religion, and the graphic scenes of death. People are disemboweled, heads are cut off, and other tasy scenarios unfold throughout the book. The writing is by no means intelligent, but that's probably why it appealed to simple little me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite suspense book","review":"I was really suprised at how much enjoyment I got from this book. The lead character, Detective Decker, had me rolling with laughter at some points with his witty dialouge and the gore factor was pretty high in this book. The way the mysterious killer deals with his victims is pretty gut-wrenching (you'll get this pun once you read the book). I also liked the fact that it involved a theme I haven't had very much experience reading about, in this case it's Santeria, a magic much more powerful than voodoo but similar.This book is definitely not a classic piece of literature by any means but if you like suspense and you like it gory with a dab of humour, then this is the book for you. I recommend it for a quick read (I read this in one sitting, it's only 350 pages and the font and type are a respectable size) and I think you'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy, Addictive, and Heart-pounding","review":"The Devil in Gray is a nice change from novels I've been mucking through recently. Concentrating on the old religion, Santeria, and adding some modern day twists, it works on multiple levels. One thing that really worked for the novel was the characterization; lead detective Decker had me laughing aloud more than once. The gore and violence were not censored in the least; I cringed in more than one scene as a victim was offed in horrendous fashions. Masterton's writing style is exceptional, the pace begins with violence and ends with it, and there's a mystery in there to boot - one not easy to figure out.Give this one a try; I was glad I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda boring","review":"Not the best mix.

It sounds like their source recording was a worn out copy of the LP, played it with a bad stylus.Seriously, it's embarrassing that Amazon would charge $8.99 for this, apparently without exerting any quality control. Next time, have a qualified engineer listen to the tracks before you put them up for sale.

A MUST HAVE FOR PENDULUM STUDY & WORK!","review":"Out of all my pendulum books this is gonna be my favorite! I think their introduction said it best. \\"This book supplies practical material that makes working with the pendulum easier. The instructions are brief and to the point. Instead of long-winded explanations, you'll get precise visual commentaries. It's not the purpose of this book to enter deeply into the philosophy of swinging the pendulum, nor to explore the energies that are behind it. But, of course, that doesn't mean that you couldn't benefit from researching that in other pendulum books.\\" It is all that and more! The best charts I've ever seen in a pendulum book! The overall design of the charts are visually inspiring and beautiful! My only small complaint is I wish when these designers design pendulum books with charts they would plan to make them spiral bound so they lay flat. Other than that miniscule problem... I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!! YOU'RE GONNA LOVE WORKING WITH IT!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting... but awful","review":"I found this LP in a cut-out bin at the local record store about 20 years ago, and since I was a fan of Emmylou's music, I bought it. Her singing wasn't very good at this point (very pitchy) and it is sort of amateurish. I later read a news article that she had sued the company or person who owned the rights to this record to prevent it from being re-released after she had success with her first several albums. It's more of a novelty in my opinion. Not a good performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely Illustrated Judo Text","review":"I bought this book after having read Kodokan Judo by Jigoro Kano, Textbook of Judo by Nagayasu Ogasawara and Best Judo by Isao Inokuma and Nobuyuki Sato. If I were starting Judo from scratch again, I think Judo Unleashed by Neil Ohlenkamp would be a great book to start with becuase it is so clearly illustrated (color with tori and uki in blue and white gi), it gives a nice history of the art and it provides a very well-done explanation of Judo Philosophy on and off the mat. The appendices are well-organized and there is a great explanation of tournament rules.

They were pretty, their arms and legs moved, and the little clothes were \\"oh so adorable\\". Two weeks later they were naked kitties, and it's not just the fact that my child didn't have the dexterity required to put the clothes back on, she had loved them, and played them so much the short velveteen type fur had all rubbed off, and they became naked plastic as well. They got dirty easily, the clothing was all lost very quickly, and they became quite ugly. About two months after she received them, my daughter sent the cat family permanently to the toy tote where they stayed for a very long time without being played with.These would be super for a child around the age of nine, who can get their clothes on and off without mommy help, and will display them more than play with them. They need a child who will not love them to death in as short a time as my six year old did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tin-Can, loose change, tinny jangle","review":"Speakers for guitar amps are a very subjective subject, and one mans \\"sparkle\\" and \\"shimmering highs\\" can be another mans \\"shrill\\". But based on trying this speaker in a Fender Blues Jr, I found it to be entirely too shrill. I'm talking tin can, ice picky, solid-state sounding, loose change on a concrete floor, tinnitus iducing 'brightness'. Even if you like British-style jangle in your guitar tone, be advised that the highs this speaker produces can be downright unbearably bright. For a more balanced speaker with good high end, I recommend the Eminence \\"Cannbus Rex\\" or the \\"Red, White, and Blues\\" for a little extra top end. Do yourself a favor and avoid this junkyard tin can speaker. Your ears will thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and inspiring.","review":"I have listened to this record since I was a child.

As a almost life long user of SONY premium grade tapes, I have begun to notice a sharp drop in the picture and sound quality I get when I record, even off my dish. The picture is never up to snuff with what I see when I watch the show as it is being recorded. For the past two years, I have been able to notice the differences when I am watching something on a SONY tape, the flaws have become to big to ignore. I will be buying TDK from now on, and I suggest you do the same. SONY used to make a great VHS tape, but I guess they are concentrating now on making more Playstations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinker","review":"This review is appearing on two films by the same name. What's up with that, Amazon? Any who, this applies to the story about the female cop hunting a vampire. Not good. Bad acting. It's from 1992 but there is sexual harassment, smoking in the office and old-fashioned typewriters -- in '92? There is a ridiculous montage of the lead character training for the plum assignment of catching the serial killer but she's already a cop so why isn't she in tip-top shape? She also isn't very attractive. The one thing they did get right was making the vampire a villain, at times handsome, at times ugly but always menacing and looking for his next meal."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring sea adventure.","review":"Based on a novel by the team of Nordhoff and Hall, this dreary film was an obvious attempt to duplicate the success of MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, also based on a novel by the same duo.

Unfortunately, the resulting film is very dull and is only partly redeemed by good performances, but even James Mason cannot quite save it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uk Buyer","review":"Arrived in good time, in condition as stated, many thanks.

And some more complain. That book is too thick. It was very uncomfortable to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another underwhelming re-release","review":"\\"Fallen Angels\\" is a re-release of a collection of previously published stories. In a nutshell, they are three erotically charged short stories all dealing with private detectives and the misunderstood women they rescue, each with requisite wimpy heroines who let their alpha males walk all over them before finding their eventual happily ever after. Mostly, there are just long sexual passages with a little bit of a barely recognizable plot tossed in.They weren't great the first time, and certainly not worthy of a second press. I keep hoping that the Foster that beguiled me with \\"Unexpected\\" will capture my attention again. She came close with \\"Havoc,\\" but for the most part, it's been one disappointment after another, and no longer an auto-purchase author for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should be recalled. Click. Click. Click. Click...","review":"I searched for this unit on Amazon to see what other owners had to say about it. I was shocked to see the same exact problems.I too had major clicking noises (that can only be explained by hearing) and locking up, etc. I luckily was within the year warranty (by a week!) and had it fixed. But certainly, this unit is something to pass on.I wanted a larger variety in random play other than 5, but not as obnoxious as 100+. So I felt 25 was just right. But the annoyance of waiting for it to process it's thoughts and getting to the next cd.. or just plain stopping to change one cd is unacceptable. With so many of the same problems, these units should be replaced.Attention Pioneer Company: Feel free to contact me to offer me a newer improved model. Otherwise, I am off to any other brand but Pioneer for any product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth every of your buck when it works.","review":"I got this player half year ago, and actually have been using it for 3 months. I applauded for its oustanding price/feature ratio until recently it broke down. Its mechanical moving part, including laser head and CD spinner, frequently locked itself, generating huge \\"click\\" sound. If it's lucky starting playing a CD, everything is okay. But when it moves from one CD to another, in random or sequencial order, the moving part gets stuck forever. Yes, I bought it at a very sweet price, as long as it still worked. To me, the moving mechanism inside is kinda fragile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look at Something Else","review":"You can't change cd's while playing one. After about a year mine started having mechanical problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money.","review":"Well, I just read the other reviews and I can agree with some things, but not others. For example, I've had mine running for hours at a time and haven't had the slightest problem. Maybe that's just his. I think the sound is great and so are the features. The only problem I've had is that if there is even the slightest scratch on a disc, it sometimes has a hard time reading it. On the other hand, a disc can have a big scratch on it and it reads it just fine. Go figure. Anyway, now that the price has gone down on these cd-jukeboxes, I'll probably get Pioneer's 101 disc player to replace my 25, seeing as it's <...> less than the price I originally paid for the 25 a few years ago. In conclusion, this is a good player with a good price and I'm sure the amount of \\"lemons\\" are few."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy Pioneer's CD-Changers","review":"I would NOT recommend any of Pioneer's CD-changers...

I bought it in June 1999."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails to change disks","review":"I was never really happy with this changer due to the noisy clicking sound it made when changing discs. Then, about a year after purchase, it stopped changing discs altogether.

I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teriible Quality CD Player","review":"This player is absolutely terrible. A few months before my warranty expired it stopped working. It would just get stuck. I get it fixed at an authorized service center and about 6 months later it doesn't go past disc number 8. Obviously by the reviews it seems that this is a lemon. [...] Bottom line, stay away from this product. Don't waste your money. I will be buying no more pioneer products in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not all bad","review":"I too would agree with some of the negative points, but not all. As with many products, people will write a negative review when something doesn't work right but when a product is fine they won't write a review at all. My unit was made in 1998. I bought it in a beat up condition for $20 from a pawn shop and as of April 26, 2011 it works as good as the day it was made. Since this product probably hasn't been available new for at least 10 years, I'm writing this review for people who today might buy the PD-F507 used but would be otherwise turned off by the bad reviews. Makes a great CD player for a second system or your garage stereo, or even a second CD player on your main system for shuffling 25 discs. Just be sure to test it first like I did if you find a used one. Incidentally, I bought the PD-F507 to replace my PD-F505 which one day decided to stop playing discs. As noted before, you can't add or take out discs when one is playing but with 25 in there who cares?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was fine til it stopped working","review":"I didn't have any clicking problems, but just before the year was up, it would just stop playing on random and sit at the first disk. I brought it to one place recommended by Pioneer and had to wait about two months to get it back. About six weeks later the same thing occurred, brought it to another fix-it shop and am told that there is nothing wrong with it. I just think it is not built well and will have intermittant problems until I buy a new and different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Click, click BOOM!","review":"I owned mine for about a year when it started making the clicking noise as the laser would get hung up as it changed disks.

Using a concise (very concise) review of selected ages, Mr. Miner simultaneously presents an image of the ideal \\"compleat gentleman\\" and lays out several broad avenues for further investigation should you care to take him on.

Don't pick it up if your morals are not Christian conservative, do yourself a favor and find another mentor.

The book starts out as a history of knights, chivalry and warriors? Then turns into a collection of Victorian quotes about man's role? And in the end it feels like a justification of the author's conservative beliefs? In any case this book is a mess! I had high hopes with chapter titles like \\"The Warrior\\", \\"The Lover\\", \\"The Monk\\". However these don't lead very far from small stories and mild rants on modern culture. Most disappointing is his justification of the Iraq war and his own navel gazing rationalization of his conscientious-objector status during the Vietnam war.

It's not. Not even close. I had to stop reading the introduction as it reads like some sort of angry scream that goes on far too long. Not to mention his glorification of Dick Cheney as a top military strategist. Seriously? I fought my way through the rest of the book but am still wondering why it's such a rag-tag disaster. The whole book is an angry mess. Please don't spend any money on it. Or if you have to have it you can buy my copy at a used book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turgid Prose and Poor Research","review":"As the author admits, this book started out as an essay. What he neglects to mention is that he converted it into a book, not by adding new material, but by repeating various combinations and permutations of the original material over and over again.In and off itself this would merely make the book boring. What makes it actively distasteful to me are the glaring historical inaccuracies. To name just three, he displays a minimal understanding of General Grant's tactical and strategic ability, he implies that Winston Churchill was responsible for the sinking of the Lusitania and he quotes a casualty figure of 100,000 for the bombing of Dresden. Any serious historian, or even anyone who followed the David Irving libel suit would know that the true figure was approximately 20,000.The author may well have a valid point in this book, but if so it is obscured by turgid prose and discredited by poor research."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"If you think the U.S. deserved the 911 attacks, this is the book for you.

Perhaps the most clarifying and precise is Carr's brief study of the effects on a populace when submerged in this type of warfare. What happens to a people when living in the Rape of Nanking?

It covers the very beginning of Bragi, Haroun, and El Murid. Normally, when I read series, I read them in order of their in-book chronology. But, in this case, since there's so much time between this prequel and the main trilogy, I'd say it's more fun to read the prequel afterward. Regardless of the reading order, this book is better written than any of the main trilogy: the pacing is better, the dialog is better, and there's less of the cornucopia of place names that the main trilogy throws at you.

It is then, that the desires of your heart to fulfil that word and bless God's people will go into action. Well this tape by Phophetess Bynum will definitely act as \\"mid-wife\\" to help you deliver your \\"baby\\" or that \\"Word. And trust me, after carrying that Word for a long time you will do anything to get it out, especially when you KNOW THE BLESSINGS IT WILL BRING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TRAVAIL","review":"I REALLY ENJOYED AND WAS INSPIRED BY THIS ALBUM JUANITA BYNUM IS TRULY AN ANNOINTED WOMAN OF GOD THIS ALBUM REALLY ENCOURAGED ME, BECAUSE I KNOW HOW IT FEELS TO BE PREGNANT WITH THE WORD OF GOD AND YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WANT TO EXPLODE.

The author has some interesting speculation but I believe his attempts to postulate a rational theory in the first Temple being in other then Jerusalem just falls flat.He spends more time on his own personal bio, and as this this book was released 8 years ago, he apparently could not find any more such proof to solidify his stand and update this book to current findings or research.

I thought he did a great job as well of illustrating how a country as free and democratic as Canada leans towards elements of ultrasecrecy for several of its governmental organizations including JTF2 where other governments openly discuss and brag about their Special Forces.

I was leary about spending that much money on such an object, especially since I have 2 Macintosh Towers,one with a DVD player, and a 3400c PowerBook that I can easely put a DVD player in. My mind was blown when I took it on a plane to Tucson, AZ. I watched 2 complete movies as the flight was 3.5 hr long. I find that it is better to use in bed at night, then the large TV's with the non-portable DVD players. I take some DVD's to bed with me so I can change disks, plus it seems more intimate that way, especially with adult disc's.

The picture is so good, you forget you are watching the movie on a small screen. It is a must have for all you technophiles and toy lovers. You will be the envy of all your fellow travellers with this machine.... The only things I wish could be changed on the machine are the sound and the lack of an adapter for the car and plane. The 3 hour battery is great, but what about for those longer trips? Not all of us can afford the Concorde to Europe and back. :) I was expecting better sound after reading how Panasonic went on about the superiority of it in the ad, but it just isnt so.

It seems that the novelty of portability cost 3 times that of a home unit --- IT SHOULDNT! Shoppers beware -- this pricing schema is still in its novelty phase in its growth cycle. Most people are being caught up on impulse shopping in regards to this product (i know i had my credit card pulled out until i read the users comments). It seems to be a great product (i would buy it for no more than $450) but if you are spending a 'grip' -- you should go with a computer.

The battery is about one third the size of the player itself which makes the DVD Player not as portable as I had hoped, but it's still better than a laptop!

This DVD is for us the FANS, this DVD much like the show is over the top, it allows the viewer to see many things one could not see at the show. This DVD also includes bonus featurs such as The documentary \\"Inside the Big top\\" which is about 30 minutes of backstage touring with none other than MIGHTY MIKE he does a great job of sharing the day to day activites with the viewer.

This disappointing book is a 15 short chapter breeze through a multitude of subjects, and does not linger long on any single subject.

Originally released in 1974, Paul Pena offers a nice wide-ranging mix of pop, rock, folk, and blues material. Highlights include: \\"Gonna Move,\\" \\"Jet Airliner,\\" \\"Venutian Lady,\\" and the title track, and I especially like the Jimi Hendrix influenced \\"Cosmic Mirror.\\" Paul Pena is a rich vocalist with a style that was a clear prototype for Lenny Kravitz. Though some may find a few of the tunes dated, I find them refreshing and reminiscent of a time when music was free from the contrived baggage so often found in modern pop music. This is one of those rare albums you will find to be a satisfying listen to from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"a recently unearthed gem from the early \`70s...","review":"This album is a recently unearthed gem from the early \`70s that got snagged up in some major record label red tape (ala Peter Wolf), and never saw the light of day. This blind soul rocker's sound shifts between Lenny Kravitz, Jimi Hendrix and Marvin Gaye. Jerry Garcia and Merle Saunders play pedal steel and keyboards giving two tracks a real Grateful Dead sound. Also, the Persuasions do harmonies on another track. And a real surprise to me is the original version of Jet Airliner is on here. I always thought that was a Steve Miller song, but Pena's keyboardist and producer was Ben Sidran who was also in Miller's band. So at least Pena has been able to eat all these years. Pena is a local guy from Cape Cod and today he is very ill.

But what many don't know is that Paul's extraordinary talents as a musician and songwriter have been recognized and honored by other musicians for many years; he's one of those rare guitarists who can play anything from classical flamenco to gut bucket blues, and his vocal range is just as impressive. This album, recorded but not released in 1973, showcases some of his many original songs, including the original version of \\"Jet Airliner\\". Even if you listen only to this one and \\"Cosmic Mirror\\", you'll get more than your money's worth with this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"UNBELIEVABLE","review":"It is really so sad to think that this album wasn't released in the early 70s when it should have been.

So I ordered more from Amazon, washed the area where it would stick, again, left it overnight to dry, and tried again. Same thing. Not good for sealing the gap left when using my slider with the doggie door.If you have the same problem, I purchased, after much trial and error, a garage door weather seal. It nailed on the end, rather than used a glue strip. It was much thicker, flexible and durable. IT solved my problem. This weather stripping was junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"have a large gap to fill, this does the trick. Sort of.","review":"We have a large gap in our back door. I tried going with the weather stripping from Home Depot, but it took tracks of it to fill the gap and then it was too much and made it hard to open and close the door.

He'd have replaced the old metal weatherstripping with new metal weatherstripping because it works best.This would work if I could actually get it to stick. It wouldn't work as well because it is really too narrow but it does have considerable spring.I know I won't be buying it again because after the first window which needed a new seal, I gave up on it.Yes, I cleaned with alcohol, sanded the rough spots or whatever, but it just wouldn't stick.Perhaps it would be better to install it on a hot summer day but that would make it difficult to tell if it were actually working.I tried installing it on a cool but not cold day and ... although the test closure showed that there wasn't much cold air infiltration, on the next open/close it simply buckled from lack of adhesive.I'm not sure why I gave it 2 stars, perhaps 1 star is sufficient."},{"rating":"2","title":"COBRA RECORDING IS ANOTHER GREAT CD.","review":"I LOVE THIS CD.

The back section was similarly challenging and strengthening. However, the rest of me felt short-changed (no leg kicks, double leg stretches, plank etc).

I was just playing with it with him yesterday. He has continued to play with it all the months he has had it. If you read my reviews, you know that I loathe battery, talking toys overall. This house allows him to make up any number of scenarios. I got him some of the little animal sets with it. And he loves those. The fact they are animals and not people has led him to call it an ark. He would play with it anyway, but he likes the \\"boy\\" connotation of animals. (He gets the boy thing from friends, not from me. And sigh, je is only three.)Sometimes he uses little plastic zoo animals to set up a zoo. The house just lends itself to any number of permutations, and I love sitting there and playing all the worlds he thinks up. Great gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really beautiful and mostly great quality","review":"We got a good deal on this as a Lightning Deal for Christmas, so that probably helps me love it more than if I had paid full price.I have been wanting to get my 8 year old daughter some sort of dollhouse for awhile. She loves Calico Critters, and the Nursery she received for her birthday last year was of good quality.I usually prefer wood over plastic, as it's more durable, but I am overall quite impressed with this Deluxe Village House.

When it arrived the cardboard backing on the bubble pack was oil soaked and you could see where about a 1/4\\" of oil was gone from the container.

Set in Buenos Aires, it stars British Colin Firth, whom everyone is seeing stars over due to the new Bridget Jones film, and American Hart Bochner, the definition of attractive leading man if there ever was one. We need more movies with Hart Bochner's face filling the screen! When he rescues the cat on the ledge, it is movie-making magic. Bochner is a mysterious character who shows up and is taken in by Firth. While the film's ending is quite unexpected and, frankly, a little on the weird side, the flow of this film is gorgeous, careening between humanistic character study and slightly gory crime scenes. At its core, it's about a male friendship between two men who are unstable in different ways -- fascinating to watch. Why more people haven't seen this movie, I have no idea ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly unsettling&#65533;","review":"When struggling Buenos Aires' art house owner Adrian (Colin Firth), is forced to take in a border, yuppie business man Jack Carney (Hart Bochner) agrees to share living quarters and expenses.That Jack is more than he seems at face, and that Adrian is even wierder than one might imagine gives this psychological study in character the foundation it needs to succeed. The film has a very eerie tone, unlike films made currently in the US, and is fraught throughout with political and sexual overtones left for the viewer's interpretation. Think La Ceremonie with male leads and an Argentinean backdrop, or better yet, Neil Simon's The Odd Couple twisted like a pretzel in this early David Koepp (Jurassic Park, Carlito's Way) script.Challenging viewing not for all tastes, a movie for repertory film, about repertory film, I like it immensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well past its prime","review":"After reading what would appear to be hyped-up reviews I decided to purchase this DVD. I took into account when it was made so I expected one or two shortcomings however I have to admit to still being disappointed.

While this is a shame it just goes to prove how far the cinema has advanced and how much more we expect both visually and in the in-depth acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARE YOU KIDDING ME!","review":"Ok the other night I watched this movie with a friend, after viewing what I would say was the WORST 2 hours of my life I decided to come on here and see what other awful things people were saying.

If anyone ever tells you they liked this movie chances are they were A) In the movie B) Had something to do with the movie or C) Getting paid to write these LIES!!! LIES!!! I tell you.

I'm 5'11\\" and usually wear a 36\\" waist 32\\" inseam. Based on the other reviews, I decided to go with a Large. Unfortunately they were still too big. The waist was ok, but I definitely had to tighten it. The length was ridiculous. They have cinchers at the bottom of the legs to tighten the cuffs, but that makes them look like MC Hammer pants, which haven't been fashionable since 1990. The deal breaker for me, though, was that the right pocket had a hole in it. It appeared to have been a manufacturing defect, so I returned them to Amazon. If the fit would have been better, I probably would have just exchanged them, but since they fit so poorly, I wasn't willing to risk it and just got a refund instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing???","review":"I'm 6'6\\" tall with 36w 36l jeans size and i was hoping these could fit me nice since they come in tall size. I've ordered large tall and I was so disappointed when they came. They were the same length as the regular large size!!! They were nowhere close to other pants I have in large tall size. Adidas should start making pants that could fit tall people. Sometimes it's so frustrating because it's so hard, almost impossible to find pants that can fit you nicely. The only plus is that returning of these pants was so easy, within couple of days the money had been returned to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable.","review":"I bought these as a gift for my husband.

It took me a few times to get the hang of all the steps, but now I feel like I know it by heart. As other reviewers have noted, there are a few times where Karen starts a step before she cues the viewer in, but after just a couple times of doing this workout, you get the hang of it.Personally, I'm not as crazy about the weight segments. The great thing about this DVD, though, is you can select which segments to do. I usually just do the three cardio circuits in a row and then do my own free weights. I also own Elle MacPherson's \\"Your Personal Best\\" video which features Karen. I'm familiar with her style of exercises and enjoy her coaching and fun, upbeat workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Aerobic and Overall Body Workout","review":"This is by far the best aerobic and total body workout tape I've used. And I was an aerobics instructor for 6+ years and taught personal training at Nautilus Fitness Centers for several years. I would highly recommend this video for someone who likes to work out HARD and really work up a sweat to the point their calves are soaked by the end of the video. Really excellent video - but not one you should do every day because your joints will feel it which is not good. I would suggest every other day or 3 times a week as being sufficient to stay in good shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first Karen Voight work out that I really hated","review":"I've always considered myself to be one of Karen Voight's biggest fans but I really hated this DVD. The steps were too tricky and done too quickly.

I'd be in better shape if I had been doing the workout regularly.One thing I don't like about this workout is that it asks for 2 different sets of hand weights: a light set and a heavy set. A light pair of dumbells was sufficient for me.Although the themed sections provide variety, some of the moves required too many reps, causing me to lose interest at some points. Perhaps it's just my cheap equipment or lack of coordination, but I also felt as though some of the moves were dangerous. I have almost slipped off of, or missed the platform many times.Other than suggesting less equipment, making some of the moves safer, and including more stretches in the cool down, there is nothing I would really change about this complete cardio/toning workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"ultimate Step Circuit - Karen Voight","review":"Eight weeks ago I was an absolutely beginner for step but with Karen Voight energy I have learned and improved a lot.

I've been getting DVDs and VHS for years, as I would rather exercise at home then spend time getting to a from the gym. I've seen some with poor cueing, and others I do long enough that it's time to move on to something new. I'm not sure how to pinpoint or put words to my impression of this, but Karen seemed very unreal, and I want something more down to earth. I like seeing strong women that I would like to be more like, and while the guy and gal in the back were fine, Karen was just too annoying up front."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this video","review":"I did not have a step but i thought it would be ok, its not.

For reference, by the time I wake up in the morning, the ice is melted, but the water is still slightly cooler than room temp.

I will see if I have anything else it will fit on, but I am disappointed that this vendor requires the restocking fee which just seems ridiculous for such a small product. also, since this shows up as a \\"related product\\" for the CamelBak .4 liter kids bottle, I just wanted to make sure others didn't make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the Job!","review":"I bought this item and the Built NY Thirsty Tote, Dot No. 7 for the 218 ounce Kleen Kanteens we have.

In the limited experience I had with it, it kept my daughter's sippy cup from getting hot, but I cannot say it kept it cold or even cool. What really frustrated me about this purchase was the lack of customer service of the seller, The Baby's Gallerie. When I contacted them about getting a replacement, I was advised I had to cut off and mail the defective part at my expense. I was also really unimpressed with the Seller's tone in their response to me when I made alternate suggestions for proving the defect, such as an emailed picture that showed the defect.

After reading Ed Roman's book I found myself come upto speed with EJB and in only a couple of days I was writing and deploying my first entity beans. The author does a marvellous job of presenting the material in the book. The text is plain, straightforward and unambiguous, concise yet exhaustive and is written keeping both the practical and thoretical aspects of transactional programming in mind. So if you are looking for a book which presents both the nitty gritty details of this potentially complicated topic along with providing a hands down programming approach, then look no further. It's really hard to write books like these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look out!","review":"I don't get how this book only got extraordinary reviews. At the very first example when the reader has to deploy its very first bean, it goes \\"Well, now it's time for you to check your container documentation to know how to do this...hopefully someday we will have great ides that will sove this for us\\" Thanks a lot! It doesn't even mention how to generate stubs and skeletons and besides that, it suggests you to go look in some messy documentation to learn how to do it. By the way, the book comes with weblogic apllication server, so nothing more logical than using it to illustrate the examples don't you think? What's the point in writting a book and tell people to look in the documentation ? I had to go to the developer's connection to get this info.

All the contents on that issue look like Sun commericials. It seems that the book was not written for programmers, who won't take anything for granted.

I could barely pay attention to what I was reading through the first three chapters, and it was quite confusing to me. I stopped using the book because it was so frustrating. I had to return the book because I simply didn't have the resources. I downloaded the software that the book suggested, but there is no troubleshooting at all in the book, and though I followed every help guide I could find on the internet, I still could not manage to start up an EJB server. This was on my personal computer though. Also this book offered no help on usage of deployment tools that had to be used to deploy the ejb's, all it said was that you had to use one supplied by the vendor to deploy them. For me, I felt this book was quite inadequate."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can not finish this book!","review":"This book is full of duplicate contents. For instance, you can find the definitions of entity bean and session bean more than ten times and they are almost same contexts.

That leaves the iron unusable because the handle is too hot to use without it. Another problem is that the irons are so slow heating up. I definitely do not recommend these irons. I was going to only give 1 star, but after they finally heat up and before they break, they are nice irons."},{"rating":"2","title":"No es pop, no es balada, es Sanz.","review":"Alejandro Sanz vuelve con su album ganador de 4 premios Grammy's (tenia 5 nominaciones, de todos modos fue el que mas gano) la ultima vez que escuchamos el corazon partio que parece murio y el alma se elevo y se fue en el aire donde todos la pueden escuchar, lo mejor de Sanz es que nunca te cansas de sus canciones, puedes escucharlas miles y miles de veces y nunca se vuelven viejas, es el unico cantante que ha podido hacer eso, ya que lo que el nos transmite no son canciones asi de la nada, son pedacitos de su alma que el comparte con nosotros dejandola desnuda, al aire. -- Comprate el Unplugged."},{"rating":"2","title":"El Alma al aire","review":"I am a fan of Alejandro Sanz since 1995 and I have listened to all his albums. I think the best one is Alejandro Sanz 3 because in that record you can really notice Alejandro's soul through the songs, it presents a peerless singer. but El Alma al Aire changes that style and shows a more common singer,his music is good but is not as especial and unique as in his former albums. The new songs do not make me feel as in a roller coaster.

Alejandro Sanz is SPANISH...not Mexican. His passion, his phrasing, are different yes...but wonderful in their own sense. Forget everything you expect from Latin music, and listen to this guy all by himself. He GIVES everything he has, in each song. And his delivery can tear your heart in pieces. This CD belongs in any collection that already holds Luis Miguel, Alejandro Fernandez and Marco Antonio Solis. Alejandro Sanz is a WINNER!! Listen, learn, and enjoy!! This guy is GREAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Spanish pop","review":"Alejandro Sanz is one of the most distinctive voices in contemporary Latin music. He is as much a poet and performance artist as he is a singer, and his dramatic style of singing is evident on this CD, \\"El Alma al Aire.\\" The CD starts off with a more serious-sounding performance on \\"Cuando nadie me va,\\" and then takes a more exuberant turn on the next song, \\"Hay un universo....\\" Most of the songs have a mellow quality, with an occasionally ethereal sound. The title song makes effective use of a female (or is it falsetto?) chorus and horn section. Overall, this is not Sanz's best CD; I think he has done stronger work on \\"Mas\\" and on \\"Alejandro Sanz 3.\\" But \\"El Alma el Aire\\" is still a strong CD of Spanish-language pop music."},{"rating":"2","title":"POR FIN LLEGO EL NUEVO CD","review":"Alejandro Sanz es uno de los mejores de los cantantes latina, Escuchando las temas de Alejandro sanz, te hace pensar mucho de las cosas de la vida, de tu novia o tu novio, Si te queres a tu novia o novio, sentate con esa persona especial y escuchar la musica de este Artista, Que sin no es el mejor esta ahi arriba con los mejores.

There's absolutely nothing with the heat of \\"Corazon Partio\\" on this self-indulgent effort. On the upside, \\"Cuando Nadie Me Ve\\" is a pleasant ballad, and \\"Quisiera Ser\\" is energetic in a Luismi sort of way. \\"Tiene Que Ser Pecado\\" is a spicy jazz number that's also worth a listen, at least until the inexplicable mountain of backing vocals greets you on the chorus. Overproducing a perfectly good song? Now that's a sin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious plot, rushed ending","review":"While this is an easy read, a good \\"beach book,\\" it had several problems. One is that instead of foreshadowing, the author practically boinks you on the head -- so many of the events \\"revealed\\" at towards the end were obvious from the very beginning. Additionally, the ending was rushed. After setting the scene for a custody battle, and allowing the reader to see various scenes leading up to it [e.g., the Guardian ad Litem's meetings with multiple characters], we get none of the actual custody trial. Finally, the problems of certain characters just seem to disappear by the ending, with no explanation on if they dealt with them or how, and how they adjusted to the ruling in the custody case.

Everyone knows everyone else and is tied in to someone who's related to this other character who is the first one's... you get the point I'm sure. It's a blurry line where it comes from \\"What a twist!\\" to \\"Ok, now what?\\"It's not a bad read, necessarily. It was engrossing, and decently written...

Then it uses highbrow words while trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator, sometimes leaving the reader wondering WHAT their actual joke/point was.

I've a feeling it isn't the creative abilities of the writers as much as the nervousness of producers worrying about catering to a greater than 13 year old mentality that keeps plots so predictable and much of the acting and dialog so brainless.OK, I'll admit that I'm coming back to these shows after having been brainwashed by Inspector Morse and Midsommer Murders but hey, I'm sure the Murder She Wrote budget trumped both of these series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murder She Wrote Season 1","review":"The disc set arrived in a very timely manner which was greatly appreciated.

It's nothing but degradation and humiliation for a character we don't even really know (What was Beauty like before she was struck by the curse?) And I was disappointed with what happened to Beauty. The ending was rather cliched and depressing, and the entire trilogy is just one big spankfest that according to the books are supposed to be for the good of these poor teenagers (some of who could apparently end up as slaves indefinitely, like poor Prince Roger).

I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they have read the other two books in the trilogy. Beauty and Tristan are kidnapped by a Sultan and his court, but the sexual games remain much the same with spanking as the primary focus of obedience and submission. The sex scenes remain repetitive and thus border on boring. Even after three books, Beauty remains very one dimensional, almost mentally retarded. There really is no plot, only situations for sexual encounters. The ending, where Beauty and Tristan are finally joined as husband and wife, King and Queen, is extremely weak and contrived. This series is the weakest product produced by Anne Rice. She should have trusted her characters to have some internal growth and change, some intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money!","review":"In a nut shell - the first 2 books, although written well, were a waste of time, redundant and actually boring and an extreme waste of money. I haven't bought the 3rd book yet, thinking if its anything like the first 2 I would not want to read it, but the other reviews of the 3rd book may convince me - I'm still undecided. 50 Shades of Grey, even though poorly written, I think is still a better read than these books. There is such a thing as going too far with erotica, that it actually turns one off, and Anne Rice's first 2 books in this series did that for me. Extreme twisted sexual violence on minors is not very appealing if you ask me."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO FAR GONE!!","review":"I'm about 3/4 the way through and I have to say..not so good. It's too much. I wasn't sure there could be a too much, but this is it. I don't want to hear about young boys fondleing and flogging men..the world is too full of grown men wishing for things that aren't real and can't be real. Some things are better left to the individuals imagination. I'm not sure why these things turn this woman on and I frankly don't want to wonder those things when I'm reading a book for the type of pleasure I'm seeking.

Unfortantly, this storyline was sacrificed in order to end the book. Ms. Rice's abilities to provide period & emotional detail has and what continues to draw me to her writing.

The trilogy covers all elements of submission in erotic love, from the most brutal punishments to the most subtle domination......I would advise everyone to get the entire series and read the books in order. Wonderful pornographic writing. A real treat for fans of erotica.

When she's innocently involved in scandal, he sends her away to Mannerby and places her under the care of Paul Ransome and his sister Melissa, and it's a frying pan and fire move, as they seem to dislike her even more than her father and cousin do.In true gothic tradition, sinister things start happening, and Sarah Jane's only ally seems to be her maid.I've always liked gothics, even before I knew they were romances, but this one gets docked a star because I didn't get to see the relationship develop between the hero and heroine. Which was always typical of gothics, but I find I'm less tolerant than I used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Had I not read any other Sandra Heath books I would say give this author a miss. However, this is a first novel (or a rewrite of one) and, unlike her later work, there are problems.

I don't mean I was on the verge of suicide but I was just very gloomy. Then my english teacher told us we had to read a novel of our choosing and keep a journal on it. For some reason I choose this book. I had only read one of Camus's short stories: THE GUEST and that did not prepare me for the beauty of A HAPPY DEATH. I had never read anything of such raw unmitigated emotion! Camus tossed feelings around like jugglers do balls! When I had finished I felt at peace with myself for the first time in a year and a half. I urge everyone to read this book. Granted, there are structural problems but who cares!

I've read everything of his, starting with The Stranger and ending with A Happy Death. I must say that A Happy Death is my favorite. I (re-)read it several times a year.A Happy Death is the most beautifully written, in my opinion. Content aside, the language (albeit in translation) is gorgeous and incredibly evocative. I can't get over it.Content-wise, I felt that A Happy Death was much more human, we got to know Mersault much better. In The Stranger he is so cold, deliberately almost one-dimensional and I felt it was lovely to get to know a different side of him in A Happy Death. The language and descriptions are lush and vivid, the character has a lot more depth, and above all else, when I read it, I can clearly see why Camus vehemently denied being called an \\"existentialist\\". Some of the \\"existentialist\\" ideas certainly are present, but there seems to be such a different aesthetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant treatise on happiness and death","review":"Camus, the master wordsmith, stunningly leads us on one man's inescapable journey towards death.

Two weeks later they were naked bunnies, and it's not just the fact that my child didn't have the dexterity required to put the clothes back on, she had loved them, and played with them so much the short velveteen type fur had all rubbed off, and they became naked plastic as well. They got dirty easily, the clothing was all lost very quickly, and they became quite ugly. About two months after she received them, my daughter sent the bunny family permanently to the toy tote where they stayed for a very long time without being played with.These would be super for a child around the age of nine, who can get their clothes on and off without mommy help, and will display them more than play with them.

They show too how one fundamental theme, of the older generation's lament on what the younger generation is, runs through American history.

So much so, he has trouble remembering the most basic of details that are not related to his work.A fine perfomance by Jimmy and the entire cast, and the aircraft design is interesting to say the least.Marlene Dietrich does a turn in a supporting role, Glynis Johns plays an airline stewardess who looks after the eccentric Stewart, and Janette Scott is wonderful as Stewart's young, lonely daughter.Although the film was made under the auspices of 20th Century Fox, the film has the feel of an Ealing Studios production.It's a real treat for fans of the Ealing type of film, and in fact, a treat for anyone who likes good film."},{"rating":"2","title":"An underappreciated gem &#65533; with a perennial message!","review":"This work really deserves 3.5-4 stars, not just the meager 3 awarded it by the respected Martin & Porter. It is one of the better, more humanly and socially interesting, and philosophically more important of the 83 films in which Stewart acted, although its aeronautical engineering focus, and British understatement or civility, must understandably account for its neglect by the public and presumably by critics. Stewart's acting style or personality in this film was unusual even for him, or in the extreme to which it took one of his many canonical roles and manners, say that of a charming eccentric (but who in this case is also a brilliant scientist). The film is ultimately a celebration of conscience and integrity, differentiated from what at first appears to be merely idiosyncrasy or dangerous insanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done and entertaining, although science is a little shaky","review":"Stewart is an extremely humane actor and easy to identify with in virtually all his parts. As a scientist with less than sparkling social skills I was a bit self-conscious watching this film. But his warmth made it a comfortable self-consciousness. The daughter was too precious to be real; but likable nonetheless. Dietrich showed her range and skill beyond \\"stardom\\".

For example, the book states that Joan of Ark \\"heard voices in her head that helped her do battle and led her to victory.\\" Such a statement would lead one to believe that she was really schizophrenic and not a saint of the Church. There are simply too many examples of this kind of smug, retrospective arrogance towards Christians of the past to list in this review. In every chapter, Christians are painted as stupid, blood thirsty, narrow-minded, etc. Their anti-Church bias is just too blatant to overlook.One would be better off checking out Martha Stewart's kid magazine for craft ideas and pick up a less biased history book to read to children. Any Christian educator will want to avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun way to add to your history lessons","review":"One of our favorite Kaleidoscope Kids Books, Knights and Castles, doesn't contain a typical old timeline of random facts. In the chapter about medieval food, kids learn that during medieval times many yummy foods had not yet been \\"discovered\\" in North and South America. Or, as it is written in the book, \\"Poof, begone to cinnamon, ginger, tapioca, pepper, coriander, and curry, too. Those spices came from faraway places and were still unknown to most people.\\" The topic of food is easy for kids to understand and kids get this style of writing. Yes, secretly they are learning about how explorations in the New World changed food choices and lifestyles, but Kaleidoscope Kids Books don't make it sound as boring as all that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Christian Zealotry at its worst","review":"Apparently Christianity is at the root of all evil and the cause of most misfortune that occurred in the middle ages. If it weren't for those darned Christians, it seems the world would be a much better place. St. Frances of Assis was ok, (he loved animals), but all the rest of the Christians were closed-minded, violent and supersititous. I wasn't aware that the church wouldn't let people read because it might confuse them and that many people became monks because they didn't want to go to war.I wish I had read all the reviews before purchasing this item, and I have definitely learned my lesson. I would never allow my children to read this trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knights & Castles 50 Hands-On Activites to Experience the Middle Ages","review":"If you are willing to gather the materials, there are lots of project ideas in this book.

We have lost a great literary voice. How sad indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"There is no way to rate this book because it does not deserve to be rated.

Is he relying on his loyal, but dwindling readership to fund his retirement by hawking this minimal tale of a parallel universe? The concept is unoriginal, introduced by Jane Roberts so many years ago. However, in Bach's capable hands, it could have been so much more. This thin work displays little imagination; in fact, there's not much of a story here at all. This might have been acceptable if it were published in New Age Magazine or some other metaphysical periodical. It's certainly short enough. However making it into a book was a huge stretch. I felt duped after buying and reading this little hardback."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Introduction To Bach and his ideas","review":"I have never read Bach's works and this book gave me the oppotunity to learn what Bach is about. While I do wish he had gone into more character development, I understand why he had these limits. He discusses the imagination and obviously, this as insight into what he sees. I found this book thought prevoking instead of thought giving. He touched on areas and I put the book down to think about these areas in my own mind and life. I was not let down by this book and hope to read more of Bach's works. These works may show me more about him, but for mow, this book opened my mind and my world.

There has to be more to it? Was this just a tease? Chapter 1 of more to come? Richard, what are you doing? Is this part of a strategy? Needless to say, I was left wanting to read the rest of the book. The concept of \\"mind travel\\" was introduced in ONE.

Same ideas as his other books, only this time there was not a fun little story, absolutely no life in this re-hash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, disappointing","review":"Richard Bach was, for a long time, my favorite author by far. As the years have passed, his books have become more and more predictable, and less and less enthralling. I read Saunders Vixen in one sitting, and promptly returned it to the bookstore. There was nothing of real value in the book, just a dull story of an alternate universe. Sadly, the same old thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"I've been reading customer reviews.

I was delighted to find that he had written a new book, I even went out and purchased it. Being from Australia, it ended up costing me about $40. I should have saved my money. It seems to me that he got tired of the book halfway through and just stopped writing.

I've also gotten a few grease burns from this.Overall, I wouldn't order this product. My $20 set from target lasted almost 5 years and after a little over a year, I already want to replace this $80 set.

This is not hard core academia, this is a way to gather the majority of the stories from some major sagas in a pleasing form. This is much needed because the sagas themselves tend to be just chapters of a greater story, this book tries to put their tales in a storyline. Near the end of the book it gets a bit more into the theological and discusses (traditional thoughts on) the afterlife in detail. It is quite good and well worth having in your collection. Both for entertainment and understanding of traditional northern European beliefs and attitudes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does exactly as advertised.","review":"Very easy to install.

Don't let this site be the end all be all. Every item I buy anymore I research locally, other sites, and here before I make a decision. I will not overpay to amazon. I put it in my Maglite and it is definetely brighter, but not what I thought it would be. I compared it to the Krypton, and regular bulb I have for my maglite, and the LED with brand new energizers in the light, the LED is a whiter type of light, not a whole lot better though.

Not worth the money at this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mag Lite LED Upgrade 2C or 2D","review":"This light produces at least 2-3 times the output of the xenon type upgrade bulb.

No doubt, there are.So many of the characters (except for the Israelis)seem to revel in their cruelty, their deep-seated hatreds and their love of horror.

LOL Anyway most of you are familiar with these guys (except the one star people that most likely haven't even heard the cd) so i'll just say that the songs come across intense live, and the sound is killer!

Having not bought a Cannibal Corpse album without him as lead vocals. This album changed my views, Cannibal Corpse is as good with him as without him! \\"Corpsegrinder\\" did an awesome job as the lead singer, and has inclined me to buy all the rest of the Cannibal Corpse cds. This live album is by far much better than any studio album you could buy of Cannibal Corpse. This album is just as brutal and fast as Cannibal Corpse has always been. If you are a true music fan you will love this brutal album by one of the best bands of all time!

I do not mean raw as in \\"heavy\\" or \\"brutal\\", but raw as in unpolished or lackluster. Most of the songs appearing on the disc are among Cannibal Corpse's finest tunes, especially those from their most recent studio album \\"Bloodthirst\\"; however, they've never had enough juice to their preformances to spawn a \\"live\\" release.

The Wii zapper is definitely helpful and would recommend it. Having both Road to Hill 30 and Earned in Blood in the PC version and having played them much, I bought Double Time because I thought the zapper make the game more dynamic.

I purchased it for a couple of favorite episodes, \\"Mummy Daddy\\", \\"The Mission\\", \\"The Main Attraction\\".. alright more than a couple.The real drawback here and the reason for my initial comment is that the episodes are mostly too short to tell the story properly and many times I felt as if I was watching a condensed version of a movie. A lot of detail left out, characters not developed as fully as they should be, abrupt endings, etc. Not always but enough to leave me feeling like I'd been abandoned by the story teller.I'd definitely recommend the series because it's not something that's likely to happen again and it's worth watching.

Also this was a Steven Spielberg project and it shows it was very well put together considering the technology at the time. I am in the market for season 2 now!

The show wasn't meant to be like tales of horror like Tales From The Darkside or Tales From The Crypt but more on the lighthearted and mostly lightly comedic side and while not hour long episodes they still kept us mesmerized until the end of the show. The video and audio of this set is probably the best we're going to get and while not the high-definition of shows like today the quality is still great.

He tends to gloss over very intricate and cumbersome episodes of that period as if there is nothing else worth mentioning. If you can keep an objective mind-frame while reading this, it may serve as a good springboard into the topic, but ultimately there is much left unsaid and much more to be understood. The history of American involvement in Afghanistan is covered in less than 20 pages in the first chapter. No references. No footnotes. Just a glossy summary. For a much more comprehensive look, I would suggest Steve Coll's \\"Ghost Wars\\". After reading that, you won't be able to help yourself from shaking your head at this attempt.

Not really.....","review":"I was taken in by the proclamation that this book was a straight, historical accounting - not a partisan point-of-view piece. Though it's true, there are no hysterical rantings and facts are used - many in context - just the same, there is a conservative perspective to the information in this book. Readers should just be aware that it's there and then can be free to assess the information in that frame, and not be duped by the protestations to the contrary. I don't believe this author is a chicken hawk, I also don't count him as a true historian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraud","review":"Quite simply, this book is nothing more than a summary of everything that's been written about in the press (aka, open sources).While the author does a good job of reviewing everything, the book offers nothing in the way of new insights into \\"America's secret war.\\" When I bought the book, I was under the impression that this would be about what we're doing NOW to fight the war, not what happened in the past.Why put the title in the present tense, as if we are going to get a peek at the current state of our secret war? I think that's incredibly misleading. The title should be: America's Wars: A look back at the recent U.S. struggle against terrorism.I also have a major problem with the author not referencing ANY sources whatsoever. Where did he get this information? I know where he got it: the newspapers. That explains why there's nothing new here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Are We Really In Iraq","review":"I have had the privilege and advantage of subscribing to Dr. Friedman's Stratfor.com's commercial intelligence service for over a year. Nothing I have read or viewed has come close to Stratfor's intelligence summaries in terms of making infinite and certifiable sense of events in Iraq and the Middle East. I have paid particular attention to Chapter 11 of his excellent book and how carefully and precisely it spells out the Bush administration's strategic reason/s for invading Iraq...reasons that have never been articulated or suggested by anyone in the administration except perhaps Paul Wolfowitz. Dr. Friedman is as unbiased and dispassionate in stating his case as he promises in the preface to this book. That makes the book worth reading no matter where you stand on the issue of Iraq.

Most of the material on the album is quite good, but the last three cuts really don't belong there, especially when there is far better material which was excluded. Further, the inclusion of \\"He Was a Friend of Mine\\" on this album makes no sense, as it was recorded by the original lineup several years before.

Lenexa is not North of Olathe, Dr. Wallace Graham's office was in Missouri, not Kansas, The Jewel Box was not a \\"notorious\\" night spot, and Queen Elizabeth had not just been coronated at the time of John Robinson's visit.

John Robinson was a businessman, Eagle Scout and Man of the Year. Very few people knew the real John Robinson. Three quarters of the book deals with the prior crimes committed by John.

I have owned four Canon cameras over the past 15 years, and the G5 and everything related to it has been a huge disappointment. (I would have bought the digital Rebel when it first came out so I could use my EOS lenses, but it didn't allow flash exposure compensation (insane for a $1000 camera body).)I do not recommend this lens or any of the G-series digital cameras from Canon. When I've got the money I'll be buying the latest digital Rebel and upgrading some of my old EOS lenses, and selling my entire PowerShot kit.

Kinda misleading and now I have to spend more to buy the correct adapter separately. Bummer.Also, Captain Jack is correct about the vignetting.

Hers is an instrument that evokes strength, quirkiness, intimacy and irony, one you can immediately fall in love with.Pictures from the Other Side is a very strong release, its only flaw being its EP-length brevity, clocking in at about half an hour. But the material is high-quality: \\"Reckoning\\" is a dark-edged pop delight; \\"Moonbeam Ladies\\" evokes the best of Tanya Donelly's ballads, quiet and moody, with a strong sense of atmosphere; \\"Summer\\" seduces you with its pulsating groove and teasing vocal; and \\"All the Good Things\\" manages to mix catchy melodies with a heavy beat and a strange sense of foreboding.A great discovery."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's O.K.","review":"THis Book was O.K.

There also is little difference in the sound quality when playing in forward or reverse mode, or from well to well. I use it to transfer my cassette collection to my computer to record on a CD-R, and the results are fantastic. And you can use it with a Pioneer remote control if you have a Pioneer receiver with the SR feature. About the only complaint I have is that it is kind of noisy when you first start to play, try to reverse, or wind the tape. The tape head goes up and down by a motor (I think) and makes a noise whenever it goes up or down. Otherwise great sound quality above what you'd expect from a cassette deck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unreliable Unit","review":"I have a number of Pioneer units. This player lasted only for about three months and then deck 1 broke. It started stopping the tape just after a few seconds of playing. The same thing happened to rewinding.Cleaning or changing a tape did not help.I had thought that investing into Pioneer meant investing into high quality and long lasting products. Apparently it was a huge mistake. Neither the high price or the name make a difference.I realized that buying Pioneer was a waste money. In future I will go with a cheaper price becasue the outcome might be just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"a Must See!","review":"This movie is a must see.

Perhaps the most famous of his jumps is the one from Ceasar's Palace in Las Vegas, it is included here in all of its busted up glory.The only reason I have not to buy this movie is the horrific transfer to DVD. A bad scratchy print was used, washed out color, no state of the art sound and it is not in the widescreen format. Maybe someday a good transfer will be made, until then I wouldn't get your hopes up on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool film, horrible DVD","review":"I agree with the previous review. This is a very cool film of the early 70's, clearly designed to promote Evel and his planned jump of the Grand Canyon (he had to settle for the Snake River Canyon in Idaho instead.) But this is quite simply the worst DVD transfer I have ever seen. The video quality is terrible. For a few bucks you might consider snatching this up, but don't expect much quality wise. On the other hand, this is my favorite George Hamilton performance, although he doesn't really look like Evel, he really nails the performance.

Him going to get her at college, riding up the stairs, I think that is classic. Then, she decides to go with him.Its told in flashback before a jump. He compares himself to Elvis two times.

I think the frame itself probably costs just a few bucks to make, and they charge you almost $150, plus they want to get more money frmo you by charing you a monthly fee. That's just a rip-off to me.

The message indicates that I can remove it by either manually deleting it or renewing. Though I delete this message every day, it comes back the next. It seems as though Ceiva has taken the position that it is acceptable to co-opt some of the limited space on your frame in order to force you into renewing early.

This was a party favorite of mine and my whole gang's back in (way back in) college days. This album (ahem...CD) belongs in your collection of party and road cruising tunes along with NRPS's Powerglide. Every song is solid, the lyrics are fun and easy to sing along to, the musicianship and vocals are tight and precise but not stiff. Only one downside (maybe two...). The darned CD is too short, it's over just as you're getting cranked up. That's a good reason to follow it up with a Powerglide chaser. And...even though the musical performance is top notch, this CD has a fair amount of hiss on the quiet sections and gives you the feeling of a hissy cassette background with no Dolby noise reduction. But the music is that good, you'll excuse the poor engineering translation from tape to CD. *****"},{"rating":"2","title":"IF YOU DO NOT HAVE IT GET IT........","review":"FRIENDS HAVE ASKED ME WHAT MY ALL TIME FAVORITE ALBUM IS I ALWAYS SAY PANAMA RED.

This is one hot story. I loved Frankie, she's one of my favorite heroines, and Jack West is mouthwateringly sexy but vulnerable at the same time...how can you resist! There are two things I didn't like about All U Can Eat: the Team Boys characters were not as fleshed out as I'd like, and as mentioned elsewhere, the mystery is kind of lame. That's not enough to knock off a star though, and the scene with Frankie and Jack in her garden made me need a cold shower!

Mike and Jack are HOT HOT HOT and Frankie is spunky and not afraid to embrace her sexual side. I genuinely liked her as a heroine.Yes, the \\"plot\\" is utterly predictable and you pretty much know who the villain is right away, but that's okay.My only quibble is that of the Emma Holly books I've read, there always seems to be ONE very odd out-of-place scene involving multiple people (Menage, Personal Assets, Cooking Up a Storm, I'M LOOKING AT YOU!) and this book is no exception. I've literally skipped over the \\"Queen of the Harem\\" scene the couple of times I've re-read this book...but what comes after it makes it all okay!!!I would absolutely recommend this book to any friend looking for delicious men, a female lead with a backbone, and enough action to make your toes curl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This trivet is so cool!","review":"I have received many compliments on this trivet.

I was disappointed.Negative points:- The women in the video aren't pregnant. It actually made me wonder about the quality of the moves presented.- It was quite fast in the instructions given. They were voiced over and there was no close-up of the positions to help guide you along.- It claims to have a beginner and intermediate level program, but the difference between the two is so slight I would really call it false advertising.- As others said, not much of a workout. I stretched my back out nicely, but that's about it.Positive points:+ Was 20 minutes long, which is what I wanted. I wanted something short and snappy. Unfortunately the contents didn't live up to it.I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible On Both Counts","review":"I received this as a gift right after I had given birth and I tried the post-natal workout at 7 weeks post-partum. While not all that difficult, something in there ended up hurting my abs more than childbirth. But, again, the annoying woman on the dvd is not and most likely has not ever been pregnant. I just tried the pre-natal session and it is just lame, not worth even commenting on further."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't call this a workout at all","review":"I was sorely disappointed in this DVD. I just finished it and hardly even feel like I had a good stretch, let alone a workout. Just when I thought we would be getting into some of the good stuff, she thanks me for joining her and it was over. Really? I was hoping that I could find a pilates DVD help me with my sciatic pain. This is not it. I have done pilates in the past and I enjoyed having my butt kicked. I will now do some research to find a GOOD pilates workout DVD for myself. Just because I am pregnant does not mean I am fragile and can't workout.Someone else mentioned that it was annoying to watch two skinny women doing a prenatal workout and I couldn't agree more. Throw a preggo in there or at least stuff a soccer ball up someone's shirt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Workout!","review":"Not only was this dvd short, boring, and not a very good workout but it was also unsafe at some times. As others mentioned, the women in the video are not pregnant and during the second workout both women are lying flat on their backs for an extended period of time. Any pregnant woman knows this is a big no-no once you hit the second trimester. Lying flat on your back restricts blood flow to you and your baby and is warned against constantly during pregnancy. They really should have done their research on this and showed a modification for an \\"actually pregnant woman\\" since this is a workout that is supposed to be directed to pregnant women. Regardless, the workout is poor and doesn't even use very many pilates moves. When it does, there are 2 or 3 reps, not enough for a good workout. The bottom line: spend your money elsewhere for a prenatal pilates workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine for a gentle warm-up to start your day","review":"Let me keep it short like this workout... The workout is only 20 minutes long. It would be nice to watch pregnant women doing the workout. The DVD is fine if you just want a gentle warm-up before another workout or to start your day.

But their characters are so bratty in this movie it was almost torture. As far as romance goes Jane Powell and the other boy, don't have chemistry. It feels like Jane is forced into the situation.But there are a couple of things to recommend. Carmen Miranda sings a couple of numbers and plays a dance instructor. Xavier Cugat, like in the better previous Holiday in Mexico, comes to the high school to perform a number, as if. It kind of undermines what a famous musician he was. The most curious of all things in this movie is Elizabeth Taylor's number. Maybe the studio wasn't exactly sure about her appeal yet but she sings a song in this. She lipsyncs and it's generic but still that's surprising enough. But she was declared the prettiest girl in the movie so at least they were aware of something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Fun","review":"Judy Foster (Jane Powell) has a happy teenage life. Her boyfriend Oogie (Scotty Beckett) is a bandleader at her school and his sister Carol (Elizabeth Taylor) is her best friend. Her father (Wallace Beery) and mother have a great relationship. However, to make himself seem irresistable, Oogie stands Judy up at a dance. The plan backfires and she brings an older man named Stephen Andrews (Robert Stack) for her date. She then toggles between Oogie and Stephen, although Carol has eyes for Stephen as well. On top of it all, Judy suspects her father is cheating when she mistakes his dance teacher (Carmen Miranda) for his mistress.This movie is strictly fun and nothing more, but with such a great cast, how could you complain? The girls are absolutely beautiful and obviously talented.

If you've read Balcony in the Forest you know that Gracq knows something about anticipation and suspense but this is a journey even deeper into the interior of the psyche and is an altogether unique reading experience. Julien Gracq's prose is best read slowly and savoured, he lingers in his descriptions and elaborates each thought with ever richer examples which hone and decorate his meanings. The plot progresses organically and instinctively like a dream unfolding and revealing episode by episode the destructive inclinations of late civilzation consciousness. Dense sensual impressions abound. If French poetry appeals to you as well as the war genre this is your book, though this book far exceeds the normal bounds of war fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use any other study guide","review":"I used this book to prepare for the AP Physics exam, and believe me, it didn't help. This gives you the answers to the practice tests, but gives you no indication of where these answers come from, or how to solve the problems. They'll derive equations and not tell you what they're derived from, I had to check with my teacher often to figure out what the book was explaining. I spent months studying for the exam, and this book gave me no advantage over the regular textbook, it only confused me, and made me ask more questions, keeping me off-track for studying the test material. Find yourself ANY other test prep, I doubt there would be two books this bad on the market. If REA has a Physics study guide I'd suggest that--its AP US History study guide was the best test prep I've had yet for any AP Exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"humanmancalvin","review":"Sub-par product, wasted my money.

While merely vexatious for those familiar with McCarthy's work, these institutionally sanctioned forms of obfuscation, however well-meaning, are a tremendous dis-service to the uninitiated. McCarthy's ambition is biblical, ungodly; thus, his work is robustly defiant -- even scornful -- of contemporary professional exegesis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect addition to the Cozy Cottage!","review":"I purchased the Cozy Cottage for our 3 year old for Christmas.

Fanatics of the past will drool over this collection of historical tales, told from non-traditional perspectives. Each of these short pieces of fiction retells classic stories in a intoxicatingly funny, yet authentic way. Carter is audacious in her plain yet twisted manner of story-telling. She contorts the stories of Lizzy Borden and Edgar Allen Poe in such a way that the reader will find herself somewhat befuddled. This is not to say that \\"Saints and Strangers\\" is not a well crafted collection of short stories.

They need to gear it down so that it doesn't spin so fast or change the motor design. The beaters are very poorly designed for mixing ingredients. I've used Kitchenaid and even cheap (less than $10) mixers that would beat lumps of brown sugar in a batter better than this one.

Also here are some tips. If you're doing multiplayer with someone, when you start, keep pressing the A button but don't press it until you get to 2 cause it goes 1, 2, 3, go and you will get a short but sweet speed boost. Also if you get squirted by those octopus things, look at the bottom screen to help you focus because it's sorta like a map and you can actually see where you're going then turn back to the top screen when the goop comes off since sometimes it's no use looking at the bottom screen all the time because you see more action if you look at the top screen.

It's the best because of how it works. The Grand Prix is neat. You start by choosing wich size engine, then you choose the original characters from Mario Kart 64. After that, you can choose Nitro or Retro. Nitro are the new courses (which are ok) and Retro is the old classics form SNES, N64, GBA and NGC. Unfornunatly, some of the retro courses have changed. For example, At Mushroom Bridge, you can't go on top of that thing on the bridge. You can now do battle mode with computer players, which I have enjnoyed. The mission mode is pretty fun, until level 3. It gets really hard. What I'm really upset about, is that the Wi Fi, I can't get it to work. I tried following the instructions, it's just to confusing.

The real problem is the wi-fi. To use it you need a wireless connection to the internet from your computer. If you don't have one then you need a USB connector for your computer.

Nor is it the type where he gets stuck on a level and it just becomes frustrating. It's a game that seems to be fun time after time after time.

The razor feels very solid in hand. The complaints of it having an awkward blade changing mechanism and angle adjustment are warranted but are easily remedied by just being extra careful. I find I can change a blade safely and easily in 20-25 seconds - do you really need a NASCAR pit stop blade change? Well worth the money for this razor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection in a razor","review":"This is my second DE razor, and it has provided me with perfect shaves thus far.

It took some time to get used to, and i drew blood more than once. But once you've found a setting that works for you, and you've got the right blades (Merkur Double Edge Safety Razor Blades #910recommended), this razor is second to none.I definitely recommend purchasingThe Art of Shaving Pre-Shave Oilfor use in combination with your preferred shaving cream. And you'll want to use short strokes, not those lower-lip-to-adam's-apple strokes you see guys do in those commercials. For close shaves, you may have to lather up a second time. But this razor is easily worth the $60+ price tag.Note: Don't try to fly with it in your luggage. It triggered the metal detector when I tried to carry it through security. And my luggage is always searched when I travel with it in my checked bags. (But I hate leaving it at home!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I bought it in November 2009.

A good friend gave him a razor from the 60’s which is way cool but at times did not give the best shave. He had this on his wish list and of course I purchased it for him as a gift. He immediately said it was a FIVE star razor. The ability to adjust the closeness of the shave and the weight of it made it feel light and not cheap. The length of the handle was also great for a better shave. The way in which it is designed, allows the shaving cream to be pulled away from the blade which means less rinsing off in the sink. The only complaint he had was putting a blade in was a bit unwieldy. He is still keeping the 1960’s Gillette however, because it is way cool to look at!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection!","review":"I'm not one to give reviews that are twenty paragraphs long.....

The form and feel of this razor is pleasing not only to the eyes but to the touch also. It looks like a fine piece if art.... Something to be admired from a distance. It feels satiny smooth, in the hand. It functions better than anything you will find on the shelves of some generic drug store. Be sure you get a shaving kit with this.

It is difficult to shave with as soon as the handle gets wet with water or soap. I have to constantly correct its position. Also, the handle feels very short in my grip which adds to this problem. If the handle were about an inch longeror even more and knurled somewhat, the task of shaving would be far more enjoyable. In the end, I will not recommend such an expensive razor to my friends unless these problems (in my view) are corrected."},{"rating":"2","title":"No reason not to use one","review":"Most other reviewers have already done an excellent job reviewing the product, you cannot beat the long term cost savings over the over-priced 3/4/5 blades units. IMO once the blade contacts the skin there are microscopic indentations created so a fresh blade is always better than a refill with 4 blades.BTW i have thick hard hair that grow fast, with cyclone shaped growth on one side, and it takes me 5-6 minutes to shave during the morning showerLength of ownership: 3+ yearsI did use it with regular gels for quiet sometime with no issuesAlways keep the movement perpendicular to the length of the blade to avoid cutsLet the weight of the razor do the job i.e. do not push too hard on itExcellent quality, and I love the satin finish, I also have the satin brush and love it tooHighly recommended.....cartridge free for over three years"},{"rating":"2","title":"An in-depth look at the Soldiers serving in the west.","review":"This book really enlightens the reader with interesting personal narratives.

Many are familiar with some of the texts, but this lets you see images of the originals plus interesting ritual items that she had used. The memories of her written by those who knew her and worked with her also is wonderful and adds more depth to those of us who never knew her except by her works. It is a wonderful memorium to her and her spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done","review":"I like how this book has been put together. There are Doreen's (I assume) drafted and typewritten poems (often with cross-outs and notations) and there are photos of some of Doreen's witchcraft tools, as another reviewer stated. Some of these poems I have seen in other places, but some I have not. From other books I have read about Doreen Valiente, I surmise that Doreen is the true founder of Wicca, as much of the liturgy is attributed to her. Gerald Gardner would have been lost without her, and Wicca never would have gained the popularity in our time, especially among women. I am not Wiccan, but I appreciate Doreen's contribution to providing an ethical view of Witchcraft. She made it easier for many to come out of the broom closet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eisenstaedt review","review":"This is an excellant book containing Eisenstaedt's remarks about each photograph and how his career began."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it alot but there is one problem","review":"I like everything in this movie: the story, music, and there are some funny parts.

She isn't. She becomes a beautiful woman. 1943 was the year for her. She shines. Unfortunately, this film does not let her shine very much. The score is forgettable and Marta Eggerth has waaaaaaaayyyyy too much screen time. But she's here (Marta) and we just have to shut up and like it. I'll shut up.Van Heflin, like all the men in Judy's MGM movies, can't see that she's a beautiful woman. Is he blind? Garland is so lovely that it should make Hedy Lamarr faint. But Lamarr (who isn't in the film) doesn't faint and Garland the trouper soldiers on. Brave girl.It's not a great film, by any stretch. Even the musical numbers are rather unmemorable; nothing remarkable. But Garland succeeds nicely in the role of a show-biz wannabe.The brother with the door knob fetish is odd. And the hat. The hat! First Garland wears it. Then a black woman. Then a monkey. Horrendous.Perhaps the least inspiring Garland musical out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A True Stinker","review":"MGM made this bomb AFTER the fantastic \\"For Me and My Gal\\"???? I mean, it's not as if they didn't know how to use Garland, and use her right! They really wasted her in this dud. And why on earth did MGM give so many more musical numbers to that ludicrous broad with the operatic voice, whose name I can't recall? Or does it just seem that way because her voice is so annoying?Anyway, there is one bright spot in this stinkbomb, and that's the last number. So just fast forward to the part where Lily becomes a big star (surprise, surprise, hope I didn't ruin it for you!) and listen to Garland sing and dance her way (finally) through a bizarre, but still enjoyable \\"Broadway Rhythm.\\"P.S.

Inspired, without doubt, by the monumental Drucker study of IBM, it took case analysis a step further. Its seminal ideas are found in many contemporary studies and schools or management thinking which have taken these principles yet further.That doesn't mean it should no longer be read. But, after reading it, and to get the most from reading it, other contemporary works should be included in your reading list. For example, Jim Collins' \\"Built to Last\\" and \\"Good to Great\\", and John Roberts' \\"The Modern Firm\\" take Peters and Watermans' original insights many steps further. \\"In Search of Excellence\\" however, is unlikely to lose its status as a classic, and the broad strokes of its conclusions will continue to be recognized as timeless principles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Unabridged book","review":"RIP OFF DO NOT BUY!

It's even more amazing then how most companies have simply ignored the lessons illustrated within, only to continue on their dismal path of mediocrity. The basic lesson to be learned is that if your company religiously follows the core tenets outlined in the book, then your company will be the leader in your industry, because you will be the only company to do so. So why is this circa 1980's book still relevant? Because the principles apply just as much today, and they apply equally well to business of any nature. If you read this book, absorb all of the lessons, and practice them in your daily activities, then you will have learned the most important lesson in your business life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good info, but not worth a buy","review":"Although the book has some interesting points it is not as easy to read as let's say \\"Good to Great\\" by Jim Collins.Moreover, as others have pointed out some(all?) of the information in the book is NOT based on real data.

For instance, the data in Excellence is faked; \\"Stupidity\\" reprints the Busines Week article in which Peter's admits this. Once I read that, I had a hard time taking Excellence seriously.In Search of Stupidity also points out that practically *all* of the high tech companies Excellence profiles either failed or had major financial problems.

Now, I am sure that there are, again, bigger, and better informed, fans of punk that might disagree but that not withstanding I can do nothing but heap praise on a fistful of songs that had me back to lifting weights and reshaving my head after only a single listening.

They were unadulterated fun. No possibility of the Joker murdering Robin, etc. Innocence was not childish, but mythic. A whole different game from that Batman plays today. Not to complain! But they are very different, and I love the old Batman mythology. You will, too, and you will find plenty of it in the present volume! Visually beautiful with delightful story telling. Which one is the \\"real\\" Batman? I wouldn't care to say. I only know that, as I read these tales, I have no lingering doubts as to whether I am reading forced and obligatory \\"relevance\\" or whether Batman is a mere detective inexplicably sporting a strange suit.

I also like that it was fake because Kathryn Lasky could write in what she wanted and felt she needed to make readers understand Mem. And if you look inside the third page has by written on it. And Kathryn Lasky is obviously not Mem, differant names. While if you look on Anne Frank's diary(a real one) it just says \\"translated by\\". Or at least my copy does.

I also think that the author's political motivation was much more concerned with the fate of Quebec than of the native peoples, which struck me as somewhat disingenuous.

This book only makes sense if you already understand compiler design. The authors frequently throw out dozens of terms that they don't bother to define for several hundred pages. With minimal effort they could explain exactly what a symbol-table is used for or at least give some idea before giving an in-depth analysis of issues in symboltable design but instead they inundate the reader in terminology (to scare off the weak-willed I think) and let the explanation appear 250 pages later.With that said the book does cover alot. It has lots of examples (that are probably the only parts that make sense) and talks about lots of important language specific issues. Going back to it the book is a useful reference.

This is a great cd to start with for someone not too familiar with Hawkins' work. Here we can hear him play solo on \\"Picasso\\", as well as in small groups and larger bands. The years covered are 1944 through to 1957. On a couple of tracks there is some surface hiss...but it does state in the booklet that some recordings were transferred from disc sources so surface noise is audible. It's a shame as I'm sure remastering would have solved that. But anyway, this is an excellent place to start a collection of Coleman Hawkins. Sonny also writes his thoughts on Hawkins and his music which is interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to Find '40s Hawk","review":"I was going to actually shell out forComplete Coleman Hawkins on Keynotebecause the few Keynote tracks I'd heard on some other compilations sounded so good. Hawkins was standing firmly at the crossroads between swing and bop during this fascinating period in the development of the tenor master. Then I found this collection, and found that 13 of the 16 tracks are all Keynote sessions featuring the likes of Cozy Cole, Teddy Wilson, Sid Catlett, Roy Eldridge, and Buck Clayton. The other three cuts are definitely among Hawk's best for Verve in the '50s: an unaccompanied solo, a gorgeous latin flavored piece with Ben Webster, and a pretty ballad. Sonny Rollins picked the tracks for this collection and thank you Sonny!Sound quality on the Keynotes varies. While less than modern remastering techniques is capable of, it's better than what I've heard on those few tracks I already have on other CDs. Amongst my dozens of Hawkins CDs, this has quickly become one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Analysis of the Arab- Israeli conflict","review":"The dean of Orientalists Bernard Lewis does not discourse on the broader civilizational conflict question, but rather confines his remarks here to the Israeli- Arab and more specifically Israeli- Palestinian Arab problem. He analyzes the failure of the Oslo process rightly pinning the blame of terrorist Arafat who could not give up doing what he knew to do best,terrorism. Lewis traces the overall development of the conflict and suggests that there can be no serious peace - process until the Palestinians have different leadership.Lewis however wrongly states that the Israeli 'settlement policy' began with the Likud's coming to power. He too it seems to me goes far but not far enough in recognizing how deep Palestinian and Arab rejection of Israel is.In general I would have preferred to see Lewis discoursing on broader civilizational issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"I always have this on hand to knock out bladder infections.","review":"This stuff is the best for early UTI.

The writing is just so simple and clear, and the topic just so important, this book is quite worthwhile reading for any student (in the broadest sense) of psychology. Bowlby is an original researcher on attachment between infants and their caregivers. He describes his own and others' research projects and analyzes them in a theoretical framework about instinctive behavior. Why would it be important for children to have attachments? What sorts of attachments would we expect them to have, and what do they have? These are questions Bowlby addresses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seminal work.

He then attempts to support that \\"proof\\" with anecdotal evidence. Virtually every premise presented by Bowlby was destroyed by the work of Dr. Michael Lamb shortly after Bowlby published \\"Attachment\\" (See \\"The Role of Father\\").

Vastly superior to their quarter-fold counterparts, half-fold cards are what you'll usually find commercially in card shops. Though they do fold to a somewhat larger-than Hallmark (tm) size, the after-folding allignment is dead-on, and you have more room to express yourself. If approximating the look and feel of a 'real' store-bought card is important to you, therefore, go with this format. However, I'm partial to more textured card-stocks--Hewlett Packard makes an excellent 'felt' ivory--so I have to drop the rating for this one down a star for its white blandness."},{"rating":"2","title":"greeting card paper","review":"this Avery greeting card paper works great for me.

The printer handles every other paper I have tried without any problem whatsoever - photo, resume, business card, etc. I simply could not get this paper to feed into my printer properly. I ordered a second box and took the files to a printshop. They said they couldn't guarantee that it would go through their machines either. I finally had them print it on their card stock.

It's important to note these chapters are ethnographies.

I took it to a shop to have it tuned and it was still crap. The antenna comes with 18 feet of thin coax and it doesn't have a connector at the base of the antenna so you can easily swap out antennas. Ask the guys at Mauldroppers.com and they'll tell you the Little Wil antenna sucks. I wish I never touched this crappy antenna. I should have just sent it back. All I get is crackle, fuzzy voice and nothing else. If you want a decent antenna, go with the Wilson 1000 or the 5000. I used this on a Uniden PC68LTW. That's about all I can tell you.

I tried to adjust the antenna (cut/extend)but the SWR was so bad on ch 1 & Ch 40 I could tell based on the provided instructions what to do, cut or extend. I purchased a Radio Shack antenna instead and the steel antenna was easy to adjust. I liked the reviews on the Wilson 'Little Wil' and how the antenna looked but it should have been close to the frequency or at least adjustable without cutting steel. The instructions says \\"the whip is generally longer than necessary for ch 1-40\\" and \\"if you have an SWR meter\\". You will NEED an SWR meter (I have one)and something to cut steel in 1/4 sections until you get it right. I use to cut steel whips in the old days when they were over 100 inches in length but a loaded whip? This antenna was so bad I could hardly receive any local traffic on nearby I95 let along transmit. Maybe I got a bad antenna."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Whip for a good Price","review":"Can't beat this lil wil, it stays on despite me beating it through thick brush and hoghway speeds, picks up far away conversations, and was easy to tune myself.

I bought in on the recommendation of a friend who compared Neylor to Toni Morrison. She also writes in the vernacular, but hers is more accessible than Morrison's. The stories are tragic and depressing, with glints of humor and hope. I felt emotionally attached to most of the characters, and Neylot does a good job of weaving the biographies in together. I will say that the stories were just that; the sheer melodrama of these women's lives made the stories more fictional than believable. With that said, I couldn't put the book down. I look forward to reading Mama Day and the Men of Brewster Place in the very near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed The Women Of Brewster Place and I liked the stories told by the different characters in the book. Each woman had her own chapter (one chapter featured two women) and it was like reading seven short stories but characters from one story would interact with characters from another story so it gave the book a \\"novel\\" feel as well. This book captured me from the beginning until the end but I was left confused a time or two. I don't quite know if I understood what went on with Mattie at the end of her chapter nor do I know if I understood what happened to Lorraine at the end of her chapter.

The drivers seem to work well, and they don't bring up any clumsy \\"toolbox\\" program every time you print something. Also, it prints on paper as small as 3x5 cards, which is great for checks or small envelopes. The toner cartridge installation couldn't be easier.Cons: None... yet. Although it has only one expansion spot for memory, so I'll have to make sure I get the right size if I upgrade. It uses a print cable which isn't compatible with the Centronics-style Ink Jet or Dot Matrix printers, but at least a 6-footer is included.Note: The 1100 does not scan or copy without the optional copy attachment.

His acting stands far and above everybody else's. There is zero chemistry between Newman and Ann Blyth. She is miscast and comes across awkwardly during the whole movie. She's totally unbelievable as she tries to portray Morgan and the drama and vices Morgan went through. The script doesn't do much to really develop the backstory of Morgan or what she actually experienced during her life. This movie was/is for the generation that already knew her story.

Why they didn't use Ann Blyth's voice is beyond me though. They thought someone with a beautiful voice like hers couldn't sing torch songs? Paul Newman is great as Helen Morgan's lover. I was a kid but I still DO remember the original Playhouse 90 broadcast with singer Polly Bergen portraying Helen Morgan, who was also wonderful.

Ann Blyth was at the very end of her movie career, even though she probably didnt realise it at the time, she had just been let go from her MGM contract and saw this vehicle as a chance to shine in a dramatic role after being a coquettish heroine in films such as \\"Rose Marie\\" and \\"The Student prince\\" (Her musical movies have mostly been ignored by DVD)Unfortunately she did not prove capable of the requirements of the cliched role and never made another movie and Newman who was a star on the rise acts her off the screen in a role that helped launch his burgeoning movie career.As a movie it is slow and pretty inaccurate of the tragic life of Morgan."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm hooked!","review":"I've always been fasinated by the little snippets of information contained in the Bible about ordinary people, especially the women, who have done something important enough to be remembered and recorded in the most read and published book in history.

This on is Jael's story who's about to marry a man arranged by her parents. She like every other bride hopes for happiness and love. Instead her husband is far worse then she could imagine and she's the third wife. Jael becomes good friends with the two other wives and the coucumbine who shows up a little later. In order to stay alive in her marriage Jael must have sons yet through the other wives Jael learns the only way to do so is by committing adultery. Jael finds that troubling to say the least. Through the cocumbine Jael slowly starts following her God. Her killing of Sisera really surprised even though it happened in the Bible. It was very brave and yet still surprised me. I liked the arrival Deborah and look forward to reading her story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read.","review":"I love historical and Biblical fiction. I hadn't read one about Jael before, so this was a very interesting read. Obviously, Ann Burton takes a lot of liberties in the fiction surrounding the story, but nothing that contradicts the Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painstakingly researched","review":"Pendragon is Blake and Lloyd's second book, and builds creditably on their first one, Keys to Avalon. They have painstakingly documented the evidence which leads them to the conclusion that Arthur was Welsh and lived, fought, and died in Wales. The evidence for this appears incontrovertible, even if the particular details are not necessarily as easily fleshed out. If nothing else, this is an incredibly important gift to Arthurian research, which hopefully will eventually supercede the always dubious, Arthurian claims of regions from Cornwall to Scotland.As an anthropologist, I most appreciate their attention to the differences in language and culture which prompted later chroniclers and authors to shift Arthur from his original location to Great Britain as a whole.Anyone looking for the 'real', historical Arthur will find him here."},{"rating":"2","title":"NYC Tyranny","review":"This is the Oyster Boys 2nd LP and it's a rocker. There's not a dull moment, & each track is a classic. What made the 70s BOC so cool was that 4 of em sang lead and they all can PLAY.

It's alright! (Only the 2001 remaster, though)","review":"This album just KILLS. It's true that the comparison to Black Sabbath isn't very well founded, but if you want to see the closest they got to the Slabbathy sound, check out the live version of \\"7 Screaming Dizbusters\\" on the tail end of the CD. The way they tweak the \\"really heavy part\\" is just unbelievable. They WERE better live. The whole album reeks of 70s, and I wasn't even born yet - just that kind of space-fixated, technically proficient, rock and roll atmosphere that is trapped in the grooves, along with traces of cocaine and mary jane. The remastering on this CD is EXCELLENT. Excellent, excellent, excellent. Probably sounds better than the original record. And YES, that is possible with the continuing advance of CD mastering technology. Oh, one more thing: the packaging on this reissue is really lavish.

Since I was a kid, I've only been aware of two of their songs, Don't Fear the Reaper and Godzilla. I never cared at all for the former, I kinda like the latter. Recently I read somewhere that BOC was considered \\"America's answer to Black Sabbath\\" and the word \\"heavy\\" was thrown around a few times. I decided to see for myself and I ordered the debut album and T&M. All I can say is \\"Huh?! 'America's answer to Black Sabbath'?!?! 'Heavy'?!?!?! What the heck are you talking about???\\" I suppose back in the early 70s, this stuff may have been considered heavy. But where the Black Sabbath comparison comes in, I don't know. Black Sabbath's music is the very epitome of HEAVY, and more important, timeless. The music on these albums is as dated as denim bell bottoms and suede vests with fringe. Sounds more like America's answer to early Yes to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pinnacle of Blue Oyster Cult","review":"I could go on a diatribe about how important this album is to the history of BOC and its legend, of sorts, but I will spare the words as to describe my love of this release.

No, this album is better than that, and was the fastest, sickest record to have come out in 1973--only \\"Raw Power\\" (the Stooges) comes close. We're talking about a band who was donning leather and riding 'cycles onstage years before Judas Priest. The dingy production and trebly, buzzsaw rhythm guitar sound of T&M anticipates countless lo-fi artisans from the Ramones to Darkthrone, and with lyrical topics ranging from devil worship to the exploits of the RCMP to a she-murderess who hides the remains of her prey in streetside bushes, you couldn't have a band more heavy metal, yet with the ironic wit of a bunch of New York intellectuals unleashing their demons.

Don't try to use it as a reference to learn quickly about some aspect that interests you. I guess is a treatise written for the few that already know this stuff. Written by a knowledgeable researcher, the book is *very* hard to read. Read instead his 1989 paper \\"Damage Mechanics\\" in Mechanics of Materials, p. 117-197. The subject index is inadequate; you cannot find anything relevant with it. I am hoping Amazon or Google will scan this book and make it searchable. The book emphasizes the micro structural aspects of damage mechanics.

I got all three seasons from another on-line retailer for $75 total. (About $25 each plus tax). I bet it has something to do with Marc Singer being in it. Probably due to some royalty conflict or something.

I was most disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An index more than a book","review":"Terrorism by John Pynchon Holms and Tom Burke is useful to only two groups: readers who know absolutely nothing about the subject, and those familiar with the topic who need a quick index. The former group will get a shallow but broad introduction to terrorism, the latter a reader-friendly glossary of names, terms, and dates.As an aside, this book originally was published in 1994. After September 11, 2001, in another egregious example of exploitation of the tragedy, the opening chapter was revised and dedicated to the terrorist attacks on Washington, New York and over the skies of Pennsylvania. The September 11th timeline, like the book as whole, is a comprehensive but contains nothing new."},{"rating":"2","title":"reviewing the reviewer","review":"(...)

It was nothing like what I saw in the store. The bezel around the watch is not moving as it should. So using the slide rule to calcualte anything is out of the question. The watch itself is tight to fit over ones hand. Trying to find anyone who has links or can add links in nearly impossible. The second hand is not realy a second hand but it goes to the stop watch, the real second hand is one of the smile hands on the face of the watch...takes some getting use to. Oh finally setting the date is a real chore. It doesn't go back so you have turn and turn the set knob until you get to the right date.

She alone, with her understanding of his writing style, has a chance to find the semi-autobiographical clues in his latest manuscript and unveil the true killer. Set in Oregon, the story moves quietly but quickly. Wilhelm layers the plot with surprising depth for a relatively short novel (278 pages).Imagine a pleasing scene from a mountain road; imagine darkness coming over the valley; imagine shadows growing and becoming more threatening...This is Wilhelm's style here. She draws you quickly into the scenes, then begins hinting at the troubles ahead. The plot moves smoothly, the characters interact and brood accordingly, and the conclusion draws the loose ends together in a satisfying and sleek manner.This was my first Wilhelm read. I'm tempted to pursue her other books, particularly since she is a local author. She captures the mood and personality of Oregon well. I enjoyed her readable style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, Wilhelm","review":"My first Wilhelm book, recommended by a friend and now I'm hooked. I love mysteries and this was a puzzle. I guess you can assume no matter how remote or inaccessible a retreat is someone can figure out a way to get to it.Even though Abby finally figured things out, some of her old friends and neighbors got to the answer before her and if it hadn't been for the secret help of Felicia the ending would have had a different outcome.But the unlikely murderer got his just desserts.The mother character seemed a bit vague to me. Everyone keeps referring to Jud Vickers as Jud Conners in these reviews and even on the back cover of the paperback that error is made. Abby Conners was Jud's daughter but they did not have the same last names.I would read this again, but I think I'll just find another one of Wilhelms books and dig in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"Kate Wilhelm always surprises me.This books starts out so predictably,a dead body at a secluded cabin and the mystery of who the killer might be,however as the story unfolds she makes each character so unique especially all the women.She also describes flawlessly the geographic locations.The ending is stunning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent understanding of Internet Commerce","review":"This book was not only very interesting to read, but also had many areas which focused on the business values of implementing e-commerce environments.

It was banned in England. As Rolling Stone wrote 'Can a nice Jewish boy from Eatons Kneck, Long Island, find happiness as a satanic pop star decked out in full leather regalia? ' ME 262 has the great line \\"Hitler's on the phone from Berlin says I'm gonna make you a star\\". The song celebrates blowing English Bombers out of the sky during WW II. This is not Kiss singing 'Strutter'. It's deep in cryptic conspiracy innuendo and sarcasm. The showpiece 'Astronomy' celebrates the marriage of Suzie dear and the impending storms of war. Astronomy--it's the career of evil--it's the black art of Secret Treaties where alliances are formed to decide the world's fate (or so the liner notes go).

Add that to \\"Career of Evil\\", the chilling but catchy \\"Subhuman\\", \\"ME 262\\", memorable riff rocker \\"Harvester of Eyes\\" and the cheeky \\"Dominance and Submission\\", and you have a coherent, powerful album, a landmark of '70s rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, no, no, no...","review":"No, no, no...

Other reviewers have been over the songs, so I'll not go into those in detail, but I can say that \\"Astronomy\\" is my favorite BOC song, if not my favorite song period. It's a thing of dark beauty, with cryptic lyrics (which one can only really understand if one knows the Imaginos storyline). \\"Dominance and Submission\\" is a powerful song, and the live version is in my opinion even better (from \\"Extraterrestrial Live\\" or the \\"A Long Day's Night\\" DVD). \\"Harvester of Eyes\\" is great, if somewhat nonsensical(even if you know its context), and \\"Flaming Telepaths\\" is an amazing work... the pulse of the keyboard note, and the drug and yet somehow something more lyrics are just magic.

It will challenge you from start to finish.And for ... (at the time of this review) it would be crazy to pass up this great deal of a game.

The best songs on it are the hauntingly touching \\"I've Seen It All\\", a duet with Radiohead's Thom York, and \\"In The Musicals\\" which is about her character's hiding from reality by daydreaming her musicals.This album is more accessable then some of Bjork's other work, and is definately brighter in it's tone. It is one of those rare soundtracks that stands alone as a striking piece of music, and also compliments the film to perfection. Both the film and the album are exceptional individually, but together they are an artistic force that will (I hope) redefine and revitalize the dying genre of film musicals."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"I'm a moderate Bjork fan, and I've especially enjoyed her work with the Sugarcubes. But this CD, I must admit, I didn't like much at all. First off, there's the price vs. number of songs problem. It's WAY overpriced for 7 songs. But beyond that, there was only one song that I really enjoyed (the duet with the singer from Radiohead). Some of the songs on here are just crap, and make no sense unless you've seen the movie (I presume). For example, there's one song where she's basically just counting. My guess is that has something to do with dancing, but as a single listening to it in your car, there's not much appeal. This CD isn't worth the money as far as I'm concerned. You're better off with Debut, or the Great Crossover Potential (by the Sugarcubes). Stay away from selmasongs, or just get the one good song off Napster (it's not worth the money)."},{"rating":"1","title":"only a big fan should by this","review":"I was excited to see a new album by Bjork in the store today.

The music basically is made up of \\"experimental\\" type electronic sounds (which, by now, are not too experimental) and orchestration. The songs themselves do not have much in the order of melody. Bjork's voice is still here of course, but being her fifth release, is that really enough to hold anyone's attention? Adding to the annoyance, there is some guy singing with Bjork on one of the tracks. And to top it all off, the disc is 32 minutes long!! If you are a die hard Bjork fan you'll probably want this. (Whether or not you'll like it is a different question.) If you are new to Bjork, check out ANYTHNING else by her, probably one of the first two. This thing is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great.","review":"Maybe you need to see the movie first? I don't know but with only seven songs/orchestrations and being an aligned piece (The songs fit within a framework.) I decided that I should have gone with another selecton from Bjork's catalog as my introductory. I was dissapointed both with the individual songs and the work as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"ridiculous","review":"Don't know if this album just goes to prove that Bjork's prior great moments were flukes, or not. Whatever, this album is desperately in need of some decent songcraft. Frankly, tracks like I've Seen It All are ridiculous to the point of being hysterically funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"can bjork sing...or act? NOPE!","review":"hearing bjork sing is like X-Men's wolverine putting his metal claws THROUGH THE BLACKBOARD and pulling down the slate! this is an awful cd and DANCER IN THE DARK is a godawful musical. she won best actress at cannes? puh-leez!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the CD before the movie","review":"My wife and I purchased the CD long before seeing the movie, and I have to say that the CD stands very well on its own. And I am not much of a Bjork person.One warning, though: the movie is so horribly depressing that since seeing it we haven't been able to listen to the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Majestic!","review":"I make a point of reviewing this album before I see the movie, for \\"Selmasongs\\" is a superbly realised musical journey all on its own. Bjork's compositions add an uneasy but heartfelt lyrical edge to a musical backing that fuses loops of abrasive samples with Vince Mendoza's feisty yet solemn orchestral arrangements. Such contrast imbue the album with an emotive power that hints more at wanderlust than melodrama. Cinematic parallels have been evident in Lars von Trier's previous films, and it's encouraging to note that he has been credited with creative input on many of these songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, but not complete","review":"I agree with the other reviewers: I'd prefer the movie soundtrack over this version--much as I like Thom's vocal over the original Jeff's voice!; I'd prefer the movie's version of Scatterheart and In the Musicals, starring Joel Grey's voice additions, over the CD version; I also didn't like to pay full price for an EP (but I'll do it this time, thinking there may not be another recording of this spellbinding music). But let me add a new point to this ongoing discussion......Broadway?If Paul Simon, Pete Townsend and Elton John can do it--Billy Joel has recently been approached to do the same--perhaps Bjork might expand the score a bit and put this dark vision on Broadway. I think that might be awesome.So Bjork...will there be an original cast album coming? Or at the very least, a more complete and original movie soundtrack coming?"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"This soundtrack should be the \\"album of the year\\" it is just better than all my other albums!Bjork has an excellent voice, I loved all her songs since her previous album in 1995. All the tracks in this album are AMAZING! I can't wait for Bjork's next album..even if it's a little too early to think about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous","review":"The minute this album arrived in the mail, I put it in the stereo and listened to it four times in a row. This is entrancing music from one of my favorite artists, and I can't wait to see the film. But as another poster said, \\"Selmasongs\\" stands on its own as a record, an exhiliarating record at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, but don't expect the same as the movie","review":"This is a great album, but the songs are not the same as the movie. (1) Some important songs are missing, (2) Some of the lyrics have been changed, (3) In the movie some of the other actors sing certain lines, whereas on the CD they do not."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Oh So Tired","review":"Björk is the freshest, most inventive, significant and exciting artist to come along in popular music since the 1960s. Each album, from Gling Glo onwards, is more more creative, ground-breaking and delightful than the previous one. Even her remix album, Telegram, is striking for the originality of the alternate versions of her songs. Well, no one can keep it up forever. Maybe this is a good soundtrack, but as an album in its own right, it's a tired rehash of old musical themes. None of her usual artful teasing, sensual playing with noise and vocal tones. It's formula Björk, if such a thing is possible.If you're shopping for Björk CDs, start with Post, Debut and Homogenic (in that order). Get this one only if you, like me, get so hooked that you have to buy everything, regardless of merit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Closest to Steely Dan I've Heard Yet","review":"What amazes me is that something this great and appreciated by the jam band community during its heydey is now going for 100 bucks new here.

I believe homegrownmusic.net has it for $13."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's Always Room For Jello","review":"Nobody can combine sarcasm and fact quite like Biafra. This album touches on some of his earlier stuff, but is mainly new material on the computer industry and the recent trend of school shootings. This album might be a little smarter than his others, and that's only because Biafra's getting a little older, but aren't we all? And with age comes wisdom. And I just want to make sure I'm getting the right wisdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Tipper, you'll love...","review":"Don't be fooled.

Yes, please!","review":"I owned all six albums in this collection from previous individual releases, and I _still_ bought it. Review: worth every penny! The remastering has done wonders for the sound, especially on \\"One Step Beyond\\" (the first album), and when they throw in 24 videos as well, along with a booklet, and unleash it on an unsuspecting public at bargain price, hell, what's to complain about? Well, maybe the booklet, which is a tad skimpy in terms of the notes, but hey at this price, that's nitpicking.Pick up this boxed set, get yourself a pair of sunglasses, and enjoy that crazy old Nutty sound!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Squashing Snails","review":"One of the most underrated bands of all time, Madness incorporated elements of reggae,ska,music hall and big band in their marvellous catalogue. All of you who remember Dan Akroyd's \\"Blues Brothers\\" dance routine, take a look at the early Madness videos and see what you have been missing. What seperated this group from their peers, was the ability to write and perform in a multitude of styles, with a touch of humor and soul. My daughter and her friends love to dance to the early hits.

I mean they have greatly improved, but for the most part the first cd seems to stay in my mind longer. The first opening song though, New Medicines is just beautiful, very catchy and a pretty strong song musically. It does set the tone for the rest of the cd, but I think the first album sounded a little better although they are finding their sound now. I don't know I think I should spend more time listening to the new cd. I would most defintiely buy this though, they have a really good sound and very strong vocals. If you like Emo, screaming, hard rock you will probably really like these guys. They are a little more pop oriented though than hard rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy Rock...engaging!","review":"Dead Poetic returns after \\"Four Wall Blackmail\\" with a more acccessible release.

I purchased the album just for that song. The rest of the album is good too, especially lyrical-wise which has already been stated. There is a lot of screaming, but it's not pointless screaming. It adds emotion, which is what screaming is meant for. Anyways, great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"Dead Poetic's debut album Four Wall Blackmail was something else. It kicked some life into the tired genre of hardcore emo. Dead Poetic's live performences and the excellent first CD prompted me to buy Mew Medicines without listening to any of it first, as is my usual rite for buying music. So I spent the 15 dollars and popped it into my stereo. I'm fairly disappointed. While they lyrics are a step above most of the other band's out today, the music and vocals are about on par with if not a little below bands like Thursday, Finch, etc. It's not a bad CD at all. But it's not terribly good either. Hopefully with their next release we'll see the intensity we did with Four Wall Blackmail, until then spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Four Wall Blackmail Instead","review":"if you loved Four Wall Blackmail, you'll most likely be dissappointed. DP has been my favorite band for over a year. I've seen them 6 times live and they are amazing. However, this album cost me fourteen dollars that I wish I hadn't spent. It sounds so...radio. If that's what you like then you'll probably love it. It reminds me of something like Good Charlotte only some great screaming (very little). I'll probably still go to their shows and lose my flip flops in the pit, but I'll be sad when they play their new stuff. DP stop trying to get big and do what you do best. Rawk."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh, so so","review":"Alright its better than one star, but that is there to bring the average rating down. This is NOT a 5 out of 5 cd. It is well performed and somewhat catchy, and the singing is good. I, however, was expecting something much better. The screaming is very good when used, but it is not used enough nor always at the right parts of the song. The album also sounds overproduced at times, fake and not true to the live sound of the band. Although this album is not bad, it lacks originality and punch. It can be summarized in 4 words: Story of the Year. This band sounds VERY similar to SOTY, other than the harder style of screaming. I would honestly rate it a 3 star, but like I said, the average rating needed to be lowered. It is worth listening to, but there are much better bands in this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Stars to a band w/not talent","review":"This A-W-F-U-L cd was released by the T&N record company and wow I was disappointed w/there 1st cd and when I listened to a few tracks of this I was even more dissapointed!

The only sanding I had to do was just to drag a rolled up piece of 320 through the coves on the end grain. I was done in < 1 minute rather than the 30-45 minutes I'd expect to spend with other bits with similar profiles. Also, after making a test cut in some scrap, I decided to take a full cut in one pass on my workpiece rather than several smaller passes.

As is the fashion these days, the boys rope in an unknown Latin star to moan a few Spanish words with hopes that the single would thus cross over onto the Spanish charts as well (and it did).Musically, however, the single is catchy and hummable and worth three listens on the radio, but to actually go out and buy it (and worse, buy the album) is a sin.

And then you understand why there is so few bonus material. No subtitles, and just a handful of little fotographs. There is a booklet, of course, like there use to be in these days.

It suddenly goes from serious tragety to horribly mistimed comedy.(try to imagine Jack dieing at the end of Titanic and then suddenly Rose runs accross the water in chibi form screaming and crying with huge crying eyes) It's too funny to take seriously and too serious to be funny, and it's not one of those shows that starts of stupid and gets much better later on like Inuyasha.

Her loyalty to the author was negligeable and 'hurtful', especially when he told of the circumstances following his suicide attempt; she said next time he commits suicide (as her clairvoyant told her he would) and when he is dead could he get JFK to tell his son that she was destined to marry him (John Kennedy Junior) - bizarre to say the least! At her worst Fergie was shown to be thoughtless, selfish, deceitful, spineless and spoilt. However, the author also gives a balanced view, as in the case where Fergie held and kissed neglected, orphaned kids when many of the other adults present could not even bring themselves to enter the room because of the stench. As for John Bryan - he needs help for sure - what a shallow character!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Human Weakness","review":"I have just read the book for the second time.

Even though the selections had been released previously on other live recordings, I jumped at the chance that I might hear a different arrangement of these wonderful songs. When I received the CD today I could hardly get through the first cut. This CD is full of horribly recored selections. It sounds like a bootleg, and a bad one at that.

This was a very fine year for Gentle Giant (1975), and one of the two shows contained on this 2-CD set was recorded in Berkely, CA (my home away from home). However, I was HUGELY disappointed when I put these discs in my player. Both concerts were recorded with handheld tape recorders from the audience. Translation: these are bootleg recordings. They sound simply dreadful, and are only required for the completists. The first show (From White Plains, NY) sounds better than the Berkeley show, but neither is listenable.This product should be removed from distribution.

The theater sync works very well, after some trial and error - along with exhausting flipping through all of the manuals.I have the receiver hooked up to a polk surround bar and subwoofer, and the sound is nice. Not as good as a large set of speakers for music, nor a true surround system, but much better than listening to the tv speakers.The setup of the receiver does take some time and the manual is not all that great. Once set up the receiver works fine and I would say great with the theater sync. Obviously, the hdmi inputs and video pass through are great, but if you do not need the bravia theater sync compatability, I think you could find a better sounding receiver in this price range. Although that may be difficult to do if you are looking for the hdmi functionality the unit offers.

It will play but I have to turn the volume all the way to maximum in order to get legible sound. I am using both an iPod Dock with RCA cables out and have also tried using RCA cables connected to the headphone jack, same result.

Pure and simple as that. If you loved Mr. Crow off their first album and bought that single and played it out, you'll love We Are Your Friends. Otherwise, Simian isn't going to have too many friends. Chemistry Is What We Are worked because of the mixtures: electronic beats, chunky rhythms, and beautiful melodies with harmonized vocals. The first three songs blew you away. Someone said it was like Aphex Twin meets the Beach Boys, and that was as good a description as possible. The music sounded as if they were experimenting and almost making it up as they went along. On this album, every song is unerringly the same: a little distorted bass, jumpy drums, and far too many bad lyrics. They sound like they're trying to get radio play or something, and it just doesn't work. Two songs are least palatable; the opener and the closer, La Breeze and End Of The Day. But simply put, We Are Your Friends consists of Simian going pop, and it hurts to listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Fun!","review":"I will admit I have not listened to the first Simian album but if it's not like this one I may not care for it.

The ability to curve the pieces to join them makes the toy more interesting to play with. However, we haven't been able to figure out how to use more than 8 balls at once, and there are only enough long pieces to make ONE of the many shapes shown on the outside of the box. A better 25-piece mix would have been 10 long pieces, 5 short ones, and 10 balls. The kit as sold has the same number of pieces but is only half as useful.Don't buy this product alone. I wouldn't get less than two boxes, preferably three. This makes it much more expensive than it looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too few pieces","review":"They only came with four long connectors, the short connectors are pretty much useless.

I bought it only because it was cheap and I spend a lot of time listening to books on my long drive to work. The book had moments that captivated me, mostly through honest and charming sentences that seem not to belong in a story filled with unlikeable characters and tedious side tracks into information that adds nothing to the story.I liken it to a conversation with an elderly relative who can take his sweet time telling a story that is, in turn, compelling, disgusting, long-winded and amusing. Because he knows his audience is forced by politeness to see the story to the finish, he embellishes to make it last, but in the end, neither party has gained anything from the exchange.I must admit I was never good with old people, and have yet to finish listening to this tale. From reading the reviews, it doesn't sound promising, but I'll see it through on my next drive to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it and read Minotaur","review":"You'd be crazy not to fall in love with Sherrill's first book, The Minotaur Takes a Cigarette Break. In his sophomore novel-writing effort, however, Sherrill falls short. The writing style hasn't changed much (thankfully), but the characters' interaction/dialogue always seems to teeter between believability and forced plot.The characters are never fully developed with exception to the main character, Benny, who is developed perhaps too much in ways not relevant to the story, such as his masturbatory patterns and having a keen eye for witnessing lewd acts.One strange chapter I'm still trying to figure out why Sherrill's editor left in: Benny reminisces about bluegrass music for 4 pages, a complete non sequitur in the story. I skipped right over most of that...and I really should have done so with the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I can't tell you how excited I was to read this as Sherrill's first book, The Minotaur Takes a Cigarette Break, is one of my all time favorites. Too bad! The writing is fantastic, but I just couldn't get past the heartless, depressing characters. So negative. So low. Ah well, I'll still look forward to Sherrill's next effort as I think he is incredibly talented--he just doesn't put it to use here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Crap","review":"This was the worst book I have ever read - completely tasteless and boring. In fact, I think the author even got bored writing in the end. Do not even waste your time reading this book. It is a complete waste of time. There is nothing to be learned or gained, not even any enjoyment whatsoever from reading the book. Pointless subplots having nothing to do with anything, a main character who does not learn anything in the end but spends a lot of time jerking off and getting away with raping a midget, and a \\"white-trash\\" setting and cast of characters that are only included in the story to give the book \\"character\\" is not good literature. I am so disgusted by how much crap gets published that I am writing a letter of protest to Random House. It's about time attention is spent in publishing quality literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto...Sad Waste","review":"Ditto to the reviewers who panned this book. I find it annoying when a writer of such obvious ability wastes everyone's time condescending to cartoon characters, faux crackers with names like Jeeter, Dink and Doodle, whose incomes are derived from tropical fish maintenance, hash-slinging, and off-hours fellatio. A mash-up of motiveless incidents, gratuitous, distasteful, unkind and grotesque, weakly strung together by the theme of sequential viewing of videotapes left by a young woman whose drowning suicide the hero, Benny Poteat, witnesses. Little information is gleaned in sum and none illuminating. The author could not pay me to raise the least interest in these characters or the story -- he shows equal weary indifference for these former and his audience. Please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read -- not sure why so many reviews are so negative","review":"I picked this up at the library, having never heard of Minotaur. I loved it -- and I read voluminously across a wide variety of fiction and nonfiction. The characters are certainly believable and the side-excursions into various not-quite-relevant-to-the-plot topics are the best part. I *know* people like Benny and Dink. He has captured the true flavor of parts of the deep south. I laughed outloud, I winced, I marveled at the outrageousness of some of the story lines (Max was especially despicable). I swear I could taste the hushpuppies. At heart, it's a darn good yarn. Don't listen to the critics! Just go read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Stars","review":"I am sad to say I would give this book no stars if possible. True, the writing is fine enough; but, paradoxically, this is one of the most disappointing things about the book. Mr. Sherrill has talent as a writer, but his sensibility here is off to the extent that is seems a waste of talent to have written this book. Visits relies on shock value and grotesqueness for its momentum. These are stock items, not creativity. There are parts of the book that I sincerely believe are plainly misogynistic. Writing talent is only half the necessary package; the other half is sensibility. This story has few, if any, redeeming qualities. Mr. Sherrill should have written it and tucked it away, then moved on to subject matter that interests and entertains the reader--and perhaps adds some insight to human nature and to our plights as human beings. All this book does is wallow in stereotypes of \\"white trash\\" culture--if you can call what Sherrill displays here \\"culture.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"It's hard to believe that the same mind that produced the intelligent, moving, and fantastic Minotour Takes a Cigarette Break, wrote Drowned Girl. Visits From A Drowned Girl is indeed a dark book, which I usually like. Fortunately, Sherrill's writing ability showed moments of the magic from his previous book, to keep me reading this one. But I was left feeling empty... what was the point of the darkness? No overall message seemed to eek out... or justify some of the really awful things the main character did. The characters seemed a bit contrived, the dialogue and plot (and subplots) forced and disconnected. Really, a big disappointment. If you are interested in this author (even if you're not) definately read his first novel, skip this one, and hope for better in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lieten up jazz enthusiasts.","review":"Tchicai takes improv to entirely new heights.

However, the new power of the Sarrukh and the information on the Yuan-ti religion contradicts other sources and seems to be setting the stage for a revision of Set's relationship with the Yuan-Ti.I would recomend this book only to those looking to set a campaign outside of the usual areas or those who are very interested in the Yuan-Ti. The Sarrukh are too limited in number and location to be of much use in a gaming sense, though the information about them makes a great read.The background on the Lizard Kings, Nagas, and other reptilian species is specious at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Price - Low Playability","review":"While the book has tons of background info and storyline material, it lacks much in the applicability department.

Well, Mountain's is the best track on this underrated album. Leslie West's harsh bark of a vocal has never sounded better delivering the lines you know so well.

The circuitry on the back of the cammera is supported by 2 watch type batteries. These are permanently attached to the thin layer circuity connected to the LCD screen and other controls.

We did, however, want a coffee pot that made noise. I wasn't sure if the sound effects only worked when there was liquid inside it, but they do! It makes a gurgling/brewing sound when you push the buttons--very cute. We've had this toy for a year without any issues--still works great! It looks really cute sitting on the counter of her pretend kitchen. My husband and I have been served many cups of \\"coffee\\" from it! Well worth $20.

Great job with the $25 play coffeemaker for kids folks.

Where Dragons Fly is a good song, though a bit more tranquil than the rest of the tracks on Symphony of Enchanted Lands. Still, Rhapsody was in fine form for that album, and this studio track is worth the price of the import single.If you're a Rhapsody fan, you're going to want to own this single.

Like the other two, it has redeeming moments. Also like the other two, it is not worth reading through to find them among the tripe. The entire book is terribly anticlimactic. More importantly, it really destroys any suspension of disbelief the reader has managed to work up. Lifelong Pagans suddenly accept modern Christian ideas and doctrine without blinking.

Then I was hooked from the start. I read through the books with bated breath, enraptured by the characters, the story, the descriptions - everything about them. \\"The Endless Knot\\" is no different: written with superior skill, this ending is both surprising and wonderful.

It is yet another well-thought-out well-researched book full of not only a dynamic plot, poignant relatable characters, and unforseen twists; but also a resivoire of knowledge of Celtic mythology. The depth of Lawhead's understanding and interweaving of the myth is breathtaking and brilliant.This is THE best trilogy I have ever picked up, and, though I don't often do this, I forsee myself reading them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book in the Song of Albion series.","review":"A great book, it was a great end to the Song of Albion series.

But I just dont really get what people see in this. It just felt flat to me. There was no three dimensional characters that I really believed in. I was never transported by good writing to the stage where you forget they are not real. I always felt like I was reading a book, and a cliche one at that. There was nothing at all unique or memorable about it. The \\"bad guy\\" (simon) is just a bad selfish guy- no complexity or understanding as to what really motivates it.

This is well summarized by the tale about Gods of creation, told by the grandfather to his inquisitive grandchild. Done in black and white, relatively little dialogue and masterful cinematography, the film provides a painting of the human will to survive, and the humanity that can sometimes be found in the most unlikely of places. There are not enough such films - historic depictions that double as artistic masterpieces. After watching this film, it may be worthwhile to look at the history involved, and to trace America's involvement in the issues. Perhaps this will lead to a broader understanding of indigenous issues related to Latin America, and the School of the Americas as well.

The characters are all real and complex, particualrly one of the brothers of the large Martin family named Francis, who feels society is the enemy. The book is set in a fictional town which is based upon Kerouac's hometown of Lowell, Massachusetts. The novel delves into the life of each member of the Martin family. It spans several years, from pre-WWII to post WWII. The last part of the book has the most \\"beat\\" feeling because it describes characters who are based upon real friends of Kerouac's, such as Allen Ginsberg and Neal Cassidy.

Nevertheless, it's still a fine story, depicting Kerouac and his families' migration from the milltown of Lowell to the urbanized New York City.

The sound track has been kept with it's original music and dialog from Japan. This dvd comes with four different episodes. Parents beware you kids will enjoy the first three episodes. Unfortunitly, the fourth and last episode contains expensive adult nudity seans that might shock young children. Overall this long awaiting return to the American shores has been way over due.

Let me decide what my emotions should be by giving me the FACTS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Her book is as irritating as her shrill voice","review":"Politics invites strange bedfellows. It even bridges the chasm of shizophrenia. First Arianna is a conservative and now she morphs into a falming liberal. The philosophies she espouses now comport with those of the liberals she blasted most recently in her previous book. It's amazing. The women not only has a grating to the ear accent but her writing and ideas grate as well. Talk about a moving target, her adherence to ideals in this book are 180 degrees the other direction of what they were merely 2 years ago!It appears the writer has lost her identity. Not only was her social identity shattered during her divorce, her political and ideological beliefs were literally erased and replaced with leftist extemist views shared by indivudals she previously attacked for years.I do not recommend this book other than to demonstrate the wily ways of a political chameleon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I just finished this book and found it very informative.It does seem like the Republicans should be scared.I also read some of the negative reviews on this book and wonder if the reviewers even read the book. Yes, some parts were humorous, but it also made me mad. As a Republican I am ashamed at all the things we as Republicans are trying to get away with. How dare we put our selfish and immoral interests above the common good? Why are we as Republicans becoming common thugs?This is not a very objective and individualist way to be. In order to be a good person we must help our society better itself. I hope many people read this book and learn what is actually happening to this great country. It seems the Republicans have stopped being objective... I hope this book will bring change.

Quality product, shipped quicklyand great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistake","review":"This product was a huge dissapointment. I bought it to record my class lectures, but without a plug to upload them into my PC, it was pretty much useless. The other problem is that when you record on the high def you can only record for a little over an hour, and the low speed, which records for 6 hours or so, it is very low quality. On top of it all, I only used it a handful of times and it is already broken. I would not buy this product from the seller that I did!!! It was over priced and under productive."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERCHARGE - Shame on you guys!!!!","review":"I would have purchased the entire series except that someone is overcharging. $60+ plus for Season 1 was too high, but I was willing to pay.WILL NOT buy any more of this series.

The Ebay listing (for about half the price) had an expiration date of 10/07. I have found vitamins in stores with expiration dates 5 years or more from todays date.I was happy to pay extra to get here, since I like Amazon and they have never done me wrong. EVERY transaction was ABOVE my expectations.UNTIL this one. The date is 10/07, so I would say they were probably \\"new\\" 2 or 3 years ago. This is similar to buying bread at the store. It is fresh and new about 8 days before the date on the bread. It is about a week old by the time you reach the date.Just writing this to tell others to make sure they confirm the expiration date before ordering \\"NEW\\" from here.Sorry Amazon, you lost your perfect record!

It is too intrusive for background music and too clipped up for sustained appreciation.Let's face it the music was written for a 12th century audience with 12th century tastes; salting it with all sorts of sound-effects and contemporary theatricality leaves us very little of the abbess and what she wanted to say spiritually and musically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music to sooth the savage pagan","review":"I'm a pagan, but I can hear in this music something very special that transcends all the horror the RC church has visited on this planet. But the RCs have a very quirky history, especially when it comes to their \\"mystics\\". Indeed, a great many of the Catholic saints and mystics are ecclesiastical and hyper-dimensional enough to impress a nature-worshipper like me. The purity doesn't need a label. This particular version of von Bingen is a stroke of luck in that a modernist like David Lynch can actually climb out of his absurdist, Samuel Beckett-esque toilet long enough to do something that approaches this delicacy and sublimity. Still, seeing a Lynch film and listening to this CD is mental whiplash. I consider 2 pieces on this CD to be some of the best music I've ever encountered: \\"Viridissima\\" and \\"Clarissima\\". Especially \\"Clarissima\\". If I could only have one CD worth of music, Montgomery's \\"Clarissima\\" would be on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing, spiritual relaxation for the home or car","review":"Breathtaking, captivating, enigmatic...

Compare it with 'Voices of Angels' perfect rendition of the same music, totally unaccompanied - or 'Anonymous 4's almost-as-good offering - and you will agree that there is no comparison. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the?!","review":"Whose screwy idea was it to have a filmmaker(Lynch)produce sound effects for a medieval album?There is much to like in Montgomery's voice but using synth and instruments that didn't exist in the medieval world ruins the recording.Avoid like the bubonic plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ooops!

This album gives me goosebumps from start to finish. Jocelyn Montgomery's voice is perfect, pure, and angelic. Orchestration is beautiful. Lynch's blending of guitar, accordian, inconspicuous synths, etc. is eerie and beautiful. I would guess anyone who likes soundtracks and Lisa Gerrard, Vas, etc. would enjoy this CD. The included Quicktime 'making-of' is interesting as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just, OK... He's not really trying","review":"OK, so he mixed it up on this album, tried a few different things. Just because you do something different, doesn't mean it's good. This album isn't good. It's just OK.I can't vouch for how true country fans feel. I don't like new country, but I've loved Junior Brown's work for years. The rest of the new country music out there is just lifeless, and poppy standard music.... that's where this disc went. The exuberance of his past albums relied on fun guitar work, and silly songs. This album has the silly songs, but the guit-steel (his trademark) just seems like an aside. Overall, this album is upbeat, but stale and very corny. I just don't feel that there is any edge or real soul put into this album. It's very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep one finger on the \\"next track\\" button","review":"We waited three years for this? As a huge Junior fan and frequent concert-goer, I bought the new release unheard, but I was seriously disappointed by the lack of fire on this CD. Junior seems to be trying for a gimmick hit ballad (Little Town Square? Puh-leeze.) to get some CMT airplay, but that's not why we buy the albums. I took out Long Walk Home yesterday to see if time makes the boring stuff less boring. Nope. Now, not all of Junior's slow songs are dull, but Junior should know what we want--we want to hear some strings get tore up. He doesn't record enough to have this many weak songs on an album. This one's going on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junior loses the magic in the studio","review":"While there are some good moments on this CD (although few & far between) Mr Brown doesnt seem to shine on CD like he does live.

Junior's recordings \\"12 Shades\\" and \\"Guit with It\\" are terrific, fun and catchy. \\"Hung it up\\" had hints of calamity forthcoming and \\"Mixed Bag\\" states it with a passion: Junior has run out of musical ideas and won't recycle his good ones, a bad combination. Do not, I repeat, do not buy this. I brought mine home, listened to it, and threw it away. Seriously! I wouldn't even consider selling it used, pawning it off on some other poor hopeful Junior Brown fan. This thing is terrible. He should have put out a live CD instead. I was really disappointed but I saw it coming, so I'm not surprised.

This model Olympus gave sharp pictures with good print (8x10) quality on my Epsom 740 printer. Alkaline batteries do not last every long especially if you use the LCD often. The software worked well to transfer the images into my PC. The only reason I am still looking is that I needed a camera that had manual settings like the Nikon Cool Pix, so I could set the focus rather than being restricted to auto focus. Olympus is known for their better quality lenses, a good reason to consider this camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more film for me!","review":"I've been waiting a long time for a digital camera costing less than a grand with this range of features and quality output. Of course, once you add NiMH batteries and a charger, additional storage, a lens cap strap (a must), a film reader to attach to your PC, a photo quality printer, photo paper....well, OK, maybe it'll take a year or two to pay back :) As pointed out in the other reviews, it takes some practice not to press the power instead of the shutter button - an embarrasing faux pas at this morning's T-Ball game, as a matter of fact *smile...woops!*. It also takes practice to quickly move through the on-screen menu options. It is way too easy to inadvertently choose an option you don't want, pressing this little frisbee thingy on the back of the camera the wrong direction. Plan for 5-6 hours of ramp-up time with this camera, even if you know photography and computing well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eats Batteries, Floppy Disk Adapter is Impossible","review":"Boy, was I disappointed in this one.

I am packing it up and sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great photos, Batteries are MAJOR issue","review":"This camera takes great pictures and is easy to understand and use. It has a MAJOR drawback though, and I may be returning this camera and buying a different one. The drawback.... It EATS batteries ! A set of Heavy Duty Alkalines will barely last 20 minutes (even with the LCD display turned off.)! I bought two sets of 1200 MA rechargeable batteries from Radio Shack plus a quick charger ($60 worth), and can barely get one set recharged before the other runs down. Don't count on being able to fill up your 8Meg flashcard AND download pictures on the same set of batteries!A second NECESSITY is the AC Adapter. Without this accessory, battery life becomes even more of a problem. This should be a standard feature with this camera.We own a Toshiba and a Sony, and neither one of them consumes power like the Olympus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Outdated Model!","review":"The 2000 is an outdated model.

Not a comprehensive book, more information on the author's philosophy is in \\"Beyond Brawn\\" and this book is meant to be a companion to that text. Unfortunately, Beyond Brawn is about five times longer than it needs to be, and the author should have condensed that information down to about 100 pages and made it the first section of this book.

I purchased all 95 episodes on DVD and became hooked. After I finished watching all 95 episodes, I wanted to learn more about Kenshin Himura, the man formerly known as Hitokiri Battousai, the rebellion's most feared assassin. When I learned that a movie was available on DVD that was a prequel to the series, I immediately ordered it and was blown away by the story and artwork. All the questions that anyone may have about the series and about Kenshin's past will be revealed, including how he got his famous cross shape scar and why he became a wanderer. My only complaint is that the dub does not stay true with the translation. All in all, this is an excellent addition to anyone's anime library who is a fan of Rurouni Kenshin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slightly disappointing","review":"Even slightly disappointing, with this video, is still head and shoulders above most anime. There is absolutely no drop in quality from the first video. There is a little less action in this tape (almost none in the first episode), but this is not bad at all; I was almost shaking with anticipation of when Kenshin would start killing again. The character development is more important here, and it is well done. So what didn't I like about this video? It's almost impossible to say without giving away something. All I can tell you is that at it didn't quite seem to completely bridge the gap between the first Samurai X and the Rouroni Kenshin TV series.Don't interpret this as a real negative, though. As drawbacks go, leaving you wanting more is hardly the worst sin the creators could commit. I heartily recommend this video to anyone who saw the first Samurai X or the TV series, and if you like anime and aren't familiar with Kenshin, I recommend all of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"the first time I saw this, my mouth dropped to the floor.

Had them in the glove box for about a month. When I broke open the package and used them the first time, I was left with a windshield that was so streaked I could not safely drive at night. I thought I would try another wipe, and then another, and another, in case my windshield was dirty and I was just spreading the dirt. But these wipes are white cloth, and they were still completely white after using each one, so I do not believe my windshield was dirty.I used Windex to clean the RainX off the windshield, and then just used a moist cloth, followed by a dry cloth to get the Windex streaks off. I use the original Rain-X on my exterior windows, and I swear by it. But I'll never use an interior glass product of theirs again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Do not purchase this product. It actually creates more work than is necessary and is an embarrassment to the Rain X product line. I used these wipes to clean the inside of my windows/windshield (which were fairly clean to begin with) and to provide some fog protection. When I wiped down the inside of each window, it left terrible streaks that ended up making the windows dirtier-looking than I have ever seen them. The only solution was to go back over each of the windows with a microfiber towel...which then removed all of the anti-fog protection. I could have done better with Windex and a paper towel because I could have used the wasted time to put another coat of wax on the car. Bottom line: If you purchase this product, expect to use twice the effort and achieve none of the advertised results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rain-X Glass Smearer Wipes","review":"Can't recommend this product: While it did seem to reduce fogging, it made a mess of my (clean) windshield.

I worked over the windows until I could see through them...but the fogging was not diminished...it was WORSE.This is a useless product no matter the price.

I actually intended to get Rain-X exterior glass treatment which causes raindrops to form beads that roll off your windshield (which actually seems pretty effective, unlike these wipes!)However, I figured I would give them a shot anyway. I tried treating my front and back windshield as well as front windows with these wipes. The instructions on the wipes do mention that a dry cloth must be used, and the wipes will definitely leave your windshield very streaky without a dry cloth.I tried using the wipes both with and without a dry cloth to see if either treatment made a difference. In both cases, my windshield still fogged up as much as before!These wipes are no more effective than regular wet wipes for cleaning purposes either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't work at all.","review":"I apply this product on my windsheild but does not work at all.

Even thought I disliked it VERY MUCH, it got addicting. It was something that was cheap and I could play quickly, even though it was cheezy.

Today I feel a trickle of cold sweat whenever the movie is mentioned.It isn't so much that BILLY JACK is a bad movie as it is an awesomely pretentious one rife with hypocrisy. The story of non-violent native Americans and flower children saved from hysterical cowboys by Billy Jack (who wants to be non-violent but always has to kick butt) is well-intentioned, but from a modern standpoint it is more than just a little embarassing. The production values are so-so, and the cast is merely adequate at best. If you have fond memories of this film, keep them by leaving BILLY JACK in the past: don't see it again. And if you have never seen it... leave well enough alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave i 1 star only because it made me laugh","review":"And whats not to laugh at?

At first, I thought my reaction was unfair, until my kids (ages 10 and 8) started laughing at the movie's best parts! (Yes, I skipped over some scenes while they were in the room). Although most guys agree that the line about \\"this boot\\" and \\"your face\\" is the ultimate tough-guy threat, the movie definitely reminds me of how confrontational everything seemed to be back then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable","review":"How amazing, that here in 1999 there are people still praising this laughable piece of claptrap.With 1971 written all over it, this movie is a joke. Perhaps that is the point, but the hypocrisy is utterly unbearable.With a message of peace and pacifism being promoted with a deluge of glorified violence (Billy Jack beats up anyone who is against peace - now there is consistency for you) it is hard to see how anyone could take this movie seriously 30 years ago, let alone at the dawn of the 21st century.Perhaps this is a must for lovers of camp, but how anyone else can sit through this is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is This Really Necessary?","review":"There's a reason this video is not widely available, and it should be obvious to any one who has had any previous exposure to the film.

My first reaction was, \\"What the hell did I ever see in this?\\" And not because I've become a conservative in my more mature (ahem)age, either, because I most definitely haven't. There's nothing wrong with the basic principals in the movie, but they get lost here. I just think that in your teens, you look at films far more emotionally than critically.This one had medicore to just bad acting, a paper-thin plot, and included almost every stereotype in the book.

That had already made me a Billy Jack fan. This movie was released when I was a high school senior. It was a very good movie. Billy Jack(an ex green beret) used violent methods to protect the school that was run by Delores Taylor.She being a pacifist, does not approve of Billy Jack's methods.The movie is very touching as well as being action packed. Laughlin plays his role very well as does Taylor. The villains in this movie are very bad guys. The scenery in this film is excellent as well. See this movie. You will like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An enigma wrapped in a tortilla, smothered in bean dip...","review":"There's something touching about this film until you really begin to dissect it. Finally, the dichotomy becomes evident: peace-loving hippies and Indians against the 'establishment'. This film managed to enjoin revolution-based politics with brain-baked standards and really took the entertainment value out of movie-going. This looks like a direct antithesis to \\"The Green Berets\\" and remains a symbolic statement that forged a trend in Hollywood. The only things missing were the SDS, the Weather Underground, and the Black Panthers. At a time when the Barrow/Parker gang and Butch Cassidy and the Hole-in-the-Wall gang were being glorified in sweeping cinematic grandeur - just short of a musical - it's no wonder that Billy Jack was standing in the wings. If you really want to get depressed, check out the sequels..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally got people thinking about the Native American again!","review":"Even though it was another cheesy-type drive-inn movie.It did get people to think about the forgotten Native American again, kind of like \\"Dances with Wolves\\".

But the plot writer never gave the poor guy a chance to turn good.By the way, you youngsters, that fight scene in the park was one of the BEST karate scenes filmed to date at that time!!!I rented this movie recently and am embarrassed at the fact that it was 1 of my 2 all-time favorites for so many years.

It is easily one of the most stupid films made. Billy Jack is the quintessential film people of \\"a certain generation\\" recall when they think of \\"native spirituality\\".The native element to the film is, at best, fantasy. For example, the mix-up with the outfits is bizarre. When Billy does his \\"snake dance\\" with his Arizona tribe he's decked out in quasi-Plains garb.

I watch it everytime it comes on TV and laugh my head off. There is so much to enjoy here for a bad movie lover. The dated politics- the Freedom School? The hypocritical message- peace and love and karate chops to the throat. The bad acting- Delores Taylor is so wooden that I think I could make a cabinet out of her. The phony spirituality- the Snake Dance? It all adds up to an extremely humorous look at arrogant, self-important filmmaking. \\"Billy Jerk\\" is one film that is not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"billy joke","review":"Amateurish hippie crap.

This movie is basically a repetition of every hippie myth propagated by the left during the sixties and seventies about all those wonderful losers er dreamers who wanted to sit around do drugs and sing awful neo-folk songs and the (gasp, shudder) the establishment (boo, hiss) who only want to shoot things like horses and puppies and kittens while acting like violent racists towards everybody who isn't a member of the Elks.

I would far rather have given it zero. This book is applicable to nothing in the B5 universe. The characters and setting appear only as a backdrop for an endless diatribe about capital punishment and xenophobia (which, for Mortimore, seems to indicate anyone who disagrees with anyone else about anything.) He presents his political opinions with all the subtlety of a MOAB bomb, and responds to any potential criticisms (how could any be lacking?) with an exceedingly arrogant comment at the end of the \\"book\\".

I promise you will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unremittingly depressing","review":"The writing style is annoying as all get out, but at least there were no typos or misspelled words, and the grammar was fine- that is honestly why it gets 2 stars instead of 1. The characters were very unsympathetic, and I didn't realize until 20 pages from the end that Gustine is supposed to be the protagonist. It's gruesome and ugly, and I felt like it really captured the feeling of working class 1831, but that's a horrible, horrible feeling. Everyone's a prisoner of ugly circumstances, and almost everyone is a deeply flawed person doing deeply wrong things for their own right reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different kind of book","review":"When I picked up this book I was actually looking for another book, but thought this my be a different kind of read. It certainly was. The writer has a unique style of writing that is both interesting and sometimes hard to follow. It is however a very clever story...it keeps drawing you back for more.

Needed to take a shower after reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfortunately disappointing","review":"As a big fan of historical fiction, I thought this would be right up my alley. Unfortunately, the writer uses a tone that is oddly distancing from the action of the novel -- you never become fully absorbed in the time and place. Additionally, the charaters are rather slight (too much action, not enough feeling/thinking). The ending is just flat-out anitclimactic."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting read","review":"I was first drawn to this book by its interesting cover...the stark gray of the town and the vivid blue dress worn by a young woman, standing out like a sore thumb. I read the inside jacket of the book and thought it sounded good so I bought the book. I wasn't disappointed. Though I do agree with some of the other reviewers that it could be a bit confusing at times with the change of narrators, I have to say that over all it was very good and very detailed. Sheri Holman must have studied a good deal about medicine and the poor of this time period because her account is thorough and realistic. The characters are a strange hodgepodge of people that may not be likeable but are most definitely intriguing. I enjoyed this book and hope others will take the time to read it. Ms. Holman is a talent author and I'm interested in reading her other book as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a challenge","review":"As other reviewers have pointed out, the cover blurb to this book suggested an engrossing story. With eagerness I bought it! The author's narrative method, however, is unusual. It changes from third person to third person, plays around with chronology and, occasionally, speaks directly to the reader to form a view about a scene or a character. Frankly, I did not like this approach - I wanted to read a story and instead my mind was being challenged from all directions. This is not a criticism - as you can see from the customer reviews, many people love this book and Holman is a clever writer. But I did not enjoy the style of writing and could not finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it","review":"The cover of this book is beautiful and compelling. That is where the romance ends. In all fairness, the book is very well written and the narrative and who that turns out to be is interesting.

Recommended only for those who enjoy wallowing in gloom and doom."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinated reader","review":"I was completely engrossed in this book. It's so different, so fascinating and surprising, I couldn't put it down. It held my interest, broke my heart, and made me stare like a helpless witness to a car accident. I recommend it to anyone who's looking for something a bit offbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"great in theory; mediocre in reality....","review":"The book started off with such finesse- a great plot, unique and enjoyable writing style, wonderfully complex characters and the promise of topics so rarely written about. Why then did it go downhill??? I still can't understand what happened. I raved about the first one hundred or so pages and couldn't put it down. Somewhere along the way I reached the point where I couldn't even finish the book, save to skim the last chapters. I think the dark subject matter just became too much- cholera morbis, body snatching, class disparities and ignorance...not enough to keep this reader interested or to lead to a positive recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a way to make a living!","review":"I am always looking for books that will take me away to places I can't imagine; to meet people living lives as different from the familiar as possible. I want to go \\"into\\" a book -- leave my place and go to their place. The Dress Lodger will take you to a time and place full of people whose lives are amazingly strange. The difficulties of daily life, the conditions under which lives were spent are drawn by the author with a fine hand. The characters become real and you care deeply about them. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Craft vs. Content","review":"The Dress Lodger is a daring, spine-tingling historical thriller set in England during the cholera scare of 1831. Prostitution, anatomic research, the horror of street life, morbid descriptions of corpses, the gulf between poor and rich are graphically told.Expecting to love this book, I soon discovered that I was both revolted by the honest but gruesome description and absolutely engaged with the writing style. Personal taste for content should not be the overriding factor in a review. Craft must be separated from content. Ms. Holman begins the book with a narrative voice speaking directly to the readers. The voice is mysterious and engaging. \\"Dear readers, you...\\" We are summoned to describe, to draw conclusions, to judge.The book is raw and dark. It is not for the faint of heart, but a discerning reader will appreciate how Holman can captivate her audience.Reviewed by Holly Weiss, author of Crestmont"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastically researched, fast paced","review":"The auther knows the times of the Cholera Morbus and portrays them with riveting scenes of daily life among the poor and uneducated as well as the wealthy and arrogant. Grave robbing, vivisection, prostitution...hopelessness and hope occupy the pages of this book. The historical accuracy is unrivalled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritatingly pretentious and excessively gruesome","review":"The Dress Lodger is one of the bleakest books I have ever read. The story is dark and lacking in any kind of subtlety, the descriptions of grave-robbing, autopsies, and death from cholera are morose and gruesome, and the characters are unrelentingly unsympathetic and grotesque. Moreover, there is too much going on in the story. There are too many lives whose stories are being told, too many points of view. The author seems to tell the story both through the eyes of different characters and through the eyes of an omiscient narrator whose identity, when revealed, is simply unbelievable. By the time I reached the book's inconclusive conclusion, and realized that I didn't really care about any of its characters, I felt manipulated and just plain annoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry","review":"I will join the small number of reviewers who did not find this book fascinating or captivating. It was slow, dry and dull. I found it did not hold my attention and thus remained on the bookshelf collecting dust. Despite several attempts to get back into the book, I was simply unable to finish it. I may try again; however, it is more likely that I will send this book to the used bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too \\"out there\\" to be believeable; couldn't finish","review":"The truth in the streets of Sunderland was probably not far off the in-depth descriptions, but I could not finish this novel. The first few chapters grabbed me, but as the characters became more intwined with one another, the plausibility decreased to the point that I found myself skimming. Gustine was such a pathetic creature, perhaps the most admirable. The others were far from human and the story became so twisted that it lacked credibility. The historical background for old England and the potteries was my favorite part."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not authentic","review":"I grew up in a working class neighborhood not far from Sunderland. As I read the book, the language just did not seem authentic, and that really started to bother me. Eventually, I read the bio: she lives in Brooklyn! The book has been spun around xeroxed, careless research. I give it one star because the author did a poor job getting into the hearts (excuse the pun) of the people. It takes more than a visit to the Sunderland public library to understand, deep down, the goodness and frailties of the people."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the Point?","review":"The Dress Lodger was a pathetic try at a book meant to make all of mankind question themselves. Instead of doing this; asking what we would have done without the stolen bodies and mistreated poor; the author digresses into frogs and evil secretaries and handsome prince charmings. This could have been the historical novel destined to rock the world of medical science. But it simply becomes a grocery store paperback with research to back it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Enjoy Reading","review":"I did not really enjoy this book from the character stand point. The majority of the characters were wrapped up in themselves and I was not able to really visualize them. Gustine's evening occupation was not at all glamorus. There were also many examples of \\"racism\\" with characters from the upper class towards the lower class. I do realize that this was a factor in the 1800's but I did not like reading about it. The writing style, such as \\"dear reader\\", was very confusing. I did think the historical points in the book were some what interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new style of historical novel.","review":"This one graphically encapsulates the horror of abject poverty in Victorian Britain and gives it voice through the mouths of its brittle, degenerate victims. Multi-level plot, loaded with shocking intrigue. Skillfully written in a taut, acidic style. No florid text, syrupy romance or latter-day Dickens here. Great dust jacket graphics as well.Author Sheri Holman is a force to be reckoned with. She ranks with the best of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly Insightful","review":"The Dress Lodger is a miraculous story of a young girl's persevering attitude to achieve what is most important to her despite all odds. Changes in the point of view throughout the book only adds to the creativity and intensity of the plot. Wonderful story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are depressed, save this book for later!","review":"Cholera epidemic, poverty, prostitution, grave-robbing.... Could have been written by a deeply depressed Charles Dickens.However, this really was a very good book, difficult to put down. The prose is well done; it is obvious Holman was meticulous in her research of both historical and medical detail. The uniqueness of the plot will keep you reading in spite of its bleakness. This is not a light read, and as a caution to readers with sensitive natures, you really shouldn't read this if you aren't emotionally ready for it. It's humorless, but deep -- far from dull. Fans of historical settings and character analysis will appreciate this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your usual \\"historical novel\\"","review":"This is a terrific novel,and not only because it has a gripping plot (which it does); it has that rare quality which I can only, for lack of a better word, call world-creation. A great deal of historical fiction, however painstakingly researched, reminds one more than anything of *other* historical fiction. Holman's book doesn't: it gives you a sense of place, a sense of things happening -- with a kind of doomed intensity -- in that place, which seems completely original. I've done enough reading in the area to know that this book is very accurate about its historical \\"sources\\" (body snatching, the cholera epidemic in the area). But what I loved about the book was how little that mattered -- just how caught up I was in the world the writer created.I'm saying too much: this is a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"I couldn't put it down......The unpredictability of the secret narrators was an outstanding literary twist. And while some may have found it gruesome, let's face it, the cholera epidemic wasn't pretty. I think the descriptions were probably fairly realistic. I only wish the ending would have been more fulfilling. Unfortunately, after deftly establishing the characters and their plights, it seemed like Sheri Holman ran out of steam. Despite this, I'm still recommending the Dress Lodger to everyone I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment.","review":"This book was highly recommended, and a big disappointment. I did not enjoy the writing style at all. If I hadn't read the jacket description, I would never have figured out the plot. I pulled the bookmark about 1/4 into it, and I rarely do that. The only good thing to say about this book is the speedy delivery by Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying to read, don't waste your time","review":"I could not wrap my head around this book. The writing was just strange. It was like the author was trying to put me into the story. It was written in the present tense which I found to just be annoying. I couldn't concentrate on the story because of it.Too annoying to continue with it. It wasn't worth it. one and 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing..","review":"Loving history, rich detail, medicine, period pieces, I was anxious to read this, but absolutely could not maintain interest. I didnt care about the characters, nothing they did moved me, and I didnt feel anything exciting from the period. Reading it felt more like an assignment than pleasure. If you want to feel the real excitement of being there, being educated and richly entertained while reading, try Ken Follet's \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" - (this is not a spy novel)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mysterious Love","review":"Wonderfully imaginative invocation of a bygone time, with a cast of characters and an atmosphere worthy of Dickens."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried, but could not get into this book","review":"I tried, despite my feelings from the beginning that I would not like this book, to give it a chance. From the first page, I had a hard time getting used to the writing style...I could not like any of the characters, even though I tried to keep an open mind. I finally put the book down and am trying to think of someone I know who might enjoy it and I can't come up with one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to say the least","review":"I've had such great luck getting book recommendations from Amazon based on previous books that I've purchased (The Reader, The Mark of An Angel, Girl in Hyacinth Blue, Girl with a Pearl Earring) I thought that I couldn't lose with this recommend. How wrong I was.I found this book unengrossing, slow and tedious. The story just drags. I wanted to scream GET ON WITH IT. I didn't care about Gustine, the Eye, Pink or Henry. Why would I? These characters were completely undeveloped. Similar to some of Anne Rice's books in which Anne goes on forever with some historical description (but interestingly, I might add) the author of this book puts the reader to sleep with her writing.Help! I need a really great book after this one. But on a positive note, I guess four out of five ain't bad. Thanks for the mostly wonderful suggestions, Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't make it past page 120","review":"When I read the other reviews posted, I thought we must have been reading different books. While I ordinarily love works of historical fiction, I found The Dress Lodger to be, in a word, irritating. The author is the literary equivalent of someone who talks too much simply because they like the sound of their own voice. When I finally gave up at page 120, virtually nothing had developed in terms of plot. Lastly, I thought if the author referred to me as \\"dear reader\\" one more time, I would vomit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, researched....UGLINESS!!!","review":"If I could,I would give this book ZERO stars. Although it is a well written and researched historical novel, I kept asking myself \\"WHAT is WRONG with this author!?\\". It seems she has a perverse delight in all the ugliness she describes in utter detail (without a shred of redemption or hope). It is unnecessarily macabre to the extreme and describes utter and complete ugliness, depravity, perversion, cruelty, and despair WITH ENTHUSIASM AND RELISH. ALL ugliness, ALL the time. It's unrealistic.After reading this novel, the most abject horrors described by Charles Dickens, would seem like paradise in comparison. Holman REALLY \\"gets into\\" the grotesque and disgusting. Sick Sick Sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious- grisly - depressing- morbid","review":"I bought this book based on the strength of the advert in the book club and was looking forward to reading it. What a surprise when I got it! And what a dissapointment. The pretentious narrator destroyed any sympathy I could have had for the characters of this grim, grisly and depressing depiction of this period in English history. I found the constant 'dear reader' cloying and distanting. If Ms. Holman thought she would become the modern equivalent of Dickens with this book, she couldn't be more wrong. Her loving detail with the death scenes is morbid in the extreme. Dickens wrote a lot of grim detail too, but his characters were filled with hope and love and the promise of redemption. These characters are not!I can't remember what author said it, but this is not a book to be tossed aside gently, it should be thrown with great force against the wall. I'm just sorry I can't give it no stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating & Vivid","review":"The Dress Lodger draws you in, with its second person narrator inviting you to come and see what he or she sees - a young woman in a bright blue dress. And so the book continues. You are told nothing; the scenes are drawn for you, and you must interpret what you \\"see.\\" The symbolism and parallels with today's political and ethical questions would make this fascinating book for a readers group. Some readers, however, will probably be repelled by the almost too-vivid descriptions. The Dress Lodger is not a book for the faint-hearted or easily nauseated.Sheri Holman compares cholera with AIDS - that some people believed it was deliberately spread to thin out an unwanted population. You could also compare Henry's anatomy lessons with, say, stem cell research.The ending seems a little too easy, but then it may not be the real ending - it may only be a fairy godmother's wish for the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"I read more than half of it and just couldn't stand anymore. A filthy disgusting place with plagues of frogs, dead, dying,murdered and dissected bodies, a one-eyed despised old hag, a dirty, mistreaded urchin named PINK who has a ferret with the normal name of Mike,a prostitute plying her trade in the dirt who has an infant with a grotesque heart deformity, on and on of the worst of the worst...and if any of this sounds interesting, it ain't! Moves along like molasses and is quite boring despite this weird, complicated collection of characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dress Lodger","review":"Because I loved \\"The Mammoth Cheese\\" by this author, I thought I'd enjoy this book as well. I just could not get through it. The story line is vague & confusing & the writing is belabored & boring. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grim, Gripping Grave-robber Yarn","review":"Sherri Holman has done a wonderful job of historical reconstruction in this novel. She recaptures the world of the town of Sunderland in 1831 with great skill. One of her most fascinating creations is a old woman known as the Eye who never speaks just shadows the dress lodger of the title. I suspect some readers might have been helped by having some material on the Burke and Hare murders of 1829 which preceded the events of this tale and formed a necessary background. However Ms. Holman's narrative grip is so sure that the reader quickly forgives and forgets this minor inconvenience, having some sense that whatever Messrs. Burke and Hare were up to, it was nasty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new","review":"Well, it's been about 7 years and psychology hasn't been turned on its ear. I suspect that this book and its author are perturbed, but I can't think of a reason that they should think otherwise. The book is vague, barely readable, very obtuse. If a new paradigm is to be found in psychology, I think it will be understandable to the masses, not just the intelligentsia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great help as long as you don't really need it!","review":"If you're over 40 and looking for hope and you've completed all the S1 stuff he talks about earlier, then you'll like this book. If you didn't, I feel very sorry for you because you'll still have the perfect ability to understand the hopeless situation he describes you as being in and then just leaves you in with no chance of moving forward. In other words, this is a typical product of our self-satisfied generation of \\"To h--- with you, I got mine, look how smart I am!\\" medical types."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretense","review":"This book is fairly pretentious in that it makes a lot of noise about changing psychology, and it comes with lots of recommendations, but really it doesn't say much at all. For instance, it calls homosexuality \\"sexual behavior\\", and never really addresses it. I suspect the author is of the belief that one can \\"develop\\" beyond it to heterosexuality; I, however, do not believe that. It smacks of the Reagan era, which was way repressed. On the other hand, the book OKs abortion, so political ideology is probably not behind this book.But it just doesn't seem to merit its \\"groundbreaking\\" subtitle."},{"rating":"1","title":"epiphany, or not?","review":"It seems that this book either offers the reader an epiphany (unconditionally), or that it does not, with concrete reasons. Count me amongst the unepiphanied. I found that it did not really say anything relatable to my life. I did not find it groundbreaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"one star is too many stars for this book","review":"Frankly, I didn't get it.The author makes a huge case for type 1 and type 2 abilities being our maturational building blocks, but about the only ability (which would be a type 1) he feels comfortable actually discussing is the ability to say \\"no\\". Well, I say no to this book. I'm not holding my breath for a revolution of any kind to come from this book. Save your time and your money.On the other hand, if you are looking for something to blame for something that went wrong in your life (like a failed marriage), you might enjoy this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Now what?","review":"Well, I read it. Now armed with all of this \\"knowledge\\", what the h-word do I do with it? I really don't feel any better off having read this than I would had I read a volume of Portuguese haiku (and I don't speak Portuguese)."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting but not monumental","review":"My hat's off to you if you finished this book. Doubly so if you got something useful out of it.I had problems with the author's conclusions. For example, he concludes that abortion is ok, but I thought that we had that with roe vs. wade years ago.I don't think that this is a work that will endure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Newly revised?","review":"If you are on some kind of Healthy plan and are thinking of using this book to help you plan your eating when you are not at home, think again. The last revision of the book was in 1991 and several of the Restarurants and Brands listed no longer exist. Of those that do, watch out. This book includes listings for menu items which no longer exist, or which were changes within the last few years.Unless this book is updated, this is not a good resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too old to be of any use","review":"Almost nothing in this book is current enough to be helpful. You are much better off using the online sites of the food manufacturers and restaurants and, if necessary, doing the math to figure out how the carbs, proteins, and fats translate into food exchanges.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Data","review":"This is the second edition (1986 & 1991) but should have been updated four more times to be up to date. There are a lot of foods now on supermarket shelves that were not available 20 years ago as well as some things covered that are no longer on the market. The data that is there is helpful, but there are too many gaps to make this a good choice for someone needing real help today."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Diabetics Brand Name food Exchange","review":"The book was a little late arriving but did arrive in excellent condition. Even though this book is a little old, it still contains a lot of valuable information. I was well pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's Really Good at One Thing and It's Not Relationships","review":"I always enjoy reading about people's adventures, large and small, and I enjoyed this book as well. Breashears is a great mountaineer and has the will and ability to conquer many challenges. However, as the chapters pass, and Breashears earns my respect and compassion through his experiences, he loses the \\"heroic\\" label with me when it came to his marriage. His lack of effort to understand and nurture his relationship to Veronique places him in the \\"workaholic\\" category with me. I should write an autobiography about my successful marriage and failed attempts at mountaineering. All in all it is a good read and we are only human, even Breashers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"High Exposure by David Breashear, is about his life experiences that indulged him into attempting and doing the impossible. Breashear's passion for mountain climbing and hiking is described through his adventures in Colorado, Tibet and other parts of the world.Breasher's book is really good for people who are interested in reading inspirational books. David describes how he pushed his mind, body, and soul to its limits through his hikes and climbs around the world.One thing about High Exposure that wasn't eye catching dealt with David's childhood and what influenced him to climb. In his book he explains what made him develop a passion for climbing but with little detail. It makes the reader wonder why didn't he use the amount of detail described in his experience across Tibet? Overall the book was very motivational. After reading the book, you'll just want to overcome any obstacle in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for any adventure seeker!","review":"David Breashear's writes in a captivating and entertaining style that makes you feel as though you are an observer on his expeditions, not a reader in your living room. For anyone with dreams of scaling such peaks as Everest, or if you just have an adventurous spirit, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"insightful look into the world of mountaineering","review":"Facinated like millions after Into Thin Air, I eagerly anticipated the arrival of legendary David Breashears memoir. It delivers on two levels-first it is a very personal account of why and how he got where he is, and second the thrilling insight into what drives men and women to pursue the adventure of the mountains. Highly reccomended for those looking for both a great adventure story and a telling biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, compelling, a MUST read","review":"Mt. Everest is a passion and a curse, this is the essence of \\"High Exposure.\\" While spending time developing his childhood, the author eventually gets into the best part of the book; Why climbers climb mountains? The consuming passion for climbing is elequently told by a man who has given us the IMAX images of the world's tallest mountain. His time on the mountain and in climbing recounts the good and the tears of mounteering. Mr. Breashears takes the reader on each climb as if we are taking each step and deciding on every movie shot. The time, talent and sheer guts of filming on Everest is totally facinating. If you have read \\"Into Thin Air,\\" this selection is A MUST READ. I've been able to see the IMAX film \\"EVEREST\\" twice. After reading this book I wish I could go see it again, now with a deeper appreciation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for giving me a new goal in life!","review":"Like another reader who submitted a review, \\"Into Thin Air\\" was the first book about climbing I had ever read. In 1996, as the Mt. Everest tragedy unfolded on the news, I was filled with misdirected anger at the people who, in my opinion, had sacrificed their own lives and ruined the lives of their survivors in an egotistical attempt to prove themselves. After reading \\"Into Thin Air\\" and then \\"High Exposure,\\" I can completely understand the quest. Although I'm well past my climbing days, I now feel a strong pull to trek to Mt. Everest and see and feel its magnificence.The biographical information gives us an important glimpse into the psyche of the climber."},{"rating":"1","title":"TWO THUMBS DOWN","review":"Let's see, the decision-making and wisdom of Rob Hall and Scott Fischer are questioned, but the author sees nothing ridiculous about Sandy Hill's outrageous behavior? I agree with the earlier reviewer--there's something amiss with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Exposure","review":"What I found most fascinating about this book, his life, is the fact that Breashears manages to make a living out of his passion. Times were certainly hard for him in the beginning but he made it. Not only does he manage to make a living but in doing so combines his other passion (filming) with it, through this he gets to travel and see other cultures. As a European, now living in the US, I find this enviable. I am somewhat surprised that other reviewers are hung up on his failed marriage. While I certainly feel for his ex-wife (and him!), I see his father's disapperance as the great tragedy in his life and it reminded me of Jon Krakauer's theme in his book \\"Into the Wild\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, But Not Gripping","review":"I must agree witht he reviewer who commented about the book being written by committee. The narrative is choppy and lacking not only key details, but also historical background. Because it's an autobiography, I don't necessarily think that it's fair to damn the book for being self-centered; it IS about him. I do feel, however, that the book needs better editing and a bit more self-examination.It's an okay addition to one's list of books about Everest expeditions - which I must admit, I've developed a morbid fascination with after recently re-reading \\"Into Thin Air\\". I wouldn't, however, use it as my primary source for information or impressions."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's All About David","review":"I was gripped by Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air and wanted another viewpoint on the 1996 tragedy. There is a bit in here about that but it is mostly All About David -- the autobiography of an intensely self-focused individual. When he meets his future wife, his thought is, \\"this is the perfect partner for me\\" -- and that, to me, says it all. It is also poorly edited. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"320 pages of the same content...!","review":"OK, so the book starts out excelent then it soon drops and fast. After about the third chapter it becomes just about the same stories after another. And he isn't the best writer so it is hard to stick to the book. It gets all my 2 thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Technical","review":"It seems that everyone wants to profit from the recent Everest disaster. I did a lot of research on it, and in my opinion, the best book written about it is still Into Thin Air. Skip this book, as well as Ken Kamler's Doctor on Everest (who was on Camp II all the time), both of which are filled with tremendous conceit and lack of flow. This book was especially a pain to read, because of a lot of technical info that resembles an instruction manual. The stories of the childhood are especially clichéd and melodramatic. I think the audiovisual media is still the best way to depict the excitement and dangers of mountain climbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below","review":"I have not read this book and after attending a promotional event with Mr. Breashears tonight in Burlington, Vt. I wont read this book. Mr.Breashears is obviously in the Krakauer camp, as when he was asked about Anatoli Boukreev he replied by liking him to waiting in the \\"parking lot\\" while his family was in danger at the top of the mountain. He failed to mentional that Boukreev was the only one who actually saved anyone. When asked another question his reply was \\"I'm not here to talk about the Imax movie, I'm here to talk about my book\\". . .this after giving the audience a hour slide show discussing the making of the Imax movie. I was extremely disappointed to see that Breashears has joined the crowd of apologists for the events of 1996. Of course he didn't get paid for his endeavors in making the Imax movie, yet he comes on as such a purist it makes you sick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down In Ole' Moulin Rouge!","review":"On 1974's 'Nightbirds' Patti,Nona and Sarah all make it clear that when it comes to stanky,sweaty New Orleans R&B and funk they will be the undisputed female champians!\\"Lady Marmalade\\" was of course Labelle's big breakthrough single and likely what they'll always be remembered for but the trio also deliver several other funky tunes in a similar vein such as the title track,\\"Don't Bring me Down\\",\\"All Girl Band\\" and \\"Somebody Somewhere\\" and these gals truely give the music their all.Patti Labelle and Nona Hendryx never have belted out stronger then they do here and Alen Toussaint's organ and horn heavy arrangements give every song here,even the two ballads a big,punchy sound.But it's not a disco thing-it's all about that hefty rhythm and alot of funkiness.A superb place to introduce yourself to Labelle if you already haven't and just a damn great CD to have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME ALBUM!!!","review":"Never mind this being my favorite Patti LaBelle album (which it is), it's my all-time favorite album, period. Of course, the infectious \\"Lady Marmalade\\" has a lot to do with it. It reminds me of the times it used to play on the radio back in '75. As a 3-year-old then, the only thing I can remember liking about the song was the part after Patti says,\\"...silky smooth\\". The \\"Ahhhhh!\\" afterwards always intrigued me. Now, as an adult, I can listen to the whole song(and album) and appreciate it for it's musical creativity. The album as a whole is an eclectic musical journey... from soul to gospel, from funk to pop and from ballad to straight-up disco. The best 36 minutes you'll ever spend! These girls rock!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Labelle (Nightbirds)","review":"Of the many female vocal groups I've heard over the years in any category, Pop, R&B, Gospel etc. None in my opinion could out sing this group.

I was astonished that anyone would have the gall to ask $21 for a regular size bottle of syrup. Seriously, this is crazy talk. Yeah, it's pretty tasty, but you would have to be an idiot to support these clowns in their attempt to pick your pocket like this. In Hawaii, the exact same article is about $5 and targets tourists, because anyone who truly wants this would just make some from scratch. It's not hard, the ingredients are easily available at any grocery store, and home made does not have the chemical aftertaste. It doesn't even take long to make, and you can easily have it done, fresh, if you start the same time you begin to cook your pancakes.

The embossed design on the front cover looks authentic and gives aspecial meaning to me because I also blow the large shofar. The other 2 sets I bought are going to be for gifts---one for a friend who now is studying Hebrew and loves to journal, and the other for a sister who plans to go on a trip to Israel next year, who will find this journal very useful in ministry. This journal will be especially meaningful to me as I am planning to fly soon to Amsterdam in route to Germany (most of the stay primarily in Berlin), and then in Poland and returning to Berlin before returning home.

However, if you are looking for pure erhu soothing music, this is not the one for you. I like some of the songs on the CD and based on the review, thought this CD would be the one for me. I'm so disappointed after listening to it. 1) background music is too loud! can't even hear the erhu sound if you are not close enough! 2) each song is just the short easy version of the original song, and since the erhu sound is so low, I can't be convinced this player is really as good as it described."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traditional Chinese Erhu Music Album","review":"Excellent for a traditional Chinese sounding album. Nothing modern or cheesy about it. This was a fantastic buy. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Legend in Green Velvet","review":"First two chapters are history of Bonnie Prince Charlie. Some sentences written in the Scottish dialect. I found this book to be very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Elizabeth Peters?","review":"I find it difficult to believe this pedantic, clumsily-written novel is by the same author as the delicious Amelia Peabody mysteries. Where is the wit, the good plotting? As outlandish as the Peabody books are, Peters writes so well in them that one gladly suspends disbelief. This book seems more like the effort of a not-very-talented undergraduate in a creative writing class. How disappointing! The narrator doesn't help; did she read the book before recording it? Inflections are inappropriate, the heroine comes across as a ditsy dame, and the male protagonist doesn't seem to know whether he speaks with an accent or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly readable mystery set in Scotland","review":"This is a delightful mystery set in Scotland. While the mystery is a good one and the characters interesting (Susan, the Scottish history buff and James, the son of Highland nobility), what is most fun is the very atmospheric evocation of Edinburgh and the Highlands. Peters manages to convey lots of Scottish history and legend in this book while keeping it very readable. I highly recommend this for anyone travelling to Scotland. It will heighten enjoyment of the trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"insightful performance by a talented new singer","review":"The previous reviewer is fair and accurate in his evaluation of this disc, but I'd like to add my two cents' worth also, since few people may have heard of Christian Gerhaher and he is a superb talent. I heard Gerhaher's New York recital debut at the Frick Museum a few years back, and it was most impressive. He has several other excellent Lieder recordings as well, but this is perhaps the best. It certainly has been well honored in the musical press, with rave reviews from Opera News, The Sunday Times, The Guardian, etc. Gerhaher has intelligence to burn, but he also makes an immediate, personal, and passionate connection with this music. Throughout the performance there are small details that are fresh and engaging. All in all, a wonderful insight into Schumann by an exciting new singer, and the accompanist Gerold Huber is similarly fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK OK","review":"I read the reviews for this book. Some say it is advanced, others say no prose etc. First and foremost this is a openings manual, therefore either you need it or you dont. It is useful if you play regular tournaments, since you can carry it with you and refer to the lines at the end of the game. It is like any other MCO or whatever. It is a personal choice which one is better, and I dont think it makes a big difference unless you are of and IM or GM strength.As I said it is a good book to have if 1) You play tournaments regularly 2) you can find one under 15 bucks. If you just play blitz on ICC or at the local club then this book is of little use to you.A word of caution opening books are like PC's they get oudated rather quickly, but then again unless you are a Garry or Vishy that should make little difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nunn's nothing","review":"I am an 1189 player who believes that Nunn's Chess Openings is worth nothing more than a paperweight.

The concerted effort of the authors to update and revise previous opening classifications may be the book's most attractive draw. The space constraints are obvious, however. The introduction is two pages long, and there is no name index. Beginners may be overwhelmed. Intermediate players, on the other hand, will find the compendium useful but lacking in pedagogy. However, the space constraints may be most disappointing to expert players. They may take exception to Nunn's decision to include only the \\"most viable\\" lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"I get the heaves","review":"There seems to be a great deal of controversy and backbiting over this one, and that is tragic, because this set is not worth all the commotion. The whole Ralphs/Clapton thing doesn't matter, because Ralphs wasn't that good, and Bender is even less adept. Hunter's voice is ragged, the whole set is sloppy, and it would seem that the only reason for releasing this thing was to fulfill a contractual obligation. Reviewers, if we must disagree with each other, let us do so respectfully. Let's review the album, and stop the character assassination. Are we not capable of better than that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"By the time this album was recorded, Mott was pretty well washed up, as this performance will attest. Mick Ralphs (who was no Eric Clapton) had departed, and Ariel Bender (aka Luther Grosvenor) proved to be even worse than Ralphs (this was before the arrival of Mick Ronson, who was far better than the other two combined). This album offers a tired band slogging its way through a ho-hum set. There is simply nothing here that Mott hasn't done better somewhere else, which makes this a rather uninteresting listening experience. Avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"There seems to be considerable controversy regarding this one. As an avid admirer of Mott the Hoople since their early days, I must confess that this set is somewhat disappointing. It is certainly true that the band had nearly reached the end of the line by the time of this recording, and much of the playing here was less than inspired. Ian Hunter talks too much throughout the set, and poor old Luther (Ariel Bender) Grosvenor proves that a hack by any other name is still a hack; he just doesn't seem able to adequately fill the gap left by the departure of Mick Ralphs. Pete Watts and Dale Griffin were still on board, and Morgan Fisher plays adequately, but the performances are rushed, sloppy, and seem to scream the fact that the members of Mott no longer really cared. In fact, this entire album seems to be mere \\"product\\", meant to fulfill a contractual obligation, a sad epitaph for a once-great band who simply threw in the towel."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very handy book with nice hair styles.","review":"This was a very nice book to find. The styles inside are easy to execute and classic in look. There were styles for all lengths of hair, although women with very short hair will find the selections for them limited.

The eyecup installs painlessly (although with a lot of friction). However, if you pay attention, the exit pupil of the magnifier is much smaller compared to that of the camera's eyepice, and so your field of view through the SLR system will be limited. With glasses, it's just borderline unusable. Without glasses, you have to press your eye very close to get the benefit (and it's a nice benefit). However, the materials this product is made out of tend to reflect and flare, putting glare into your eyes. Not cool. Needs protection against stray light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proof in pudding","review":"I own an E-300 and a bag full of manual focusing Olympus and Pentax lenses, which I use in addition to some auto-focus 4/3rds ones. As a glasses wearer I was constantly adjusting my diopter and straining to get things into focus when using the manuals, the result being perhaps 25% of my shots being unusable.This little magnifier makes a big difference. On several recent outings I had absolutely great results. Most shots sharp and clear. There is a bit of a downside in that I have to work a little harder to see the readout in viewfinder, but I really don't need that.Don't expect an eye-popping change, but a change you will notice.Good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Virtually useless","review":"I can barely see a difference in E-500 viewfinder with and without ME-1.

Very disappointing. I knew it was only x1.2, but now it's clear it's not even worth bothering..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I really didn't find this product helpful. The magnification is 1.2X which is really not much. Both my husband and I couldn't tell a difference from the original viewfinder. Olympus should make a higher magnification, and should build it into the camera (and not charge you $30+ extra). I plan on applying my refund to an expodisc instead (this is a product that helps with white balancing)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Quality wise this item, like everything else Olympus, was high in quality, fit and finish.

After reading the first few scenes of the book, I was reminded of the Spencer Tracy film \\"Bad Day At Black Rock\\", a great movie which is also a modern western. Both book and movie deal with a war veteran returning to find something about the family of a dead brother-in-arms. The similarities end there. Silver Rock deals with Tully Gibbs' efforts to mine a valuable but forgotten claim with his friend's father. There is little action and a standard subplot involving a girl, a jealous boyfriend and Tully's guilty secret.

Prior to the release of the album I had read Spoon River Anthology and thought it clever enough for early 20th century poetry. I never would have guessed Richard Buckner could have made it so listenable. Upon listening to \\"The Hill\\" you realize the words of Edgar Lee Masters were simply made for Richard Buckner to sing. All of those dark gothic tales fit perfectly with his style. This is the ideal soundtrack for an evening alone with all of the lights turned down, a glass of bourbon on the rocks, and a contemplative state of mind. It's like being able to peer behind the sunny veneer of \\"The Waltons\\" and see the seamy side of American life during that much-romanticized time. If you're a fan of Buckner, then you need this one. Yeah, the fact that it's just one long track is rather inconvenient, but it's worth an entire listen everytime you put it on. My only complaint is that it isn't longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Wailin' since Willie","review":"Ably supported by the core of Calexico, Richard Buckner has delivered a stunning 'concept' album on a par with (and possibly superior to) Willie Nelson's 'Red Headed Stranger'. Archetypal in vision, the suite of songs and bridging instrumental pieces tranport the listener to a world of angst and longing with a conviction and power rarely heard in contemporary music. Chiming acoustic guitar work and restrained bass and percussion underpin the most important instrument - Buckner's voice. The emotional power on songs such as 'A.D. Blood' is simply breathtaking. The only disappointment is the brevity of some passages - I wanted them to go on and on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had to spin this one 20 or 30 times.....","review":"...before I felt I could review it :) This may well end up being my favorite Buckner CD.

I had heard of the book but had never read it, so I picked up it and the CD both today. While I miss Buckner's lyrics, the fragmented phrases almost in code that I don't always comprehend but do always enjoy, the melancholy that runs through most of his work is amplified here; for each of Masters' poems is the voice of one of Spoon River's dead, buried on the Hill, encapsulating their life and how they met their fate. The music and Buckner's voice are enthralling. I leave him with four stars based on half-a-dozen listens today but I wouldn't be surprised if it grows to a five-star album with time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worldbeat-Jazz-Fusion","review":"From the 1st percolating sounds on the synth to the last smooth saxophone passage, put this disc on and dare to enter the kingdom of musical heaven.

I guess you can't trust amazon.com reviewers, they'd give anything four stars. I understand there are a few nice solos here, but why the disco beat, that just cheapens everything. CHEAP, 2nd rate bargain basement jazz, with more disco than jazz, and yes I like Miles Davis' B*tches Brew, so it's not that I don't get the concept of fusion.

Interpersonal peace, peace in the family and community, world peace, and most importantly, peace within oneself. His words reflect an ancient wisdom which is simple yet so profoundly insightful. In my opinion, his approach to solving emotional suffering and curtailing society's ills dwarfs many theories of modern behavioral and social sciences. This is a work to be read and reread. I also recommend Thich Nhat Hanh's \\"The Miracle of Mindfulness\\" as a complement to this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, Simple, and Sound Advice","review":"Beautifully written, simply delivered.

That is the energy that I got from this book. The excercises in this book for keeping yourself in the present moment are so easy and he teaches you how to do them even when you are washing the dishes which I have tried and I can say I actually like doing my dishes now. All I can say is this book is great, but that is my opinion you will have to read it for yourself to truly understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard-Boiled Classic","review":"Halo For Satan is still my favorite of the Pine novels.

The stereotypical image of Nixon as the hunched over, brooding character has been done so many times before, that it would be interesting to see someone really attempt to play him as he really was.That being said, it was entertaining at times and the actors did a good job. However, many liberties were taken with history and it wasn't all quite as it was protrayed. Just be prepared to see a very loosely based portrayal of actual history. In reality about 2.5 stars for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The interview as chess match","review":"The Bottom Line:Though it probably wouldn't have gotten a best picture nod in a stronger year for cinema, Frost/Nixon is still a fine drama that doesn't demonize Nixon in the way that's become boring over the years, instead setting him up as a eccentric but worthy adversary to Michael Sheen's Frost; with a large cast of character actors ably backing up the two leads (though Rebecca Hall doesn't have much to do aside from look lovely) and an intelligent script, it's quite a good movie.3.5/4"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Thinking Person's Film","review":"First of all, I want to say in my own opinion Frank Langella and not Sean Penn should have won the Best Actor Oscar for Frost/Nixon. He is simply amazing as Richard Nixon and most of all he makes one of history's most odious characters human. He is very appealing and while he's not someone you emphasize with you pity what he did to himself, all thanks to Langella's acting.I have to also say that the rest of the movie is equally well acted and well directed. Given its historical perspective we can't say this is a suspense film but we do find ourselves at times wondering what will happen next. There are times of great tension and I for one liked the one on one interview style with the non-lead actors as it gives a great deal of perspective to what is not only taking place on screen, but what is happening in the characters minds.This is a great film and well worth your time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film","review":"\\"Frost/Nixon\\" is a very well done film directed by Ron Howard that explores the post-Watergate interviews of Richard Nixon (Frank Langella) conducted by British television host David Frost (Michael Sheen). The film chronicles Frost's desperate attempts to land and finance the interviews, as well as his poor preparation for the first three sessions, which are completely monopolized by Nixon. Frost finally gets his act together by the time it's time to discuss Watergate, and the interview ends up being one of the most successful pieces in all of television history.I really enjoyed the film. Excellent performances by Sheen and Langella are supported by a wonderful cast that includes liver Platt, Sam Rockwell, and Kevin Bacon. I definitely recommend this film to any political junkie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frost/Nixon","review":"It was one of the strangest episodes in television history: a self-promoting British TV personality was able to arrange a no-holds-barred interview with disgraced former president Richard Nixon. It's an inherently compelling tale, and Ron Howard's Fresh Best Picture nominee Frost/Nixon is a taut, tense historical drama. Michael Sheen stars as David Frost, who was able to coax Nixon to sit down after three years of silence; though Nixon expects softballs, Frost turns out to be a bit more than he bargained for. Frost/Nixon is a superbly acted character study, filled with razor-sharp dialogue and a palpable sense of time and place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be famous for your dinner parties!","review":"Go out and buy this book and you will be famous for your dinner parties.

Coupled with \\"From Chocolate to Morphine\\" (another must read book) a reader will have a great fund a basic information about drugs and our relationship to them.

Many references are given to stories mentioning Manx strings, Scottish strings, Finnish strings and Lapp strings.I found this to be a real boring book. I had hoped that this book might provide some stories about Finnish or Lapp wizards or folktales, but was profoundly disappointed.

I was disappointed at the rave reviews on this site vs. our experience. I would have preferred the Sephra fountain, even for the extra money--but I didn't have enough time before my event to have it shipped. The only thing they manufacture is chocolate fountains and provide you with chocolate that doesnt require adding oil or pre-melting, so I suspect it may be a better quality and easier to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit working the third time I used it","review":"The first two times I used the fountain it worked wonderfully. I offered it to a friend for his wedding reception (I personally assembled it and added the chocolate) and all was well the first ten minutes it was on -- then it just stopped. It continuted to heat the chocolate in the well so people could dip their strawberries, etc., in the well, but the auger didn't work. Thus, the chocolate didn't flow over the tiers, which totally ruined the aesthetic effect of the fountain. I might as well have put a pan of melted chocolate out for people to dip into.

Just insert the center tube with auger, snap on two tiers, melt six bags of chocolate chips, add some oil and wallah, instant delicious cascades of chocolately goodness.We like strawberries, bananas, pretzels, marshmallows and firm angel food cake.We ran it for two hours with absolutely no problems and it was the hit of the party.Cleanup is also relatively quick and easy.Do yourself a favor and go get one of the these for the holidays...you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ist chocolate fountain experience ....Success!","review":"I used this fountain during my son's 1st birthday last Saturday and it was a big hit.

So as long as you don't ever end up with a damaged part, the motor doesn't blow, or you don't lose any parts then you're ok. I asked the customer rep at Rival how they were going to honor their one year warranty if they don't make them anymore and apparently the warranty isn't valid anymore because of this.

I was expecting hot.Second, the reviews that talk about all the vegetable oil being added are correct. And as the party went on, more oil had to be added. Oil added to chocolate chips doesn't taste very good.I would MUCH rather have real fondue that's hot and chocolatey! That way you can add liquors or other flavors, experiment with different chocolates, etc.With the Fondue Fountain, by the time guests returned to their seats, several commented that the chocolate had \\"hardened\\" from all the oil added. Yuck.Also, be prepared for the size. Ask yourself, \\"Where am I going to store this big box?\\"Just my honest opinions. I'm sticking with the real fondue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use the Right Chocolate","review":"I have two fountains and they both work well now that I know what I'm doing. I used to use chocolate chips, but I couldn't get the mix right and I either put too much or too little oil. The oil does effect the taste slightly and it just looks gross pouring it all in. We had lots of troubles when we used the oil.We then found SF Signature Fountain Chocolate, which is for sale here on Amazon or it is also available at Target stores. I went to their website also which is www.sweetfountains.com. It works great and the fountain flowed perfectly. No oil needed and simple.

I bought higher quality chocolate chips, and they did taste better than the cheaper ones. You mix one cup of oil in for 4 lbs of chocolate, you can't tell it's in there at all when the fountain is running. Put out a plate of marshmellows, cookies, cubes of cheesecake, and cake, dessert is done and mmmmmm! For around $20 you can serve dessert to 20 people. Clean up.. well, you have to put your hands in there and get them covered with chocolate to break the parts down.

Sure, the title may help it sell, but its what is inside a book that matters, which in this case is nothing more than fluff and boring material.

She came across as so articulate, energetic and intelligent that I was really looking forward to reading her work. After struggling through about the first quarter of the book, I have had to admit defeat and replace it on my shelf, largely unread. The writing is painfully banal, and downright boring at times. The issues raised seem very familiar to anyone who's thought about race, culture and gender, but no new insights come from their telling. Much is explicitly spelled out for the reader, where better writers would have built enough richness into the characters and the dialog to carry the point without further explanation. Serros clearly had a lot to say when interviewed in person, but her writing isn't mature enough yet to be in print."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This was book was a required purchase for a course I was taking!

I seriously doubt that this book would have been published if it were not written by a Latina, during a time when Chicana fiction is finally (and justifiably) exploding. Unfortunately, when you move past the \\"Chicana\\" theme here, which seems exploited in this case, there is nothing of substance left to this book. What you are left with is some very poor writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Taco Bell of Latina Literature","review":"Serros makes a few mildly entertaining observations, but she in no way matures as a person through her writing. That is something that every good memoir must entail. The writing is childlike. The observations have been made before, usually by better writers.A good chunk of the book is used for Serros to assert her superiority over whites. She makes sweeping generalizations about non-Latinos. If a white writer did that they would be run out of town on a rail (rightfully so).I'm your average white, middle class American. But I have several years of studying Spanish and Latino literature under my belt, both for fun and school. I've read stories that were much more compelling than this one.Try Julia Alvarez, or Sandra Cisneros if you're looking for intelligent Latinas. Try Serros if you're looking for shallow mediocrity..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Chicana Writers to Choose From","review":"I read most of this book, but it was like pulling teeth. I was trying really hard to give this book of short stories a fair shake, but I had to put it down. What happened here? I happen to be chicana, but I cannot relate in any way to far-fetched, predictable and seemingly phony stories. This was a real stretch in creativeness and humor. Published chicana writing that is as poor as this lowers the standard for all chicana literature. We deserve better than this. Makes me wonder if she got published just because she seems like a good chicana \\"product.\\" What does this say to the truly talented chicana writers out there? Sandra Cisneros, Esmeralda Santiago, Ana Castillo, Julia Alvarez and others - this fake, commercialized generation of chicana can't touch you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chock full of stereotypes","review":"How come every white character in this book is racist in some way? Surely somewhere in her journeys Ms. Serros must have run up against some intelligent, compassionate white people. But apparently not.

Some of Michele's stories are funny, even silly at times, and other stories plainly reveal the day-to-day prejudice one has to endure becuase of the color of one's skin. However, Michele's writing is a bit juvenile and simplistic. I would recommend this book to a younger audience as some adults may find it a bit tedious and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taussig's fetishism about Taussig","review":"Mick Taussig's fetishism with fetishism is shown at new levels in this book. This pomo work of fantasy is almost a parody of the stupidity with which anthropology has retreated from a world inhabited by real people with real problems to a never ending exercise in self exploration. This book shows Taussig to care only about himself and his whims in ways betraying not only his own narcissism, but that of contemporary anthropology as it praises such self important musings while ignoring the voices of other cultures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't quite cut it","review":"I bought this bit in the hopes that I could miter cut some 0.8 mm laminate before gluing it to the material so I could get a proper corner joint and avoid the ugly black line that comes from straight trimming laminate. Sadly, it didn't work. The tolerances are just too tight and it's nearly impossible to keep the cut straight enough (even with the router table-mounted) to join the two seams. Plus, you've got the problem of needing to cut at least one side before gluing, which is tough to do well with laminate. Finally, the bit had a tendency to separate the clear coat from laminate a little.This bit would probably work well with a thicker, non-stratified, natural material. Sadly, that wasn't the use I intended it for, nor what the promotion indicates it is designed for, so I have to consider this an expensive failed experiment.

Somehow I didn't pick up on this, so it was disconcerting to have the thing end so soon. But that's not important. What's important is the vast glowing cloud of melancholy that emanates from this film. It's not despair... but it's not hope, either. It just is what it is. (The short about the girl and her cat -- told from the cat's point of view -- has the same magical quality.) When it was over I sat there motionless for several minutes, looking at the dark grey screen, with a quiet mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspires an Unfamiliar Feeling","review":"When this began I was skeptical; the animation wasn't too terrific and the dialogue seemed simplistic.What a difference 15 minutes makes.For some reason you find yourself gaining empathy for both of the characters, who are realistic, kind, and strong. The more they exchange words across their phones and the time between each message lengthens, the more you want them to be together. They are children, and at the same time, adults. I'm not sure that I would recommend this short film for a single feeling, but that feeling...I'm not even sure what it was. Almost bittersweet, not quite melancholy, close to comfort. What I think it may have been was passion for the human race--their strength when inspired by love.I'd say to rent it first but, if you can't, then you may want to spend a few dollars for some newfound hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short, interesting, mixed in quality","review":"This is a 30-minute work made by a single artist. The story is somewhat reminiscent of Haldeman's classic SF novel \\"The Forever War.\\" The artwork is variable... the characters themselves tend to be poorly rendered and at times almost grotesque. On the other hand the imagery of the fighting mechs are very well done and fascinating. The story itself is reasonably satisfying although very angst-filled.The DVD also includes some very interesting extra material including an interview with the artist and one of his earlier works which is quite good. Overall you wont get much for your money.

It turned out to be one of those things we regular folk just don't get. Now I love anime in most of its forms, except gratuituous mecha. I had hopes for this one as a good, sci-fi topic. It might have made an impression, had it been a bit longer. As it was, its hardly worth the money for a 25 minute runtime, when I was expecting a bit more of a movie.I've seen some excellent award winning, short animations, where the animation itself told a great story. I will admit there are a few parts like that in this film. Unfortunately, there are also time wasting, still shot moments, which should only be part of a longer piece. In the end, I was left with a lot of questions, and maybe that was the point of it all. I still hate it when the existential artists make something, and their patrons tell us we should all like it. If you like thought pieces OK, but I'd still advise renting this one first."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're looking for trite angst, this is the movie for you","review":"I think a lot of people get worked up about Voices of a Distant star because it was done by one person and because of the sound track. While both of those things are impressive, the plot, dialogue, and characters are not. One is almost forced to wonder why the two \\"star crossed lovers\\" bother keeping up their correspondence. By the end of this movie, they seem to have about as much of an emotional connection between them as I have with they guy who bags my groceries. Maybe less.Considering the length of this anime, it has a disproportionate amount of still shots. There's no climax or resolution. Because of the length and the lack of an ending, I actually thought I had read the box wrong and picked up the first episode of a longer series and not a movie.I normally love sad anime, but I would say Voices of a Distant Star is a force watch only."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice but too short","review":"this is one very well animated movie.The problem is,its only 30 min which makes it more like an episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa","review":"This is the first anime that has left me actually feeling something after it is over; for once it had a little more to it than awesome action, cool characters, and a descent story.

First of all, if Mr. Shinkai had wanted to make it longer, he would have. Second of all, to say that it's \\"too short\\" is like saying that a piece of haiku poetry is \\"too short.\\" It is obvious that Mr. Shinkai did not set out to create a feature-length movie, but rather something far from it. Sometimes, profound and moving things can be said with the fewest words and images. Not to belabor the old cliche, \\"a picture is worth a thousand words,\\" but, as Mr. Shinkai mentioned in the interview included on the disk, he began with the simple image of a girl sitting in a cockpit and holding a cell phone.

This book was written in 1944, so it is dated as far as relating to current issues, but it has so many \\"gold nuggets\\" from which to expound on for further research. The book deals with men like Pershing, Billy Mitchell, and Gutzon Borglum (of Mt. Rushmore fame). The book also deals with men like Sir Basil Zaharoff; who supplied both friend and foe with armaments during World War 2; and in turn made tremendous profits in the process.

The SD card contained an entire Africa photo safari that I recently returned from.

Its a large screen, quite visible and clear. I scanned several 100 photos from our family albums and wanted to view them in chronological order. Unfortunately, the frame only does slideshows in alphabetical order. So, to view the pictures chronologically, we had to change the name of each file, putting an index number in front (0001, 0002, etc) so that it could show them in chronological order.

When she put the CF and SD cards in, they did play continuously, but she had no control over the photos at all. The mp3 files did not play, nor did the avi files on the cards.I sent the product back to Amazon for a refund, as they say they are no longer stocking this item.

It seemed surprisingly brief for a novel, but perhaps brevity is a virtue when one has not so much to say. While I suppose no one is fond of lawyers, and it IS a work of fiction, I did not find the attorneys in the book to be very believeable. However, in one area, the author truly excels. His ear for the behavior of your stereotypical white trash rednecks is tuned quite finely. Write what you know best, I say.

But more like a Jerry Springer Show.","review":"This book was somewhat entertaining on the beach, but in all reality was just eye candy and offered no nutritional value. The characters portray all Southerners as gun-toting, fist-fighting idiots who eat Crawfish ettouffee for breakfast, lunch and dinner.How many times can an author write a scene about the main character beating someone senseless and continue to make it interesting? This book will surely push that boundary.Loose plot ends are tied up in a paragraph or two in the last pages of the book, leaving the other 300 or so pages to describe in great detail just how tall, attractive and physically brutish the main character is (modeled after the author's self-perception?? perhaps)This book might as well be called \\"Sins of the Author\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"main character is a jerk","review":"The day his brother is buried, that evening Tom (the protagonist) is [messing around with] his brothers girlfriend.How's that for unprincipled.

Dr. Svendsen, while apparently capable of parsing biblical Greek, cannot repair to an English dictionary to learn the difference between ordinate sexual attraction and sexual lust - an inordinate sexual desire - and in his misunderstanding complains that the avowedly celibate pontiff is criticizing healthy marital relations.

This book \\"Cahokia the Great Native American Metropolis\\" is great if you want to learn much more about the interactions between the archeologists themselves, and not much about the culture of the Cahokia people and the archaeological site.

Once the game gets going, its almost impossible to tell where things are going to land with any precision, and I found pieces constantly dropping where I didn't want them. Part of the reason also, is because the pieces take a minute to float over to where you want to drop them, which is completely ridiculous. (definitely not part of the N64 game) You'll think its lined up, only to have it drop a couple spaces off. I've been able to get my score up to 130,000 on the console version but can't even make it past 5,000 in this game. Terrible adaptation from the console game.The N64 version is by far my favorite game for the console though, and it is pretty addictive, which makes the PC version all the more frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memory Upgrad for Dell Dimension 2400 Series","review":"Great price and what a difference this made in my 5+ year old computer speed...everything was easy and fast....simple to install and am very pleased with this product...just as described."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't believe how it revitalized my old computers!","review":"We had 2 old Dell dimensions that were working sooo slow.

To start off the controls freaking suck to a large extent. When aiming your sniper rifle for example, you will notice how it won't seem to stay on target, like it's being weighed down by something heavy so aiming for your target is too damn hard. Your grenades can be useless too because when you throw them they can roll down a hill even if they are spot on to a enemy which made this game even more infuriating play. The gameplay is total crap as well! Yay! IT PLAYS LIKE AN INCREDIBLY POORLY MADE ROLE-PLAYING GAME BECAUSE YOU AND YOUR ENEMY TAKE TURNS TRYING TO KILL EACH OTHER. Aside from the broken gameplay, broken camera, and broken controls the only positive thing I can find in this game is the humor, that's the only damn thing that's good.

Felt Mountain","review":"You know I love Goldfrapp and that's why I was highly disappointed with this album. When I was first introduced to this group I thought how amazing they were. First there was \\"Felt Mountain\\" which I consider in my top five, a thoroughly amazing album! Ambient, Dark, weird with a touch of winter trip-hop. Then came \\"Black Cherry\\" a 180 degree turn from \\"Felt Mountain\\". It was everything that \\"Felt Mountain\\" was not - lustful, glam, with a touch of 80's Electo-rock. A fantastic album in it self, though not as brilliant as \\"Felt Mountain\\".\\"Supernature\\" - Goldfrapp's Pop Hour. This album I like to think of as \\"Black Cherry\\" part 2 or a lesser version of that album. Moving towards dance remix land and pop. This album sits on the edge of alternative and mainstream. Much too polished and not interesting enough to keep you sticking around.Sadly this is a throw-away album from a fantastic band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"A total sell out album.

From their first release in 2000 (Utopia)they just keep evolving. Getting better and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stellar Achievment","review":"And a shining example of how to do electronic pop the right way. Incredibly sexy but not vulgar. Instantly and ridiculously catchy, but not lightweight and throwaway. Completely accessible but with just enough edge. And all the better because it seems Goldfrapp are just begining to tap into their collaborative creativity. Alison's voice has never sounded better. Call me crazy, but I hear the timbre, pitch and phrasing of a young Olivia Newton John in Miss Goldfrapp's voice, and NO, that's not a bad thing; it is perhaps the highest compliment I can pay her. Supernature is by far the best album I've bought this year. By all means get the bonus pack with the DVD. The 5.1 Surround mix is incredible, and the extras are a real treat for longtime fans and newcomers alike. Forget Ladytron, forget Miss Kitten, forget Scissor Sisters, forget Fischerspooner. Goldfrapp ARE the future of electronic pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goldfrapp has sold out?","review":"Dah! What a little sell out she is. OMG, this is just about the most furthest thing from her first album as one can possibly get. I feel like she pivoted fan against fan, and the only fans who know anything about good music would be on my side (the one star side). This album sucks! lame, lame, lame. Total disco sludge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot, Hot, Hot","review":"As a 57 year old music junkie, I was beginning to think that innovation would not strike again in my lifetime, but I am simply blown away by Goldfrapp. She simply oozes sex, and takes electric to a level I never dreamed of. I just hope they get more main stream exposure. I want people to know what is out there. The appearance on Letterman really helped the cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive boring electronica.","review":"The album is sterile, cold, dull, repetitive electronica, with a passionless vocal track. If that's what you like, you'll like this. It doesn't do anything for me. It doesn't repel me (like rap), but provides nothing of interest for future listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few AMAZING songs and then a melange of vocal styles","review":"I found \\"Supernature\\" a bit hard to come to terms with, even after a few listens. Inside it, there are moments that I love beyond reason: the catchy synth-based opening track and \\"Number 1\\", and the ethereal \\"Let It Take You\\", where Alison Goldfrapp uses her vocal assets in a unique way.There are other moments here, though, where I hear a melange of Blondie's Debby Harris (\\"Ride a White Horse\\"), Garbage's Shirley Manson (\\"Lovely 2 C U\\") and -above all- Madonna's \\"new\\" sound (\\"Fly Me Away\\", \\"Slide In\\") where new wave-like keyboards are brought back to life in interesting, yet not as innovative ways.The album works. It really does. However, it can't get more than four stars, because giving it the same qualification as her first album, \\"Felt Mountain\\", would be completely unfair. At the end, you too may end up feeling torn about it, but finding yourself enjoying it. However, I highly doubt this production will age as well as her debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"21st Century Glam!","review":"\\"Supernature\\" is a continuation of the electro-dance sound of \\"Black Cherry\\" with a few touches of \\"Felt Mountain\\". One of my favorite songs is \\"Ooh La La\\" in which Goldfrapp channels some serious T. Rex mojo. Other glam highlights include \\"Lovely 2 C U\\", \\"Ride A White Horse\\", \\"Slide In\\" and \\"Number 1\\". Fans of \\"Felt Mountain\\" will love \\"Let It Take You\\" and \\"Time Out From The World\\". The deluxe version has a DVD that's tons of fun. In addition to the videos and photos is a 5.1 version of the album (for only a dollar more than the regular edition!) On the video of \\"Ooh La La\\", I'd be truly surprised if Alison and Will hadn't studied performances by artists such as T. Rex, David Bowie and Roxy Music. The outfits and poses are a terrific homage to these '70's rockers from which Goldfrapp was clearly inspired by this time around. So get your platform shoes and bell bottoms out and Rock On!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!

However, I must be honest when I say this cd is not as a great as Felt Mountain, but it is better than Black Cherry. On this album, the music can only be described as \\"out-of-space glam\\". Songs like 'Ooh La La' has the appeal of a purring dance party, while 'Ride A White Horse' pumps funk to keep the party going. The haunting 'Let It Take You' slows the music down, while 'Koko' relives Kate Bush from the 80s. My only issue with this cd is its not as cutting edge as Felt Mountain. However, because Goldfrapp still beats to their own drum, they probably won't find an audience here in America. Only a few music lovers who wants something different, like myself, will take a risk on Goldfrapp.On another note, Madonna took alot of her styles on her Confession On the Dancefloor from this group. So I think fans who love music owe it to themselves to check this group out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supernature will fly you away","review":"This deluxe edition worth every penny.

Unfortunately, I was wrong. While two tracks on the album--Devi and Jaya--are well thought out and played, most of the other songs are too diluted, commercial, or slick-sounding to be substantial contributions to the subgenre.Too bad. This could possibly have been much better, but when you have a song with lyrics like \\"Strange, strange world, it's incredible\\", or \\"Endless sea of hope, unlock the mysteries\\", you know you're very likely in for a bumpy ride. The musicianship is actually quite good in places--the sarangi master Ramesh Mishra certainly gives it his all--but here, the whole is decidedly less than the sum of its parts.A good one to pass up."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent work","review":"This text is as in-depth in its survey of all the major and minor figures after Vesalius as it is approachable.

He has a very nice vehicle mode, though with fairly questionable colors. In robot mode, his head sculpt pays a nice homage to the G1 character \\"Wheeljack\\". Cannons can be attached to his shoulders, giving him a very powerful look. His cyberkey gimmick allows a really cool-looking claw to pop out of the car grille. This gimmick works in both modes, but looks better in car mode.

In this case building a deck can mean little more than building a simple platform and from there, expanding on your idea to whatever extent one chooses. How far one goes with design will likely depend to a certain degree on space, lifestyle and financial resources. There are some great ideas here for furniture, planters, etc. and the photography is quite appealing. Wondering what to plant around your deck and where? This book offers some really great suggestions.

The menu has no setup to get rid of it and worse than that the logo was underlined in red so it was a real eye sore to watch the movie. I would have never bought it if I knew that. Love the movies but hate the logo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calming and Intriguing","review":"I read this book to prepare for a term paper this semester -- stumbled upon it at the library merely by chance, and I'm glad that I did. Moore takes an unusual look at the soul, drawing upon Renaissance thinking and Greek archetypes as well as his own experiences in the Catholic church. It's easy to follow and inspirational to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half good/half bad","review":"The concept of valuing what makes us human and befriending our true selves is fascinating. Moore writes with eloquence and is thought-provoking, but he has obviously never suffered from depression (to which he devotes a chapter) and this raises doubt as to the credibility of the remainder of the book. Depression is not some kind of poetic melancholy or boredom. It is a deep pit of despair where reality is distorted beyond recognition. The only thing I have learned from depression is to fear and distrust it. I have retrieved this book from the trash because the final chapters intrigue me, but I will read it with skepticism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely boring","review":"I love books but this book is seriously boring.

I know nothing about Thomas Moore, but I supposed he should be very interesting because he was a religious man. So, I liked the book; it was also interesting to see the Jung ideas developped by somebody very different. Unfortunely, the translation of the book in Romanian language is horrable; so, I am not sure if the things that I don't like are becasue of the author, or because of translator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had high hopes for this book as I thought it would address spirituality in a humanistic way. At first, I thought I agreed with the 'accepting of self' philosophy, but gradually statements made by the author just didn't ring true. I kept on thinking that maybe I was resistant to the reevaluation of my own thought processes, but gave up when the author spoke of a patient who found out her husband was cheating on her and the author's response was that she had control issues (!?!) and was acting like a victim. I think at that moment, perhaps she feeling victimized. But instead of telling her to 'embrace her victim', she is a control freak. Then he presents depression like it is some kind of choice, instead of a chemical imbalance. Perhaps depression can spawn creativity, but you have to be able to get out of bed first -- and that is a problem. I gave up on the book after that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nonfiction for the literary lover","review":"Being a student of classical literature, I have very rarely found nonfiction that can speak in the same language to which I am accustomed. This book is deeply profound and challenging--perhaps the most evocative approach to psychology I have ever encountered.It is especially helpful to those who enjoy literature. It is artistic and aesthetic, yet still very, very helpful for practical use and everyday living. I have found myself challenged deeply towards personal and spiritual fulfillment, and have been recommending the book to everyone that I know.My husband and I read it together and are continuing to sift through its richness. No other book has been able to so completely shift my spiritual and psychological paradigm effectively. This is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Remarkable Journey","review":"As an avid reader, many books inhabit my homestead. None of them have been so transcending as \\"Care of the Soul.\\"\\"Care of the Soul\\" is a journey into cultivating the very essence of living each moment to it's fullest. This book transcends all others. Whether you are wanting to cultivate the spiritual, physical, interpersonal, or business side, this book will lead you along the path to experience your dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book for understanding depression & other nuerosis","review":"The new paradigm Moore presents for psychology is extrordinary! He permits people self respect and an avenue for growth within depression or other mental disorders. Should be a must read for every one."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"excellent book on the subject of the soul and spirit. moore's prose can be dense at times but is always rewarding. this is book that i have given as a gift to friends and family and like to return to myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book with Soul","review":"I got a review copy of this book when it was first released almost 20 years ago, and the title and subtitle--\\"A Guide for Cultivating Depth and Sacredness in Everyday Life\\"--intrigued me immediately. Moore's impressive credentials moor his powerful take on life. The book has--how can I say it any other way--soul. And it helped me find mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Claptrap","review":"\\"Soul\\" turns out to be something like \\"pornography\\": Moore cannot define it, but he knows it when he sees it. Everybody knows he or she has one (do they?), and all of the world's troubles can be attributed to sick souls...whatever they are. Since Moore never really pins down what \\"soul\\" is, he does not have to worry about being consistant or inteligible. He is free to intrepret dreams, Greek myth, and Jung in whatever way fits his thesis--which seems to be that people are complex and they should accept their complexity. Do we need a book for that? Moore talks about the troubled people he has seen in his theraputic practice, but I am not sure he ever talks about helping them in any meaningful way. (I have to admit that I gave up halfway through the book; life is too short to waste on New Age claptrap like this.) Since he is only \\"caring\\" for souls, not \\"curing\\" them, I guess it does not make any difference, but I ache for those people who found this book a help and a guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spirituality for white men","review":"I bought this book because I had been led to believe that it challenged existing beliefs--it was supposed to be something spiritual, not religious. But Moore's work is a continuation of a tradition in which god is male, the truly spiritual are those who use rationality to overcome emotionality, and all is right in the world because white men are in charge. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly irrelevant","review":"I bought this book without hesitation, and I regret it. After the GREAT book Journey of Souls by Michael Newton, I have become very interested in matters of the soul. Care of the Souls does nothing but rehash ancient mythology without applying any analysis to real life people. I don't know how anyone could find this book aspiring. Aspired by what? One chapter talks about how one should be depressed from time to time for the fuller understanding of the soul. I cannot remember the last time that I was depressed about anything. I've have made choices in life that have made me very happy. Why would I be depressed? Does that make me less aware of my soul? Absolutely not! I found the author to be very well read; however, he does not have the SLIGHTEST idea who he is or what a soul is. He is clearly unaware of his."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, painful","review":"This book was atrocious.

I would like to consider myself very intelligent, but this book is not an easy read, at all. I found myself rereading pages just to try and understand it.

Would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul Searching","review":"Insightful and consicely written about esoteric topic.

I appreciated the book's mythological language and metaphorical imagining. I especially liked the way Moore used paradox to reflect wholeness. I also liked the lesson that all things are teachers, whether negative or positive in appearance, when we let them be. I would highly recommend this book to seekers who are ready to embrace reality and are through with analytical fixatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious, dry and BORING!","review":"I excitedly bought this book after hearing wonderful things about it from friends, fellow students and teachers. I was profoundly disappointed. Moore never actually guides one through \\"cultivating depth and sacredness\\". He lectures about subjects that the average reader cares little about. There are a great many books out there that are infinitely more accessible to the common reader. I suggest that they be sought out. This book is thoroughly unenjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too abstract","review":"The book is too repetitive, I didn't even make it halfway through.

Despite earlier comments to the contrary, the 39-year old Leontyne Price is still very much in her prime here and does some really terrific singing and acting. Carlo Bergonzi is an excellent Riccardo, full of lightness and elegance and humor. Reri Grist is the perfect page, in lovely voice with flawless high notes. The always wonderful Shirley Verrett, though a mezzo, sings the contralto role of Ulrica with firm tones and excellent musicianship. There was a comment that Robert Merrill was past his prime here. I can tell you that he is in better voice for this recording than he was for the Traviata he made with Joan Sutherland in 1962. I was amazed at just how good he sounded and what an all around fine job he did. I also own the Ballo with Pavarotti and Margaret Price, et al. Even though Pavarotti is a fabulous Riccardo, the RCA recording is superior overrall, especially because of Leontyne Price."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Bergonzi... but not Price!","review":"Au début des années 60, Decca a sorti un Bal masqué avec un Bergonzi à la fois lumineux et incisif mais sous la direction hautement discutable de Solti -dont la conception analytique du son se trouvait d'autant plus accentuée que c'était le péché mignon des ingénieurs du son de Decca. En 1966 RCA sort son propre Bal masqué avec Bergonzi qui n'a rien perdu de ses qualités. La direction de Leinsdorf, précipitée mais sans la brutalité de Solti est homogène. Malheureusement Amelia est Leontyne Price, une chanteuse avec certes un superbe timbre mais chez qui l'intuition remplace trop souvent la technique.

Not much break-away here, nor anything we haven't heard before from the red-head."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wonder...","review":"As a product of the Joni M, Karla Bonoff, Bonnie Raitt, Wendy Waldman et al, generation, it's hard for me to understand why Ms. Kimball's music hasn't made a bigger splash. Her music has depth, yet her melodies stick with you like good pop songs. Her lyrics appeal to my sense of past intimacies and emotional rememberences. I suspect that it's just a generational 'thing'. I like thoughtful and complex music and I grew up with it. If you did the same, you'll love this..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful debut from ex-Story member","review":"When I first saw Jennifer Kimball's album, I was a bit apprehensive given her lack of songwriting input in the Story. I bought the CD anyway, and the result far surpassed my expectations. Not only is Jennifer a wonderful singer and vocal arranger, but her songwriting is excellent. Her songs explore a wide range of moods and emotions. For me, though, the highlight of the album is \\"Take One Step\\" with its mix of coy romance and mystery (Argentia? It's a harbor town in Eastern Canada. Learned that from Jennifer herself). \\"Veering From the Wave\\" is a wonderful album that is sure to please fans of the Story and of singer-songwriters in general. Take my word for it - I've bought three copies to give to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genesis on Bible Prophecy","review":"Another good prophecy book by Pastor Hagee. In this one, he covers 30 Revelations of Truth that we can find in the book of Genesis. From the Garden of Eden, to Joseph, and how it relates to prohecies fulfilled and those yet to be fulfilled. Hagee demonstrates a deep study and knowledge of the Hebrew culture. He also describes the 7 ages of Dispensation. From the Age of Creation to the Age to Come, the Kingdom of God. Worth picking up this book, if you are interested in Bible Prophecy and the book of Genesis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sean Granger commentary","review":"What is interested to the educated reader (Christian) is the author's use of the formed Earth in describing how the modern science and the book of Genesis do not condridict one another.

The only thing going for it was it was pleasant enough I wasn't ashamed to have the kids watch it, it was just bland and boring. Movies like \\"A Christmas Story\\", \\"Miracle on 34th Street\\", and \\"(The) Santa Claus\\" are much more entertaining and can also be watched by young children.Also, didn't realize it was a made-for-TV movie, but it was pretty obvious as I watched it since it had the darkening scenes you always notice right before the commerical break, yuk."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Want a Christmas Movie for Kids, It's OK","review":"If you expect Leslie Nielsen to stop his trademark bumbling slapstick acting which he showed in his \\"Naked Gun\\" series; and if you buy the idea of Santa with amnesia, give another star and make it three. As I don't either, excuse me for my low rating.So, if you want to buy a Christmas present for your kids, and thinking about a harmless and amusing one, \\"Santa Who?\\" will do. It is good-natured, and though slightly sexual relationship is implied (between the two adults), it is nothing you might be embarrassed with when watching it with kids.However, if you seek for more profound and thought-provoking one, how about \\"Miracle on 34th Street\\"? Both the original and the remake (featuring Natalie Wood and Mara Wilson respectively, and they are so cute!!) are great, I assure you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad waste of great comic talent","review":"A film that fails to deliver, even with such obvious comedic talents. Not only does Leslie \\"Naked Gun\\" Nielsen appear as Santa, but Steve Smith of the US \\"Red Green\\" show had a supporting role. Sadly, they are but ancillary players (Smith's role was sadly unnecessary), playing second fiddle to a bachelor who argues with his girlfriend's son about the existence of Santa. The son is not very endearing as the faithful child, and many plot points are unnecessarily delayed. (Can we say \\"idiot plot?\\") Nielsen's comic potential is needlessly squandered. Red Green fans would never accept that their hero could be overcome by Tommy \\"In Living Color\\" Davidson, who plays an oversized elf. A waste of two hours you will never get back. Life is too short for bad movies like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Santa Who Review","review":"Very excited to have found this movie on Amazon, as it is one of my favorites and I didn't want to have to rely on finding it on TV every Christmas.

I personally didn't like the \\"I hate Christmas\\" track either as compared to the \\"I hate people\\" track from the movie. It definately softened his hatred, which misses the mark completely. Alberty Finney plays an awesome role going from the most bitter and angry scrooge on film to the most jovial and friendly scrooge on film which is what makes the movie so great. As for the music, this disc lacks a passion that the movie disc has.Apparently the CD of the movie musical does exist...there was someone selling it on Ebay and they claim it's not dubbed from an LP or taken from the movie. So who knows ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"But we WANT the soundtrack from the MOVIE!!!","review":"The reason for all the negative reviews isn't necessarilly a reflection on the Birmingham cast. It's because the FILM was so wonderful and the songs were spectacular and memorable as done by THAT cast, and everyone is looking for a recording from THAT!!!Unfortunately, unless you get the DVD and hook it up to make your own bootleg recording, there isn't any soundtrack from the film available.This version isn't misleading - it clearly identifies itself as the STAGE soundtrack.

I have been using cell phones since the time they came in a suitcase, and computers filled up the entire floor of a building. This phone not only functions as a great phone, but also functions as a mini computer. I can get my email anywhere in the country, take pictures of a job and email them to my office for imediate review. I can search the internet for anything that I might be interested in. With the bluetooth function I can talk handsfree in my car or on my motorcycle. The small size makes it easy to stick in a pocket, or it doesn't take up much room in a holster. I would recommend this phone to anyone. As a matter of fact two of my adult kids have Pearls also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good but Bluetooth disaster","review":"This phone is perfect in many ways but the bluetooth feature is a disaster. There is simply inadequate service connectivity with other items (especially Mac) despite what the manual says. This means it HAS to be synced every time you may want to add a phone numer from your computer or vice versa. No dragging and droppinbg on this phone. No apparent support for industry standard v cards either. A boring issue needing cables etc. I got a free upgrade on this phone in the UK but it's going back to Viodafone and I am going back to Sony Ericsson who also have 'push' email - just like Blackberry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Looking Phone","review":"This phone is great looking, easy to use and has the email functionality that you would expect from RIM-blackberry. I love the fact that is tiny and lighweight. Although I've heard some people complain about how difficult it is to type on the keypad, I (6'3'' with giant hands) haven't had a problem with that thus far. I think that people are expecting the best of both worlds- a tiny phone with a giant key board(get a speak and type program). That said, I do have one problem with this otherwise wonderful phone (although I gave it a five star rating). I think that the RIM folks could have added video capture capacity and a better camera this beauty. Other than that though, this small lightweight smart phone is everyones dream-UNLESS YOU LIKE BULKY CELL PHONES ATTACHED TO YOUR HIP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One MAJOR problem","review":"Overall I love my Blackberry Pearl. It's easy to use, convenient, small and now I only have to carry one device. It does, however, have one MAJOR problem. Since I bought it 6 months ago, I have had to get it replaced twice, both for the same problem. The handset speaker stops working. In a call the person I'm talking to can hear me but I can't hear them. I take good care of my phone, have never dropped it, gotten it wet, etc. so there is no excuse for it to stop functioning like this, especially after so short a time.

Both have hardware failures. My phone at exactly 1 year and 3 days experienced several failures, these include: 1) volume increase button failed (No s/w way to control!!!), basically every time I accidentally decrease the volume I have more and more difficult time hearing and eventually will not be able to use the phone. The speaker phone has one bar left and is completely useless now. 2) ear jack no longer works (this is also happening to my husbands phone) Now I can not use the mp3 features, no more music! 3) Can't hear out of phone when phone is against your ear for listening (my husbands phone only). My husbands phone is down to speaker phone only.Reception to others calling is terrible.We are going to buy i-phones with expectations of better hardware!I have found out that others around my job who have or had this version of the blackberry (8100) experienced similar problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blackberry is Junk","review":"I have two Blackberry devices on my plan. The 8100 and the 8130 and both have had the USB connections break. This the charging mechanism for the device and when it goes, it is gone. I didn't buy insurance on the 8100 thinking there was a year warranty. Good luck getting anything fixed under warranty. After being without a phone for over a month, I finally get it back NOT repaired stating customer abuse. They then charged me $55. There are 50 pages on google on the USB failing. This unit was under a year old. The Blackberry USB is just poorly designed. Blackberry has the arrogant mentality that they are the only game in town. The operating system on the blackberry is the most poorly designed I have ever seen. Setup is a pain and almost unmanageable for a novice. Don't waste your money on any blackberry (even the storm). There are many better options and a whole lot less stress.

If you are not a Blackberry user, this will likely be not a good choice for a first smart phone. I'm reasonably computer literate, and I found that the CD and software that came with the phone was terrible. Great on fancy images, useless on information. A small quick start written manual came with it, but no owner's manual. If you have an IT person at your company to help you with this phone great, otherwise, forget it. Microscopic icons and print on the screen, even when text size is adjusted, the command lines remain tiny. Unable to sync with Yahoo Address book, track ball feels like a toy, the volume on my phone even at high was clearly insufficient, both in terms of ringer volume and voice volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever!","review":"I have had a Palm Pilot, a Blackberry model I cannot remember and the Blackberry 8700c - - and I just love the pearl!

Within 2 hours it stopped working (specifically, it does not ring or vibrate on an incoming call, even though it is set to do both). This is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate. I took it back, got another one, that one lasted about 18 hours, same problem. Went back a third time, got another phone, this one worked about 6 hours. This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless. Their documentation is also the worst I've seen, and I've worked in this industry for several years.

They have a known problem with the Blackberry Pearl and the myfaves network where the myfaves contacts get deleted automatically from the Tmobile's system. The contact still shows on your phone as a myfaves contact however, so you continue to call them thinking that this is so while your free minutes are being used up. Customer service is absolutely NO HELP in this matter and you'll end up going through a TON of frustration trying to get this resolved, only with no resolution. I have spent 3 days trying to fix this issue - being transferred from department to department - having to retell the same story each and every time. It is NOT worth the aggravation that this will cause. Forget the Blackberry and forget TMobile. I should have stayed with my Sprint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Don't choose T-Mobile.

Even when phone is \\"free\\", the data plans are nuts--$100/month on average for data and locked in for years.Suretype stinks for anything but standard dictionary typing---browsing and emails basically required me to shut off the \\"feature\\".I'm going to return this phone and maybe try out the alternatives: Nokia E62, Moto Q, other Blackberry models or the new Samsung \\"BlackJack\\" phone out soon.Blackberries are awesome for corporate emails in the normal QWERTY format. Pearl is a major compromise in usability, battery life and stability. Looks are nice, but it's not enough to overcome the other negatives.Maybe Indigo will be the right balance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of all possible worlds","review":"I think the Pearl is terrific. I was so hooked by the description that I went out and bought it on the first day it came out and have been enjoying it for a week now. Having used a 7100 for the past three years I have always disliked the size; too big to comfortably fit in your pocket and annoying (not to mention geeky) to clip to your belt loop. At last, a Blackberry with a reasonable form-factor! I immediately bought a 1GB microSD to put in it and am thinking of it as a day-to-day ipod replacement. Finally I can go on a short trip and bring a single device for communication and entertainment.Agree with the other reviewer that the speaker phone is not the best quality but with the other advantages (size, style, color, audio/video/camera, email, calendar, etc.) I find it hard to knock the experience. Best phone I have ever had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing upgrade from other BlackBerry's - Depends on Priorities","review":"I have had BlackBerry's for years since the \\"black and white\\" pager style models that didn't even have phones.Over time, I have found that even though I had the large-keyboard units, I typed out relatively short messages, generally, and did not have a use for the detailed keyboard. I did write a memo on a plane one time that when printed was two pages. I would not want to do that on the Pearl.What I can tell you is that if you are needing a phone plus email and not email plus a phone (note the difference), the Pearl is for you. I give it four stars only because it's not perfect; no phone ever has been.PROS: Camera - good. Thin, narron (better than the Q's wide size). I like the pearl instead of the track wheel we're so addicted/used to.Cons: Speakerphone is weak, to be expected for a small phone. Keyboard is too small to write long articles, like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite a real Blackberry, but gd enough.","review":"Scale 1-10Size: 10! Compact!Style: 9!

I regret the 40 minutes of my life I wasted watching this film (that's correct, only 40 minutes... by that point it was physically painful and we turned it off). I am so glad we didn't waste any money on this film, thank heaven it was on Prime. DO NOT WATCH!!! Would NOT RECOMMEND!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PeniH","review":"Christmas in Wonderland was written with a lot of love and heart. The writer was able to capture the true feeling of a struggling father who loved his family deeply and wanted to make life the best for his kids. In doing so, the youngest knew she wanted to help her Dad, so when the miracle appeared, she new in her heart that everything was going to be OK. This is a great holiday movie and should be released on DVD now. I know I plan on watching it during the next holiday if not sooner. I don't know why it took so long to be released for viewing, even if it was on TV. Maybe Canada has a say so on what happens since this was filmed in the South Edmonton Mall. I just hope it gets released soon. Loved the movie. Love the Writer. She's the best. I look forward to more of her screen plays being made into movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Patrick Stewart and Tim Curry, but not this movie","review":"I generally like movies with Patrick Swayze (even Red Dawn), and Tim Curry is usually the funniest part of any movie, but this movie was so dreadful we turned it off after 20 minutes.Others have noted the non-hilarity of OMG CHRISTMAS AT A MALL!, but it was the tired acting, the entirely predictable plot, the endless dreary set-up of a gag so that you know five minutes before the actors what's about to happen.I had hoped for better from the cast, but this was a movie best to be filed as \\"not something to put on one's resume.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas in Wonderland","review":"This was a delightful movie. Some of the things the children did was a little far fetched but none the less a cute movie for Children to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egregious....","review":"Since \\"horrible\\" and \\"atrocious\\" have already been used to describe this movie, I'll go ahead and toss \\"egregious\\" into the hat. This movie is neither funny nor entertaining.Even reliable talent like Swayze or Curry (both in subpar performances) can help this dreck. The writing is terrible and the acting is forced.This film is the worst holiday seasonal movie that I can think of - it's just awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I reccomend this book to anyone who is interested in the subject of space travel. Mike Collins tells the story of his adventures in space really well, from his beginnings in Gemini and later on Apollo 11, he gives a great account of being part of the crew that made the first moon landing, a must read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Were the Moon Landings Real?","review":"I have many doubts about the Moon Landings being Real. Just too many questions. I honestly think it was FAKE.So many people have been sucked in by nasa. It was done in the Arizona Desert and a Studio.People can find out for themselves. Too many persons listen to nasa as if they are god."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best ever!","review":"I must say I think this is his best cd ever next to the innocent age ! His voice just seems to melt with the music. The perfect blend. I know this is not one of his more popular cd's or shall I say albums but it is a gem. If you really want to hear Dan pour out his heart and soul buy this cd. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful storytelling.","review":"Another example of his musical genius. His passing has left a huge void in the musical world, but his songs live on."},{"rating":"2","title":"the mirror of \\"Sovenirs\\"","review":"I have both of them, and I can say this is a continuation of SovenirsAspen/These Days is the first of 2-in-1 combo, plus Man In The Mirror/Below The SurfaceComes and Goes sounds like \\"Changing Horses\\"Man in the Mirror/Below the Surface (the second part) sounds like \\"Parts of the PlanOld Tennessee sounds like \\"Sound from Half Mountain\\"however, there's an ultimate track: The Last Nail, which compose a drama into a song, describes a guy loves a lady in hidden, even she was married and has children, and I highly recommend this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Surprise","review":"Prior to buying this album, I owned PHOENIX, INNOCENT AGE and GREATEST HITS. I was more familiar with Dan's later work and, gazing at the back of this CD, I didn't know any of these songs.What a pleasant surprise to discover that these songs are not only as good as Dan's later and more famous material, they might even be better. I wasn't sure if Dan would really sound \\"young,\\" probably because of his tendency to overproduce arrangements. But he truly does here...and this is amplified by the wonderful accentuation of country elements on this record.Tremendous guitar playing, soulful vocals, lyrics that actually have something to say...this is the sound of an artist truly coming into his own. And the songs are absolutely wonderful - a great mix of ballads and rockers, often within the same track!If you like Dan at all, make sure to get this one. You will not regret it, period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"All of Fogelberg's Albums are very inconsistent and uneven but most contain at least a couple of good songs. This one is probably his worst and does not even have one memorable song or melody (OK - I guess Comes and Goes is the best song here and is pretty good). Amazing really how bad this is overall -- Avoid!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hub","review":"This was a very decent price. I bought the computer stand and then realized I could use the hub also, so I looked around until I found this one. It gives you extra USB attachments and your computer plug can be easier accessed since you plug it into the hub rather than the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk - buy an extension cord instead","review":"It looks good, but it is pure junk. The box is very light, and the design puts two rounded plastic tabs on the front, essentially little ice skates that the box wears so that it will slide around if you touch it even gently. For a device designed to sit on your desk so that you can plug a cord into it, this is a braindead design decision.The power cord on it is also painfully short.Buy an extension cord and duct tape the end to your desk. It will work better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that efficient","review":"I thought I'd love this, and the power outlet is very useful, but the USB ports aren't that useful to me, because they don't allow for my iPhone to be charged while being plugged in. So I have to use my regular USB ports after all. What a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hub works","review":"I got this Rolodex Combo 2.0 USB Hub / Power Outlet (at Amazing Savings, very cheap, brand new). Hooked it up to the back of my Windows 7 USB port. Windows 7 detected it immediately and installed the drivers for it. Plugged in a USB external Hard Drive into the hub and I was able to successfully back up my pc files. It works fine so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"No driver, USB doesn't work","review":"The AC power plug works, but the USB ports do not. There is no driver for this device; looked around and didn't find one. Don't know if I need one, but in any case the USB ports don't work. So essentially I have a short extension cable for an AC power plug."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Real?!","review":"When i buy a \\"foot soldier with spear\\" i expect a foot soldier equiped with a spear and ready to make a kill! This doesn't kill anything, it just sits there. Also it's shield doesn't protect it from fire, bullets, or other spears. I was very dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also based on volume 1...","review":"If you like movies without a single redeeming value except for the cover art you should get this series. The cover art attracted my attention because it is some of the most beautifull I have seem, I couldn't have been more surprised at the utter lack of quality in the anime itself. Average dub, average art (nothing like the beauty of the front cover), horrible plot, lame jokes delivered in a flatpan. DON'T BUY unless you happen to like dumb anime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful prose","review":"The book is written with a beautifully eloquent prose. The author truly loves and understands the Orient. He painted an intriguing visualization, but in all honesty, this repetitive prose gets in the way of the character development and storyline. By page 167, unfortunately, the characters simply couldn't continue to hold my interest and I put the book away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"Very upset... order it with another book that one came in a week and as of this date (28 Aug 09) still have not gotten the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"why i am dissatisfied with my purchase","review":"This book is a great book, don't get me wrong. But the book I ordered was supposed to come with a CD-ROM...didn't get it. And I also received an Intructor's Edition instead of the student version that I ordered, and the student version comes with a project management module which I need for my class and did not get! And the student version also has an access code on it which i need to be able to access my assignments online, and the intstructor's edition doesn't have one of those either. So I can't do my homework for my class. So basically what im saying is, don't believe what the book descriptions on here tell you, because I thought I was getting what I needed and I was wrong!!I am very dissastisfied with their service as of now, and I probably won't get as much money for the book when I do try to return it, so now I have worse problems than I had before! Thanks a LOT amazon.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"a case of Amazon being too big for its own britches?","review":"Buyer beware that you may not (and probably won't) get what you paid for. According to this product advertisement a cd is included, however none came with book. I emailed amazon concerning this problem and was informed that no effort would be made to remedy this situation (since it came from amazons warehouse) and If I was unhappy with purchase I would have to send it back. I'd say that is awful customer service which I hope isn't systemic with how amazon does it's business, certainly will give me pause when ordering anything from amazon directly and makes me think twice about renewing my prime membership. I'd say the book is ok, maybe a little outdated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price on this book","review":"This was a super price for this used book, and it was in great condition, as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gwendolyn Hilliard's textbook experience","review":"I needed books for summer school.

That would also eliminate the problem of \\"interchangeable faces\\" for the dolls. (There is a doll of Ginger Rogers and alternate tabbed heads of Cyd Charisse, etc. to fix over Rogers' face.) Of course, most people who buy this book are interested in studying and enjoying the costumes, as I am, rather than cutting out and dressing the dolls. I think actually trying to dress the dolls and manage the fold-on heads would be disappointing. But if you just enjoy looking at the costumes, reading about them, and indulging in nostalgia for a more glamorous era, you will love this book. A lovely surprise for me was the extent to which I enjoyed the male dancers' costumes. I bought the book thinking of all those lovely gowns but was equallly delighted by the men's costumes and the commentary about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar Cable","review":"The Cable sounds good and gives the very vintage look for any vintage guitar like my Eric Clapton signature strat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality cable","review":"This is my second Spectraflex cable and I love them.

He takes archaeological and written sources and explains nuances that are seldom mentioned by seminary-trained teachers.I have used some of his older taped lessons in Sunday School classes and for Youth Groups and even inspired several folks to go on one of his tours to Israel.Not only does Vanderlaan make history come alive, he nearly always instills in me a desire to study, learn and to know more on my own. He is an excellent speaker, scholar and spokesman.I can't recommend his series more highly!Nolan Grubb"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Best of all Bible Study DVD's","review":"I have purchased Ray Vander Laan Faith Lessons before, and I can't praise the product enough.

I wish they would have put all 8 episodes on one DVD instead of splitting it into two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Try","review":"I've been an avid Power Ranger fan since the day it first aired with \\"The Day of the Dumpster\\". I left the show around Disney's takeover and watched it sparingly throughout the years. After I heard of Saban returning to the series, I was happy and hopeful that the show would return to it's original self. Sadly, my hopes were not met. The show's cast is handsome and beautiful faces but, and I'm sorry for being blunt, can't act their way out of a paper bag. It's almost cringe worthy to watch them on screen. Specifically the Red and Blue Rangers (the two leaders). I'm hoping the next incarnation of the series that Saban produces is better than this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Stat Mech Book I've read","review":"Although it is a little weak in the coverage of all applications of statistical mechanics, my overall rating for this book is excellent.

Even then, I'd be annoyed by its narrow focus, pathethic handful of races and padded selection of feats and prestige classes. If ever there was a book who's sole reason for existing appeared to be to soak more money from a loyal audience, this - and the other core 'Races of...' books forthcoming - is most definitely it.Buy Races of Faerun instead and/or get a subscription to Dragon, but don't throw any money in this one's direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff anyone?","review":"This book is pretty pathetic. There are a few feats and a few prestige classes I might use in it, but its mostly a waste of time. The only thing I think that stands out for me are the racial substitution classes. The new race, the Goliath (can anyone think of a better name? Yeah, just about anyone could)is a waste of time.I've seen where you can get all three of the race books in one box set. I can't imagine the shock of the buyer after picking up these three books and realizing how much money he wasted.

Lets dive into the book and see how THEY see the Matrix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matrix and Cyberpunk science fiction","review":"This book was very entertaining. Although it is a bit misleading, the book discusses Cyberpunk fiction more than the Matrix. But that is what I enjoyed about this book. The collection of essays is fun and goes through some great largely unknown books of sci-fi. The Cyberpunk genre is cultish but a personal favorite of mine.If you like the Matrix this is a good book but don't complain about sidetracking to other topics of interest, because that is what this book does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for challenging the Tenor","review":"Practice is how a singer improves and Puccini is a challenging composer. The backing tracks are excellent and if there is any complaint some of the tracks are played in a fairly slow tempo.
