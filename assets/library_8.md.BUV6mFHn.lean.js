It's the song he performed on the Latin Grammys and one that I always want to play over and over. Written by Vives, it's overflowing with life and emotion. Oh ! to be loved with such passion...the object of his affection is a very fortunate woman.Of the other 10 tracks, \\"La Receta\\" is a favorite, and the rendition of \\"La Piragua\\" is a knockout. This CD is an Emilio Estefan production, and the arrangements and musicianship are superb thoughout. Mayt�� Montero on gaitas, Egidio Cuadrado on acorde��n, and Andr��s Castro on guitarra are a delight to listen to.The booklet is nice though you'll need a magnifying glass to read the lyrics, but you'll be dancing to these great rhythms instead of reading anyway...\\"Si si si/ este amor es tan profundo/ que tu eres mi consentida/ que lo sepa todo el mundo\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"un muy buen cd","review":"Vives surge a la popularidad con el excelente clasicos de provinciaLuego lanza dos cd siendo la tierra del olvidoel rescatable.

There is a few Joe Strummer songs and a few rare Pogues songs. Nobody really needs the Pogues covering The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, but it is worth getting just for the song Rake at the Gates of Hell, or an alterate version of Fall From the Grace of God with the harmonica being the main melody instrument instead of the accordian. The MacManus Gang (Elvis Costello and company) song is an instrumental and is very good. There are some silly tracks, but for the rare songs it is a necessary addition to the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album has really grown on me.","review":"When I first heard this album, it did not make much of an impression on me. The first song still doesn't, actually. What I love about this album is that it's sources are so eclectic (just look at who's on it), but every song has this twangy, country feel to it that's not exactly right because it's country done by a bunch of Britons. I especially love \\"Rake at the Gates of Hell,\\" \\"Evil Darling,\\" \\"Money, Guns and Coffee,\\" and \\"Big Nothing.\\" If anyone can get me the lyrics to the second and third ones, it would be greatly appreciated. The country version of \\"If I Should Fall From Grace With God\\" is really interesting for anyone who has ever heard the version on the Pogues album of the same name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the DVD instead","review":"Other than asking the kids which letter makes the \\" \\" sound, this is just a video.

I had done just about everything to teach her letters. You name it I had tried it, nothing worked she would tell me to stop and run away. UNTIL someone at Leapster amazed us all. What a great toy. I CRIED when my daughter came out after THREE DAYS of playing this game just before bed, 30 minutes a day, and SHE KNEW ALL HER LETTERS AND THE SOUNDS OF EACH LETTER. I stood in my kitchen in shock that LEAPSTER TAUGHT MY DAUGHTER in an HOUR AND A HALF, what I had been trying to do for 2 years. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU LEAPSTER."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT","review":"My 5 year old daughter got this game as a gift.

Then it was took late. He happily ripped it open and stuck it in his Leapster. Since he already reads, he got a little bored with it, but surprisingly he will still play it sometimes and he likes it. The letters dance and talk and it has a simple game. It is cute.This video would be awesome for a child that was learning his letters. If you have a very young child, 2 or 3, you can set the video to just play and once it's though it will turn off the Leapster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Boring","review":"This is more a video than an actually game. My son has learned the sounds but we also have Letters on the Loose, which is a game and he enjoys that much more. Letters on the Loose also teaches them the sounds and letters but in a more game style fashion. I can't see Letter Factory entertaining him more than a few times since it take's half and hour to watch the whole video, which will get boring for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help your child with letter recognition and letter sounds!!!","review":"Ok, I will admit I am not a big fan of the song (sounds like \\"the farmer in the dell\\" except with letters like \\"the B says Buh, the B says Buh, Every letter makes a sound the B says Buh....etc.). But that is what the leapster headset and volume control is for! But I will say that it has really helped my son with letter recognition and phonics! It is very exciting when your child applies the knowledge he learns from this video. Very good teaching tool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight A's for the Letter Factory","review":"I purchased this for my 2 year old to use with his L-Max. (He wanted to be able to plan games in the car and stores like his 3 1/2 year old brother.) This is the perfect game for the younger kids, since it is a video along with games. My 3 1/2 year old now knows all of his phoentic sounds and the younger one can recognize most of his letters. Another A for Leap Frog products!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best suited for 3-4 year olds","review":"I was so excited to purchase this for my soon to be 5 year old daughter after reading the reviews.

I thought this was gonna be a good book. So good in fact that i didnt bother to read the reviews. Well, whoa nelly! When i got the book in the mail and opened it up it dropped out of my hands and almost went down the floor vent. This thing is way too small for a bathroom read. Sure, it's got 140 pg but them pages are small even for midgets. When I toilet read I place the material right smack dab on the floor between my ankles so I can use my feet to flip the pages. Not with this little tome. And I really don't think I'm gonna get past more than one session before it's been read.

Unlike some other videos in this series, this one is regular 2-D animation, not claymation. It's well written and suitable for both kids and adults. Jonah is portrayed as a total curmudgeon, which is entertaining and in keeping with the biblical text. I use a lot of videos in teaching the Hebrew Scriptures to juniors at a Catholic prep school, and this one works well for that purpose.You can also get \\"Jonah\\" ina set of four, along with \\"Creation and the Flood\\" (which is OK), \\"Abraham\\" (another good one), and \\"Elijah\\" (peculiar: a cartoon with Mendelssohn's \\"Elijah\\" oratorio as the score).

You can't help but sing along with the clever lyrics and grand melodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"An overlooked gem","review":"Many view this as a poor example of Nanci Griffith's work. Personally, I found it to be one of the most uplifting cd's I'd heard in a while. I have to admit that the first two tracks are the worst I've heard from Nanci, but there are at least half a dozen tracks on the cd that speak to me as a single woman in the 90's- of love found and lost, of being scared of trying again, of not living up expectations, and of surpassing them , yet not feeling as if I have. The lyrics are the most personal I've heard Nanci write, and while it may be more polished instrumentally than many like from Nanci Griffith, if you stood by her through Late Night Grande Hotel, you'll love this. It's Nanci Griffith as she evolves and becomes more confident with her music and her feelings."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enduring favorite","review":"I picked up this CD in a used record store around 1996. It immediately became a favorite, and it has stuck in that position since. \\"Flyer\\" would be one of my top ten \\"desert island selections.\\" Nanci's voice is beautiful and wistful and poignant; the arrangements are detailed and perfect - every note there for a reason, every song a delicate little detailed sculpture. No song ever wears out its welcome or ends too soon. Wonderful, beautiful, intimate, heartfelt; I can't say enough good things about it. It's that good. Everyone should hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flying high with a genius!","review":"This is the last of Nanci's albums for me to buy - I have them all, now. Boy, was this worth waiting for. This is a set of songs that drive you hard and fast, more rock-y than her other albums but it shows what a class act and a thoroughbred Nanci is.I particularly like \\"Time Of Inconvenience\\", \\"Anything You Need But Me\\" and \\"This Heart\\", but, hell, when you have 15 great tracks to choose from, why bother picking any of them out.The guest musicians are a massive boon, too - Mark Knopfler (my favourite guitarist of all time), The Chieftens, Emmylou Harris, Peter Buck, Larry Mullen Jnr, Adam Clayton. Nanci has a fantastic band, but to bring in this other mob is just amazing and inspired.Wallow in the sheer brilliance of this album and be prepared to be dazzled by Nanci's sheer genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best!","review":"This is one of my favorites - it's always in my CD player. \\"Going Back to Georgia\\", \\"Talk to Me While I'm Listening\\", and \\"These Days in an Open Book\\" are among the most enjoyable for many different reasons. This album has turned other people into Nanci Griffith fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nanci Griffith with no Country folk in any song.","review":"This album has no country-folk in it as in so many of her recordings. It was too pop oriented for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Study Abroad Life Saver","review":"I first picked up the Lonely Planet London book at the praises of my history advisor. I studied in London for five weeks and this book was with me every step of the way. Not only does it provide top notch detailing of the major sites and locations, but it gives an easy to read historical overview so you don't get lost in the annuals of history. I loved using it when trying to find places to go or even to help me with my assignments! Pick it up and you'll never see London the same way again."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible, horrible book","review":"Paul thanks Chris Ware in the Acknowledgements, and this makes the book all the more painful to read. Jimmy Corrigan is hailed as the greatest graphic novel to date, and Paul borrows Chris Ware's name and style to create a book that tries to force sympathy from the reader. Read Jimmy Corrigan and Mother Come Home side by side and the difference will be glaringly obvious.Also: Paul doesnt \\"successfully tell a tragic story in half the space it would take in a novel\\". He just writes it badly and thus gets it over soon. It took me less than an hour to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad, moving.","review":"I read this graphic novel in one sitting, tears streaming down my face. Honest, innocent, tragic, hopeful, matter of fact.

My son and I put ours together rather easily, once I figured out just what the directions were trying to instruct me to do (no words, just a ton of numbers randomly strewn about). But, the dino is really, really cool, and realistic. My son has his assembled, standing on top of his book case. Sometimes he'll bring it down and make it \\"walk around & roar\\", but it's best as an educational tool. Well made, really like it & will purchase the other dinos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Feelings","review":"This is a very powerful experience.

Nobody has captured what it was like growing up in West Texas in the 40's & 50's like Guy. Every song is a snapshot of a by-gone era in a part of our country that--to borrow from Buzz Aldrin--is \\"magnificent desolation\\".

It gives *some* basics, but then you expect more, and what it does is explaining how to install Windows servers. If you work on other system than Windows, you might also get quite frustrated. One of (if not) the best network operation system, FreeBSD, is not even mentioned. Who takes security and performance seriously doesn't install a Windows network. I skipped the second part of the book. It's not even technical regarding Red Hat configuration. For Linux, you need to know command lines rather that knowing how to use a GUI. Click \\"Next\\", every one knows. How about real thourough basics of networking? It would have been a lot more useful that giving tips on whether to buy your hardware at Radioshack or BestBuy. Anyway, I'm going to look for something more serious. Too sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for business use.","review":"I am glad I bought this book. There is good information in it. But all I was interested in was learning about networking concepts and getting my two home computers to network since the windows XP wizard didn't work.I believe this book is geared more for the person who wants to make networking a career. This book talks mostly about networking in a business environment and if that is your thing then this is the beginner's book for you.I liked the beginning of the book about network layers, cable types and network topographies.This is a good book, just a little overkill for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do we need another Elvis greatiest hits of his movies?","review":"Fans, Friends, and readers lean me your eyes on this column...

The SRK consistently proved itself rugged and dependable in extreme heat, and under extreme stresses where other knives and tools would literally snap off at the hilt. The only downside to the package was the plastic sheath, it felt flimsy when compared to the knife. I decided to reinforce the plastic with some 550 cord in order to give it a more durable feel. Despite the sheath, the SRK sports an awesome grip, and it is clearly made of high quality materials. Bottom line: this knife is a rugged and solid thing of beauty, and I would recommend it to any armed professional."},{"rating":"2","title":"survival rescue knife review","review":"Quality construction and seems to be the perfect fighting knife.

It has been a great investment. Its inexpensive, tough and reliable. Not sure how hard it is to sharpen, because I take all my knives to the local cutlery and they do it for me for three bucks apiece. Ive beaten this thing up on campsites and on projects for a long time, using it to whittle, chop, split, gut, what have you, and its still in great shape. For the money, this is a terrific knife.The sheath is okay - the knife locks solidly inside, and it can go in with the blade facing left or right, whichever you prefer. There are holes for lashing it to your gear if you wanted to do that, but I never really found a method of securing it that worked for me, so Im getting a custom leather sheath. I like the lanyard hole; it increases the utility of the knife tenfold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Knife....... Crappy Sheath","review":"I do like the knife but the sheath with mine is horrible. Turn the sheath upside down and the knife falls out. Don't even need to shake it, just turn it over.

It was a huge hit, and then, mercifully, his career went in the toilet.Then, fourteen years later in 1992, the ever dreaded sequel - cleverly titled \\"Bat Out of Hell II,\\" was released. It was just as bad, and almost as popular. Then, mercifully, Meat Loaf's career headed back into the toilet.Now he is another attempt to revive a sagging career. The songs are still bad, just perhaps not quite as overproduced. Ignore this people and maybe he will finally go away once and for all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze","review":"What a snooze.

I enjoyed listening to Meatloaf tell his stories about each song, though the audio on the stories was much lower than on the songs. The result being you have to keep adjusting the volume, and could be taken by surprise when transitioning quickly to a song. Well worth the nuisance though. The only other note was, this being a live recording, the pace was slightly slower than on in studio recorded songs, which caused a few stumbles on my part while attempting to sing along in the car. A great CD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Collector's Album","review":"This record allows listeners to learn more about the background of Meatloaf and gives insight into the songwriting process. Though an entertaining album, buyers should have a genuine interest in the actual stories behind the songs because much of the album consists of Meatloaf talking with the audience about the experiences Jim Steinman and he had trying to sell the songs to a label. Additionally, most of the songs are shortened to accomodate for all of the conversation. This album is a great addition to someone looking for a comprehensive Meatloaf library but it is not a fun album to sing along with and it is not as elaborate as a true concert album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlistenable","review":"I work in a music store and the manager had this on our list of CDs we play in store.

It is hard to imagine a performer more ill-suited for the Storyteller format then Meat Loaf.

As anything other then a relic of the time this is useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great collection!","review":"Meat is at it again with another great collection of his best music. Some of the songs sound better than ever, like More Than You Deserve (such emotion!). The addition of 2 \\"newer\\" songs helped, too. Some of the songs are cut, however, because of the format. That, and as any true Meat fan knows, the same songs are constantly on other collections.

The most disappointing part of this book for me was the part where Jesus says he drank from a sponge that was drugged, indicating to me that he did not really die. I was hoping that at least this book would stick to the somewhat limited historical facts that we have about Jesus. To have Jesus say he did not die but was only sleeping, even if only in a fiction book, is to me intolerable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too far out","review":"This was too far out for me and not anything that I thought Jesus went through.

It sucks you in, and you expect to read a believable fictional biography of the Christ. Instead, it's a story that, if it referred to Mohammed, or Buddha, or any other religious figure, it would not even have been printed.Sacrilegious in the utmost, and not a book for anyone who is considering belief, or already does believe, Jesus Christ to be the Son of God.Disappointing. Does not even deserve one star. One of the few books I have ever thought needed to be burned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus Christ as a human being","review":"Elliott's book presents a very human picture of the life of Jesus, giving an intimate view of what such a person would have felt and thought. It is thought provoking in that it shows the simple but powerful ideas underlying his message to the people of his time, and how he understood what he was trying to do. It is expressive on the subject of Jesus's response to his impending suffering, and it makes a powerful statement about how these ideas apply to life today. It is absorbing to read, and you will find yourself thinking about it quite a bit later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Neil just having fun with us?","review":"The Christianity I thought I knew as a young man is not what it is now.

But, it must have been fun for nNeil I am not, NOT interested in anything they have to say about anything. If one looks at the history of how the books of the bible were put together... they don't want to do that. They always answer that God works in mysterious ways, etc.. But yet we were \\"fashioned in His image\\" ?... The dichotomy is everywhere. But Elliott's book when viewed as entertainment is OK. Even I fine it incredulous though. So, paraphrasing Spot'n Life in \\"Porgy and Bess\\" I takes it with a grain of salt cause it ain't necessarily so."},{"rating":"2","title":"a passionate account","review":"Neil Elliot has written a very creative and interesting account of the life of Jesus as if it were told to him personally. I find this to be a facsinating sort of 'alternative' take on the myth of Christ. Sometimes it's good to explore the concept of divinity from a more personal angle, as that is how each of us are supposed to experience Jesus, anyway.Elliot's account is rich in well-researched historical detail, which lends credence to his engaging interpretation. I kept reading long after my eyes blurred from absorbing so much print in one go. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just started reading","review":"So far, so good.

It failed at streaming more than one song in a row from my PC. It also doesn't have WPA security for the 802.11b so you're best to hard wire it.Since I don't think you can buy it anymore, I'm not sure what good this review is, but if you're thinking of getting a used one from somebody, I'd recommend you steer clear of the MP101. There are other alternatives that I'm told work much better.Oh yeah, I spent about 3 hours on the phone with Netgear tech support (sure sounded to me like everyone I spoke with was in India) and they were unable to solve the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work and had to return","review":"I had major problems wih this unit. It did not work at all and after calling Netgears tech support and being on hold for 45 minutes I had an almost useless tech tell me to update the firmware.

The software is a joke and the product was really hard to set up. Plus, the LCD display was hard to read at a distance.While the MP101 is a bit cheaper, it's a poor imitation of the product that I ended up with, which was Squeezebox. It's got both optical and coax digital outputs, supports tons of audio formats including uncompressed, automatically imports from iTunes (so my playlists on my iPod are the same on my stereo)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea - Poor Software","review":"Great Idea, Wireless network set up OK, loaded software and scanned for MP3 files. Everything working fine, couldn't be happier.Then I started loading more of my CD's and LP's into MP3 format for use with the system. Problems, each time I added more music the software \\"broke\\" and the browse music function stopped working. Each time I tried to select by Artist I could only get half way through the \\"B\\"s before the list would loop back. Any attempt to search by starting letter would produce a \\"Search Failed\\" message.Deleting the music and loading from scratch did not solve the problem. Neither did restarting either the computer or the MP101So far the only thing that has worked is un-installing and then re-installing the software, complete with rescanning for music. Not a viable options for each time I add more music.As for customer support ? I'm still waiting for a response."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Hassle!!!","review":"I puchased the MP101 and got it running for several weeks until, all of a sudden, I began having wireless connection problems. The MP101 found my wireless network but could not access the Server with all of my music files. Translation - it stopped working altogether! Shop around to find another wireless music player and avoid the headaches - I've wasted hours troubleshooting on Netgear forums and with their weak tech support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"This product is a bleeding edge technological failure. I have other Netgear products and they work fine, but this was a dud.I upgraded it to the latest firmware/software (as of Nov '04), shutdown my firewall and still even with a wired connection to this product, it could not play any of my mp3s for longer than 40 seconds if that. The player would stop mid song and jump to the next and then try to play the previous. My PC has no trouble playing these songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"It NEVER works....rip off","review":"Basically, its a piece of crap. The server never connects. When it does connect, the songs break up and don't sound right. The Media Server software always locks up. Its just an awful program. What a waste of $ this was.How could Netgear release something that was so horrid? Beats me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wireless when it wants to","review":"Don't buy this item unless you plan on physically hooking it up to a network. I've spent hours tweaking with this trying to get a more consistant connection. My Netgear Music Player is only about 10 feet from my wireless router. It's also a large hassle when you can't even shut off the power to reset sometimes without unplugging or waiting 5 minutes because it can't stay on the network. Spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Way To Go","review":"The product is immature; I am likely returning it after just a few days. The unit often stops working. You must unplug the power from the back to get it out if its funk. I tried using it with Rhapsody Radio so to have internet radio over my stereo, unfortunately it plays two songs then proceeds to state \\"Unable to Play Song\\" followed by \\"Skipping Song\\" indefinitely until I unplug the power. Netgear's technical support is very weak. I presume they will either eventually fix the product or drop it from its product line. I don't want to risk it, so I will return it and likely purchase a similar device from another manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Hardware for Price. Unacceptable software.","review":"Not bad for the price, if it worked as advertised. The hardware is not bad. Sound quality not so hot, but acceptable. I was happy with it .... but the killer was the server software. I had a lot of problems with it... slow operation, and worst of all, my database would disappear often, forcing me to spend much time reloading it. Found out why. I have 6000+ songs. It will load these, ONCE. When you try to update anything after that, it goes nuts and does weird things and eventually clears out database on it's own. Called tech support.....they said THE SUPPLIED SERVER CAN ONLY HAND THREE HUNDRED ENTRIES. Stupid.So, if you want to keep this, you are limited. You can also use a third party server, but why?I have also tried the Linksys product, which will NOT work on WIN98SE. I also have the DLINK DSM320...best of the bunch. The DSM320 is a keeper, this Netgear, NO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but .... !","review":"This player works, and probably offers value for money, but this player, and I think the whole field of music players still has to mature. I will start with the problems:- Don't use supplied software. Get something like TwonkyVision Musicserver (free). This will read your Itunes database as well.- GUI is bad. Browsing through artists/genres is very slow.- Searching is appalling. If you search for \\"stones\\" it will not find \\"the rolling stones\\" because this artist does not start with the string \\"stones\\". If you don't know the exact spelling of your artist you can't find it.- Wireless connection does not always work, use wired instead.What works OK is just listening to a list of songs in one genre (so you don't have to search for other songs because that is too slow), or listening to internet radio, which is possible through Twonky.Regards,Simon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste money","review":"1. If you are looking to stream online radio, it's limited to two subscription services. Why pay more for less quality when you can get wireless speakers and stream what YOU want, not what THEY want you to buy?!?! It's also CHEAPER to get wireless speakers and you can do much more.2. VERY poor support with people who speak broken English at best and do not understand simple questions as they don't understand our language. (A stupid and unethical corporate trend these days -- I shouldn't have to learn 40 languages to survive product support in my nation).3. Drops and doesn't play all audio or plays it incorrectly. Very limited.4. Maybe someday, it will just stream to other devices what is on your pc. But right now, extremely limited. I can burn mp3s and play it on a stereo for cheaper too. This thing is nonsense the way it is. Now, if it played any service I already have and radio stations I listen to for free, (and it worked), I would say they aren't charging enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure the plug is handy","review":"This is a great idea, with an awful implementation. I got it up and running in 10 mins, updated all the firmware and software, configured my firewall, etc. It plays rhapsody, internet radio, and your mp3 library for short periods of time (5 to 10 mins). It regularly loses the wireless signal, or the server, or both, and I tried it with two different APs including one that has much better RF performance. When it gets confused, it gets really confused and there is no way to get it back other than pulling the plug, so make sure its handy and make sure you took your pills, because this great little idea is really badly implemented.Looks like a hacked software implementation or some kind of marginality in the hardware.

The book is the dullest and uninspiring compilation of platitudes without any critical referent. To the problems of architecture and architectural imagination, it offers as panacea the most insidious graphic banalities that can be used in a set of architectural drawings as pseudo-effective means of communication and design. The book presents in many drawings easy formulas or ready-made clich��s, or smooth, ever-so-accommodating confirmations of graphic conventions that prevent any critical dispute of the most pedestrian and prosaic design protocols.

I rarely drink anything other than water, and usually not bottled water since we have a filtering system, and I feel guilty using plastic bottles for one drink.But, for people who do not care for water (which I can't imagine) this brand is great.

It's delicious with a light breakfast, perfect for a hot day or just when you want something to drink just just a touch of flavor. I wouldn't suggest it for accompanying heavy meals, like a steak dinner or anything like that. The light taste would get lost in the meals bolder flavors. But I love having one of these with a bagel for breakfast or with a sandwich at lunch. The flavor is light, and it isn't too sweet. Nothing like a sports drink or juice. It reminds me of distilled water, with just a bit of a background taste. It tastes like if you had just been drinking a juice of some other kind out of your bottle, then went and filled the same bottle up with water and drank it.

I tried this product based on its label of \\"Premium Essence Water\\", and the flavor sounded good too (Pomegranate-Tangerine). The first thing I noticed before opening the bottle was the amount of debris/particles/sediment floating inside the water while the sun was reflected into the bottle. I decided to still go ahead and try it and was quite unimpressed. The water had a flavor of industrial tap water, the kind you get in a large city, that is processed at the water plant nestled next to the sewer plant.

Overall it's quite good; however, some of the songs on the album were borderline _preachy_...dig it! Instead of gnawing-at-your-throat lyrics that if you were so stupid that you didn't understand them you were probably the target of them, the listener is presented with songs that are _blatantly _preachy_, with all the _blatant_ social commentary of a Monkees' song. However, this is still a pretty good album, and well worth obtaining, especially for the loverly cover of \\"Don't Be Cruel\\"...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everythang is Everythang","review":"Well I bought this cd according to amazon on 7/20/07 I did not listen to this cd until 10/22/09. Yeah thats pretty slept on. Why the delay,can't really say I have so much music it probably got lost in the shuffle. Anyway WOW what a good album. This thing is the perfect blend of hardcore and smooth. Some may disagree with me, but I do not like In God We Trust at all. Ths is so much better than that cd it is ridiculous. The rhymes are better the beats are for better. The subject matter is darker, but it was 94. That was the year of Ready to Die, The murder was the case soundtrack and Illmatic oh and don't forget Mc Eiht We come strapped. The pro black was dead and Gangsta was king so this cd fit the time. Rap has fallen off extremlly badly since these days. Pick this up 55555 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great One From Nubian","review":"This record displays the unity maintained by Brand Nubian even when Grand Puba pursued his solo career. Lord Jamar shines on this album, while Sadat X keeps us on his toes with his unique delivery and dope MC voice. This album was not meant to produce radio tracks but it is a clear representation of true hip-hop from one of NY's finest. The freestyle tracks are dope and reveal the essence of the truest MC trait... the freestyle.

Coburn Pharr was on vocals (he also sang for Annihilator on their 2nd album). His vocals are quite different from JD Kimball's, but powerful in their own right.I know many people were disappointed in this album, but I think mainly due to the loss of JD Kimball's vocals and the CLASSIC Omen sound. While containing a few mediocre tracks, this album (esp. the first half) contains at least four or five strong songs, especially the title track and 'Cry for the Morning'. Also a highlight: a great metal version of 'Radar Love', possibly my favorite version of this classic song. I give it 3 1/2 stars due to the few weaker tracks. This album is essential for any fan of Omen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great band, good album","review":"They got it right this time. The track order I mean. My other copy of this CD had the wrong order of songs on the album sleeve. In any case, this is a good, but slightly over-produced, album. Maybe too many guest artists although Pat Benatar adds some fine backing vocals on \\"Poem of the River\\". Other standout songs include \\"Judas Kiss\\" and two versions of the wonderful \\"Cheyenne.\\" I think that \\"Johnny Comes Marching Home\\" and \\"Lovers Who Wander\\" are albums that fall into the GREAT category and are must haves for any fan of a gritty, roots rockin' style, but \\"Based on a True Story\\" is also well worth having as a testament to a fantastic rock band that, somehow, fell through the cracks during the mid-to-late 80's music scene.

Both my husband and I are sharing reading time, and the insights about the opposite sex has drawn us much closer because we can understand each other (and forgive each other what we thought were originally shortcomings), when in fact, they are simply the basic differemces between how men and women perceive the world around them, as well as process information and create relationships, etc.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this book!

It is mistitled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Men Are Like Waffles, Women Are Like Spaghetti","review":"I recommend everyone in a relationship, be it dating or married, read this book. It helps explain why men and women act so differently and do the things we do. For instance, women typically can juggle many things at once. We're called \\"multi-taskers\\". Sometime we expect men to be the same way but they were wired typically to focus on one issue at a time until it's completed. So many problems would be avoided if we did not expect the opposite sex to be like ourselves. We need to respect each other for how we were wired. It was God's plan to help us compliment each other. Understanding will bring more harmony to relationships. Ever wonder why a man often cannot keep up with a conversation that goes in so many directions, hence the analogy of spaghetti that has no beginning or end? Men, do you wonder why some women talk so much? Read this book. It's enlightening and an easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are these people real?","review":"I don't recommend this book for anyone who have real problems or want real advice.

The stereotypes that it throws out are just that, stereotypes. It goes through common stereotypes in an \\"Isn't it funny? Yeah, so you need to act like you love your spouse\\" sort of manner.I believe one of the other reviewers mentioned that it kind of paints men in a bad light, and I feel the same way. In their mind, men sit around the house and drink a beer while their wife cleans. They aren't interested or concerned about what their spouse thinks. They just think about food, cars, or sports. Bah!

The liveliness and vitality of \\"Let Go\\" is gone here, buried in boring Nashville production and jaded musicianship. Also, they abandoned their brother-harmony singing style and basically made a solo album for Ricky Lee Phelps, who just doesn't carry most of the material. Nothing on here ever catches fire: if you want to hear these guys at their best, try the \\"Let Go\\" album instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dando's most creative work","review":"Griffith Sunset is mesmerizing, bizarre, transfixing - Dando at his most creative, with none of his pop sensibility. The songs he's selected here are quiet, self-conscious gems, from longing alt country riffs to quasi-antique ballads. Beyond some well-planted distortion and the occasional echo of a scratching turntable, this is just Dando and his guitar. Music made for a journey - be it on foot, in a car or just in your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY","review":"I've seen Evan Dando about 6 times, starting in 1992, and the last time I saw him (February 2001) was one of the best. This album shows why. Some of his best songs performed acoustically, without a band to drown out the lyrics and Evan's underrated voice. With the new songs I've heard only live (including \\"All My Life,\\" written for him by Ben Lee), I'm very optimistic about his next solo album. He's talented, married, and seems to have his act together. The Griffith Sunset EP is a nice addition to a great live set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - to say the least","review":"I picked this CD up as soon as I saw it was available. I'm very fond of Dando, especially his acoustic stuff. To be kind, this CD is just not all that great. I've heard better tunes off some of the music swapping sites.

I sincerely suggest you put your money to better use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly vitriolic","review":"I was going to buy this book and the CD that goes with it.

His descriptions of some of the nuances of Chinese writing with the emphasis on revealing the presence of shamanism is especially interesting to me.The feeling of this book is one of refreshing pleasure, elucidation, contentment and reassurance. It is kind to the eyes, heart, and spirit.As evidence of the shamanic Chinese lineage, this book is not only a resource, but a modern artifact to be treasured; it is akin to the art and ancient inscriptions, many of which are reproduced and discussed clearly and in a fashion worthy of deep reflection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for Batman fans!","review":"Santa brought this one this year and is it the hit in our house!

However, the Riddler does escape and eventually does kidnap the missing boy. But, Batman is at his best with the dry wit and the master science mind that he has, and figures out the clues the Riddler leaves behind. Great, great story and a wonderful way to not only get your child to read, but to realize how important math and science are - especially to Batman!

I could understand getting a bad one once, but twice? That shouldnever have happened. In my opinion, the manufacturer should do a better job of packaging these things because they are fragile.

This band could not thrash their way out of an untied garbage bag. You could randomly pick 4-5 homeless people off the streets of any major city and chances are, they would form a better band and put on a better show than Laaz Rockit - even if they had no chance to practice, they had never seen the instruments before, and they did not speak the same language. Do yourself a favor and leave this musical excrement on the shelf and thank yourself for the favor. Guitar work is pitifully repetitive, drum solos weak, and the audio sounds like an abused child. The tracks drone on forever, as if cycling the song through your subconcious will somehow alleviate the painful memory of its exposure.

Well, I know where he spent his time. The lyrics are deep, meaningful and poetic, but with a melody. The literary talent & style in his songwriting is truly mature....an area where Ricky and Enrique don't compete. I am a mature listener of good quality music - and Carlos offers just that.

I had never even heard of Bebo, but thought I'd try it. I quickly became a huge Bebo fan. Most of my favorite CD's have spoken to me on a spiritual or emotional level: true art transcends the moment and reaches into the hearts of its audience. Bebo accomplishes this on 10 Thousand Days. Bebo's honesty in his lyrical style (\\"I don't know how to really love, I've never stood still for long enough . . .\\") is one of his endearing qualities as an artist. I had the opportunity to see him in concert about a year later--just him and an acoustic guitar--and his humility, honesty, and strong sense of his own identity drew me to him. I liken listening to this CD as hearing your best friend sing your shared experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best thing I've heard in a long, long time.","review":"Wow! A fantastic album!

I almost cried when I read \\"A Page is Turned\\"; it was a really touching song. If you get a chance check out the articles that describe how he wrote his songs. After reading them I have an even deeper appreciation for his music. For example, The Hammer Holds was written when Bebo was in college and struggling with his spirituality.

Or so we thinkuntil he is visited one Christmas Eve by four sprits who show him the errorof his ways. In the end a redeemed Scrooge resolves to keep the Christmasspirit all the days of his life and to be good to his fellow men.Stewart is able without the aid of costumes, scenery, special effects, orother actors, to bring this timeless tale to life.

Ann Rinaldi is known for many historical fiction books. Girl in Blue is also a historical fiction book during the Civil War.1861In the begining the main character, 16 year old Sarah Wheelock, is decribed as a worker on her father's farm. Her father is a very cruel man, not giving her dinner sometimes and forcing her to marry Ezekiel Kunkle, a neighbor. Finaly Sarah is overwhelmed, so she runs away to join the army. She pretends to be a man and then later on she is discovered as woman when she is discovered as a woman she is suggested to investigate another woman who they think is a spy.I think is was a VERY good book. It is about a woman during the Civil War making a difference. It was very suspensful, not knowing if she was going to get caught. I would most definantly suggest it! ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Girl in Blue","review":"Will she make it out alive? If you love books with loads and loads of action, you'll love Girl in Blue by Ann Rinaldi. It's jam-packed with action and mysterious consequences. Ann has outdone herself once again with another historical fiction called Girl in Blue. This book is filled with twists and turns.None of the characters are whom they seem to be. Especially Sheldon, the Union Army General. The book is about a girl named Sarah whose father tries to marry her off to their neighbor just to combine farms. Sarah then decides to go to her aunt's house in Baltimore and while she's there she pretends to be a boy and joins the Union Army to fight in the Civil War. She later becomes a spy working undercover for Mr.Pinkerton.She goes to Mrs. Greenhorn's house to spy on her as a maid. While she's there she falls in love with Sheldon.

It really gave me a good description of what times were like during the Civil War. I think the author could have been a little more clear about where some events took place. The author really showed that Sarah ( the main character) was a very brave couragous girl with lots of will power so she would not blow her cover as a spy.

Even I couldn't answer hardly ANY of the \\"male\\" questions, since in this game, men answer questions about womanly stuff, and women answer questions about manly stuff. We have played it twice now, and even though the men's team has always had 1 male more in touch with his female side than most, the women have always gotten our butts kicked. It is so one sided it's not even funny. Even the men were saying, it's not even fun since the game lasts basically 10 minutes. One of the men said he even had to think twice about some of the \\"male\\" questions. If I were anyone looking to get a good party game, I certainly wouldn't put my money out to get this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Game","review":"This is a very poorly designed game, and the questions that the men receive are much easier than the questions for women. For instance, the men will get a \\"true or false\\" question which means they have a 50% chance of getting it right even if they don't know the answer, whereas the women will get a question that asks them to name three out of four components of an item. After playing it once at a party, we played it a second time having both sides use the questions for women. Guess what? The men struggled as much as the women. My suggestion is to buy Trivial Pursuit if you're wanting to play a trivia game, and stay away from this dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"We've played this game twice and it could be so much more than it is...it always seems like the questions are too hard so no one ends up moving their pieces.

There are numerous issues, including:- The directions aren't clear. When does someone win? What's this about blocking someone? Why is the board shaped like it is?- The questions are ridiculous. We went three rounds until we quit out of boredom. No one had missed a question yet. An example question (no joke!) is: \\"Replace two letters to get this song title: SPELLS LIKE SEEM SPIRIT\\". Is there anyone who wouldn't get that?- Some questions are visual, where the team answering the question has to look at the card with a graph on it. But the answer is right below the graph!

There are several innuendos of an adult nature and no alternative behaviors, aside from violence, to resolve conflict. The ending is poorly written, leaving you wondering what happens to him. Unfortunately, this story leaves you with the message that if you're overweight you can only feel good about yourself if you lose weight, its ok for others to make fun of you, and violence is an acceptable solution to your problems.

What they all had in common was a knack for combining an infectious melody with wicked wit - and you don't need me to tell you that it was the wit part of the equation that got jettisoned with the advent of the brothers Gallagher. The highlights here are the title track and \\"Just Too Bloody Stupid\\" (which really deserves to be a world anthem), but the entire disc offers many moments of sparkling pop and small wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close Lobsters - never enough!","review":"Lively, bitter, optomistic, and just plain great! If you like \\"Echo and the Bunnymen\\", \\"The Church\\", etc., you are most likely to dig the Close Lobsters deeply. Excellent lyrical content (nothing in here w/silly lyrics about fast cars and fluffy stuff) and the mood of the music matches the lyrical theme wonderfully. Their second album (cd), \\"Headache Rhetoric\\" follows and is equally good. Buy all the Close Lobsters stuff you can, it is darn hard to find.

But I was let down by the truly terrible writing. As mentioned in another review, the text is poorly organized and skips from topic to topic with little rhyme or reason. Non sequitors are the order of the day. Basically unreadable.

The towns people, (thinking they have a historical find), tow it into the local harbor. I'm sure you can piece the rest together. Yes, there are vivid scenes of cannabalism that are down right nasty and disgusting, but it is a horror book and if you don't like it you shouldn't read it.Simply put, I liked \\"THE NIGHT BOAT\\" I recommend it to any horror lover. It is an easy read worth the time.

If this book were made into a movie, it would be a low-budget-zombie-straight-to-video-release. However, based upon the reviews of his other books, I plan to read more of McCammon's work.

I had heard that the formula changed back around 2009, and it made me wonder if that happened again.Sure enough, I just compared the two bottles, and the formula has changed! Among other differences, the newer bottle had the betaine ingredient (the \\"cleansing\\" part) much lower on the list, which I'm guessing caused the buildup.

Lindquist also tells you how to defend yourself if you get into physical danger, and the methods are not like the convoluted jabs and flips that you see on T.V. I think this book is especially good for younger women who don't have as much experience being out on their own. Many victims of crimes are targeted by predators because they act vulnerable in public, this book will give women the confidence that will deter criminals."},{"rating":"2","title":"My goodness I think I wet my pants!","review":"I was in a comic store in San Francisco a few years ago when I picked up the first issue of Answer Me!

My 4 year old is learning how to write his letters so I thought this would be a great learning tool. The problem is that the pen is so sensitive that if he does not put the correct amount of pressure on it while drawing, it doesn't allow him to finish. The idea is to \\"trace\\" the letters but if he is not absolutely exact, it tells him it's wrong. He was very discouraged. I would not recommend purchasing this cartridge unless your child already has a very steady hand and his writing is flawless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Pencil - very problamatic","review":"I have a 5,3,2 year old. We bought leapster for the oldest and realized the others would benefit too. So we bought each one their own module. We purchased all the cartridges. I highly recommend the leapster and its games. Very educational and fun. However, Mr.Pencil is very frustrating. I thought it was due to lack of skill for the kids, but even I and my wife could not make MrPencil happy. I took my time and tried my hardest and could not do well. Very disappointing for the kids that are learning, because when they are actually doing it right, they recieve no credit from Mr. Pencil. Anyways. we love Leapster and want new games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very fustrating","review":"We got this game for our 4 yr old and thought it would be great to help learn to write his letters.

Was a waste of my [money]. I won't let my son play it anymore cause he ends up getting to upset."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"I bought this for my 4 year old because he was not to interested in writing and I thought it would help.He likes the painting and doodle part but when he goes to the lessons it will give him two chances to trace the letters and if he dosen't trace it just right it sends him back to the option page he gets really discuraged. It is really picky about how strait the lines are I feel when a kid is learning this is not a great tool to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"FULL OF FUN","review":"MY 4 YEAR OLD ENJOYS THIS GAME.

There is so much to do with this game. You can make pictures, do mazes, write your letters and numbers, connect the dots, and that is just what I remember off the top of my head. It is a great way to bring coloring with you when you otherwise can't bring the crayons and paint. It is a great introduction or reinforcer for writing your letters and numbers. The mazes teach fine motor control - you have to stay in the lines or start over (which can be a bit frustrating). And the mazes go from really big to really small spaces. This game has had more play time than any other in my house and has stoped more temper tantrums while we were shopping or driving than any other."},{"rating":"2","title":"my 4 sons","review":"My son got this \\"game\\" when he was three (he is now 5 1/2).

It has many plot twists and turns along with wonderfully recreating the depicted era (1940s) The movie has one very bright/sharp and conniving character that appears to be leading the seemly dem character astray with the dense character, of course, being a little smarter than she appears (or just damn lucky) and MOST OF ALL the presentation has lots of that so-called British \\"black humor\\". It's really a good show that kept this viewer on the edge of his seat while at the same time completely amused.

It probably weights 15-20 lbs. VERY sturdy. Cool powdercoat that grabs attention when people walk in the room (not that it matters haha). Magneto driven means that it only has one moving part and is very low noise. In fact, the only noise that I hear is my bike and the whining sound the gears make. Resistance from the roller is steady and consistent.Cons: The magneto-driven wheel has several resistance settings, however when I switch them up or down I don't seem to recognize a difference between them. Don't know if it has something to do with the age of the trainer that I have or whether or not it's working properly. This really isn't a big deal, though. It provides ample amounts of resistance, so all you need to do is tick up your secondary gear to a higher number in order to achieve a harder workout.EXCELLENT TRAINER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic Support is Weak","review":"The fly-wheel supports are made out of brittle plastic.

I believe it is appealing across genre lines with entertaning and thought provoking lyrics and first rate intrumental.

Since this release Clutchs style has slowly evolved tooo.. something else thats still good, but if you want to understand the essance of this band you HAVE to start at the beginning! and I dont care who you are(country, metal, r&b, modern rock..) this album will please you!

The singer is my college roommate's brother. My brother, just 16 when he got his hands on this cd, played it reguarly for his high school football team in the locker room. That kind of indie power. Even the kids in Southern Maryland, who'd never heard of d#ck were into it.My favorite tracks are \\"Tight Like That,\\" \\"Rock n Roll Outlaw,\\" \\"Big News I,\\" and \\"Spacegrass.\\"If you are new to Clutch, this is the CD to buy.I'm going to see Clutch live for the first time in a few weeks.

Those were loud, heavy, hard rock, whereas this has a much more funky style to it. The album has a wide range of sounds, well put together and arranged, so it takes you on a bit of an adventure. It isn't the easiest music to get into, but if you give it some time and give it a few plays it really grows on you and gets into you. It was my first Clutch album, and I think it is pure genius. Clutch takes rock in a fun and interesting direction, not forgetting their hard rocking roots, but trying to keep things different, new, and fresh. I hope you like it as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"their best","review":"clutch's best album, favs from this are 'tight like that' and big news, actually every song is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just screaming and yelling, nothing more.","review":"Maybe I've been around too long and have had the benefit of being raised on 60's and 70's music, but I really don't see what all the hype is about. Maybe the other reviewers have been raised on late- '90's screaming and yelling, because this CD is just more of the same. As far as the music itself goes, its easy beans - any High School-age band could play it. I'm just happy I downloaded mp3's because I wouldn't waste my money on this.

His ken for Techno and Brazilian swing is underpinned by a basicly funky r&b and dance hall groove even more evident in his \\"Sound Museum\\" CD. If you experience deja vu, don't be alarmed or surprised, you HAVE heard it before. But, like suddenly realizing that the great feeling you, inexplicably, have is residual of the nice dream you had last night, so Towa's familiar and comfort-food tunes subtly and shamelessly delight. Towa truly loves pop music, it shows, kitsch and all, and you may also dig it better through his eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not alot of thought put into execution of this CD.","review":"I'd describe this CD as having a loungy/Brazilian samba sound overall. While Bebel Gilberto is featured quite a bit on this CD, I think she's better showcased on a pure samba CD. I found this CD to be a bit all-over the place, which is fine, IF it's well-thought out and somehow cohesive. But that was not the case with this CD. In addition to the lounge and samba tracks, two of the songs are very \\"pop\\" (which doesn't appeal to me), and one song was a horribly failed attempt at a \\"global\\" sound (track 7). I feel that the artist didn't put enough effort into this CD, and just threw some tracks together without sitting back and reviewing them from a technical/artistic standpoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Japanese Talent","review":"This is a very funky collection of nice eclectic tunes brought together by Towa Tei. A talented DJ who has built a very brilliant career in his native country. This album shows a very interesting mix of funky disco with soulful bossanova.

It's actually a small portion serving for ONE person - much better for a bowl of cereal..."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are not too small and are in constant use.","review":"I've had these shallow bowls for a few years now and they are well worth the money. They are easy to hold and I have used them for single servings of pasta, rice, etc. as well as using it as a coaster for just microwaved Pyrex bowl. I am getting sick of the ivory color and hope to switch to the Royal Albert English Rose version but this is definitely a terrific piece that is useful for children as well as adults. The pattern is not offensive and not ugly as so many of these grandma patterns tend to be. I'm just ready for some stronger colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"No butterfly design outside","review":"This is the first Lenox product I have to return to Amazon. The fruit bowl is small. Probably to serve fruit chunks, rather than putting fruits in it. The biggest drawback for me is there is no butterfly pattern on the outside of the bowl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appaling","review":"Bad written, lack of detail, outdated information that deals with 2 decades earlier. Ignorance of current job demands and qualifications."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid, reserved, not balanced.","review":"This album has some great tracks; Jealousy, Wonder, and my personal favorite, Where I Go, but lacks range. Merchant keeps a dark mood almost untouched throughout her treatments of these songs. The final track is perhaps the weakest, displaying little of her originality and lyricism. This album is well worth the money though, with quietly reinforcing percussion and good guitar work, but isn't a good sampling of her best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great CD - SAD DVD AUDIO","review":"This such a great CD but who ever mixed it for DVD-Audio needs to be looking for a new career. It was mixed as it it was an old prologic movie, almost like a live performance. The DVD does not use the potential of the the 5.1 sound. It was very disappointing. If they can remix an old record like the Eagle's Hotel California in way that knocks your socks off why the heck is this so poorly done? Yahama's 6 Channel Stereo feature on the PCM stereo track sounds much better than the actual surround sound. Natalie's fans deserve better than this for their 22 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timeless Classic, Hauntingly Beautiful, 5 Stars!","review":"Don't buy this CD if you aren't spiritual. If you sincerely love a uniquely exquisite voice, if you're willing to open your heart to a masterpiece.....this is THE album. You'll never forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother buying it for the 5.1mix","review":"From the existing reviews I thought this would be a great 5.1 mix, hardly. If you have the stereo version, don't waste your money buying this one. If you have a \\"Surround\\" setting on your amp, odds are it will sound better. The vocals are non-descript and seem to come from everywhere. The instruments imaging in the stereo version is smeared between the speakers. VERY DISSAPOINTING...save your money!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, Maybe Two and One-half","review":"Just wanted to let a little air out of the Natalie Adoration Society. Yes, there is no voice like hers, but I believe that the weight given to her work is off the mark. I find \\"depth\\" in her lyrics to actually be pretty lacking - there seems to be an air of pretense that has followed her solo career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Excellant","review":"Natalie has managed to put together an album that is both musically masterful and lyrically moving. The lyrics to RIver are haunting and beautiful as are the lyrics to Beloved Wife. Ms. Merchant shows her versitility with such catchy jingles as Jealousy and Wonder. Natalie has a unique and wonderfully powerful singing voice that is full of dept and beauty, if Ophelia is even 1/10 as good as this album Merchant will have another masterpiece to add to her long list of acomplishments."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the reason we love her","review":"This disc has so many facets:Sparse and painful ballads: Beloved Wife, Seven Years, and RiverPop songs with serious topics: Wonder and San Andreas FaultAnd songs that just plain tell stories while sounding so good: Carnival, Jealousy, Cowboy Romance, and Where I Go.The songs highlight the richness of her voice and are mixed with understated music from the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and misleading","review":"This CD is simply boring, with none of the lively pop found on the earlier 10,000 Maniacs CDs. Natalie needs to liven it up a bit and not be quite so self-indulgent.Speaking of self-indulgence, a few of these reviews say that Natalie was friends with River Phoenix, which is why she wrote and recorded \\"River.\\" This is not true--I saw an interview with Natalie where she said she didn't even know him. I think she was just jumping on the bandwagon with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tigerlily","review":"Have it but have not had time to listen to busy listening to Retrospective 1995-2005 but cannot wait to hear it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creatively, a wonderful album...","review":"This is by far one of the best albums I've heard in a long time. The lyrics are very passionate and the music is beautiful. Having seen Natalie Merchant live only hightens my love for her work. Leaving the 10,000 Maniacs gave her the creative freedom she needed. I would recommend this record to anyone who has an appreciation for amazing music."},{"rating":"2","title":"More great songs from Natalie Merchant","review":"A beautiful collection. Natalie is a brilliant artist and I would recommend any and all albums with her name on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best","review":"This has to be one of my favorite C.D's since I bought it. Natalie has the most beatiful voice in the whole world, it's so mesmirizing. The lyrics to all the songs are amazing. My favorite songs are:Wonder, Carnival, San Andreas Fault and Jealousy but I love them all.Though I have never seen her or the 10,000 Maniacs in concert, I'm sure she puts on a very good show. Natalie Merchant has been a big inspiration to me, and she still is, I wish the best luck to her in the futer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong lyrics, weak music","review":"Merchant's lyrics were always one of the Maniacs' greatest strengths, and on this album she shows she still has the kack. But musically, it's a huge dissapointment. The melodies and arrangements sound like cover band clones of classic Maniacs songs, to the point where the songs themselves start to sound like watered down versions of old Maniacs tunes. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"TigerLily, Natalie Merchant","review":"Wow, did this ever take me back to my hippie days. Wonderful music!! I'm 66, well almost 67 this month and I loved this music. It's timeless!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Try this record, you wll love it.","review":"I have bought this cd 6 times now. A new GF has never heard it, I play it for her, she loves it and takes it. Natalie Merchant has a voice all her own. The perfect melancholy record. I listen to it when it rains. She wrote a great song about River Phoenix, and the spectacle after his death. It transcends even today. Cowboy Romance is a favorite if you have ever been in a dive bar people watching. The hits Carnival, and Jealousy are on this record. Beloved Wife is extremely powerful, and if you have lost a spouse... remove all ropes, narcotics, firearms, and sharp objects before listening to it. Your can hear Natalie choke back tears while she is singng it. Even if you don't know who she is, or wasn't really into the stuff you heard, this is a great record. The women in my life agree, that's why they always steal it."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved this cd","review":"I really enjoyed this CD. The more I play it , the more I become hooked. I remember first hearing it many years ago, at a friends house, and was surprized how great the lyrics to her music were. What surprizes me many years later is that this music, from the 90's has aged so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly 13 years after its release and still a favorite","review":"Here I am listening to Natalie's album nearly 13 years of after its release and the song \\"River\\" caught my attention. It took me this long to figure out that this song may be about the death of River Phoenix (yes, I just now paid attention to the lyrics). Still one of my favorite albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of her solo albums.","review":"I can't really say much about this, except that it's brilliant and I have yet to meet anyone who can hear \\"Beloved Wife\\" without being moved nearly to tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Natalie is nothing without 10000 maniacs.","review":"Carnival is a great tune. Natalie has a tremendous voice, her timbre is accentuated by the metre that she seems fond of, (These Are Days). 10000 Maniacs provided a background sound of plucky, almost amateurish, acoustics which by contrast, lent credence and strength to Natalies already strong vocals. Since solo, Natalie seems to have gotten superficially serious on us, and seems to suffer from the more serious, and mechanical acoustics, of late."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too expensive","review":"You can buy this in .flac digital format 24 bit 98k from HDtracks for $18. You just don't get the silly 5.1 surround sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music to go to Sleep By","review":"I was very disappointed with this CD. Song after song after song justs puts you to sleep. Natalie needs to reconnect with the 10,000 Maniacs. I certainly will not be purchasing any more of her solo work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound","review":"I didn't know that in order to get the most out of this audio DVD you have to have a special DVD player. I don't so I cannot get the most out of the sound on this DVD, but even with a standard player it sounds great. I think the best song on here (in terms of sound) is Seven Years. Even if you don't have a DVD player, buy Natalie's Tigerlily or Ophelia, which is even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"How did I love you? There was no measuring...\\"","review":"I love a lot of this album. There are some songs that I could do without: 'Cowboy Romance,' 'River,' 'The Letter,' 'Where I Go,' and 'Wonder.' However, these are made up for by the brilliant works 'Seven Years,' 'I May Know the Word,' 'Carnival,' and 'Beloved Wife.' The rest of the album is above average, but those four are my favourites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid Solo Debut From Natalie Merchant","review":"I was vaguely familiar with Ten Thousand Maniacs, so hearing \\"Tigerlilly\\" for the first time was a wonderful surprise. Merchant is a fine songwriter who deftly blends folk, pop, and rock. The smash hit \\"Carnival\\" may be this album's best tune, followed closely behind by her folk masterpiece \\"Beloved Wife\\", but I also treasure \\"Wonder\\", \\"San Andreas Fault\\" and her elegy to the late actor River Phoenix, \\"River\\". \\"Cowboy Romance\\" features the talents of fiddler Jay Unger, best known for his performances on Garrison Keillor's \\"Prarie Home Companion\\" and as the composer of \\"Ashokean Farewell\\", the theme to the Burns brothers' documentary masterpiece \\"The Civil War\\". Fans of Natalie Merchant will surely treasure this fine CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Singer Songwriter!","review":"\\"Wonder\\" and \\"Jealousy\\" are the best tracks!Merchant is a great singer and songwriter. She has a unique sound that she can call her own. That is a great way to be successful.

Check out the song samples for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the former Maniac?","review":"Natalie left the Maniacs for THIS?! Wow, this album is one big yawn. The only saving grace is \\"Wonder\\". What happened to the energy and political/social messages that were such a driving force in the music of the Maniacs? It's so sad to see a great band break up, but even more so in this case, where the solo effort is so tired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Natalie's \\"well-regarded\\" solo career is baffling","review":"I'm glad to read some intensely negative reviews on this release. I concur. I bought both TigerLily and Ophelia after she left 10,000 Maniacs and tried to get into them. Impossible. 10,000 Maniacs was truly a great band. Merchant's voice was an integral part of that greatness but she evidently wasn't the reason that the band was so good. Her replacement, Mary Ramsey, proved the point. The band continued its string of excellent albums without missing a single beat. Merchant wasn't missed at all. I couldn't understand why she left 10,000 Maniacs and started a solo career but I loyally followed her over here. Big mistake. Sandy Denny she's not!I've read elsewhere than 10,000 Maniacs with Mary Ramsey are recording a new album in 2011. I'm very much looking forward to it.As for Merchant, her success as a solo artist is utterly baffling. There is just nothing here worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Away from 10k Maniacs was not good for Natalie","review":"Sorry, Natalie, but you are not the reason the 10,000 Maniacs were good, as evidenced by your sorry solo career. This CD is more akin to [weak], boring, dull pop than original, TRUE alternative rock of the 10k Maniancs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cindy! Please forgive me!","review":"I bought this CD when it first came out, hated it, and subsequently gave it away to my then girlfriend.

For...the price of the CD, you get a mundane still photo of Natalie and/or friends pasted on your video screen while the song plays in the background.... that's it! How they have the nerve to market this as a DVD eludes my rational thought process...at least call it a DA(audio)D or something to distinguish it from something that actually has music video content.

You have to have a DVD player to play this version, and better yet one that plays DVD-A to get the most out of this specific format.WHAT I LIKE - It plays at a higher resolution for better sound. You can view the lyrics on your TV and watch a video of song, \\"Carnival\\" although it is not in the high-resolution audio format.WHAT I DON'T LIKE - If you have a 2-channel audio system, your player may not down-convert the multi-channel format into 2-channel stereo sound like you may be familiar with on regular CD. This format seem to have more delay in between tracks than on a regular CD. It took me some getting used to. It's much more of an annoyance with artists that intertwine songs together like Pink Floyd - DVD-Audio will break up these transitions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands my test of time","review":"It has been more than 10 years since I first heard this album. It still sounds so refreshing. There is not a song that I would not like.

He is obviously a huge fan of Holmes, and has put this book together with a great degree of enthusiasm. However, it lacks the most important ingredient: skill.The book itself is a odd hodgepodge of things: the best thing is the opening essay, 'The Moriarty Principle', which looks at the role and importance of Moriarty in defining Sherlock Holmes. Then we have lots of photos of the Norwegian Explorers of Minnesota, a Sherlock Holmes fan club, poems (more or less - there is a lot more to poetry than just getting things to rhyme!), some essays of aspects of the Holmes canon and related matters (including an examination of whether Holmes' assigned birthday of 6 January really suits the astrological sign that would be his), some scripts and fiction.Sadly, it really isn't worth the cost of the book overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality Collectible","review":"The details put into this figuerine are impressive, from the papal staff, insignia, gold fringe and red shoes. The voice of Pope John Paul II speaks 22 phrases which encapsulate the ideals he espoused and the issues he tackled during his papacy. On the box you can read all 22 phrases and following along as he speaks. Also included is certificate of authenticity.

My favorite album will forever be \\"The Loving Kind\\", but all of her albums are wonderful in their own way.Like any artist worth her salt, Cindy Morgan has constantly experimented and changed her sound. She has tried different versions of music and alternative-ness. But one thing has not changed - her love of Jesus Christ and her love for her family.

It took several months to arrive and for some reason I thought I had ordered a set of the books. Instead, I got a big, unwieldy brick of a book with very small type. I've been trying to read it, but a lot of the time I do just as well by going to the Project Gutenberg site and reading the book there (but not all volumes are online yet).

As the other reviewer noted, the brulee cups are the flatter oval ones seen with the more expensive \\"Bonjour\\" product. However, I consider this a feature, not a bug. For those who love creme brulee, this is the more classic presentation, and a shallower custard with more surface area for glazing produces a superior dessert. The torch has held up fine for us, and seems quite similar to the more expensive versions, so I will have to give it a full 5 stars.

This reissue should help clear the cobwebs.\\"Lasso From El Paso\\" is the most eclectic of a mid-70s LP trio. Friedman champions the faded and forgotten with effective portraits in \\"Sold American\\" (recorded live on Bob Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue) and \\"The Ballad of Ira Hayes.\\" In contrast, he imbues \\"Ahab the Arab\\" with bombast above and beyond the song's lyrical content, and laughs his way through the ode to snot, \\"Ol' Ben Lucas.\\" Also included is the Bob Dylan outtake, \\"Catfish\\" and appearances by Eric Clapton, Dr. John, Roger McGuinn and Ringo Starr as Jesus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good First Draft","review":"The book has a great table of contents, but it reads more likea first draft than a polished presentation. Many of thetechniques are explained in the same style as the researchpaper they came from, and so the book comes across like a seriesof synopses, which can make it hard to read. I often foundthe explanations unclear -- it didn't read like a book thathad been class tested.Still, I have occasionally found some useful tidbits in thebook, so I gave it two stars rather than one. There's a goodbook buried in here -- hopefully the author will prepare asecond edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bioinformatics: Sequence and Genome Analysis by David W. Mount [Paperback]","review":"Book is a good reference textbook for Bioinformatics. Of course the material covered is technical and dense, but that is unavoidable for the subject matter that the book covers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disservice to the bioinformatics research community","review":"This book is written for biologist who mistakenly believe that bioinformatics problems can be can be solved without mathematics, statistics and computer science. The author knowingly avoids these important components of the bioinformatics equation in his presentation and as a result several problems arise. The most noticeable is that the book is almost incomprehensible. David Mount and his editors must realize that verbal descriptions in place of mathematical formalism will not lead to an understanding necessary to solve bioinformatics problems and advance the field. David Mount and authors of similar books will be responsible for raising an entire generation students who can merely repackage preexising software packages and provide ad hoc(theoretically weak)solutions to bioinformatics problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction for biologists","review":"David Mount did an excellent job introducing bioinformatics to biologists. Without a lot of Mathematics he explains the algorithms used for sequence alignments or phylogenetics, much better than any other book I have seen. Particularly, I found the chapter about Phylogenetic Prediction very helpful, that shows advantages and disadvantages of the numerous phylogenetic analysis programs with a lot of examples and helps the molecular biologist to decide which one to use. Although this book is quiet expensive, I think it is worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for the steep ramp-up in bioinformatics","review":"Dr. Mount provides an excellent text/guide for those who are interested in making the steep climb into the field of bioinformatics. As a bioinformatics graduate student with an undergraduate degree in biology, I often find that I am over my head in the mathematical jargon that is used in bioinformatics literature. Mount's book gave me the step-up I needed in order to digest the more technically cutting edge alogrithms in the field. He covers all the major areas of bioinformatics (from a biologist's point of view) with the exception of microarray data analysis (which I believe was just coming out at the time the book was printed).I cannot recommend this text more to anyone who is coming into the field. It is especially useful for senior undergraduates or early graduate students. And don't let the price-tag scare you off... CSHL Press books are always expensive, but they are usually worth every nickle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agonizingly painful","review":"David W. Mount is a terrible writer. I can't believe how much of a chore this book is to read. His sentences, in my opinion, are ambiguous and I find myself backtracking unnecessarily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs an Editor","review":"This book has been heavily hyped but the publisher should have put more work into the editing. There is much information here -- a comprehensive set of URL's make the book worthwhile. However I found the book difficult to read -- after analyzing why I realized the author didn't believe in the one concept per paragraph style of writing. Instead he repeatedly attempts to cram too many ideas into too few paragraphs making the book a slow slog.Bioinformatics is hot now and there is a rush to publish -- this book could have used another few months of polishing before going to press."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for computational biologist","review":"If you are a biologist and just want to know some background information of how to apply bioinformatics to your research, do not read this book. My recommendation for you is \\"developing bioinformatics computer skills\\" and some other books like that.If you are a student or scientist who study bioinformatics, this book is an excellent book and really worthy to read. This books gives very detailed information on algorithm to help us understand how the software such as BLAST and FASTA are designed. The illustrations are easy to understand compared with other books I have read, especially for the statistics part of any algorithm.One weak point is that the book focus on nucleic acid sequence analysis while talk little about protein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skips too many details and is hard to read","review":"This is the required book for our graduate-level computational biology class. I think I represent most of the class when I say the book does a very poor job explaining concepts. There seems to be a pervasive fear of mathematics, which leads to long confusing attempts to explain algorithms by words alone. The writing also seems unnecessarily wordy and opaque. This book also contains many typos, though that may improve in future editions. For some reason, it also costs at least twice as much as most other books on the topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun family game!","review":"Even for younger kids that struggle with the regular CSI game.

We played it as a family and had a GREAT time with it. The puzzles are challenging but not too hard and the interactiveness of the game keeps it fun and exciting. The only two drawbacks were that the flashlights (blacklights) worked terribly if at all but we fortunately had another blacklight on hand and used it instead. The other thing is that it only has 4 or 5 different cases and you cant buy another pack to enhance it. So, after you run through the cases, you pretty much are done with the game. The kids, however, dont mind playing over and over even though they already know \\"whodunnit\\". IT is basically a race to the finish rather than solving the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Challenge","review":"My 5 other brothers and sisters recently got together for my dads 80th birthday,and we decided to play CSI. We had the best time laughing and making fun of each other when we had to act out or make sound effects. This game is challenging and fun which makes it well worth having.

I liked the way the author emphasizes \\"thinking out of the box,\\" and how most brilliant ideas were really common concepts not usually put together. As a writer, I enjoyed his creativity tips on how to think and his discussions of Einstein, Edison, and other greats. The only problem I had with the book is that it was geared more toward the business side of discovering new ideas. I would have preferred more discussion about creating new literary ideas. The author also repeated much of what he said in his previous \\"Thinkertoys\\" book, but what he said was on point.

Bought them because:(1) molybdenum is usually missing from multi-vitamin/multi-mineral combos,(2) molybdenum is the key ion for the body's key mitochondrial protecting protein.(3) molybdenum intake can lower copper levels, which if too high contribute to brain neural degeneration, ...plus copper is usually easily acquired in normal diets.With this high amount, will have to MAKE SURE not to overshoot and totally deplete all my body's copper stores because copper is a key mineral. Only thing is, copper is more readily available from the diet (like chocolate) than molybdenum, and molybdenum's mitochondrial protecting activity is soo essential to prevent premature aging. So I'll take this for a month or two and watch for any symptoms of copper deficiency. This supply should last me years!Thanks Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comedy album","review":"Martin Lawrence was a comedic force to be reckoned with in the mid 1990s. With a successful and legitimacy funny sitcom on the air, he also managed to create stand up tours and specials that are a treat for fans of comedy. While the comedy here is not quite at the standard ofMartin Lawrence: You So Crazy, this is a really good, if uneven at parts, comedy album. After a slow start, Lawrence is on fire with humorous musings and pondering about John Wayne Bobbitt, religion, airline protocol, gangsta culture, the police and pet ownership. If you like comedy or have ever wondered if your dog has eye problems or how people get out of speeding tickets, then give this album a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMGodness, Too Funny!!!!","review":"I loved this CD.

I am a bit disappointed. The projects are, for the most part, completely aesthetically unappealing to me. The level of the book is \\"beginner\\" (which I am), so initially I thought the images were overly simple in order to accommodate the reader's lack of expertise. At the same time, however, he suggests projects which would be out of the realm of most beginning mosaicists -- like making and firing your own decorative tiles, for instance. And although each project comes replete with a long list of necessary supplies, in some cases he never mentions any instructions for certain items on the list. Maybe his intermediate/advanced level books are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Beginners","review":"This is a good book for beginners (me).

I requested a size 10, and the bandwidth of the item I received exceeded the size 10 bandwidth on the ring sizing chart.I returned the ring via certified mail and requested an exhange. The return was confirmed received on Friday 3 August. The vendor kindly informed me that the order would be processed and shipped on Monday 6 August. Except for the flawed band & wrong size, I like the design and alloy. But if this order takes more than a week to receive, I will not purchase from this merchant again because the delivery time does not justify the original shipping cost. Moreover, if the exchange is sized incorrectly or the band is bent, I will request a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"This DVD has been a blessing to me and everyone that I have recommended it too.

In a short period of time you go threw a amazing amount of poses without feeling rushed or bored.

What seems to be a cookie-cutter rap/metal excursion suddenly shifts into an armor piercing riff accompanied by a thunderous tribal sounding beat. The solo in Can't Describe, in which a sqealing guitar wail drowns out the background sound, is another prime illustration of the band's unpredictable explosiveness. While Tragic (an equally great record) ventured off more into the rap/metal territory, Driver* is more of a traditional hardcore punk record. It's Chaka Malik's angry vocals and the group's aforementioned unpredictability and volatility that truly make this disc a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Time Classic Movies","review":"We don't make a practice of watching old movies but these are just too good.

The Ambicom has good compatability between brands, and the software enables you to link easily with different services. There is even an option in the software to set up an ActiveSync connection, and a proxy internet connection for your PPC. Now my ipaq and vaio can sync easily without wires, using ActiveSync. In the setup, getting the COMport numbers correct can be a bit tricky -- it's important to pay attention to the steps in installation, and to consult your PDA manual. Also, I find I need to connect to ActiveSync (on the ipaq) through the bluetooth manager, which is easy, no problem. Once it's set up, it connects perfectly every time. A relief, after struggling with the Sony adapter and software -- and the Ambicom is half the price -- so I give this one 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"War with a Twist","review":"This game is basically war with a twist. Each person turns over a card and calculates the number, if both players are correct, the one with the highest total takes the cards.Although the rules are boring, the cards are very bright and appealing. They can be sorted by color for difficulty. The cards are very heavy and durable. This is a good set.I changed the rules to make the game a little more appealing. I added in an extra pile of cards. At the beginning of each round, we turn over an extra. First person to come to the correct conclusion keeps that card. That small rule change adds some skill requirement and excitment to the game and kept my 4 1/2 YO playing (and learning).This is a card game worth adding to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"the goth band's a hoot","review":"Here we have a fairly pedestrian entry into the horror genre, but one not without its charm. We have a gang of teenagers sight seeing in an abandoned asylum, populated by a deranged killer.By and large, it's a typical 80's horror film. It's largely comedic. The gore factor isn't remarkable by any means, but not bad. The best part of the movie is the all female angry political cheese-goth band. They're a hoot. Beyond that it's all here. The cheesy 80's goth band, the ridiculous plot twist, and a thoroughly respectable pointless excuse for the topless girl shot. Worth viewing if you're a horror fanatic and you have an hour and a half you were going to waste anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap in an Asylum!!","review":"Perhaps the stupidest movie I have ever had the displeasure of viewing!!

I cant even count how many times she uses the word \\"Freak\\". The vocabulary here is very limited along with substance which basically there is none. The songs on here are so terrible especially the slow ones that sound like some junk her record label through together the last minute. I think it's funny how she tries to oversing these pathetic songs like they have any meaning or expressive lyrics to them.

If you dig a chocolate chip out of one [not easy because they're kind of melded in with the cookie], you'll find that even that's not very chocolatey.Laudable effort to create a healthier unhealthy snack for kids, and they might like it OK, but not this chocolate lover.If you really love chocolate, look elswhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spirit filled, profound read","review":"An in depth poetic journey which challenges the spiritual sincerity of our religious training.

The thing I am so glad about is how she explains the \\"why\\" of a thing. For instance, we know from Jehovah God's word that fornication and adultery are wrong. Yet, she tells what happens emotionally and physically when we allow ourselves to be used and abused in that manner. She goes beyond the \\"don't do this\\" of a thing.I have been recommending her works to everyone (particularly women) that will listen. Her books coupled with God's word, the Bible have been my constant companion this month and I am sure even after I am done reading them they will take their place in my library, in my living room, where I can refer to them again-and-again as necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan of this one.","review":"Bought it for my lady.

Very similar in feel, I think, to David Sylvian's Gone To Earth (and for some reason I think Bill Nelson added some guitar here and there on that one). Bought the album on cassette when it came out and recently replaced that with CD. Beware, the CD release of \\"Chance Encounters...\\" is actually 2 CDs (but in separate jewel cases). It would appear Disc 1 is entitled \\"Chance Encounters...\\", but Disc 2 is in a separate jewel case and possibly labelled something else...the 2 CD's encompass the cassette version and then some. Purchased a single CD of the album (not knowing/realizing the \\"full set\\" consisted of two)...and am a little disappointed that it's not the complete set as I owned it on cassette.

You have to be familiar with the culture. Then again, if you buy it, you may watch it again, perhaps in the company of a hispanic friend.I really recommend it both as a comedy, and as a \\"general culture\\" must-have.As a bonus, you will learn several Spanish bad words, should you want to impress your friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked Humor!!!","review":"A low level official with the PRI gets sent to clean up a tiny town outside of Mexico.

I am making an exception in trying to get in shape after having a baby in the freezing Midwest winter. This is a great workout for the beginner that I now must consider myself. It takes a few times through to get all the moves down just perfect, but once you get the moves and keep up it's a good workout to get you into the fat burning heart rate range.Also, I agree with other reviewers in that Chris Freytag is not annoying like some of the other workout video people. And I like that the set is simple and not some pretentious island view overlooking the beach.

However, if you actually want to DO a video workout, I'd steer clear of this one. The verbal \\"heads up\\" for step changes nearly always come after the move has commenced, and while a step is repeated 4-8 times the first go-round, the instructor quickly moves on to a lengthy combination of 8-10 steps that will leave all but the most dedicated fitness fanatic in the dust. Beginners and intermediates need not waste their time...unless they prefer their fitness videos for entertainment value only. This production will take many run throughs before you can even begin to keep up, and by then you'll be regretting having doled out the cash for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed","review":"This is really a very basic beginner workout but it has design flaws. The instructor's energy is great but cuing is late, and doesn't often include anything about your form until later in the program. Almost all her cues are about breathing. No cuing about protecting your knees or back and reminders for people exercising on carpet...home video no-no. The moves are basic and nice because they are dance alternatives to the standard aerobic moves BUT she puts them together wrong. The sequence causes you to go from a moderate intensity move to a series of very low-intensity moves for awhile and back. You never break a sweat and the jumps in intensity don't make sense. Very disappointing program."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor routine","review":"The routine is strange and does not flow. There are lunges with twisting which caused me to injure my knee.

It is very well organized and I do two segments of the cardio for one long 41 minute workout. The first one is a little more dancey style while the second is segmented into 6 fun sections.

IT is worth its weight in gold!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mix","review":"I always enjoy the workouts that Prevention puts together - there's so much variety that you will certainly not get bored. Your heartrate will be up, but I was never gasping for breath (which is good!) Chris definitely has a cheerful personality that isn't overwhelming. She's encoraging, motivating, and makes you hit all the areas of your body. If your looking something that really intense, this video isn't it, but I still feel it's a decent workout. And it's broken up into seperate segments, so if you are crunched for time you can just do what your in the mood for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided Thinking","review":"Writing in the early 1960s, the author basically argues that the federal government should increase taxes significantly in order to be able to employ the coming wave of 20 somethings on the front end of the baby boom.

Most of the recipes are easy to follow and delicious, not fancy. favorites are the potato tofu salad (No one believes that it doesn't contain mayo!) tofu turnovers,EASY fried tofu,(put in a sandwich it tastes a lot like chicken)and Korean Barbeque Tofu - in this recipe I cook the tofu first, until it is tough and then I marinate it, not the other way around. The almond tofu is great as well. If you want to eat more tofu and don't know how to fix it, this is the book for you. There are dips and desserts too, but I haven't made many of those yet...just keep making my favorites over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty but time consuming...","review":"I agree with other reviewers that this is a nicely illustrated book with plenty of recipes for those who are new to tofu. The recipes I have tried have been mostly quite tasty (I especially liked the Enchiladas and Barbecued Tofu). However, many of the recipes are very time consuming and/or require frozen tofu, which you may or may not have on hand when thinking about what to make for supper. I like to experiment with these kinds of meals once in a while, but for the most part, I prefer things to go relatively quickly. Nothing worse than spending a lot of time on a recipe (the To-fu Yung one in this book comes to mind) only to have it turn out so-so.

They're not only easy and fast, but taste great. Plus, I feel good about how we're slipping soy into our diet without even noticing it.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that the book is as much about the actors and actresses he has worked with as it is about Williamson himself. Looking at all those names and photos, I figure Kevin must be responsible for launching at least half of all of today's teen idols. Sure they have pretty faces to begin with, but it's the words that he gives them that makes them so attractive. Also, this may be the only place for fans of the short lived series Wasteland to see details of the now-forgotten show in print.

I even used some industrial strength glue my husband stole from his job and even that didn't hold it. So I rigged the net by tying it to some anchors that were already there, including the back seat belt, and even slipping the string under some molding in the car.

The author taxes the reader over and over, using flashbacks again and again to tell a convoluted story of so-called friendship between two young women. The author also unsuccessfully attempts to make the story into one of suspense but really there is NO mystery. With a friend like Sonia, who need enemies? And Cameron? A spineless individual if ever there was one. (And why, one wonders, was the professor given such an important-and belabored-role in this comedy of errors anyway? He had no logical place at all in the story of the women's friendship.)If you are looking for a really good story, try one of Jodi Picoult's or Anita Shreve's books.

She explores loss, love, lust, and forgotten friendship with engrossing prose and touching dialogue.(Her trademark description of sexy young men is present as it was in Body of A Girl.)At times it was like reading my diary, so similar were the protagonist's feelings to my own, truly a testament to Stewart's ability to draw her reader in.Well written and heartbreaking, hopeful.

This is not a book for adults - it belongs in the \\"Teen Angst\\" section of the library. The main character is stuck in perpetual high school mode.A character, like Cameron, who lets us know from the beginning that she is a good liar is just not believable when she goes off the rails after discovering that people have (shock!)lied to her. Her punisment of Sonia (her supposed best friend) is out of all proportion to Sonia's \\"crime.\\"Leah Stewart does know how to put words together - many of her passages are quite beautiful. She has talent that is, unfortunately, wasted in chick-lit fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable...","review":"I really enjoyed THE MYTH OF YOU AND ME a great deal. While the story is about the friendship between two females, I think anyone, male or female, could relate to the story of an intense friendship that suddenly comes to an end.I enjoyed the way this book was structured, going from past to present to tell the story. My only disappointment with the book is that I was hoping that the reason for the demise of the friendship between Cameron and Sonia had to do with something other than a man. Regardless, this is still an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"People are Complicated","review":"Stewart writes a great book mining the complexities of women's friendships. I love the theme that despite what \\"myths\\" might permeate our lives, we write our own endings; we decide in our lives what we will bind (and what good it does us) and what we will loose (and how it heals us) and how we can love, forgive, and remember people, without fully understanding them. That maybe that is the definition of love in the end, not all we thought it was supposed to be before. When I finished reading this book, I wished my book club were discussing it this month, because there are so many things that happen in it I'd love to talk to other people about. Unfortunately, if I tell you about them in this review, it will ruin the book for you! A great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and uneventful","review":"I am not sure why I felt the urge to finish this book. I was hoping the contents of the box would help the story but I was sadly disappointed. It is yet another disappointment in Cameron's depressing life. Cameron seems spineless and unmotivated. Why doesn't she do something with her life and move away from her past? This really was a terrible story with a ridiculous plot. You will be sadly disappointed if you waste the time to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not memorable","review":"I finished this book last week and liked it. It was a quick read because once you finish it, you will never think about it again. It's like a lifetime movie that you just can't seem to look away from. You just want to find out what happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ FOR BOOKCLUBS!","review":"I read this book because of Leah Stewart's appearance at the Southern Festival of Books in Nashville. I will be encouraging friends around the country who are in bookclubs to place this book on the 'must read' list for the coming year. As wonderful as it is to read the Myth of You and Me, it is a gift to women everywhere to open up an honest dialogue with others. Many copies of this book will undoubtedly be packaged and mailed across country renewing old friendships in much the same way Oliver, in the Myth of You & Me, hoped his package would be a catalyist for renewing old bonds."},{"rating":"2","title":"KInd of disappointed with the ending","review":"To me, getting to the end of this book was actually better then the ending itself. I liked how she would switch between the present and the past, and it also brought of memories of my adolescence, but the ending was just kind of \\"blah\\" compared to the trip there. I will, however, read another book by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"An album you will love","review":"Excellent album! The music draws you in and the lyrics keep you there!

They bring back rock and roll that is fun!!!

This CD has a little of everything - rockin tunes like \\"Get In Get Out\\" and \\"I'm So Sorry\\" to the sweet melodies of \\"Back Home\\" and \\"Learning to Love\\". The two worlds collide for my personal favorite - \\"Feels So Good\\". The best part - I love every single one of these songs live!

I saw them here a couple months ago, and the energy was unreal. I had to go out and get this CD. This is a must buy, and every single song on this CD is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this album is rated so highly...","review":"Bought this disc hoping for some solid alt rock; knew I was in trouble when I cracked the cover and the lead singer was staring at me with his shaved chest and open vest straight out of Billy Idol's closet. The weak-sauce tunes just reaffirmed my initial impression - overly sappy lyrics combined with a limp rhythm section just about killed the album by track five, but I kept waiting for it to get better. Whoever compared these chumps to Nickelback is either tone deaf or just hates Canadians. And that song \\"Get In Get Out\\"? Dimebag Darrell is rolling in his grave knowing that one of his best riffs (from \\"I'm Broken\\") has been stolen by these poseurs.The two stars? One for actually getting a record contract, the other for the one actually catchy song on the disc (Should've Known Better)."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to buy both cd's!!","review":"Cinder Road and Plunge are actually one in the same. In order to get the TRUE feeling of the band you must buy BOTH cd's. These young men really know how to make GREAT music. Superhuman is their first collaberation cd done with Marti Frederiksen. Writing was done by Mike Ruocco (lead singer) and Marti. The sound is awesome!! Extremely well produced. All I can say is I love everything about this cd...Their \\"Hometown Hero\\" cd is 100% the band and their 1st official release. This cd WILL NOT disappoint the buyer.Proud owner of both cd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"cinder road is an amazing band","review":"like everyone else on here i have to agree. cinder road is an amazing live band. superhuman is a great cd that you can never get tired of listening to and its even better live in concert. if you have the chance you should diffently go see them. buy this cd you wont regret it![...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Colt Starting 101","review":"raw & uncut isn't as good as it sounds.

Unfortunately it arrived after Christmas even though I ordered it two and a half weeks prior to Christmas. This was very frustrating to me and I will not use super shipper ever again! On the bright side, the DVD set came two days after Christmas and my 11 year old daughter was thrilled and watched the movies over and over. The quality was great and completed her collection of Powerpuff Girl media."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, Fast Delivery","review":"I enjoyed doing business with the seller.

Thank you for your service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"I wish the packaging was more descriptive: No episodes listings. You have to play the individual season disc to find out what episodes are on each. Still, it's every episode, so good enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great condition as stated in description","review":"Full complete series with bonus episodes. Great purchase. This product is for all Powerpuff Girls fans that can sit down and watch all of the episodes from back to back."},{"rating":"2","title":"All you can want of the PPG","review":"This collection is great! Every episode from all 6 seasons. Still as fun & funny now as when they first aired! What more is there to say? The only negative to this collection is that it's on double-sided DVDs. DVDs are fragile enough, and this just doubles the odds of something unfortunate happening to a disk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!","review":"If you like the PPG, then you'll love this box set! All the episodes and some extras, all at the click of a button. Definitely a must-have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great set!","review":"My kids and I love the powerpuff girls, and I am so happy to have the complete series! PPG was a great show, and while some of the earlier dvd collections were nice, we are glad to have a set that contains all the episodes. Great show and great collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"great collection","review":"After reading some of these reviews about how a few DVDs didnt work, or the packaging was terrible, I reluctantly ordered the box set and hoped for the best.I feel bad for the people who didnt get exactly what this collection offers. We got everything that was listed in the discription and everything was in new condition. The box holding all 6 DVDs is in perfect condition and all the DVDs work just fine. I didnt realize how many PowerPuff Girls episodes there actually were. This keeps kids entertained for many hours, especially in the car.Well worth the price! I am glad I took the chance on these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOX SET INCOMPLETE, missing items","review":"BUYERS BEWARE!!! The dvd inserts in the box set were missing. The inserts that tell you the episode titles of the dvd's. These are the same inserts that when put together are supposed to make the poster. I thought maybe it was just the set I received so I exchanged it. But the second set I got was still missing the inserts and there was a deep scratch on one of the dvd's that prevented it from playing. I returned this set as well. This is just ridiculous that these dvds are even being sold without the inserts that are clearly on the product pictures. Others have complained about this same issue. I was very dissatisfied and have decided to try purchasing this from somewhere else. Needless to say, my daughter was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"PowerPuff Girls","review":"Videos are have great playback quality and include all of the episodes, but there is no labeling or design on the disks themselves, so it is confusing to tell which side is which (-1 star). Don't expect any bonus cartoons to be included with these disks like the ones available for sale or rent in retail stores. Courage The Cowardly Dog, Sheep In The Big City are nowhere to be found on these DVDs (-1/2 star)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!! finally on dvd!!","review":"I purchased the series from best buy but i want to rate the box set and the series... this collection is awesome the show is american animation at its best!! hilarious and action packed i definitely recommend the collection to any fan or someone looking for a high quality cartoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-have for Powerpuff Girls fans","review":"My husband got this set for our kids, who are all PPG fanatics. I wish all boxed sets were this great. This set has *EVERY* PPG episode made for Cartoon Network. The discs are double-sided and come in individual cases so they go through less wear than DVD sets that are in the flip-style arrangements (such as Simpsons and Pokemon).I do wish they would mass release this set as individual DVDs though. Our kids lost one of the DVDs and finding a replacement without buying a whole new boxed set took months of eBay searching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Fast shipping; was the best present that I could have gotten for my four year old Powerpuff Girl fanatic; item was just how described and arrived just in time for her birthday!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but problems","review":"I had been very happy with TV for the first month but a reoccurring technical problem as made me regret purchasing it. The TV now loses picture and sound after being on for about 20 minutes. Despite still being under warranty this problem has yet to be corrected after several visits by an RCA technician over the past month. I would absolutely not buy this TV again and I strongly suggest that anyone who purchases it consider checking to make sure there is a competent repair center that can make housecalls in your area (TV is way to big to haul back and forth to the many service calls you may need)."},{"rating":"1","title":"RCA F38310 38\\" REVIEW","review":"I HAVE OWNED ONE FOR OVER A YEAR AND IN THIS TIME I HAVE HAD 3 RECEIVERS PUT IN AND HAVE THE SERVICE PEOPLE OUT 5 OR 6 TIMES AND EACH TIME IT IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.BUT WHEN IT WORKS IT'S THE BEST TV I HAD EVER HAD GREAT FOR PLAYING X-BOX OR NINTENDO ON."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad OOBE","review":"Day 1. After wrestling this monster indoors & out of the box it really disappointed me. When I plugged in the AC cord I heard the 'chirp' of the high voltage power supply and the whirr of a fan. Pressing the power button changed nothing. There's no initial setup screen, no blue screen, no snow, nada, zip, nothing. The troubleshooting index suggests removing power & trying again in 5 minutes. No good. I've removed power & placed a fan near the vents in case condensation formed when the unit came in from its 50 degree Farenheit journey from Circuit City. We'll see where this goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"The unit is highly succeptable of blowing the high voltage (fly-back) transformer, which will generally cause other component failures. You'll find yourself waiting for months to get replacement parts, and longer waiting for Thompson Electronics to provide any form of customer satisfaction or care. (Poor design and sub-standard quality)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent HDTV Value","review":"Great overall performance, great picture, I have had it for 2-years without any problems.

DON'T BUT IT - NOT WORTH THE HASSLE.I bought this TV a month ago and it seems to be the worst consumer electronics decision I've ever made.Initially it worked fine (over the air). When I had a Direct TV dish installed,it became apparent that the inbuilt direct tv tuner didn't work. The RCA recommendend repairer came and collected it and determined there was also a problem with the picture tube...My advice - choose a TV with better warranty support"},{"rating":"1","title":"no sound","review":"A relative who owned this for a year using surround sound just gave me this unit.

DirecTV is a Satellite Company that is about to be \\"basically\\" bought out buy another Satellite company, DishNetwork. The DirecTV Reciever in this tv is going to be obsolete equipment. Don't believe it? Well, RCA has STOPPED making these recievers, so what does that tell you?The High Definition part of this tv is great and all, but you can go out and get a much better quality HDTV w/out this useless receiver."},{"rating":"2","title":"still thinking","review":"which one ? looking at rca 38 in or panasonic 47in projection widescreen swaying towards rca mostly for built in hdtv also like clarity of tube tv. price pretty much evens out more tv with projection but which one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice initially, but later....","review":"I bought this television 4 months ago. All the methods suggested by RCA to get the TV to work were tried but nothing worked. Finally a RCA-approved local technician checked it and found that a component in the power supply board was bad. After this, a video converter board was found to be bad. I am going to cut my losses and sell this TV now and buy something else. If you scan the reviews here at Amazon and other sites, you will see that RCA/Thompson products have a much higher component failure rate than similar products made by Sony, Panasonic, JVC, etc. You pay a little less for RCA up front, but are taking a high risk later with repair bills and headaches. Think about it before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy after 1 Day","review":"I just bought this set and have had it for a day and so far I am very happy. One concern that others had expressed was the noise of the fan. I can barely hear the fan if I put my ear next to teh TV, so on my unit anyway this is not an issue (unless it gets worse with time). I have not yet hooked up direct TV so I have not yet gotten the HDTV part going, but just looking at a DVD on the set (component input) the quality is really great.Now \\"regular\\" TV channels don't always look so fabulous, but I suspect that may be just because the clarity and size of the tv shows teh imperfections in those signals (like sometimes I notice artifacts that I think are from my tivo--I never noticed them before but I wasn;t using such a good set before).Anyway, for the price, considerng it has a built in HDTV tuner (very few sets do)...its a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best TV picture - - - period!","review":"I had the poor saleslady drag this TV alongside a Sony and Philips; my three HDTV finalists all using the same signal source. The RCA won by a narrow margin over the Philips and a wide margin over the Sony. All had great pictures, so the RCA was the best of the best.This monster is heavy, so get some help to move around 216 pounds.It is hard to believe that there are no video outputs on this unit. More than stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Replace DM1 module after 18 months","review":"Purchased for Christmas, 2002. Excellent picture. No troubleuntil June, 2004. Heard a \\"popping\\" sound and the on screen menuwent berserk. DM1 module needs to be replaced. Cost: $1500.00Fortunately, we purchased an extended warranty. They havedecided to replace the TV with one of equal quality plus aseparate HD Directv Receiver. Do not purchase this unit unless you have money to throw away or you like to gamble. Also, wehad to travel a long distance to take the unit to a service center who would EVEN begin to check and repair the set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repair parts unavailable - TV D/C'd ????","review":"Never another Thompson product for this consumer. After a $400+ earlier repair, TV again went out, took 10-12 weeks to determine part not available.

TV left my house in January and I'm still waiting for a check - only saving grace - not a Thompson credit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Grill","review":"This grill has everything I wanted in a grill. It gives you the convience of gas, but the taste of a charcoal grill. I love the built in wood box. Today I smoked a Boston Butt roast for 6 hours using indirect heat on about 225 degrees and it turned out great. I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect Weber S-650","review":"The Weber S-650 is the best grill I've owned. It is the third weber I've purchased. My last weber is 18years old. Weber's quality and parts support has been the best. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the decal, for the lighting and propane instructions, on the inside of the lefthand door, is on upsidedown."},{"rating":"2","title":"New to Gas Grilling","review":"Never owned a gas grill before so I have nothing to compare this to, other than my beat up old charcoal grill. First things first...it arrived in perfect condition...no dents in the doors...no scratches. This thing is built like a tank. Nothing wobbles, shakes, or squeeks. Good solid construction. The hood seems like it could widthstand a mortar shell.Everything works as advertised. Little if any discernable difference in taste between gas and charcoal. Could it be that those flavorizor bars are more than just a marketing gimmick? Time will tell. Due to my lack of experience with gas, the feature set on this grill far exceeds my ability to take advantage of it. But it will be a fun learning experience. That's all for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"disgusting gease pan water leaks design flaw","review":"I purchased the nearly same s-670 grill as a replacement for an older weber and returned it as defective. the replacement also was flawed and was taken back. There is a serious disgusting design flaw on this model. there is a large gap all along the attachment of the grill to the cart that leaves a one inch opening around it. In ANY rain storm water leaks in here, runs down the grease trap catcher and fills the grease pan that sits in the cabinet. In a short time your entire cabinet fills with a flood of rotting greasy overflow and water destroying anything inside. Weber claims to know nothing of this and asked for photos to analyze but if you search on line for this problem you will see many many people have had it and demanded refunds from weber. Their only answer is to leave the grill covered at all times when not in use-- this is just unacceptable for a $2000 grill. Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Summit Line Problem","review":"I have a Weber Summit S-420, but my comments are applicable to the entire Summit line. Whenever it rains, water flows down the back and enters the internal drip tray, which the flows into a drip pan. The pan overflows creating a greasy mess inside the cabinet. The problem occurs with and without the Weber cover in-place. Weber does not consider this to be an issue!!! I give the grill a 2 star rating because it does do a nice job of cooking - once the mess is cleaned up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible singing and playing on the CD","review":"I had only a short look at the book itself and it appears to me to be OK (say 3 stars worth). When I bought the book during holiday, I alas have not had the opportunity to listen to the accompanying CD - a grave mistake and the reason for the ONE STAR.Both the singing and the guitar(s) playing are truly repulsive: the singer is off-key an estimated 30% of the time and his voice generally breaks with the moderately to high notes. The guitar playing is uninspired, appears to be off-beat a bit too much, and I have the idea that the guitar(s) are significantly out of tune in half of the songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame On You Jump Start!","review":"I am very disappointed with this product. It is a quiz show style game in which the host \\"Polly\\" is supposed to be a 2nd grade genious. (I guess this is why she is wearing coke bottle glasses and a lab coat?) She is a bully! When getting an answer wrong she makes fun of you. If you get the answer right, she makes fun of you. I will not allow my child to play this game.

Surprisingly, the group was declared as a one-hit wonder, but what does the hit lead to? It just leads all the way down into a spiral.The 1995 album, LP, consists of upbeat and strong apply-made titles, including This House Is Not A Home, and sadly, their only one hit, I'll Be There For You, from the mega-hit NBC series, Friends. Sadly, there were edged into the wall, only from the popularity of Friends. Nevertheless, they could still make a good song anyday.The bad part is that many people only bought this album because of the Friends theme. No wonder, they were unable to showw the true colrs, on the radio, or in the mainstream.

This book avoids any breathless disclosures in favor of excellent detail on many of the blind alleys and unknown people who are a part of the historical record, but are rarely mentioned. Open at any page, and you will be intrigued by at least one entry, and will find yourself following the cross references to other entries throughout the book. I find that I often bookmark pages to come back to later, even after having read virtually everything credible done on the subject. Highly recommended for your bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"non-fiction?","review":"This is a terrible book. It presents highly speculative and unfounded conspiracy theories as if they're actually true! It doesn't belong on the non-fiction shelf of the library, which is where I found it.

We also hear the energetic music of the 1950s (\\"Angel Baby\\" by Jeanette Hurado and \\"Que Rico El Mambo\\" by Perez Prado). This transports us to the lives of the first generation of Sanchezes, born in the United States, raised by their Mexican-born parents. We also have some lively merengue (in the form of \\"Guavaberry\\" by Juan Luis Guerra y 4.40).You all will love this CD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the CD","review":"Music is great...lots of oldies.

As my review's title says, this is The Preeminent Guide to Egypt. At 495 pages, it's quite comprehensive, and, there's numerous drawings of temples, and multi-fold pullouts. You just don't see this kind of guide anymore. For example, if your Egyptian guide takes you to the Temple of Khons, simply turn to page 278 and you will find a diagram of the temple from overhead, as well as a description of each portion of it, all clearly labeled. It also includes a concise but helpful English-Egyptian dictionary, and a primer on Heirglyphics, and much more. Writers who write about Egypt should also have a copy of this book in their library, it will be indispensable to you. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended Fitness Training Program","review":"I am a Physical Education teacher and purchased this book for the training and evaluation sections.

The evaluation section is exceptional and it is the first time I have seen such a thorough explanation in one book. I would highly recommend this book to anyone involved in fitness training or education even though it was directed to police and firefighters.

The knives were sharp out of the box and made well. the steel is a good guage and do not flex like my previous starter set. The steak knives have not rusted in the dishwasher but I do hand wash all the other chopping, dicing, and slicing blades. I am an average size man and can safely say that the handles on the smaller knives are a little smaller than I would have liked, or I am too used to the big injection molded plastic from my previous ones. That is the only complaint I have. I frequently cut meat, Dice vegetables, and just flat out use them. The price can not be beat and I am very happy with this purchase. I will continue to use these for quite some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely disgusted, but only because I don't like rust.","review":"If you're an avid fan of rust then by all means, buy these knives.

We're not talking about days or months submerged, nope just overnight in the rack will do. I swear they had little rust speckles right out of the box. I should have known better though because I read a review like this one, but ignored it so I guess I got mine. Farberware must have specially engineered the stainless steel to rust faster. I am severely dissapointed, and unless you like rust you will be too. oh, and they hold a terrible edge, but I'm not a chef so that really didn't bother me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great buy!","review":"I read what everyone else said about these knifes rusting and decided that the price was worth the risk. I have had no problems with them at all, that said I think they could have been sharper, but I can fix that.

Sanborn's playing is far too \\"smooth\\" to contain any of these traits. His playing is lovely, it may soar and you may find it emotionally touching.

A zippered slash in front completes the bag. There is a bottom-zippered sleeve on the back for slipping onto a luggage handle but works better (zipped) as a mag holder and hung from the front of a larger rolling piece of luggage. I have the Werks Traveler which has the mono-poll ergonomic pull handle and a slip-over type of bag doesn't work well except when it's added to the front strap.

I thought, ok, just another boring reading book, whatever. But it was worse than that. This was stereotypical, but tried to be clever. Every time the main character made a joke, he clarified it, and it usually wasn't very funny the first time. The main character was portrayed as a well read, above average student, but the only books he reads are the general required reading for every school in the country (To Kill A Mockingbird, etc.)The book also tries to use vocab words, but he is so blatantly trying to pound them into our heads that it gets annoying. The characters are very fake and boring, and when it tries to get into heavier subjects, the heavier things (like suicide) are glossed over and sort of ignored (bad things happen, but not to you!). There is one type of charming in the book, and if you aren't that kind of charming, you are out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summer Reading","review":"I had to read this book over the summer for Summer Reading.

Each character in Scott's high school will be instantly recognizable to any reader, and yet is not some cardboard cut-out character.

I read it in 45 minutes.This book gave NO information relating to specific conspiracy theories, most of the topics of discussion were British in nature (which is fine if you live in Britian, but I'm in the US and none of that means anything to me) and is no more than a rambling mess about why conspiracy theories exist (in the author's opinion, of course) and footnotes. Extremely repetative, no structure or organization.This book is a mess and not worth a dime....

This watch did not even last 2 years before it started to fall apart. It's completely a Lemon and specially for a $325 price tag.

That is the universal language of trust and love that is common to all livings things. What makes this book special is the understanding of past lives that specific animals communicate verbally and the knowledge that we, if inclined, may also partake of this. The delicate, joyous feeling of universal understanding comes upon those who are open to this. Even our beautiful earth, though mute to most of us, has a symphony of love and harmony that patiently supports us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly touching","review":"Deeply touching and amazing book, that will change the minds and hearts of even the most skeptical, about communicating with our animals. Highly recommended, and easy to relate to on a highly spiritual and emotional level. Reading this book will touch the heart and stimulate the sensitivity of every animal owner. Arlene Millman, author of BOOMERANG - A MIRACLE TRILOGY (The tale of a remarkable Boston Terrier)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably fresh music after all these years","review":"I heard about this band six years ago and took a chance and got their CD. It was probably one of the best music-related decisions i have made. The music rocks, in its optimistic upbeat and assured phrasing to its fresh melodies. The songs \\"Ren\\" and \\"Hear\\" are too persuasive to listen to that you'll end up empowered and recharged. \\"Soon\\" is one of my favorites (why just choose one?) and the song is vindictive yet the pain in the lead singer's voice betrays this. Great oxymoron. This is one of the best kept secrets of rock. I think its time the world gets to know it. Buy the CD and make one of the best choices in your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut album by an unknown band","review":"This is one of the greatest debut albums by a band that never made...and even by a lot that did.

After receiving the book, I was very disappointed. There are about 10 pages missing, and there are copy notes and even some personal notes from the last person who used the book inside here or there.

Cioraan, Wang Wei, and Gerard Manley Hopkins is sure to get my attention for I love them all. Therefore, I am biased for Charles Wright's \\"Appalachia\\".Charles Wright has many wonderful images: \\"Remembered landscapes are left in me / The way a bee leaves its sting\\". There are also lines of religious depth: \\" . . . to get to God, pull both your feet back - / One foot from out of this life, one foot from the other\\".Unfortunately, at the end of the book, what I recalled are wonderful lines not wonderful poems. Well worth reading, even rereading and certainly better than much of contemporary poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth it","review":"In Charles Wright's book Appalachia there are many poems which do not have any apparent point. When speaking about the pointlessness of the book, the poem \\"Opus Posthumous\\" comes to mind. This poem does not have any meaning; it is not even a desirable poem to hear. Charles Wright wrote his poems either only for himself or a select few that might understand his off the wall creations. At first I thought that the poems were some kind of joke, but the punch lines never came. Charles Wright apparently wrote Appalachia not with the purpose of actually trying to write acceptable poetry, but was only trying to get some words onto paper so that it could be published. Appalachia is by far the worst book that I have read in years. I have seen better poetry written by teenagers. It is a waste of paper, time, and money. I only hope that contemporary poetry does not follow in the footsteps of Charles Wright, because poetry of this kind belongs in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most inspiring, faith building books I've read.","review":"I was deeply touched by the simplistic faith of these backwards people from a small island in Indonesia. Even the children, as young as six, took the entire Bible at face value and began to travel through the jungle to nearby villages to tell others about God and His saving power. The miracles that transpired, many people of today would scoff at and say that they are fantasies or the figment of someone's imagination. But as Mel puts it, \\"I praise God that no matter what the scholars in America might say, we in Indonesia have experienced all the things in Mark 16 by the power of His Holy Spirit.\\" Thank God there are still those who believe the entire Bible.God sent Mel to America as a missionary and until he landed at L.A. airport, he had no comprehension of why. He felt that Indonesia still needed missionaires from America until he realized the motto on our coins was no longer true. The motto, \\"IN GOD WE TRUST."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are reasons we Dont see miracles and they do!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was the start of a desire in my life for more of GOD in and through my life. The events described are miraculous and very inspiring. The simple raw faith of these believers is what grabs you. The brothers and sisters written about in this book took Jesus at His Word with no doubt that He that saved and filled them would also perform His Word.On arriving in America, the author new something was wrong.

If you are a believer it provokes you to rise up out of complacency and do the works Jesus has commanded us to do. He is the God of the United States. He is just looking for believers. The signs and wonders is what's needed to usher in this end time harvest. They don't need to be talked into believing in God. It needs to be demonstrated. I have purchased and sent copies to people I believe want to demonstrate God power, and to stir them out of complacency. We have so much in America. The believers just have the Word, they believed the Word, and saw the Word become a reality in their everyday lives. Wake up body of Christ. There is a work still to be done.

I just closed the book and put it to one side, regretting ever considering distributing it. I knew there was something wrong.It is obvious how the writer himself even clutches at straws when he recounts himself and some other believers drinking water and God 'telling them' to say it is delicious wine. If you ever read that part of the book you will very quickly perceive how desperately it is stated, as if Mr. Tari is desperate to believe it's true no matter what.Don't waste your money or mind, rather buy God's Smuggler again."},{"rating":"2","title":"IF YOU WANT TO FIND \\"ONE OF THE GOOD ONES\\" READ THIS BOOK!","review":"Get ready for some time-tested, old fashioned advice.

For (price), I did not expect the kind of quality I got. I compared this set to my old speaker system, a... Creative Labs FPS1000. Well I can safely say, although the price of this labtec is a little less than double the creative, its about 8 times better.The subwoofer is built well, its heavy, in a strong wooden case to eliminate distortion. The base is extremely powerful. The only problem it suffers is that at some volumes, it tends to overpower the satellites. But this can be fixed by adjusting the level of the base.The Satellites are very lightweight, sometimes, i wonder if they are too lightweight. But anyway, they sound great, very clear. There is a power button, volume control and headphone jack on the satellite, very convenient.There is only one slight problem with this system, it comes with a flimsy manual. But, that isn't too much of a problem because it is very easy to set up. Thats why I give it 5/5 Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Labtec Pulse 424 speakers","review":"I just got these speakers last week and they are amazing.

Mrs.Jenkins is a superb writer and historian. The story of Hestor and Galen renewed my interest in reading. The plot was better than a movie and the romance was sweeter than any modern day courtship. This is a story set in slavery times, but with a wonderful blend of mystery, intrigue and special romantic interludes. OH HOW ROMANTIC....In a modern society, where relationships are based on things, this story highlights the special ways two people share the simplicity of life in little things \\"like making mud pies together\\" all while dealing with the hardship and adversity of slavery issues.

Women from all over will want to be cherished and worshiped like the characters in these books. Beverly captures Black History and romance all in one fabulous setting.

Because of situations beyond her control, Hester was left with a lifelong brand and unbeknownst to her, it would be that very imperfection that would become a loving moniker.

Indigo and Topaz are my favorites but the others are also very good. I recommend these books to anyone who loves romance and excitement. Beverly's books always gives you a history lesson and that's one of the things I really love about them.

Well this is definitely not a romance. Although set in the 1800's, there is very little sense of time or place. It has HEA endings, obligatory in erotica, but really, it's nothing but sex scenes with very slight links between them, which is how I think of pornography. Utlimately it was too slight to hold my attention, and it's not a keeper. All that sex with no feelings for the characters or sense of connection between them (aside from the physical, that is) makes it too much sugar, not enough substance.

In his books are recommendations to learn about value averaging as descibed in this book by Michael Edleson.As I begin reading, I quickly realize this is simply the stock market version of the Martingale gambling system which in stock market terms is a short volatility or mean reversion strategy. This text explain how this strategy is a winner, but in reality, it only works if the market is always going up year over year. In a big market crash like that of 08, this strategy gets crushed as it goes all in after the first dip.Maybe some have faith in this methodology but personally, I think it's a statistical gimmick that doesn't respect the fat tails of the real marketplace. I know this strategy has a cult following, but I won't be participating in it or dollar cost averaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broker husband says \\"Great Book\\", thanks!!","review":"I ordered this for my husband.

Dollar Cost Averaging works during asset accumulation phase only. You really have to do the opposite during asset withdraw phase of you life. It works for asset accumulation and asset withdraw phases of life. One drawback is the focus on continuing streams of new deposits. So you have to improvise somewhat if you are just reallocating from a static portfolio that is meant to grow over time. Works best for that portion of portfolio meant to grow. The portion used for withdrawals should be treated strictly from your non-equity \\"safe money\\" assets used for short term (<7 years) goals giving time for the long term target to be achieved.author seems to have biography that I think should be left out of the book. His personal life may bias your opinion of the content of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Value Averaging","review":"I'm sorry, but I put this book down after reading the first three chapters. This book takes into account strategies that only work if the individual stock or market continuously goes up. If a stock hits a new high or low, taking this books advice, you should buy ignoring all other market conditions. This will hedge your profit or loss while investing blindly into the market. No wonder why the majority of individual investors will end up losing in the stock market.With the housing boom coming to an end, interest rates artificially being kept low, and inflation on the horizon, the book will lower your net worth for years to come.For a man with an MIT PHD and the Managing Director of Morgan Stanley, this book is a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"where are the chakras?","review":"interesting information, not for the reader who is totally new to new age stuff, overly simple meditation, NO MENTIONS OF CHAKRAS WHATSOEVER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing About Chakras","review":"Considering it's the first word in the title, I expected this book to have something on Chakras - no dice.

I preferred it to the seriously flawed \`War Dragons' with it's sundry continuity errors. But objectively I can't rate it any higher than the first book in the series. Captain Picard and Lt Worf undercover, an interesting premise. It had all the ingredients; a few space battles, intrigue, lost treasure and a beautiful woman at the heart of it all ; the mysterious captain: \`Red Abby'. but it lacked a little sauce, some flavour. There just wasn't enough of the Enterprise D crew to make it more palatable. A novelised version of the double STNG episode \`Gambit \` from Picard's point of view would have been a better idea as it is \`Dujonian's Hoard' is but a pale imititation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst one of the series so far","review":"I read Captain's Table #1 and immediately chased it with this one. Like drinking the hair of the dog on a morning after, this one tasted awful. I actually quit reading the book in frustration after struggling to get through the long-winded passages describing the intricate details of the various ships, weapons, crew members, etc. I'm a fan of action-adventure, but this was pure torture. The writer made me feel like Capt. Picard is truly a boring storyteller -- not that the story itself isn't interesting, but that *he* couldn't tell it well. The interruptions from the captain's listeners aren't as frequent as in the previous book (or in later ones). Those interruptions, IMO, help to break up the story, provide suspense, and keep it from dragging. \\"Dujonian's Hoard\\" needed those interruptions more frequently, and it doesn't get them. As a result, the story gets bogged down in the details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much in Love with the Framing Story","review":"The tale told by Captain Picard in this second \\"Captain's Table\\" novel is, in and of itself, amusing but not engrossing. Almost all of the pleasure one could get from it is sapped by the ever-increasing interruptions that return us to the far-too hokey Captain's Table bar. The interruptions do not, as one reviewer suggested, lend a sense of realism. Rather, they continually remind us how contrived the whole set up is. As with War Dragons, the tale itself is *not* written in the way one would expect a story to be told at a bar, and Picard's voice is not always captured. My advice to those who are about to read this one: read only the chapters captioned \\"Tale.\\" Skip all of the others.Michael Jan Friedman is ordinarily among the best of the Trek writers; it is unfortunate that he allowed himself to get roped into the Captain's Table idea. A fine talent, an interesting challenge (a first-person Picard tale), but a wasted effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drudgery. Lacking excitement at any turn.","review":"In the first of the series, War Dragons, there is wonderful excitement and continuity of the story. This is always commendable, but more so when you realize the dual nature of the story. In this poor follow up, Picard cannot capture our imagination in the same way. The story is constantly interrupted by the audience. You don't have the time to build excitement enough to care what is going to happen next. The ending is predictable, (Picard never waivers), and even Worf manages to sound boring in this tale. Oh well. I'll still read The Mist and the others. I'm looking forward to Pike's tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Story","review":"A weak star trek novel. The story was nothing but fighting - not very deep.

Also the low budget-ness made the movie suffer and some of the acting is inconsistant....But now that I've got the bad stuff out the way, the good in this movie is to see this actors/rapper be an ensemble in such a form.

The moral of the story( as Lil' Kim would start of one of her rap versus) Is that dont expect this to be a hit( hince that why I went straight to DVD, but dont expect it to be a Glitter.

Throw in some random cruelty scenes such as blowing fish up with fireworks, smashing fireflies with tennis rackets (showing kids how to do both) and a completely unrealistic sex scene. There was a shift in one character's demeanor that was very drastic and never explained.

No one really rings all that true, either. So, you're left to wade through the film-making technique, which relies on a lot of time-shifting and flashbacks that become a bit confusing because they are so short and frequent. It takes awhile before it dawns on you who is who here besides the evil dad, Willem DaFoe, who looks the same in flashback and today. Julia Roberts doesn't have much to do, either, as the long-suffering mom who looks the other way at her husband's child abuse.

When you compare it to the Be Bop Deluxe catalogue it pales considerably. As with most of Nelson's work it is clever and inventive. Unfortunately, it is also extremely hyper-active. Too much so, as the pace spoils what could have been interesting cuts. Nelson also abandons his guitar god throne on this outing avoiding guitar solos entirely. Stick with Be Bop Deluxe, particularly Sunburst Finish, Modern Music, Live in the Air Age and Futurama. Give this one a pass....Simon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I am new to the whole Bill Nelson collection. I read about in him a recent Guitar Player magazine. I also remember my father owning some Be Bop Deluxe albums. I decided to investigate. I am so glad I did. I have enjoyed everything Bill Nelson that I have heard so far. Sound on Sound is something special. Got the CD in the mail today and have already heard it 3 times since opening up the package. It's not for everyone but those who it is for will fall in love with it as I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon supervision of sales","review":"Amazon has asked twice to review an item which has yet to be delivered.

Most of these Karaoke tracks you may not be able to find anywhere else.Also on the CD are four songs performed by a new face: Stephanie. I heard some of her songs and I was completely blown away. She has a great voice that'll just mezmerize you.Overall, it's definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Uplifting","review":"I find this album, and all the songs on it, infused with happiness, and the album makes me smile within seconds of hitting play. The songs are upbeat, with great beats, wonderful multi-part singing, and a kind of African - Carribean feel to them.I highly recommend this CD, I think it's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, instructive and practical","review":"Simple, instructive and practical. That is the best description for this book. Andrew Martin has written a good introduction to the Center Counter (Scandinavian). The book gives you a good perspective on how to play the opening (the main line with Qa5 and early deviations).I have only found a few invaluable faults. As example in the intruduction it is said that the move orden would always be c6, Bf5, e6, Nd7, Bb4 and Ngf6, but in almost 95% games in the book, the move order estar with Ngf6. Anyway I understant the author message.Highly recommended if you play or want to learn the Center Counter.Best Regards"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like this book","review":"I don't like this book at all. Too many lines but not enough substance. Better off using chess opening database."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and little info","review":"This is another horrible book by Andrew Martin.

This book freaking sucks!!!!! The author is not clear on some things and does not give very clear examples of what to do. (lesson 02 pg.75). It seems he assumes you know what to do even though this book states it is for the novice too.Oh well,I'm going to think twice about ordering another alias publised book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Start from here.","review":"Great book. Lessons are detailed and give you a good grasp of what a complicated program like Maya can do. Of course some effort is needed from the reader, it simply not possible to master (or simply work) with such a sophisticated tool with no effort. So, following these instructions, the reader will discover first (most important thing imho) if he or she is really interested in the topic. Having this interest he/she will have good (wotking) time to discover Maya capabilities with these detailed step-by-step lessons. For THE starting book of Maya discovery, look around no further. This should be the first book to own and practice on.Highly recommended. The Sketchbook Pro included is a great gift also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"This book is weighty, full-colored and honestly, looks pretty cool when it comes in the mail. The problem starts when you go to use it. For someone like myself who has absolutely no prior 3D animation expierence, this book is horrible. It skimps on steps, the steps it tells me to do fail to work in the program, the dozens/hundred of menu options are not labeled when you're doing the steps and then a few pages over it'll tell you to go to visor window and you're all, what? Visor menu? What in the world is that? Then you have to waste valueable time searching for the elusive menu.I would not recommend this book to anyone who has no prior knowledge or expierence. It's a fairly useless book if you need help pinpointing how to do something because the only way you'll be able to do anything out of the book is to do every single page until you've worked your way up to where you need to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this DVD","review":"I had a different idea of what this DVD would be. It has a young girl on the cover and 80+ minutes of instruction but, the actual ballet instruction for kids is maybe around 25 minutes. The other hour just watching older dancers, learning about point dance and the shoes. Its almost like a documentary, so your little primaballerina will find most of this boring. The actual instruction is being interpretted into english and doesn't really give you comprehensive instruction on the ballet moves. If your child is already in ballet then it might make more sense to them, but I'm not sure if they will find if fun and once you've watched it once, most likely they'll never want to watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Value","review":"The Panasonic SCPM11 offers a very good feature set at a very good price: 5 CD changer, high power, clear sound, fairly good frequency response, and a good remote. Not a bad looking unit either, but not exactly \\"sexy.\\" The low points: Not as deep a bass response as more pricey units, no PlayExchange (i.e., does not let you swap out CDs while one is playing), no custom equalization, and a noisy changer that will probably wake you up if you use the \\"sleep\\" function. If you're willing to forego these shortfalls, it's definitely worth considering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite","review":"The poetry in this book is magnificent. The incredible weather imagery make the poems larger than life--nearly a working model for objective correlative.

This product arrived obviously defective with an end piece that was obviously broken and yet the product was still packaged and sent to me. This is a big bulky item so not an easy return and I didn't install the item immediately so Amazon won't handle a return after one month. I'll be contacting the manufacturer directly for a replacement part. Once the replacement part arrives, it appears as if the product will work well. This is why I gave two stars rather than one. But a bother and a disappointment for what should be a very good quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Semitic and Under values the Festivals","review":"I was totally ashamed to read that the Mr. Scott see no value to God's appointed times except as a sign pointing to Messiah. He reads like one looking down his nose at the Jews and constanltly reminds Christians that they are so much better off without these Holy days. He implies that the Messiah has the right to change what God established, so if you are a follower of Jesus you can ignore these appointred times and enjoy Christams and Easter if you want.

This book was created for people who want to break into the industry. By no way is the author saying it's easy but the insight to certain industry professions and the professionals he had contribute to this book is remarkable.If you know someone who wants to break into the film industry, I know there are many books out there but purchase this book as a present for that individual. It's hip, informative and definitely not boring.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book to get started","review":"I am an entertainment buff and I thought this book was great for people who want a survey of jobs they can pursue. It gave an in depth look at a lot of the positions in the film business. If you want a general look at the possible jobs, get this book. If you are more interested in television, this book is a great start, but it doesn't say anything about that since its primarly about film so look for another book for further reading. I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to break into the business, it was really helpful for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find a different program instead!","review":"I thought the Kliplinger Will program would be as functional as their TaxCut software, but clearly this program falls short. The instructions were bad, and what drove me the MOST crazy was that there was no delete feature (if you mistakenly list your mutual fund under a savings account, for example, you can't just delete or recatogorize the entry).When I printed my V-E-R-Y simple will, the program managed to spit out 45 pages of lawyer-speak.

It also appears a bit skimpy in size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabric.","review":"The scarf looks wonderful.

And my recommendation is \\"Use it only if you enjoy confusing students\\". I rated it \\"one star\\" because the choice \\"no star\\" does not exist. Whatever earlier editions of the book may have been like, this edition is full of errors. I spent the beginning of each class pointing out the errors I have found in a chapter and its assignments; my students find more. But my most serious criticism is this -- For teaching a relational database language, supply a database that follows a good relational model! The design of the database used in this book is atrocious. If one designed a database like that at a company, one should get fired for incompetence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good teaching source","review":"This book has been quite helpful in learning the fundamentals of itallic Calligraphy.

A very recent (2002) book that covers the militaries of several countries in the region. A chapter each on Syria, Egypt, Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Iran. Plus a discussion of US and Russian involvement.Very readable. Though, needless to say, the chapters on the Iraqi army of Saddam Hussein, and on the US, are now outdated. The book was printed in 2002, but the text was written prior to 11 September 2001. So there is little discussion of terrorism/guerilla activity. Don't let this deter you. The book still gives a good briefing on the armies. Useful background for current affairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"un aporte a la valoracion de los servicios ambientales","review":"Es bien importante que se editen textos en estos temas de econom��a ambiental pues la subestimaci��n del valor de los ecosistemas para la humanidad surge a partir del poco conocimiento de los ecosistemas, de sus sinergias y los diversos beneficios que brindan, muchos de ellos no reconocidos.

It was a little hard for him to reach the digger at first but now he can reach it. Also, because it is lightweight, a new walker might have trouble using it to balance and walk behind it initially.

I like the light weight feel of the pieces, but as far as ergonomic, I can't tell the difference between this design versus the standard designs. I even find that the standard design works better such as the cultivator, this one is much harder to use because the the claw is more sparse and is thicker at the end giving it more difficulty penetrating the dirt.

I suppose if you lived your entire life in the big city, there might be some value here. The problem is that the author's perspective is completely distorted through a foggy prism of self righteousness. If he were a pleasant fellow, I could overlook his hypocrisy... but he isn't. He hates the independent, self-sufficient logger who \\"destroys\\" the precious wilderness, but feels free to burn as much wood as he can get his hands on. His justification of the wood having already been chopped is the equivalent of purchasing ivory that has already been removed from the elephant, or the sea turtle shell that is already dead... some environmentalist.If you can overlook the hypocrisy, then maybe this book has some merit. Otherwise, I recommend chopping wood instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rick's a cool guy","review":"Having experienced the Yaak during winter, a few years in a row, I know what it's like...

Each of the three times I've sat down to read it, I've soon set it aside, thinking 'life's too short to spend with books like this.' Rick Bass may be a great guy (some reviewers point out that he is), but this book is forced and soulless. Within my own experience with environmental nonfiction, \\"nature writing\\" as some will call it, I can think of nothing with which this book would compare well. Teale's 'Wandering Through Winter' is broader and more informative, more interesting because it is more interested; Abbey's 'Desert Solitaire' is more personally engaging; Thoreau's 'Walden', Leopold's 'Almanac' or 'Sketches', anything by Muir, Mowat, or Lopez -- more philosophical, more lyrical, more evocative, far better by any standard of measure.Sorry to have to fasten the 'one star' rating here, Mr. Bass, but this book is nothing beyond mediocre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winter...It takes Me Back...","review":"\\"Winter\\"...It takes me back...Spent half a year (winter) taking care of one of the wonderful characters pictured in prose so well in this book.Was hard not at all to close my eyes and find me back at TheDirty Shame doing my laundry and talking with Donna and Rickwhile feeding quarters into the poker machines.This book makes it so easy to remember the beautiful scenery,the deer who outnumbered us humans X100,the birds and just thevery excitement in getting up each morning...the very smell of the fresh air with a slight hint of woodsmoke.For anyone just looking for a Good Book...a nice easy read that can prompt your mind to return to your own personnal unique world... \\"Winter\\" will take you back there...I believe everyone has their own\\" personal place\\" and I thank Mr Bass for sharing the Yaak and hope it helps others returnto theirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teenagers write better blogs","review":"Teenagers write better blogs.

That steel-drum sound -- don't even ask how he produces that -- the rhythms, and that haunting/enchanting melody have landed this track on mix-tapes for people who hate techno.

Reading this, I learned it's even less grounded in reality than I thought.At first I was too busy looking at the terrific photos, but then I settled down and read it cover to cover, and found it well worth my time. It's lavishly illustrated, but, as another reviewer mentioned, it is not a reference work. Instead, it's mainly a historical analysis of the political, economic, and social reasons for the triumph of Colonial Revival architecture. It covers many areas of interest outside the scope of a reference work. Colonial Revival interiors receive plenty of attention, which I appreciated.The book focuses on the grandest expressions of Colonial Revival; there are no Sears 1910 homes, only custom built beauties. I would have enjoyed a survey of the lower-end expressions of the style up to the present day, but that would be another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lt.

First off, from the very beginning the software didn't always work right with my Windows XP. Anytime a document had to be cancelled, I had to reboot my computer in order to print anything else because the pending documents list would freeze up. Then there's the usual problem with not getting much usage out of an ink cartridge. But now, the paper feed doesn't work, requiring about ten attempts and usually a manual insertion of paper to get the paper to feed into the printer. The scanning feature works well, but copy quality isn't all that good, and scanning pictures also distorts the image quality quite a bit. All in all, I'm very disappointed in Lexmark and will never buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Printer Ever!!!","review":"I've owned this computer for less than 8 months and now my black ink will not print.

Don't believe the ratings for the speed. It is SLOW... The only time it's not slow is if you have it on the LOWEST RESOLUTION with BLACK AND WHITE only. Then it looks...[bad] anyway.

After a concept, he jumps straight into hard examples without showing you easy ones. Take for example section 1.6 \\"on the distribution of balls in urns\\". He explains this concept all in theory and uses the word vectors which confused me beucause i was thinking physics. He should have used the term \\"cell\\" or something less confusing.

Another reviewer said he'll burn the book, but it's not that bad either. It's a fairly typical intro book that's neither particularly good nor bad. The problems were at an appropriate level and were definitely doable if reasonable time was put in. Ross explains the concepts decently well, but I found William Feller's Intro to Mathematical Probability a much better presentation of the material. The part that I despised about Ross is his exposition of various types of random variables. This was the part where the book got truly boring, since his style was \\"this is binomial. got it? this is possion. ok. and this is exponential.\\" There was no sense of flow or connection. For this I give him 2 stars although I would have given him 3 otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good book","review":"Don't relate to previous reviewers' problems with this book: CLEAR though concise presentation of material, interesting examples.

I guess that one would be for human remains or something??????? jeez"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable","review":"It's a bag of good quality and very comfortable to carry sportswear.

She shows some creativity with the melodies that I mostly found refreshing, particularly with \\"What Child is This?\\", which is my favorite track on the disc.Joni Mitchell's \\"River\\" and Gordon Lightfoot's \\"Song for a Winter's Night\\" were welcome additions to my ears, and brought a touch of nostalgia to this 50-something reviewer's heart.Overall I found that the songs convey the wonder, the peace and the simplicity that are a powerful reminder of the true Christmas spirit. This album serves as a prophetic voice in the midst of the busyness, noise and commercialism that are hard to escape this time of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great artist","review":"Sarah McLachlan has really hit the mark with this CD. Her voice is always like a angel and this christmas compilation is no exception. Turn on the christmas lights and crank this up. Peace on Earth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to a X-mas collection!","review":"I love Sarah McLachlan and I found that her X-Mas CD was fabulous. It has a good mix of songs you recognize, with a few thrown in that you may not.Sarah has a unique sound...it carries over so well into her X-mas music. If you like her other CD's, you'll love the X-mas album. If you don't care for her other music (what's wrong with you!), then sadly I doubt you'll like this CD.My favorite on the CD has to be \\"Song for a Winter's Night\\". It is just a beautiful track.I don't own a lot of X-Mas CDs...but I am certainly happy with the purchase of this CD and I would suggest it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have Christmas CD.","review":"To have Sarah sing Christmas songs is just pure joy.A must have for all Sarah fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My new Christmas Favorite!","review":"My absolute favorite is \\"River\\"- I'm shocked that anyone could \\"do it\\" better then Joni Mitchell, but Sara McLachlan has such unbounded talent. I really liked the fact that her music suits so many different ages & tastes within my household. Definitely a CD we can all agree on this winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winter chill","review":"Nevermind this is a X'mas album. Nevermind we've been waiting for 3 years and Sarah's only treating us to an album of x'mas oldies. Nevermind the silly critiques.Sarah McLachlan knows only one thing - to move with her voice and songs. If anything's worth buying the album for, it would be the original title track, Wintersong. You'd probably not ever hear a Xmas song so heart-wrenching that it makes you pine for the person you've loved the most and then lost. It made me cry.Then there's the beautiful rendition of the Joni-Mitchell favorite River. It's beautifully touching and melancholy. Sarah made it hers.As for the rest of the album, they are covers of standard Xmas fare with an added McLachlan touch.This album will tide fans over until when Sarah is ready to charm us with another album of all-new stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"--John Diliberto Obviously Doesn't Know Music!!!!","review":"This is absolutely gorgeous, true Sarah music.

The innovative arrangements and innovative use of instruments and sounds creates a rather euphoric feeling in the best spirit of the season for the listener. These devices truly augment and enrich Sarah McLachlan's wonderful voice which reciprocates beautifully with these arrangements creating a warm and elated experience. This is one of the most remarkable Christmas albums to come along in years that is true to the spirit of the Christmas season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just beautiful","review":"I'm a Sarah McLachlan fan, but even I was skeptical about a Christmas CD. It's exceptional. I love just about every song. What's so surprising is what she was able to do with some of the traditional songs. They were amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous music!","review":"When I saw Sarah McLachlan sing \\"River\\" on the Rockefeller Christmas Tree lighting special, I knew I had to have this cd. I have at least 20 Christmas cd's from various recording artists and have since added this to my collection. Her voice is so beautiful and haunting and it makes every song on this cd spectacular. I would recommend this cd to anyone who: #1 -loves Sarah McLachlan, #2 -loves a more gentle sounding Christmas cd, and #3 -wants something that stand out as a truly unique Christmas cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"wispy, ethereal and by now cliche","review":"This is predictable stylistic treatment of standard songs by someone who may eventually sound more eccentric than anything else to future listeners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silent Blight","review":"I'd be irate if I would only stay awake long enough to notice. Stupefyingly devoid of any emotion other than monotony, her withered gossamer tones mewl standard holiday fare no better or worse than the lead in the Macy's Christmas Choir, with longtime McLachlan menace Pierre Marchand on board to helm this snoozefest with his usual flair for over-saturation. They're all here, from the traditionalist \`The First Noel' and \`Oh Little Town Of Bethlehem' and, of course, \`Silent Night', to her sucking the joy right out of \`Christmas Time Is Here' to the umpteenth remakes of \`River' and \`Happy Xmas [War Is Over]' the latter two reaching new heights [lows] of languidness. The real clinker is the self-penned \`Wintersong', her seasonal contribution I am steadfast her rabid fan base will swallow like Christmas pudding. Oh, yeah - downgraded for employing the over-rated Diana Krall on a cut. The cover art is pretty, though. My grade: C-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wintersong should be called \\"Jail house Rock!\\"","review":"I love Sarah McLachlan, but half of the songs on this cd are not even written by her. They are basically old Christmas songs. I am shocked that no on else has noticed this. She copies someone and sells a million albums, I copy ONE SONG and get a big fat F in my beginning piano composition class. If this is what the pros are doing, why are we being punished in school? Another round of applause for the public school system...no thanks, write your own songs Sarah...I have to."},{"rating":"2","title":"X mas song","review":"Heard and saw her do \\"Silent Night,Holy Night\\" live on TV- it was magificant,so I got the album.

The album features a great selection of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wintersong","review":"The CD is wonderful. I bought one for myself & one for a friend for Christmas. I am very pleased with Amazon in general. I used it for over half of my holiday purchases. And then again for birthday presents after the first of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Wintersong","review":"This is a wonderful CD! Vocal harmonies are beautiful. I can't pick a favorite song because I love them all. We are still listening to it and it's well past Christmas, just can't bear to put it away. My 13 year old daughter is in love with it too, we will probably be listening to it in July!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected","review":"I would like to start out saying that I'm a huge Sarah McLachlan fan. My wife bought this for me for Christmas as a surprise. I wanted to love the album but I just couldn't. As beautiful as Sarah's voice is, and as much as I love her style of singing, it just didn't work for me with Christmas songs. Most of the tracks sound the same and are delivered in such a somber tone that it just doesn't feel like Christmas music. In my opinion this just doesn't live up to the quality of her work. I would borrow the CD from your local library to preview it before buying it just to make sure it is your cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Another Album","review":"This is such a disappointing album. It sounds more like Enya's Christmas album, which is essentially a copy of all of her other songs. They all sound they same and they are not at all Christmas like. Do yourself a favor and save some money... if you like this artist then I'm sure you already have other songs that sound just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully done!","review":"I love this album- it's got great songs, done wonderfully well.Her version of \\"River\\"- the Joni Mitchell song- is gorgeous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Holiday Album","review":"I don't usually love new holiday albums, but I'd been waiting for years for Sarah McLachlan's beautiful voice to grace the Christmas scene. She didn't disappoint. This year this album was added to my \\"usual rotation\\" of Christmas albums. Her take on the standards are fresh - keeping you from getting bored, and her new songs are simply refreshing.Sarah, if you're reading ... Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas in September","review":"I have been a Sarah McLachlan for over a decade now beginning with her first albumTouch. I have always loved her gentle vocals and introspective lyrics. I recently got around to hearing her Christmas albumWintersong. While I do like the cd a lot, I have to admit I had to listen to it a few times to get used to Sarah's take on songs like \\"What Child is This?\\" and \\"The First Noel/Mary Mary\\". Initially I wasn't really wild about the melodies to those songs but after several listens, I grew to love them. My favorite track has to be Sarah's haunting cover of John Lennon's \\"Happy Xmas (War is Over)\\". I always loved the music and the lyrics. Sarah's gentle vocals compliments the song very well. I also enjoyed the new tracks \\"River\\" and \\"Wintersong\\". Even though WINTERSONG is a Christmas album, I do like listening to it after work. I find the music very soothing to listen to. This album is a must have for Sarah fans I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved IT!","review":"I love Sara's music ans wasn't dissappointed. The songs that were oldies but goodies had a fresh and contemporary sound with I loved. It is a great CD even for after the holidays, you never get tired of good music. Arrived fast and packaged wee as always, thanks Amazon!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like this CD!","review":"I really like the renditions Sarah McLachlan does of traditional Christmas carols and her original song is beautiful. I played it during a holiday party and many of my guests liked and asked about the music and wanted to get one for themselves. If you like her music you will not be disappointed by this new collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah Mclachalan Touches Winter","review":"Sarah Mclachlan has most beautifully and soulfully captured the essence of winter.........listen to it at night, by candlelight, as the cycle of light reaches the solstice in December....you are in the moment. The CD has been a catalyst to engage my heart and soul this Christmas. Thank you, Sarah"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Beautiful!","review":"I didn't even know that Sarah had a Christmas CD out until I saw her perform the Joni Mitchell song \\"River\\" on an episode of Martha a couple of weeks ago. Wow- I was blown away. I went right out and bought this CD and it is the most beautiful Christmas CD I have ever owned. I highly recommend this CD to everyone. Merry Christmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from Sarah!!!","review":"Love the remake of \\"River\\". Like the other reviews I also wish she had written more of the songs with her own take and thoughts in them instead of the traditionals. But beatuiful anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sarah McLachlan","review":"This is a high quality CD. This lady has such a beautiful voice. I recomend her to all"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better choices available","review":"It's not that hard to create a great Christmas Album, and it' hard to believe a talent like Sarah McLachlan created Wintersong. This is a boring Christmas album. The song selection is partially to blame as each song is slower than the next. In my opinion, this album completely fails to capture the joy of the holiday. The songs while well done are not anything special or memorable. None of Sarah's versions of these classic Christmas tunes is a standout and I doubt they will be remembered past this Christmas. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrecognizable","review":"For rabid fans only! The warbling, swoops, scoops, and drops are never ending and made me dizzy. This left me thinking, \\"Can she hit a note?\\" Based on her vocal, the songs are unrecognizable. I tried listening to the cd several times, but have decided to give up and give it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tobias Kircher","review":"Track four from which the album gets its name, written by Sarah McLachlan, is absolutely stunning in its lyric-melodic combination. It truly paints a picture of, and provides comfort for, anyone experiencing grief during the Christmas season. In addition, her renditions of traditional songs such as Noel are soulful, powerful performances. I just pulled the CD from my car--and it's five weeks since Christmas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOrRRRRrrrrInG","review":"This CD is so boring. Sarah McLachlan has written / performed songs before that have set people alight with her passion, her intensity, her hurt, etc... these are very TIRED renditions of all-too-familiar Christmas songs. Sure, I can stomach a Kenny Rogers Christmas, for some reason it just seems to make sense. But Sarah McLachlan putting out a Christmas album seems to be nothing more than a combination of not having new material of her own and needing some more bucks. Excuse my frankness, but this album is very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"To heck with the media reviewers","review":"I've seen quite a few not-so-stellar reviews of this album. Personally, I think Sarah could sing the phone book, and it would be phenomenal.She covers Joni Mitchell's The River on this album, and again does a great job with her material (she also did Blue)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Beautiful!","review":"I have quite a few Christmas CD's that get played year after year and I decided it was time to add some new music to the mix. I came across this CD during my search for new music and decided to give it a try since I've always loved Sarah's voice. This CD is so beautiful. The whole album has sort of a melancholy feel to it, definitely not your typical Christmas album. But I have to say I loved it so much that I immediately purchased four more copies to send to my sisters and best friend because I thought they would be as moved by the music as I was. This is DEFINITELY my favorite Christmas album. I don't think I'll be able to wait a whole year before hearing it again, so I'm sure I'll be pulling this one out early..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Great Album and it got here very fast, this album is great to just turn on in the background infront of the fireplace opening presents"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's amazing, buy it!!","review":"What can I say, I love Christmas music and Sarah Mclachlan crooning to them. The recording is excellent. Very little compression that I could hear, just like most of Sarah Mclachlan's albums. Kudos to the production team. The better your playback system, the better this album will sound. Her voice is very warm and comforting, just what's needed to bring Christmas spirit out of everyone. There is no weak song here. Every song is distinctive with its own style. Can't go wrong with this CD people.

What a voice this woman has and it's put to incredibly good use on these songs. I listen to this album over and over. If I had to pick only one Christmas album for the rest of my life - this would be it. No, not necessarily upbeat and \\"hot\\", so it depends on what you like. If you like languid music that wraps itself around you and is comforting and inspirational, then go with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Christmas Music album from Sarah!","review":"This is excellent as always, this has some real good selections."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll Be Home For Christmas","review":"I LOVE virtually everything that this artist does.

Her voice is beautiful as always. However, for a Christmas album, it's a little lacking in holiday cheer for my taste. It's lovely.

But I'm not limited to 2 or 3 :) So I'm quite happy to have and play this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Winter","review":"I love this album.

Considering myself more of a \\"classic\\" Christmas music fan -not easily swayed towards \\"new\\" versions of Christmas songs, I was suprised to find myself listening to this CD over and over.

It would be divine."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO GO FOR ME","review":"I was a little dissappointed in the CD. I love SM but this left me unmoved and I gave it away.

I am fan of Sarah McLachlan and was so excited to find that she recorded a Christmas CD. I was completely prepared to love it.

It's a text book case of what can go wrong when a new act is signed, a big budget is applied and there is hardly a decent song in sight. New material was in short supply, so two songs from her first indie album reappears here. Tina's strength up to the present moment has always been in the capacity of singer and performer; very old school with tons of audience interaction and sweat. See her in a small out of the way venue if you can. She has as of this year been released from her contract with Sire Records and the future of the band looks uncertain. I believe that her best work as a recording artist is yet to come if she can write or find the right songs to record. She's a rock & roll singer in need of rock & roll songs.

Nothing will ever take the place of this show and the mark it made in the industry. Even though I know it would be too much to ask, but it would be nice if they could get together and do a like a reunion episode with EVERYBODY in it. I would say it would never happen, but I've always been told \\"Never Say Never\\". But until then, I can't wait for Season 2 to come out on DVD (or which ever one has Wanda in it).

Buy this dvd set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about freakin time!","review":"I was 9 years old in 1990, and even then I realized what a great show this was. for those who missed the reruns on cable such as myself, we now have the DVD box set! Looking back, it's kind of funny how dated the show is- the obsession with neon-colored clothing, for example. My major gripes however, are:1) The fact that the only special features are commentary -- no, not from Keenan, Damon, or David Allen Grier-- but by Tommy Davidson... and even then it's only on 2 episodes!2) No blooper/gag reel episode!!! I remember seeing a show where there were nothing but bloopers. Where is that episode?In my view, these are the set's only flaws. But I think they are major enough for it to warrant 4 1/2 stars, but since there is no 4 1/2, a 4 would be more appropriate than a 5. Maybe if more people point it out it would send a message (hint, hint)."},{"rating":"2","title":"homey dont play that","review":"homey the clown still the funniest on in living color infact all it so damn funny my fav homey the clown tho this is a must have u better get this dvd or else youll regret it BAD!! i give this dvd a 2 snaps up"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOOOHOOO ITS FINALLY ON DVD !!!!","review":"In Living Color is the funniest sketch show ever made!!

THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU to whoever makes it possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Return","review":"I remember the laughter more than anything, and until right now just memories and wishes for this progam to come home where it belongs, on DVD. There has been no sketch comedy since In Living Color that could even come close to matching it in orginality, content/material, or realness. Anyone who grew-up within any generation that would have allowed them to see it was a lucky one; television is not as good now as it was then, and bringing back what most would call the quintenssential comedy, it is obvious. I can not express the joy of knowing that I can finally own the greatest comedies to ever be displayed on a televison screen.

At a time when so much poetry is blather, what a surprise to find these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good book","review":"I ended up buying , reading, and actually liking this book, but not necessarily because of the poetry itself. Some of it's a bit bad, with clunky words and phrases that sometimes wander into seemingly unrelated vagueness, though some of the images and lines are really good. What I really like about this book is what Cole has to say: his feelings, struggles, and perspective on himself and the world around him.

Essentially, it is a regurgitation of the IRS regulations on a number of estate planning issues. There is no interpretation, no attempt to simplify or clarify for the reader, and worst of all no advice on tax planning strategy given particular issues or circumstances. What do these regs mean? How should they be interpreted? What do they allow the estate planner to do and not to do? What is the most advantageous interpretation of the jprovisions? This book gives not a clue.

All of this is washed out because of Sony Connect. It makes adding music to the player because of share rights. Basically CD's that you own and burn to your computer are useless.

This isn't the best book by this team of authors. In fact, probably the worst I've read by them. Since these aren't series books, I'd skip this one unless you are a fan of the \\"ouch that hurts... let's do that again club\\". The whole premise is stupid since the main character has a family and friends that should have believed her in the 1st place. And it just keeps going and going and going and going. She is like the dumb herione in a horror movie where you are telling them not to go upstairs but they do anyways.... I expect my novels to be smarter than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Stuff","review":"I feel a little guilty enjoying these writer's works as much as I do. Not deep but really entertaining. Very British in its focus and style, this psycological thiller is a fast paced and enjoyable read. Might be a little too tame for conventional horror tastes and a little contrived for those who want realism. But the writing is good and the story easily engages the reader and holds the attention. French has a quirky and effective habit of dropping thematic bombs in very understated ways throughout the book. Many American writers should learn this trick. Subtlety is often better than overkill. Try this story, you'll probably like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great creepy psychological thriller","review":"First Ihave read from this author (authors?)..whatever.

It started out very confusing and never got any better for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"success sells","review":"I rank mystery writers into three classes: I'll check the book out of the library; I'll buy the paperback; I'll spring for the hardback. With Nicci French, I just crossed over into category 3 and ordered Secret Smile.It's about a plausible psycho who infiltrates a woman's life. Wait, no, that's The Safe House. There's a police officer who (maddeningly) won't take the woman's peril seriously. Oh, gee, that's the first third of Beneath the Skin. OK, a London woman has a terrifying experience and none of her friends believe. . . . Sorry: Land of the Living. Well, there's a seemingly loving guy who only the main character really sees for what he is and the book's called Killing Me Softly.Right. All the Nicci French books are great. And this is all the Nicci French books rolled into one. And less. Even if you are a fan, take my advice: get it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another gem by Nicci French","review":"Gripping and unnerving. The characters are real. The emotions raw.

I always enjoy her first-person heroines. When I'm reading one, it's like a movie. I'm drawn in to the page-turning suspense and identify with the characters. The thing that keeps me coming back is that she resolves her stories with a satisfactory, not an ugly, torn ending. Or as she would say in her British English, it's \\"sorted.\\" This one is a little different since there is a bit of an open door. But I wouldn't mind meeting any of her heroines again, so it's OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been better","review":"I like Nicci French's writing style, the way they describe the heroine's daily routine, the eating, the bathing, the relaxing, the working and all... But when it comes to surprising plots, twists and hooks, I have to say this book is so far behind you can't even see it! All I felt about Miranda while reading this book is that she was a pushover and wouldn't do anything AT ALL to defend herself. That went on and on for more than half of the book and it got on my nerves. There's absolutely nothing special about this book regarding suspense. Not that I regret buying this, but the funny thing is that I bought this book because at the time this was rated 5 stars here! :p"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a tad dishonest in promotion","review":"Even the install instructions ignored the restrictions (broadband needed).

These are all well written police procedurals, with a large cast of interesting characters, although character development isn't really the name of the game for McBain. Instead, these are plot driven books, about unusual (but usually believable) crime--Tricks features a troup of murdering circus midgets posing as kids at Halloween! And McBain is careful not to keep his characters in \\"series limbo\\"; although they don't age quite the same as you and I, things do happen to them--this book features an event that occurs to undercover decoy Eileen Burke that resonates through many of the subsequent books.

First, over half of the designs are pretty boring and not really worth doing (Lips? A plain heart? Boring.) The rest of them seem to all use different sizes and number of towels. To do the palm tree you need FIVE hand towels. I for one don't generally keep *that* many towels of the same color lying around. The other main problem is the directions are not terribly clear. For instance, the instructions for the dog tell me to roll up the long ends into the middle, and after trying this a couple times, and wondering why it wasn't working, I realized it really wanted you to roll the *short* ends into the middle.

(This is in a well-characterized WiFi environment with no interferers and other reliable client installations nearby.)Installation is poor as well; I had to uninstall and reinstall the device before its configuration service would start properly.In short, the WUSB54GC is a real piece of junk... not recommended under any circumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crashed my internet connection","review":"I installed the drivers and plugged it in, restarted my computer and lost my connection.

Many times it has had trouble picking up the signal from the wireless router when I don't feel this should be a problem. Both my wife and I have laptops with built in wireless receivers and have no issues picking up the router's signal anywhere in the house. However, it seems like this USB adapter has to be right on top of the router for the signal to be strong enough to link to anything.

Great addition to the library for any vine gardener."},{"rating":"2","title":"A NOTHER GREAT BLUES CD","review":"Once again I was too quick and reviewed this CD after only a couple of listens and got it wrong. After another week it has grown on me. The singing is like a slightly rougher ROBBEN FORD and suits most of these songs very well. The songs are excellent and the guitar work very tasteful. His phrasing and guitar styling at times sound familiar but he adds enough of his own to create his own style. His guitar tone is gorgeous, complimented by first class backing and superb production. Colin James promises great things for the future and I will have to buy the rest of his releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just good chops","review":"After listening to the cd a few times, I must say I'm impressed. It's obvious the guy has chops, but he doesn't force them on you with a barrage of overwhelming guitar noise. Instead, he seems to prefer a more restrained, laid back approach, using his guitar for punctuation & emphasis, a technique made famous by B.B. King & Albert King, & to a lesser extent even SRV. This makes his guitar solos stand out all the more, & when he does cut loose his style, phrasing, & tone are unquestionably the work of a master. Especially rewarding are the last two songs, \\"Atlanta Moan\\" & \\"Speechless,\\" two hauntingly beautiful ballads in stark contrast to the fast pace & upbeat tempo of the previous nine. I give him four-and-a-half stars & expect that he will continue to get better with age."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!","review":"I love blues-rock and Colin James-along with Jonny Lang-is tehe master!!! This CD is wonderful and has all of the essential elements of good blues-rock. Must buy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good!","review":"This is without one of the most disappointing short-story romance anthologies I have ever read! The first story with the abusive Tolly and his basically getting away with it and still winning the love of Sarah who was stupidly convinced by Pricilla and Hawk to forgive him and give him another chance totally marred what could have been a terrific book! Yes it even marred the romance of Pricilla and Hawk! Okay so it was Tolly's ex-girlfriend who he beat up and not Sarah but he was verbally abusive to Sarah and the fact that he physically abused his ex should be a warning sign to Sarah, Pricilla and Hawk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"There are many things that stand in the way of the heroes' happiness, and for a change, it is not lack of communication. They are torn between love for each other and responsibility to their families. I liked it that they were able to talk to each other and explain their fears and their feelings - and if sometimes they didn't say everything that needed to be said, they had good reasons for it. The story had quite a few unexpected twists and turns. I liked it. A lot :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Potter reaches for the stars...","review":"...and once again, she grasps them.

He is joined by a Dane, Niels-Henning Orsted Pederson on Bass, Canadian Lorne Lofsky on Guitar and Englishman Martin Drew on drums. This international quartet Peterson compositions combine with jazz standards to create an outstanding jazz concert. OUTSTANDING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must to have in your collection....","review":"if you know and love Oscar Peterson. I've been enjoying his music since I started listening to jazz at the age of 16. I was lucky to work at a record store and one of my fellow employees suggested I check him out. It's almost 30 years later and I'm still amazed at his style and speed. Great musicians along with him for the ride. Buy and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suzanne - The voice of an Angel","review":"I have been a huge fan of the Cox Family and Alison Krauss for many years and I can't get enough of them. Both Alison Krauss and Suzanne Cox have such beautiful voices that they soften even the hardest of hearts. When you hear them sing, simply close your eyes and let these Angels sing your troubles away.This album could have used a bit more bluegrass. The commercial stuff is ok, but the Cox family really shine when they sing bluegrass. If you haven't heard the Cox Family sing, you are missing out on one of life's little treasures."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book I ever read","review":"I am working on a metadata driven project. So I ordered this book.I opened the book, It it looks like a 2 year VB programmer view on software development. Lots of Ideology and preaching, but nothing concreate. like \\"Interfaces should never be changed\\" which is fine, nobody changes an interface for the fun of it, but what you do when you have to.or \\"make your classes small, with small interface, and make as few classes as possible\\". again, it is like saying it is better to be healty,handsome and rice than ill, ugly and poor.My main reason for the purchase were the rave reviews that apear on this page.Re-reading them - they do not seem authentic to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book rocks!!!!!","review":"This is a fantastic book!

Frankly, I could have found an equally poor quality copy on one of the Web book search engines and printed a copy on my printer.I do expect better quality from Amazon.But, the original book is as insightful and interesting as it was when written more then hundred years ago. So, if you are like me and any quality copy bound is better then nothing, it is for you. If you need quality print copy, keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Gal, Wonderful Album","review":"I love Sezen Aksu's traditional approach to the songs on this album, especially selection # 4, Keshin Bicak. This song alone makes the album worth owning, but don't worry, you won't have to fast forward through everything else. The other songs are a delightful mixed bag.This album was my first exposure to Turkish music and to Sezen Aksu. She deserves her title as the Diva of Turkey. My other big favorite is selection #7, O-kudum-da, as fun and rollicking as Keshin Bicak is sexy and sorrowful. \\"Deliveren\\" is a happy addition to my list of five-star reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the fifty great voices","review":"Sezen Aksu was selected by NPR as one of the fifty great voices for their programs. It is a voice very reminiscent of a young Piaf and being totally unaware of the content/lyrics of each song is inconsequential. The rhythms vary fro haunting to jangling - very Turkish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Response to Chris Doyle","review":"\\"Meanwhile, artists and bands like Allies, John Elefante, Mark Farner, Idle Cure, Jag, Legend Seven, Liaison, Mastedon, PFR, Ruscha, Skillet, Switchfoot, and Matthew Ward get little, if any, credit in this book.\\"Gee, maybe that's because they produced mostly unoriginal, derivative drivel.\\"Sure, the 80's group Daniel Amos was okay, but they are mentioned throughout the book as if they were to Christian rock what the Beatles were to secular rock and roll.\\"Well, that's exactly what they are, artistically speaking. Or maybe they're the REM of Christian rock, or the Nirvana of Christian rock -- the only difference being that DA never had success with charts or record sales. In commercial terms, I guess Petra were the Beatles of Christian rock, but in terms of artistic achievement, they were midgets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ego driven...","review":"I agree with the other reviewer, John J. Thompsons band the wayside is mentioned way too much. I have heard them and they are not that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"As advertised. Note that it is just the unit, no power cord or software.","review":"This is my second firepod, I daisy chained them together and all is working smoothly. As for software, I used Cubase for a couple years then got a macbook and starting using Garageband. For a home recording unit these things are great. They produce near studio quality sound for cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Explorative Versions of Classic Tunes","review":"I was pleasantly surprised at just how good this CD is. It's fine jazz by any measuring standard - not even taking into account the miracle that Dizzy was 74 years old when this was recorded, and still playing well.The recordings come from a 3-night \\"golden jubilee\\" celebration held for Dizzy in NYC, where he was supported by various musicians. They play great, long, top-notch versions of \\"Ornithology\\", \\"Conformation\\", and \\"Night in Tunisia\\". This works! Great record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Well- what can I say? It was a fantastic read and very entertaining. The author clearly knows what he is talking about and gives detailed information on how to cultivate the plants, grow them and even talks about the different mechanisms by which they work. I would nonetheless also recommend reading Slack's book on carnivorous plants along with this one.I suppose you may be wondering if there are any negatives with this product; the only one disappointing this was that it was clearly focused for the American grower. I live in the UK, so the way in which I grow my plants are very different due to the different climate etc. However, I would certainly recommend the book to any grower as it has good tips and ideas that are useful to all.Definitely thumbs up to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have if you want an interesting and practical Guide","review":"A must have for people that want a well written and practical guide to the different Genus of carnivorous plants and how to grow them. Well written and not overly technical, The Savage Garden was interesting as well as practical reading for the hobbyist grower. When I received this book, I read it cover to cover, staying up until 3AM.The Savage Garden was exceedingly well organized and the information was, by my experience, accurate. I particularly like the way he organized the book, with growing information for the Genus and species grouped logically at the end of each section, instead of spread throughout the book. It makes it much easier to use as a reference for growers.If you own but on book on these plants, this should be the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best carnivorous plant reference","review":"If you want to grow carnivorous plants you need this book. This book contains everything that you need to know about caring for carnivorous plants. It is well organized and I refer to it often.

The plants that I have ordered are doing great. I plan to expand my collection soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"the savage garden","review":"Zeer goed boek,Het boek is zeer overzichtelijk geschreven, al de bekende en minder bekende soorten zijn in het boek beschreven.Maar het leukste aan het boek vind ik dat er bij elke plantengroep ook een beschrijving is over hoe je de soort het beste kan verzorgen en vermenigvuldigen.Ook belangrijk vind ik dat het voor mensen wiens moedertaal niet engels is zeer eenvoudig te lezen en verstaan isik heb het boek met veel plezier gelezen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome read!","review":"I have read many reviews about this book, and now that I have gotten this book, I have to agree that it is packed full of information!

He is very knowledgeable and presents information directly and clearly. Superb book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I have owned this book for a few years.

It just swings like crazy.Chieli Minucci brings his guitars to sing so sweetly. George Jinda, Fernando Saunders, Lionel Cordew and Omar Hakim create a beat that takes over your whole system. Michael Bearden, Steve Skinner and Randy Roos form a lovely atmosphere with their pianos and synths.

However, not too long ago while waiting for my plane in an airport with this case, I went searching through it for something, only to discover that one of the brand new netted pockets had broken entirely loose on one side (unravelled without any apparent cause or strain) which caused one of my family heirloom cufflinks to \\"disappear\\". The missing cufflink later reappeared in the lower area into which it had dropped. Thankfully, it wasn't lost, although it certainly had every opportunity. Please disregard the five stars.

Still haven't figured out how to connect all the wires from the console while getting the little plastic covering underneath it and don't expect any help from their instruction manual either (VERY POOR DESCRIPTIONS). Like another reviewer mentioned, it is designed poorly ergonomically and not all that comfortable. A lifetime warranty on parts isn't too important when you consider how cheap the parts on this item must be to replace. Unfortunately there isn't a lifetime warranty on the labor to replace said parts. One of the descriptions on this site said this bike can perform as well as a bike at your local gym. If that's the case then you should switch gyms. It's beyond basic and the performance can't be considered anything more than average.

This book will give you confidence in your ability to speak with God about your kids, and a new desire to be faithful in prayer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of info but still easy to digest","review":"Really enjoyed this book.

Still to put it all into practice of course but great reference book to have on hand, not just for preconceptive care but also for everyday optimal health."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Company","review":"This is a great cd, the best that Bad Company ever put out. Theres echoes of the past as the band forges ahead with the classic Bad Co. blues-rock sound, but the key words there are forges ahead. Which is exactly what the band does. Bad Co. never sounded so on target as they did on Company Of Strangers. If you love old Bad Co. but was less than thrilled with the late '80's and '90's stuff, you will love how raw and ready they were here. If you loved the late '80's and '90's stuff before singer Robert Hart joined the band for this and one more great studio album, and didn't love the '70's stuff, you won't like this one as much. The group rejects the gloss and goes to the heart of the matter on this cd, and the result is the finest music they ever made. If you don't know Bad Co. but are interested in the band then this is a great introduction as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hitting bottom...","review":"The addition of a Rodgers-clone marked a new era of decline for Bad Co.after the short and succesful stint with Brian Howe.Hart is a competent singer,however,the new songs lack power and inspiration,aspiring too much at the glories of the past 1970's era.Bad Company imitating themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Company Returns To Its Roots With A New Singer","review":"On COMPANY OF STRANGERS, Bad Company replaces lead singer Brian Howe with the Paul Rodgers-influenced Robert Hart, returns to its roots in the Memphis-Chicago-Texas-St. Louis-Louisiana-Detroit-Philadelphia-Kansas City blues/R&B/soul/rock & roll axis, and releases its best album since 1979's DESOLATION ANGELS. Gone are all the pop affectations of the last five albums, replaced with a raw, dry sound reminiscent of the first three albums and any number of Southern boogie bands. There are numerous great rockers here, but the most riveting moment is the ballad \\"Little Martha\\", a sad tale of child mortality that reminds me of seeing children's tombstones while hiking around historical sites to get in shape for my favorite female celebrities. I'd love to ask a cute girl for a dance to this one and the first five with Rodgers, even if this girl doesn't quite fit that \\"little mold\\" that others think she should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bad Company CD without Paul Rodgers","review":"Easily this is the best Bad Company CD without Paul Rodgers and better than some of the CDs with Paul Rodgers. It's a shame the follow-up to this album \\"Stories Untold\\" (or wahtever it's called) was so bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one in years","review":"Bad Company with singer Paul Rodgers made a lot of great music, but after Rodgers left the band they got stuck in making average or even below average albums. Maybe it was due to the music climate at the time...Maybe it had something to to with singer Brian Howe... But on this one Bad Company seem to have found their roots again. Thankfully we don't have to listen to Howe's more or less annoying voice, since the band have recruited a much better singer in the name of Robert Hart.\\"Company of strangers\\" is at least worth 4 stars, very close to 5. It will not have any real impact in the shape of radio play but for us who love the more traditional blues based hard rock it's a treat. You get good groove with great melody from a talented band with a very good singer. The material is very strong!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"This watch was a bust.

I tried digging small holes, just big enough for small annuals and I found it far inferior to a traditional trowel, in fact, not at all up to the job.

However, the narrative style - a series of little vignettes - had the quality of memory; people really do remember their lives through a succession of episodes. The novel has a strong physical quality: it evoked New York in the 50s and 60s so well... and some of the characters, such as Ives' wife, are so delicately and complete drawn, that they seem to breathe.

I really wanted a great animal book for my 2 year old son. He loves another animal book called Animal ABC and it is filled with page sized animals with no writing except the alphabet. This book looked and sounded like it was similar because it is full of 365 animals and it's called the BIG book of animals. It's not so big. Every page is filled with many animals and a lot of them are drawings (not cool), so it ends up being quite a thin book. I am not impressed and won't recommend this book to anyone. If you want pictures, look for something with full page photography and not drawings. If you want information, this has it but at a very small scale. You won't be able to learn more than an introduction to these animals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book for my 3 year old","review":"Awesome huge size, tons of glossy pics, I love all the books in this series and this one was no exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"i hate interviews","review":"short 5 minute interview with weird chanting in background and thunder.i prefer music!\\"rpm\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"this has become my everyday watch","review":"I am a bit of a watch geek, and have historically owned 2 or 3 favorites that I rotate depending on my mood. I have owned this watch for almost two years, and I now wear it nearly every day. I am as pleased with it now as I was when I received it. It looks great dressed down with jeans and a sweater, and it looks equally good dressed up a bit. The FC5000 band that came with mine (black rubber) is easy to clean, and doesn't get brittle or pick up stains/smells that a leather band picks up if you wear it every day.When I travel, I love having the ability to display two time zones as well. The only time I don't reach for this watch in the morning is if I am going somewhere formal. Other than that, I'm nearly always wearing this watch, and I love it. I will definitely look at Tag again when (if) I shop for another watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch, even after 6 years of everyday use","review":"Bought this watch brand new in November 2003. The battery died around August 2009, and got it replaced for $40 at an authorized Tag Heuer dealer.Incredibly accurate watch, probably loses around a second every 2 months.Stylish, you can turn off all digital displays, so it only displays a black face. I love this!You also have the chronograph, count-down timer, and alarm functions, and a second timezone. It also displays the date/year, and it has a perpetual calendar built in too!Pushing the crown in, turns on the backlight for viewing in the dark.Only thing I don't like, is the ratchet bezel is really hard to turn. I have an Omega Seamaster Pro, and the bezel is much pleasant to turn.Other than that, extremely tough, reliable, and accurate watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swing meets Country in this Underrated CD","review":"Country music and swing jazz are not usually paired together, but they are in this album with fabulous results. Starting with the title track, Restless, and ending with the album's final cut, Swingtown, this album combines fine jazz fiddle work with steel guitars, along with an irresistable beat and Shelby's great vocals for a fun underrated CD. Shelby shares songwriting credit on 5 of the 10 songs showing her breadth of talent. Jamie O'Hara writes or co-writes 6 of the 10 tunes. Not all the songs are jazz, as some are country soaked blues with wailing harmonicas and sad, cry-in-your-beer lyrics. Another highlight on this album is Wish I Knew, a blues infused song with Shelby's soaring vocals that will leave you with goosebumps. All of this on an album that is now found in the bargain bins. Pick it up and experience some great tunes from an underrated performer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Restless by Shelby Lynne","review":"I absolutely love every song on this CD. The 1st song \\"Slow Me Down\\" starts off up tempo and just gets better from there. I guess The song \\"Restless\\" is my all time favorite on this CD. I think that it's so tragic that Shelby Lynne and her sister Allison Moorer haven't won every award out there. This CD has some really great musicans on it and whom ever is singing back-up with Shelby is great.This CD has something for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"After purchasing Shelby's \\"I Am...\\" I was disappointed to listen to this CD.

She's not a clone, of course, just similar sound. Mandy has a very good voice with its own distinct quality and accent. Her voice is very rich and full. A very good album. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 mainly because I'm not a big fan of the traditional-sounding country genre. Fans of that genre should definitely get this.Maybe and Baby Don't You Know are fun, energetic tunes. Wayfaring Stranger is an affecting religious tune about singer being a traveler on Earth and contemplating home [Heaven]."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a mesmerizing voice","review":"A couple of years ago, I caught the tail end of the video of \\"Now thats all right with me\\" on CMT. Ten seconds of her voice, and I was scrambling for a piece of paper to write down her name so I could track down this CD. Every time I play this CD, I find a stop whatever I'm doing and just close my eyes and listen when she sings that song. Unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Voice - Fair Arrangements","review":"If you bought \\"Right to Cry\\", and want more of the same, this might not be your solution.

You can put it anywhere to save space . Most newer apartments don't have alot of wall space for furniture. It also is ideal for the family with small children to keep it up away from them so they can't tip it over on themselves.

The Panasonic has been very disappointing. The features are great, but it has totally unacceptable color, with a heavy green cast to everything that cannot be corrected with the color controls. The line doubler also produces very distracting artifacts on normal broadcast reception. After a weekend with the Avia calibration disk and a service call, I am returning this set and getting a Sony I can rely on."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOOK MINE BACK","review":"I appreciated all the time people took to write reviews, as they were quite helpful to me so I thought I would reciprocate and share my experience. The picture was great as everyone said, but nobody mentioned one thing that was important to me. THE SOUND ON THE T.V. IS TERRIBLE. They put [price] speakers in a [price] television. Yes, I have a surround system and that works great, but I don't want to have to fire up the stereo at 7 in the morning just to watch the morning news. If you keep this in the basement and really don't care about the sound from the TV speakers then this is a good one for you. If you keep it in the family room and don't always run it through the surround sound then this TV will make you crazy.

But I got a kick out of watching JDG with the Flatlanders on Austin City Limits so not knowing which album to buy, I went with this because I loved T-Bone Burnett's production on the Roy Orbison Black and White concert and \\"Oh Brother\\" soundtrack, and, frankly, because it was so cheap. Boy did I get lucky! I haven't gotten goose flesh from a popular music CD in many years. The quirky instrumentation, the original lyrics, and that VOICE all come together to create a genuinely moving work of art. I suspect the negative reviews come from an expectation of a more standard country music experience. This transcends not only the country genre, it transcends the usual music listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"like a sunday drive into the sunset of west texas","review":"a beautiful, ambitious album...it's too bad that some fans want their heros to crank out the same old same old...Jimmie takes us where he wants to go...it's just a matter of opening yourself up to something different and going along for the ride...5 Stars!

When he sings \\"round and round and round and round\\" or \\"we'll fly, and fly, and fly, and fly\\" I can't keep a straight face.

I've lost 50 pounds in a year and have about another 30 left to go. This scale is very accurate, and it matches my weight at Weight Watchers every week.However, make sure you stand in the same spot everytime you weight yourself. You will get slightly different readings if you stand on the front, middle and back of the scale. Also, if you have multiple people using it, make sure to set it for the personalized sessions.

I had good luck on old hardwood floors, less luck on our old bumpy tile floors in the bathroom.It was very consistent on a level surface... I tested it several times in a row with the same reading, and various times throughout the day... nothing read unusually.I really like the form factor of this scale. It's so small...

The scales went up 7 lbs one day, hours later down 4,up 2lbs the next time. I can step on it 10 times in a row and never have the same number twice. It will move between 1 to 5 pounds. When you are watching your weight you want to know for sure, if your weight is up or down, not spend 15 minutes every morning trying to get an average number.

Surprisingly, it gives the same initial reading as the el cheapo Weight Watchers scale. Neither scale can discriminate incremental weight change when I step back on the scale with a 1, 2, or 3 pound workout weight but the Tanita is considerably less inaccurate for this test. All said, I feel better relying on the Tanita.This thing is driving me nuts. Once it anchors a reading it won't budge from that number regardless of drinking 16 oz. of water (1 lb) or the reverse. I tried measuring its accuracy with a 10 lb plate in my arms. It was off by .2 lbs. That translates into an error of 2 lb per hundred pound of body weight. That's pretty much useless for self-motivation. With a 25 lb plat in my arms, it was off by .6 lbs or 2.4 lbs per 100 lbs. of body weight.

Within a few months the readings start to fluctuate significantly. Not only does this scale give as much as a 25-lb. difference within 1 or 2 minutes (stepping on, stepping off and zeroing it out, stepping back on...several times), it also has a problem honing in on one weight. I have zeroed it, stepped on it, looked down (not moving about)...and the numbers fluctuate wildly (as much as 25 lbs.) before settling on one reading...and, as stated, upon immediately repeating the process the next reading settled on may be as much as 20 to 30 pounds off of the first one.

I picked up my cat who is rather big and lost a pound. Now the scale seems to pick one weight and stick with it for long periods of time. If you try to reset it the scale picks random weights. This would be a great scale for a person on a calorie diet...you would never know if you were losing pounds or not. This is a bad scale for just having, because I have wasted so much of my time doing fun little experiments to see what it will do next. I even wrote this review. I should have returned this when I got it, but I never used it enough to realize the problem until the physical for a job showed my scale was off by ten pounds or so (turns out the best diet is using a scale that works)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edison's apologia","review":"This book is very well written, illustrated and produced; also it is a very good introduction on Edison's contribution to motion pictures but, while it doesn't seem to falsify the actual truth, the author, Charles Musser one of the major historians of early cinema development, bends backwards to exonerate Edison's less than savory practices; to present Edison as the \\"inventor of motion pictures\\"; to claim the development of cinema for the US; and to make totally unsupported claims that this was a beneficial turn of events for all cinema / motion pictures!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly entertaining!","review":"Westlife is a very talented group of guys with a bunch of first-rate songs under their belt.

The album as a whole is not as good as her other 2, but the album is a must.

Nice soft cotton - and it did not shrink when I washed it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot mixes","review":"Perfect music to add to my running workouts. A few songs I didn't care for much, but overall, the cd is full of energy pumping jams with a good blend of hip hop and rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed, compared to Z-trips other work.","review":"I have almost every cut that Z-trip has been on, I have literally thousands of vinyl records, and I used to have an active interest in turntableism and DJing. Z-trip has always impressed me with his creativity (especially using some very unusual tracks in his mixes), however this album doesn't do it for me. It sounds more like a hip-hop/rap album with a lot of famous names and bad music. You be the judge, but this is nothing like his previous album."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's a better recording on SACD / Hybrid - nearly the same CD","review":"This CD sums a variety of pieces and the talent of the Loussier trio.Although, you can have nearly the same CD on a far better sound (SACD / Hybrid)on Amazon.com:http://www.amazon.com/Best-Play-Bach-Stereo-Multichannel/dp/B0001BDAQO/ref=sr_1_7?s=music&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1293499464&sr;=1-7The CD tracks 1 to 8 are exactly the same on the SACD except for the Concerto in D.I suggest you opt for the SACD for the better sound and because, at this time, it's US$10,00 cheaper than this common CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whatever Happened to Rock and Roll Radio?","review":"Joe D'Urso wants to know what happened to rock and roll radio. Sounding like The Boss with his story songs and emotive voice, D'Urso has some fun with the state of radio (particularly on \\"Rock and Roll Call\\") and with intros by a number of DJ's who haven't forgotten what rock is about. (Go Vince Scelsa!)The songs are definitely reminiscent of a time when rock had emotional weight. Not perfect (\\"The Ballad of Townes Van Zant and Hawkeye Pierce\\" is a bit of a stretch) but with memorable songs like \\"Numb\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Station\\" this is nice collection of rock that means something to the band and to the listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, But for Collectors Only","review":"Why? Because this excellent short graphic novel has been reprinted in the trade paperback \\"Lucifer: Evensong,\\" volume 11 in Mike Carey's complete Lucifer library. Evensong also reprints issues 70-75 of the Lucifer comic, so for about the same price you get Nirvana plus another 154 pages of Lucifer, a bargain any way you cut it. The entire 11 volume series is well worth owning; it's a graphic masterpiece which belongs on the same shelf as Sandman, Preacher, or Watchmen. Yep, it's that good.

You can multi-task when wearinr them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good. Worth the money","review":"I replaced my headset Earbuds with these. I hate Earbuds cause they always fall out my ear. That's so annoying, so I was looking for something more secure on my Ear. This is fairly secure. It feels like it'll fall off when I'm running/jogging, but it doesn't (I don't know how I feel about that). The stick or whatever you call it that the Mic is on is extremely firm. I'm not even sure if it was meant to be bent. It matches my phone (Black), so that's good. It's a MAJOR improvement over my Earbud Headset. I hate Earbuds so much!I saw another Headset that looks a lot better & sleeker than this, but the reviews for it wasn't good at all, so I decided on getting this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need big ears to operate","review":"Initially when I looked at this product there was some concern in reviews that the earpiece does not fit snugly. Boy was that an understatement. I'm a big man and it didn't even come close on my head. The sound quality is great, as described. But it does not fit snugly on your head. You almost have to hold it, which to me defeats the purpose of having an earpiece in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money!!","review":"DOnt buy and I had tough time in adjusting the ear piece as it falls out every time you hang it over the ear.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the price","review":"Better sound quality on both ends than the phone alone. Comfortable to wear. However, doesn't fit my phone without an adapter, which used to be included with this headset but now requires separate purchase. Good thing I saved my old adapter. As other reviewers note, the headset works for a year or two or three, then quits--but, hey, for that price, it's still value for money."},{"rating":"2","title":"my all time favourite book!","review":"It is the second time I have had the pleasure of reading this novel and weeks later I am still thinking and talking about it. Alfred the Great...what a man! I was so enthralled by the life and times of this English King, his insight, morality and courage, an inspiration thanks to Joan Wolf. Alfred was not expecting to become king of Wessex, one of the four kingdoms in England, with five older brothers. Different to his brothers, Alfred was well educated, sensative and very pragmatic. When the threat of a Danish invasion caught England on the back foot, Alfred united his kingdom and led the only kingdom to withstand the Danes. Entwined with passion, love and heartwrenching suspense, the reader is captured by the characters and their lifestyles. This novel enables the reader to experience the thoughts and issues of the time and gives insight to the only king of England to be called \\"Great\\". Do yourself a favour and read to your heart's content, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The edge of light.","review":"I had a very difficult time keeping the characters straight and so I stopped reading it.

Very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smoked: A true story about the kids next door.","review":"I think this book is a travesty. Not only have I read it, but I lived it. All the people in this book, I knew. And more precisely, Kathy Macaulay and Heather Goodwin were my friends for many years. Ms. Bing makes Dave out to be some sort of victim, when he is nothing but a cold blooded killer. The book was writen just from his point, becuase obviously, the girls no longer have the opportunity to speak for themselves. If Ms. Bing has a \\"investigating detective's assertion\\", then I thank God she doesn't work for a police department. She needs to get all the facts before she writes a book again, it only hurts people when she doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never really know","review":"Although you can spend your life along side someone, as I did growing up with all involved, you may never really know what they think, how they hurt or what minute circumstance will forever change their lives. This book barely covers the reality of being a teen in So. Pas. Bing could have delved deeper into the case and she would have uncovered things more important than how much money Kathy's parents had or how poor David was. I saw Danae the night before she died. She worked in the same mall as I and I happend to look up from my station and saw her walk by. I didn't call out to say Goodbye or anything. I, as all I am sure, thought there would be a tomorrow. Although I am glad this book was written, I am still sad that it was written about my friends and people I knew. It's been 15 years now, and I still remember it as yesterday."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little note of truth, threw the lies","review":"Not only is this book based on lies and deception, but it is completly miss leading. Leon Bing's information was distorted and minipulated to suite her own needs. She took actual quotes and instences and completley changed them from the truth. I know this becuase I was one of her mian interviewies. What happened was a horrific tragedy and still is. I have thought about it everyday. It has and still hurts my life in more ways than I can count. I was friends with everyone involved. But the fact that Leon Bing has gotten away with passing off this B.S. of a book as truth, is a tragedy of its own. If you call giving 16 year old kids beers, pizza, and money for pot good investigative reporting, than the media and writers of our society and our society as a whole is further in the trash than any of us could know. Please don't waste your money on these lies! If you want some truth about what happened feel free to e-mail me at madchef02@yahoo.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smoked","review":"This book is filled with lies, presented as facts. If Ms. Bing were to have sold the book as fiction at least it would not be a deliberate concealment of the truth. The only parts of this book that are true seem to be information taken from the court transcipts. It's pure trash. Save your money, although you dont have much to loose with it being priced (at the still too expensive)price of 48 cents. Ms. Bing was out to make a buck at the families expence. I hope she is happy (not really) in her upper middle class home in Pasadena, paid for by the blood of children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Pause and go cop this single","review":"Great great song, a classic...This single is unlike the others he released on The Streetz iz a Mutha...its in the same style as it ain't no fun..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Little TV","review":"I needed a tv for my dorm room. Something that sounded good and had stereo audio video inputs. This tv has it all. Its not very heavy, and it doesn't take up that much room. The model above this one is 30 dollars more, however, its the same tv, but with a better remote. This is the best deal. It can be had cheaper in stores. Awesome television, great picture, sound, and audio. The FM tuner is also very good, it works with an internal attenna which is very cool. I recommend this tv to anyone who is looking for a nice tv, at a decent price, and doesn't have room for a large television. With Panasonic's quality I'm not worried about it breaking anytime soon either. 5 Stars ++!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This TV!","review":"Multiple problems have been discovered with this tv, and if you purchase one, chances are you will discover them soon.

Do yourself a favor and do not buy this tv."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor power supply","review":"We've had two problems with our set, both ever since it came out of the box on Oct 25,2001.First, the power supply has a nasty hum which makes listening difficult at low volume levels. Since this set was bought for the bedroom, and is often used after the kids have gone to sleep, we often have the volume set low (around \\"six\\"). At this level there is a very noticeable 60Hz hum, making it hard to hear the words. You'll never notice this if there is background noise, like at a store or a service shop, but you sure will in a quiet house!!Also, ours likes to turn itself back on about 2 seconds after you shut it off, sometimes takes 5+ tries to shut it off.Our set has been in for service three times for these problems(a total of 55 days in service so far). Panasonic Customer Service is unwilling to help in any way.Summary - for a low price set, I'd buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this tv","review":"I justg bought this and that night I noticed that some stations have a surging image to them.

It seems to get worse over time. It was a mere occasional annoyance at first, but now is a real problem. Plus Panasonic requires us to travel about 20 miles to a repair facility (in a major metro area - Wash DC!). Hardly seems worth it! We will try a different remote as suggested by another reviewer, but if that doesn't work I think we'll have to buy a new set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with my purchase","review":"I'm not sure what is going on with some of these other reviews.

I had an old copy of this, but it was destroyed. I had often used it for baby shower gifts, so I ordered this one as a replacement. It was listed as new, but arrived extremely warped from water damage, with the pages stuck together and ink damage.

For the price, I expected much better condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"What could be","review":"This is a great album from the Kentucky Headhunters. Their versions of these classic songs breathes new life to every cut. If there was any justice in the music industry this album would be played on every country and rock-n-roll radio station in the nation. The version of \\"Made in Japan\\" is the best remake I've heard in years and if widely listened to would be a bigger hit than even the Buck Owens version....and that's saying something. Buy this and play it LOUD.

All episodes of the A&C Show are already available on high-quality DVDs. On a personal note, I find Season One much more satisfying, as it was written mostly by Sid Fields and included Hillary Brooke, Joe Besser and Joe Kirk (Bacciagalupe), none of whom, except for Fields, returned for Season Two.

Its a lot better than Down II. This is, next to Black Sabbath 'Master of reality', one of the best Doom Metal albums of all time. The inlay of the booklet gives you the best feel of the album. 5 dudes hanging around in the sun, making some kick ass tunes. New Orleans swamp metal. Chemically-depressed Stoner Rock. Doom. This band started off making some underground tapes. But beccause they were so good, they went on to make a great album. This is some very heavy guitar riffs with some mellow acoustic songs.

Phil Anselmo from Pantera, Pepper Keenan from C.O.C., Jimmy Bower from Eyehategod, and Kirk Windstein and Todd Strange from Crowbar united in 1995 for an album that was such a departure from their respective bands, but was loved by most, if not all, of their fans. \\"Lifer\\", \\"Underneath Everything\\", \\"Stone the Crow\\", \\"Eyes of the South\\", \\"Rehab\\", and \\"Temptation's Wings\\" remain personal favorites of mine, and after listening to this countless times for the past seven years, \\"NOLA\\" is one of the few albums that is truly timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"Everyone told me what a classic album that this was...I downloaded the MP3s not too long ago and realized that I really needed to buy this. So I went out and finally got it and it certinatly is a classic. This album really sounds like Pantera, Black Sabbath, and Lynard Skynard put in a blender. It doesn't get much better than this. The most notable tracks are \\"Temptation's Wings\\", \\"Eyes of the South\\", \\"Losing All\\", and \\"Stone the Crows\\". One thing about Nola is there is absolutly no filler...every track is undoubtably album worthy. You can tell they had fun making this album and jamming out to the tracks. What stopped me from giving this CD a 5 star rating is basically just that the lyrics aren't up to par with the musicianship on here, I personally can't relate to the southern themes. I'm not one for all that southern pride/confederacy shxt. None the less...it matches the feel of the album. If you are a fan of Pantera or any classic metal, this is a must.

In this case, they couldn't hear me.I finally broke down and splurged on a whole Plantronics Calisto wireless system with bluetooth headset. It cost me $250, but I'm finally happy! I can easily hear most calls on just the lowest volume setting, everyone says I sound clear. If someone is especially quiet, I can turn it up and hear no problem now. The whole thing is completely wireless to boot. If this is for business, just get the good stuff. You'll be happier in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jensen JTH940 - BAD WIRE","review":"This was an Open Box purchase. Probably was returned because it was defective. Sound was very scratchy when plugged in. The molding on plug prevented it from fully inserting into the cell phone jack (LG 220C flip phone).I trimmed the molding (which made the headset non-returnable) and discovered the the problem is a bad connection within the molded plug. I have read other reviews who had the same problem after a few months.When the sound worked, the ear phone was great. The ear cushion was comfortable.Never got a chance to test the microphone.I liked the sound well enough that I plan to replace the plug to get it to work.Plan on replacing this headset every few months due to defective wiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"headset","review":"The product is fine, the guy I bought it from is a thief.

I have been using it for about a month now. People tell me sometimes they can't hear me. I just have to postition the mic right. It took me about 3 tries to get used to putting it on but once it is on it stays on. I really like the retractable feature on it. Like I like to lie in bed talking on the phone and i can adjust the line so it doesn't get too messy when i toss and turn. Only Con is that you have to postition the mic right or else the person you are talking to can't hear you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This things sucks","review":"Let me tell you, the concept was better then I could have imagined. It fit into my pocket with my cell without wires getting all tangled up.HOWEVER, I was in my car and snagged it on my seatbelt, oh so slightly, and the retractable device broke into a million pieces. I didn't even own it for 2 hours before I had to throw it away.And the delivery was the worst. I ordered it in September and received it in December. They didn't even contact me to let me know it was being delayed. I almost forgot if I had ordered it or not. My opinion, spend the extra few dollars and get a Bluetooth, at least you don't have to worry it is going to break into a million pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Like","review":"Don't like this item.

The product arrived one day than expected which was great. However, once I applied the product to my lower reciever I noticed the color change as it dried to an ashy black almost dark gray.

The paint does rub off so keep that in mind if you decide to purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used it to touch up camera equipment. It does the job.","review":"I purchased this to touch up the paint on Nikon metal camera bodies and lenses. It did a good job of covering up the areas where paint had been scraped off and making it less noticeable. Durability is not that great as the paint applied to areas frequently touched rubbed off after a week of use. The flat black is not a great match to the splotchy, powder coat-like coating of higher end Nikon camera products. Gloss might be a better choice or some combination of flat and gloss. I would be this again as i have not seen anything better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product.","review":"Does a good job of repairing the scratches on the black iPhone5 metal casing/antenna band.

Not because I think they are wrong, but because the product worked very well for my intended use. I used this almost as soon as it arrived. At the range, my AR gets scuffed occasionally and this was bought to do touch ups on the more glaring spots. I used it cold before i went and it worked ok. As luck would have it, my daughter managed to drop my old A1 on some gravel while the barrel was still hot. I put this product on the hot barrel dings and as soon as the barrel cooled, i couldn't tell where I applied it. I will keep a pen of this product in my range bag from now on. I may also try the blue and gloss black versions for other firearms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Country Rock","review":"This is my first Big & Rich album.

What a great mix.. from songs that will make you cry to songs that will make you laugh out loud. I strongly urge you to give it a try. If you have only heard what is being played on the radio you are missing so much. I have gone twice to see Big and Rich in concert in the last month.

My 12 year old brother can freestyle better than he can rap. That's besides the point. If they didn't have that lame rapper in some of the songs, this could be an ok album. And what the heck is wrong with Tim McGraw? Last time I checked, he has made better \\"country\\" music than these clowns. At least he doesn't have spanish rapping black hicks on his records, which is absurd. This is not a breath of fresh air into the country music world, it's just more music from the trailer park like Kid Rock. Kick My A$$ is a good songs until it gets ruined at the end as well.

After giving their music a good listen, it's just another attempt by the Nashville Music Row to shove more of the same down our throats through radio.

This cd was one of the greatest cds ever made. I honestly believe that Big and Rich is one of the greatest bands on the planet. This cd is flawless. The freakparade is a great thing. It brings major Big and Rich fans together to share the love.

What an amazing collection of half-baked, cheesy, overwrought, insincere wailings this is! The whole \\"Kid Rockitizing\\" of country music is a profoundly disturbing trend. Few things are more pitiful than a couple of over the hill rednecks who morph into hip hop wannabes. The \\"skip\\" button on your CD player will get a real workout here. The one and only bright spot is \\"Holy Water,\\" which is a huge surprise...sensitive and authentic and beautifully performed. Apart from that one song, zero stars for this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful!!!","review":"Big & Rich seem to be doing pretty good in the country business but for those who enjoy real country would say these guys are not country and they are awful.

It should not have even been allowed to be on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD has it all","review":"My first introduction to Big & Rich came during the halftime show of the NBA All-Star Game broadcast. Their performance was like a lightening rod. They truly have all it takes to be the next great band of all time. People don't know this, but Kid Rock stole the whole \\"little person on stage\\" bit from them, and incorporating rap and beats with guitars and country is so confusing.Since buying their CD I've started experimenting with more hardcore Rap acts like M & M, and Ludicrous. And Nelly recorded that song with Toby Keith, and I like that too. And now Willie Nelson has done a reggae record. But this is where it all started. If we can all just get along, and combine a whole bunch of different stuff into each song, like banjoes and dj-scratching and trombones, the music will gradually become less confusing. And everyone can enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars wasn't a rating","review":"This is a worthless CD. I don't care how many people tell me this is country, I'm not buying their opinions. These guys are terrible. The lyrics sound like rap with a twangy as beat. Some people may call this country, but this isn't my country music."},{"rating":"1","title":"*sigh*","review":"When will people ever learn? Big & Rich are just another marketing ploy created by some Nashville big wig to earn a few bucks. The sad thing is, it's working. It's no wonder so many reviewers say that they were never big fans of country until they discovered Big & Rich... because Big & Rich AREN'T country. They're just living, breathing proof of contemporary Nashville's greed and disregard for country music's tradition."},{"rating":"1","title":"lighten up","review":"The only use I have for musical genres, styles, traditions, etc. is to have some idea of what to expect when I listen to the radio. Beyond that, the whole system is mere taxonomy. There's really only three kinds of music: music that moves my body, music that moves my mind, and the combination of the two.Big & Rich is decidedly the former. Are they genuine? Are they a 'corporate scheme'? Are they even country? I don't know and I don't care. If you're looking for high art ,groundbreaking music or deep, poignant lyrics, this ain't it. But if it makes you grin, makes you wanna dance, sometimes that's all that matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I thought I would like this CD - country music with a twist - since I like many forms of music. It is well produced. Some of the songs are real catchy. The problem is two-fold. 1) After a while, it starts to seem kinda gimmicky. Tongue in cheek only goes so far for so long. 2) Big & Rich do not have the best voices in country music. They hit the mark on songs like Big Time and Holy Water, but miss terribly on many others. Music is all about personal taste, and personnaly, it is only a decent cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, Love, Love It","review":"If you are looking for something different and fun, you must go buy this record. The perfect mix of rock and country.I also wanted to comment on the folks who mentioned that touring with Tim McGraw is a bad idea. Many years ago, KISS opened for Blue Oyster Cult on their first tour. The next year, BOC was opening for KISS. I think we may see somethng like this happen again. At the very least, at the start of the tour people will be coming to see Tim, but I believe very shortly word will spread and people will be coming to see Big & Rich."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Anybody Complaining.....","review":"To anyone who is gonna complain saying \\"Ohh, this isn't country, pweeze mister man, don't buy this it isn't country\\" all I have to say is DUH! Great Music, Great Mood, Great Writing. It is PARTY music, makes you feel good. And it is about time someone like Big and Rich came along. As they say in their song Rollin'\\"Why they trying to complicateThe simple music that we makeOh cause if it moves my soulI'm gonna keep on rollin, rollin\\"And that's what it is all about. Take the best of all music worlds and put them together, the combination is Big and Rich and the Freak Parade! Right on boys, keep it comin'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album of the Year...","review":"In my opinion, one of if not the best album of 2004 had to be Big and Rich's \\"Horse of a Different Color.\\" Whether you like country, rock, rap, hip-hop(in their words \\"Hick-hop\\"), or a mixture of them all, you will be able to find it and more on this CD. Big and Rich's ability to combine all these genres while creating true songs about everyday life will blow you away. If you are sick of music with boundries, you will find comfort in this CD. Big and Rich do not follow anybody's rules and make music that is true to them. With crazy songs like Save a Horse, Ride a Cowboy and ballads like Rollin' and Deadwood Mountain, you will not be disappointed! Love Everybody!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big and Rich are awesome","review":"This Cd is great. There is such a awesome array of different songs but all and all they are all so well done.

Ever heard of \\"Outlaw Country\\"?? You think Johnny Cash was always considered \\"country\\" by everyone? Most of the best country music has come from the artists that bucked the system and went against the current sound of Music Row. This is a stellar example of this trend.If you want cookie cutter mold country, then no, this album isn't for you. But if what you want is a true artistic and refreshing album, then buy this one and listen to it every day!

This isn't real country, just pop music with a 'country-like' twang to it. It's an insult to *good* country music.Everytime *REAL* artists make advancements in Country music in an effort to make it more appealing to the general public, something like this comes out and ruins it.

I thought Hollaback Girl was the worst song ever but then came These Boots are made for walking by Jessica Simpson, then Gretchen Wilsons all jakked up, and now this crappy duo with no talent puts out a song called Coming to your city. I cant review that cd, so i'll just say it hear-IT SUCKS! What is wrong with music today? Songs are getting worse and worse, and people are eating it up like some sloppy fried triple cheeseburger with bacon. Big and Rich have no talent but like any music act in country or pop, they have money. When I heard they rhyme we scared Manson, I was in shock and laughed. The only thing you can scare Manson on is how retarded you guys are, your gimmick is like week old underwear.

Wheither you think it country or just great music that everyone can enjoy. It cover every aspect of life. It has great party songs, like Save a Horse and Rollin ( the Ballad of Big and Rich). It has very meaningful songs like Holy Water and Saved. The lyrics to all the songs on the album are real life. The melodies are catchy and make you sing along with them. The album is by two of Nashville's finest songwriters and artists. It contains background vocals of the great Martina McBride and Grethen Wilson. If your looking for some great music that you and your teenagers can enjoy together, then Horse of a Different Color is the album. I would recommend this for soccer moms everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is awesome!","review":"One of the best CD's of the year - hands down - in any genre. It's great to hear a new breed of music being invented. These guys are it! These talented country singers have woken up and warmed up to other genres. Where else can you hear rock, rap, R & B and classic country seamlessly blended into one singable blend of fun and sometimes spiritual music? Hey, my kids listen to it and they don't even like country. I don't usually either .. until now. By the way, I saw them in concert last night and it was great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Response to \\"The Last Outlaw\\"","review":"Okay, so it's not Hank, Hank, or Hank, but you have to admit, it's creative. They're doing what they want to do, and if it happens to make them some money... I'll admit, it's a little corny, but it's fun music. Music is supposed to be an escape for people. If this helps the listener escape to a fun and happy place, then what's the harm. It's not the country from the 80s or before, but all music changes. The rock music of today isn't the same as the rock music of the 80s. Does that make it horrible? No. It's just different.This is a really good cd. Wouldn't call it great, but it's enjoyable to listen to. Buy it, and have fun with music. It's okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"MY GRANDSON WANTED IT FOR CHRISTMAS AND HE WAS SO HAPPY, HE LOVES BIG AND RICH.

One of the few in a long time that I can put in the player and listen to every song. The sound is refreshing and is really a windows down radio up kind of sound. I love this album. These guys are sure to show everyone what a great country duo can be. If you have a chance to go out and get this album get it. Trust me I'm not one to review things that much but this cd is just so good I want others to know that. They will be amazing in concert too I assume. I'll be glad if this sound is something that continues in country music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big & Rich Sound...","review":"I attended high school with John Rich, of Big & Rich, and I designed the cover art for his first demo that got him his first job as an entertainer for Opryland in Nashville. I'm not into the new country music on the radio. I like the old stuff, but I'm not a big country music fan overall. I mostly listen to Jazz, Classic Rock and Experimental Music. I ran into John and Big Kenny up here in Madison, Wisconsin at a benefit show and was impressed with their new music (they only had their guitars and voices). Anyway, I recently purchased their new c.d. and It's really good. They have about 4 or 5 potential hits on it, very unusual for country music these days. Their success couldn't happen to a nicer person than John. He was a really nice, polite and caring person in high school and I wish him all the luck in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best guide on Columbus!","review":"This is a fine introductory take on the \\"Mysterious History of Columbus: An Exploration of the Man, the Myth, the Legacy\\". You must read this book first in order to have a full true understanding on Columbus and America in history. You have to walk before you can run. This book explores everything on him what is known and what is not known. Sadly, Columbian and American mythology fills up much our understanding about Columbus in History that often distort our views or perceptions about him. This book clears it up for all of us by sticking to the facts. Good bibliographical notes for further reading. A great guide for anyone interested in Columbus."},{"rating":"2","title":"A smooth, soothing rocknroll cocktail.","review":"This cd has a consistent groove to it that just invades your head.

Featuring lazy, dreamlike guitar work and often bizzare lyrics (an example: \\"you can't give the finger to the blind\\" from their debut album). Nevertheless, \\"Penthouse\\" is a classic that proves that great guitar albums do not need to be fast and loud. The best tracks are the lengthy \\"23 Minutes in Brussels\\" and \\"Kalamazoo.\\" Don't try to figure out what the lyrics mean. They're irrelevant. Just enjoy the sonic dreamscape."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is just the best!","review":"I've seen a bunch of tapes, and this is by far the best.

Once i began to assemble it it noticed that there was rust on the peg that connects the body to the wheels, this also did not bother me. But once i powered it on it began to melt and the smell of burnt wires or plastic filled the air. At first i though it was just because it was that new smell. WRONG, the longer it stayed on the worse it got. I called the company and asked for refund and sent it back. The rep was cool about it she tried have another sent but i said no way and asked for my money back.

This DVD game scores for you!Thanks for a great game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Value","review":"The game itself is okay, but it's so short and there are only three games. That's $10 per game -- maybe a half hours worth. If there were 20 games, and each section was longer, then it might be worth it.

I pulled out the cabin filters currently in my car and confirmed the Bosch C3788 Cabin Filters would not work and are not for my 2008 ML 350 (W164).I have no complaints regarding the quality of the filters or the packaging and delivery, all of this was perfect.My one star rating is really just to draw attention to the fact that these filters are not for my SUV and the Amazon data base should be updated to reflect this.I sent the filters back with no problems and ordered the right filters, TYC 800129C2 Mercedes Benz Replacement Cabin Air Filter.

She's a thirteen-year old Eisenhower- era preteen with three brothers, a best friend, and a richly crafted family and community in upstate New York. She's the anti -Nancy: a little younger, less self- assured, and mocked by her intimates for her wild conspiracy theories and deeply suspicious nature. Yet somehow it always turns out all right, and this tale is no exception when Trixie and her pals head out to Iowa for her Uncle Andrew's sheep farm. Along with a few 4-H shenanigans, there's livestock rustling, natural disasters, and a school dance."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book to train and have a great dog.","review":"This book promotes a consistant training program for everyone in the fmaily.

I never hesitate to recommend it to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's as important to train YOU as it is your dog...","review":"This easy to follow (for dog and human) guide is best at getting the owner to understand exactly what a dog is capable of understanding and doing. No long philosophies, just a step by step guide. Absolutely the best training manual I've read because of its emphasis that a dog's abilities vs owner's desires are not always realistic. Stresses rewards, not punishment as motivator."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\" Chpt. 14; House Training - a Necessity\\" (Duhhh, really?)","review":"The commands taught in this book are far too complicated for the average dog owner looking to teach their dog basic obedience. WAY too much emphasis on ridiculous commands (teaching your dog to \\"jump\\"? I'll bet most dog owners want to inhibit that behavior, not encourage it!) I was most surprised that the foundation of all obedience training, the \\"heel\\", was glossed over by saying \\"if you really want to teach your dog to heel seek professional help\\"!

Sorry to be so picky, but it matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's MARINE, not marine....","review":"Not only was this story, which had great, great potential, very boring, I cringed every time I saw the word \\"marine.\\" No Marine is identified in this manner, and as the wife of a former Marine, I was a little offended. That said, Tori and Rocket made a handsome couple, but like most S.A. books, this story was a boring tale mixed with a few delightful highlights."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will put a smile on your face - - ENJOY !","review":"\`Hot and Bothered' is a very enjoyable romance/murder mystery. This is the story of Tori and John/Rocket who had hot week five year ago and created a child. Tori hires John ex-marine now PI to find her brother and solve her father's murder. The sparks fly and more than a murder is solved. I enjoyed Susan Andersen's \`Getting Lucky' novel as well and plan to buy \`Skintight' her latest novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Susan Andersen Fan","review":"I've read all of Susan's books and, in my opinion, this one is not up to par. This is the final book in Susan's trilogy (Head Over Heels & Getting Lucky)and I was extremely disappointed. The plot was boring as well as the dialogue between the two main characters. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for a romance when I read this but, nevertheless, I was looking forward to John \\"Rocket\\" Miglionni's story and I felt let down when I finished the book. \\"Head Over Heels\\" was the best out of the three. Hope Susan's next book is better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fizzled fast","review":"Tori and Rocket were interesting, as was Jared, but there were so many dull spots in this book I nearly put it aside. In fact, this is true of many Susan Andersen books. I wish she'd write at least one consistent page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not hold my interest","review":"I usually like Susan Andersen books but this one was very disappointing. I skipped over big parts of the story and really didn't mind that it ended. I liked the hero and I liked the heroine but together they just didn't have any sparks. The book spent way too much time on the younger brother and P.J. and I just completely skipped through those pages. I think it would have been better to have more scenes with the hero and his 5 year old daughter getting to know each other better. I just thought it was overall a pretty boring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite by this author","review":"2.5 stars.Bor-ing. While I might have loved this book years ago, I now find myself mostly annoyed (okay... very annoyed) with it. And bored with the constant derailments and senseless rambling. What speaks volumes though is the fact that I bought and read this book when it first came out and, for the life of me, I didn't remember anything about it, not even why I loved it enough to put on my keeper shelf to begin with. And I remember all the good books I've read prior to this one... So it's not a very memorable read either. Oh well, more space on my keeper shelf since this book is destined for the donation bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slooooow","review":"The film is tediously slow. Shots are held to the point where you're going \\"well\\"? There's a kind of dull numbness to the whole thing, relieved only occasionally by a light bit of humor. Sadly, the lead hasn't got the screen presence to carry the film.There cinematography is sometimes pretty, but the framing is sometimes weird. There's a shot through a doorway and the two leads walk out of view as seen through it, but the camera lingers on the empty door for-ever. Some scenes feel like they were done with only two setups, and there's no additional coverage, so we go from a one shot to a another one shot and back to the first. The dinner scene, for instance, where we never see the food...even when one of them supposedly takes a bite.I wanted to like it, but it felt like a short film that was stretched out to five times its ideal length."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"Apparently lots of people watched a different DVD than we did. We like to rent gay films to be supportive of gays in the industry, but this was a mistake. First, there is no script. Second, almost all of the movie is done in close-up when panning back/out would have helped to visually set the context in many of the scenes. Third, what little script there was is not always delivered with the best acting. Fourth, one can only watch an actor sitting or lying around \\"pensive\\" for so long...at some point you expect an actual story."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"This story is like many other ones, of a lost of a loved one, but end s up like a interview of two people who happend to live quite far from each other, is a very slow one, and I couldnt find the greatness on this film, not beacuse it is gay it means its ok sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"You keep Waiting something to happen and NADA.

Already in the Beethoven piano concertos 2 and 5 issued by SONY CLASSICAL several years back they had shown wonderfuly musical playing and connection. This is totally engaging. The depth and feel for the music shown by the artists in Schubert's music for two hands needs no mention.This to me is one of those events where if one had the chance, then one should attend. They dont happen every other day. Just once in a lifetime perhaps.A truly remarkable meeting of minds in Carnegie Hall!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frenetic and bombastic","review":"I found the performance frenetic and bombastic.

If it were by any other artist it would be hailed as a classic. It's just that what Black Dog did with 'Bytes' was so spectacular, it tended to put whatever they came up with as a follow-up into the shade.There is a more ethnic feel to this album. Waves of arabic touches flow in and out of the music on here, lending it more of a middle-eastern feel. But it didn't overpower the usual qualities of their music, the innovative drum programming, melodic tracks, all what we recall from 'Bytes'. It just tended to add another dimension to their music, that's all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Record that Sounds Like a Whole Story","review":"This is one of the most interesting records of the Electronica. It does not sound totally like trip-hop, or ambient or house or a little of caribean rythm, but all in between. The tracks seem to say a whole story, which ends with a song (Chesh) that make you picture all the creation and evolution of the Universe. If you are a fan of the Electronica and/or the new tendencies, this is an intense and unique CD highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Barbecue Swingers Live\\" Much Better","review":"I have been a big fan of Mr Ruffins for many years.

Kermit needs to play with an acoustic band! Cheesey electric keyboard sounds, electric bass, lousy covers, his daughter's singing and a bizarre version of Talking Loud and Saying Nothing make this one to avoid.

Had two different service personel (at a cost of $170 each time) out here to take the TV away and they tell me nothing is wrong. It works fine for a week and then it starts turning off again. With Panasonics attitude and not acknowledging they're having problems with this model, I will never again buy any Panasonic ever product again.

I do like arotica and romance and even books without any explicit sex. So my tastes run the gamut. But it would have been nice to see a little more plot line and layers to the story. I think, as far as writing ability, the author has potential - but her chapter divisions and plot arc were not done well at all.

However, after using this headset for some time I've noticed that it really doesn't fit very well ... the overall design does not allow for ANY adjustment other than the boom mic position (rotation) so it slips off the ears if you move around much (especially if you use it walking/pacing) and it actually hurts my ears if I try to use the plastic pieces that appear to be ear-loops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skunked Again","review":"Well, I guess I asked for it.

Johnny Cash's American Recordings is an example. Just as Cash lived up to his myth with that album, Emmylou Harris lives up to hers with Wrecking Ball. No matter how great her country albums are, there has always been something dark and atmospheric about her. Those qualities come through with this album. Beautiful, haunting music that somehow manages to take your mind off whatever it is your thinking about, Wrecking Ball is an album Emmylou was destined to make."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of the 90's","review":"Emmylou's shatteringly beautiful voice shows some signs of weariness here, but it suits the overall mood of this album. Atmospherically produced by Daniel Lanois, this album of other songwriter's works moves from highlight to highlight. If you think of Emmylou as strictly a country artist, you will find some surprises here. This album stretches to gospel, folk, blues, and rock, with songwriters as diverse as Jimi Hendrix, Neil Young, Gillian Welch, and Bob Dylan.If you are not a fan of Daniel Lanois, I might advise you to stay away from this, as a few reviewers have had some very negative reactions to this album. Also, many of the songs are quite downbeat and downright depressing in a way. But others are uplifting and spiritual, and all of them are sung with heart and soul engaged. Personally, I think it is a highpoint in Harris' career."},{"rating":"2","title":"haunting and beautiful","review":"I don't usually go for high production recordings but Emmylou's voice fits so gorgeously with the soundscapes created by producer Daniel Lanois that this album really works. It's an emotional and spiritual as well as sonic glory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This is the first Emmylou Harris record I ever purchased. I'm a big fan of some of the songwriters whose work Harris covered on this disc, including Bob Dylan, Neil Young and Steve Earle. Considering all the glowing reviews, I expected much more than I got. This disc is heavy on production, monotonous, and downright unlistenable. If you're looking for good county or folk music, look elsewhere. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tantric Country","review":"Being a college graduate, I feel I want to stretch my boundaries at time- case in point when I want to hear \\"Joshua Tree\\", but still have a little bite left, in me I put on this record. It has all the jangly guitars and pomp of that classic, but without the high-school-soul. When the other reviewers refer to it's soulful qualities I'm assuming they mean soul- as in a dead body. Don't get me wrong, this is a good record, but not a great record. Daniel Lanios is single-handedly responsible for new-aged country. If Steve Earle is the Devil's right hand, then Daniel Lanois is Depok's publicist. The only thing this album is missing is Emmy-lou singing \\"I'm Every Woman.\\" Don't get me wrong though, this is a great album to have meaningful sex to. Whereas \\"Josua Tree\\" may be right for a one night stand, \\"Wrecking Ball\\" is right for Mrs. Right."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted talent in lousy production","review":"This CD may be the worst engineered recording since Big Brother and the Holding Company in the '60's. The sound is so muddy the lyrics are indecipherable, and Harris' voice jumps volume levels as if the mike was swinging on a string. The tragedy is that the poor sound quality isn't the biggest problem with this album. The arrangements are almost identical from one track to the next: simple-minded, monotonous, adolescent pounding drowned in reverb, dominated by unimaginative guitar playing and positively irritating drumming. Harris did herself no favor by releasing this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful","review":"Mumbled lyrics. Overbearing \\"production\\". A noisy, incoherent mess.

Emmylou's voice is one of the greatest in popular music, but the total sound here just draws you in. Love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn Down the Reverb","review":"This isn't an Emmylou Harris record, but a Daniel Lanois record with Emmylou singing. If you like Lanois, you'll love it. I find his studio tricks and over use of re-verb and echo that drowns out the voice of an angel to be annoying. I'd rather listen to any Emmylou record over this one. Heck I'd rather listen to 90% of albums over this one. I put away for over 10 years, found a copy and try to listen to it but three songs in the music was so horrid I couldn't take it any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"While I usually give credit for artists who reinvent their sound, I cannot do so here. This album, to put it bluntly is over-produced. Lanois's trademark sound--heavy use of echoing guitars, and reverb filled base lines suffocate the real reason why people listen to emmylou: the softness, compassion and genuineness of her voice. In the Hendrix cover, Emmylou's voice is lost in the amplified chaos of Lanois's U2 sound. Hendrix himself performed this piece the way Emmylou should have.Sweet old world is the only gem; simply recorded, no heavy bass and guitar lines. Moreover, Emmylou's voice along with Neil Young's harmony carries the piece. For Emmylou fans stick to earlier albums or her Linda Rondstadt collaboration. My favorite Emmylou album: live at the ryman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Awful","review":"Emmylou Harris is a fabulous singer, but on this disc her vocal purity is flattened by Daniel Lanois' overbearing production style.

I love most music and can try to appreciate all forms. My favorite style from ELH is 'Together Again' from Profile (The Best of Emmylou Harris) - her voice is crisp, strong, and the instrumentals are fantastic (Floyd Cramer-style). I have listened to Wrecking Ball three times and I am beginning to like it. It will never be among my favorites. I also like Cimarron, Cowgirl's Prayer and Live At the Ryman soooooooooooooooooooooooo much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Lanois Disaster","review":"Fair warning to anyone tempted to purchase this cd on the basis of the reviews below, as I was: this is the worst album Ms. Harris ever made, and the fault is clearly that of the producer. Ms. Harris doesn't have the stongest voice but it is clear as a bell, except on this album, where she mumbles the lyrics, such as they may be since you can't make them out, two octaves below her range to the accompaniment of the most tastless, overblown arrangements imaginable, for a lady who can sing to the angels with an acoustic guitar. Amazingly, Langois did the same thing to Willie Nelson, producing Mr. Nelson's worst album (in a career with more than a few misses), making him sound like Clarabell the clown. If you are new to Emmylow Harris, try Blue Kentucky Girl to hear what she is capable of."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a thorough disappointment","review":"I thought there was nothing Emmylou could do that I wouldn't love, but this album proved me wrong. It sounds like it was recorded on a cheap hand held recorder in an abandoned warehouse. And the material she records is simply uninteresting; in fact it downright wears on the listener the second or third time through. Yes, I realize the critics are all in ecstasy over the album, but the fact is it is far below her usual standards. Skip this one, and try her earlier and more recent work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like she's on downers, slurred lyrics and dynamics.","review":"Emmylou Harris has apparently forgotten that vocalists need to practice proper enunciation. It is impossible to understand about half of the lyrics. It sounds like she's on downers, her words are slurred, and the melodies have no dynamics. Absolutely the worst thing that I have heard from her. I prefer the older albums like Luxury Liner where the songs and the performance are so very, very polished and listenable. Wrecking Ball is aptly named -- I'm afraid it's another CD frisbee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly","review":"I've listened to this album many times over the years since it was released, trying to find a 'reason to believe.' Except for a moment hear and there when Harris can actually be heard, I'm afraid my original impression remains: a horrible mess by a great singer. And virtually all of the blame can be attributed to the producer, Daniel Lanois. He has covered Harris' slender voice with layer upon layer of electronic garbage, so much so that it's hard to tell if the songs are better than they sound (certainly his own compositions are pretty pathetic compared to some that Harris has written). One could hope that this was just an abberation by Lanois, but his work with Neil Young and others is just as bad. Kudos to Harris for being adventurous, but I'm glad she moved on. If not for the fact that it's Emmylou Harris, one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did Danny let this one out of the studio?","review":"I don't know how Danny let this one out of the studio in 1995. I have nine EmmyLou Harris CD's, 1973-2003. The early work really sparkles. Through Brand New Dance, 1990, she was spot on. On this CD, she loses her lyrics, she does not hit her high and low notes. It almost sounds as if she was incapacitated, by who knows what. The ensemble for this album was mind boggling, a lot of people who I really like. In Spyboy, 1998, she seems back to herself, and I know Red Dirt Girl, 2000, by heart. But this one is a real shame. And, for this she got a Grammy. It must have been one of those \\"we owe you\\" gifts."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love her country music, you won't like this","review":"I've been a fan of EH since 1975, and being skeptical of overhype, I ignored this CD when it came out. Having hated her followup to this, \\"Red Dirt Girl,\\" I still stayed away. When I found it at my local library, I checked it out, and am I glad I didn't waste a dime on it. I confess, I gave up on it after 6 tracks. Her singing was off key, her diction slurred, and there wasn't a steel guitar to be heard. I guess this is some sort of New Age Folk, but it sure didn't float my boat. If you're a fan of EH's country music, pick up her latest, \\"All I Intended To Be\\" and you won't be disappointed. But stay away from this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a horrible, horrible album","review":"This album got great reviews, and many of my friends who don't care for country music liked it.

To be avoided by lovers of the old Emmylou."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant from start to finish","review":"Sadly, I am another music lover who did not buy Wrecking Ball when it was first released. A friend gave me the album for Christmas and I just got around to playing it this week on a road trip. I was moved. I played it at least five times in a row and can't get the haunting words, music and melodies out of my head. The stand out track for me is the title track. This is the most moving song Neil Young has written in my opinion. Each track has a similar feel musically which helps to keep things consistant but each song speaks of something new. I believe I may not have felt this way about this album had I first heard it in 1995. I may have been too young to appreicate it's artistic beauty. I encourage anyone looking for a \\"lifetime keeper\\" to make the investment and buy \\"Wrecking Ball.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Old World - one of the great moments","review":"I'd had Wrecking Ball stuck away in a back corner because on a first listen it wasn't the Emmylou Harris I knew. Then, a spare moment of time to REALLY listen, and wow.There's a slice of pure perfection it this albumYou travel a long way to hear anything more sensitively performed, better produced, or perfect for the the artist than Wrecking Ball's Sweet Old World.At its basics its a regretful song about the sweet things some person who has suicided has left behind in this Sweet Old World.Then you're listening again to the words, and you realize the almost woozy, sliding ethereal sound that's been created to wrap around the song is so acutely suggestive of some soul slipping gently away from life. Huge marks for Emmylou herself, Daniel Lanois who produced it, and Neil Young who's background vocal is right on itIt's a wonderful moment in music.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Not usually a fan of country music, I got hooked on Emmylou when she was touring with Linda Ronstadt, then went back and purchased the Trio and Trio II albums.

The story looked great, and I'd heard good things about it, but I have to say that this book did not live up to any of the expectations I had for it. Georgiana was obnoxious and anachronistic - I couldn't bring myself to like her at all. I also had the feeling she would have fit in better in the 21st century than the 19th. The plot was muddled, and at places very silly.

My goodness, I think it took me two hours to read this book because it was mostly filler--the book could have been 50 pages and accomplished the same thing as it does at its current length--a sign of a truly badly written text. There was no story there--no romantic tension to build and shape into anything. I am still confused why they are together and how they got there--the headlong rush that fails to make sense.

In my opinion, this book is almost unrecognizeable as a product of her imagination. Foley's signature emotional intensity between the two main characters was nowhere to be found. In fact, the characters were flat and boring, and the love scenes and sexual tension were about as hot as dry ice.

There is a power update that I installed when I first got it but it doesn't seem to fix the problem at hand. If you're looking for dependency and reliablity, I defiantly wouldn't recommend the EM-500. I've lost all my data twice now (partly my fault because I didn't do a backup)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pocket PC!","review":"Well I just bought an EM-500 Sky Blue and am very happy. I know that there are going to be a lot of new Pocket PC's hitting the market soon but I did some research and found out that this is really all I need. The price is great (only 299.99 here) and the MMC/SD cards are going down! There is an optional modem from casio and a few other venors that plugs into the port at the bottem of the devise. I have 3 32 Mb MMC cars (I own an Mp3 player that uses them)and that is plenty of space for anything I want. If you have been thinking of buying this, do it.

The other comes from \\"Exquisite Dead Guy\\" (which scares my folks) and \\"S-E-X-X-Y\\" which is cool because they aren't, well, experts in that type of music but still make it rock. Buy it, but buy all of the other albums first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good CD from a great band","review":"For first time listeners, Factory Showroom is a good album to start out with.

Even as great as their early work was, I feel that the duo does better work with the full band. It just gives them a better sound.

Polk.\\" Others such as \\"Metal Detector\\", \\"XTC vs. Adam Ant\\" and \\"Your Own Worst Enemy\\" soon grew on me.

Musically, and lyrically, it lacks the humor, creativity, and intelligence that epitomizes all other TMBG works. This is NOT the CD to buy, if you're interested in who TMBG are and what they're made of, and what they typify. Nothing about this album is in any way reminiscent of who they are.

When I bought this cd because I found it used for $2.99 I put it in and to my supprize heard a bass line(SEXXY). Finally a band who rocks the bass some of these songs make me want to install a disco ball in my car. Were as other songs make me want to play in a band to rock like crazy(Till-My-Head-Falls-Off). Then there are the song with convey strong emotions in a very odd way like I Can Hear You and Own Worest Enemy. The only real fault to this cd is it is mildly annoying.

Polk,\\" \\"Metal Detector,\\" and the almost-Christmas carol \\"New York City.\\" Great music throughout. The themes and lyrics are not Frank-Zappa-style comedic, but at times the humor and satire come through very clearly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"This was an album purchase that would have been better as a \\"buy a couple tracks\\" purchase. I really liked \\"James K. Polk\\" and \\"Exquisite Dead Guy,\\" but that was it. The songs that try to be more rock, like \\"S-E-X-X-Y\\" and \\"XTC vs Adam Ant,\\" are just too slow. The former even pauses pretty often, which is a fine thing to do if there's, you know, MUSIC the rest of the time. It's just a lot of foreplay without getting to the deed, you know? You're basically waiting for the song to start the whole time and it just never does.The rest of the tracks are just a loose, lazy, bubblegum pop that I really don't care for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I bought this DVD player at Sam's Club.

I purchased this in order to take advantage of the HDMI inputs on my new TV and to boost the quality of my existing DVD's. The HDMI output worked only once in about 30-40 attempts, the remote is horrible and the unit frequently doesn't respond. I had to unplug the unit and plug it back in twice to get my DVD back at one point (the unit had frozen). I finally got through to customer service and after describing the problem the guy immediately told me to return it. They are evidently aware of the problem. The replacement unit (I really wanted this to work) had all of the same problems. This is a bum of a DVD player and isn't worth the $50 price. Sam's should stop selling it.

Our schools fail miserably at Math and Science and Writing.. they need to put effort on that, and leave the moral upbringing to parents.

My only problem with the book is her recipies, some needed to be reworked as the proportions are wrong. As well I couldn't get some to mix.

But one may wonder what the point of this type of recreationist interpretation is, especially given that Kurt is prone to denigrate far better musicians than himself, ie Wynton, for allegedly raping the past.At any rate, Elling is about the best there is in male jazz vocalists, and I hope he learns to refine his tastes to better musical choices, and hopefully, finally, a new piano player."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Fan","review":"I had heard of Kurt Elling, but never actually HEARD him. Happened to run into a song by him on internet radio. Was blown away by his phrasing, smoothness. The next day, I went to my local store & found just this sole CD, not even knowing that it was new. Nor did I wonder if it contained the 1 song I had heard. It din't matter. But as I fought to unwrap the packaging, I told myself: \\"this better be worth buying unheard\\". The very 1st cut started a little slow (for me), but picked up 1/2 way through. The rest of the CD left me hungering for more. Where have I been all my life??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music to appreciate!!","review":"I am a HUGE fan of Kurt Elling. I can't say enough glowing things about this new CD to bring justice to the true artistry of the recording. Many thanks to Kurt and company for a brilliant album!! They have surpassed my expectations. So far Higher Vibe is my favorite, but all the songs are hauntingly real and beautiful. Go see him live if you get a chance. You will be a part of something truly special!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy","review":"This product is not as pictured.It is a thin , flat stick.Vender will not issue full credit when returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"a remarkable collection at a great price","review":"Like the companion set, Hittin' on All Six (jazz guitar), this collection brings together a wide range of excellent records that date from the earliest jazz recordings going up though early modern. Some of the selections are predictable, some are obscure, but they all are interesting. Lots of Sid Catlett, for example, and excellent choices on the big band side in particular (Cozy Cole, Jimmy Crawford and Jo Jones, to name three). No Lionel Hampton, but the fabulous cymbal beat of Alvin Burroughs with a Hampton small group. And of course, Chick Webb's Liza, which features wonderful drumming but also a really fine trumpet solo by Bobby Stark (the 2nd solo)."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very comprehensive","review":"I was excited to read this book but was very disappointed with the content.

I was introduced to him about four or five years ago (I'm only twenty six) by someone I met while seeing Woody at The Carlyle. This album is the closest one can get to seeing Mr. Short, and what his modern shows are like. Great brass, intimate setting and wonderful songs performed by Mr. Short with his legendary phrasing and delievery, are soon to be no more after this year. For the past three years I have been around the world in the military, two or three times a year traveling back home to see him. But when I cannot, I put on this album, grab a drink, and listen to this wonderful recording. No one with any musical taste that I have played this album to did not enjoy it. Must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the same fun as the rest of the series","review":"This book, as are all of the Clearwater Crossing books, is truely enjoyable. I read my copy in about five hours of staigt reading, ending at four in the morning. I would have liked a little more of a spiritual perspective when the Junior Explorer gets lost (I'm tring not to spoil anything that isn't spoiled by reading the back of the book) but that doesn't appear to be Roberts' style. Again, Ben is really down played, so we never see him except when he is involved with the other characters. The cliffhanger is a bit less dramatic this time, and it lacks some of the crisis situations of the second and fourth books.Oh, and if you're wondering who the new people are on the cover: I'm afraid I don't know either. We don't seem to be adding any important characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking song","review":"This is an awesome song, especially live. The song starts off simple enough- no bass, Benji playing open chords, Billy plucking some strings here and there, and Aaron using just a tamborine and the hi-hat. Then it kicks into the chorus, with an awesome melody, distorted guitars, bass, and great drumming. The lyrics are very poetic, and gives you a warm feeling inside. The song is about needing motivation to go on in life. The thing that really steals the show, though, is Benji's guitar solo which starts at 2:11 and ends at 2:36. The song ends with that signature, Good Charlotte explosive, uplifting feeling, and guest vocalist Jimmy from Jimmy's Chicken Shack does vocals towards the end of the song, and the melodies are once again perfect. This is probably my favorite song ever, don't pass up this song just because your afraid liking GC will \\"hurt your image\\" or whatever, just give it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shower Curtain","review":"The shower curtain arrived very quickly, and is of superior quality.

Wrong! It looks the same, but does not work the same. The Floral Passions does not harden enough for it to come off cleanly. We found that the Floral Passions tended to stay \\"gooey\\" so that it had to be pulled off in little pieces, greatly increasing the pain level. I don't understand why they felt the need to \\"improve\\" something that worked fine. Get the Gigi Brazilian Hard Wax if you can find it. Floral Passions equals more pain in our book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the original formula this one does not work","review":"I got this after the can the warmer came with ran out (Gigi Brazilian Hard Body Wax). It smells great but does not work well, it remains soft and gooey no matter how thin or thick you apply it, I even left it on longer and still it would not harden. I ended up with a patchy job and a sticky mess I had to use loads of oil to remove. I only gave 1 star because of the smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves a lot to be desired","review":"I am not thrilled with this product.

This album is truly something! This is not the typical emo album, crying about their girl troubles. Most emo albums you listen to, the singer has broken his heart and wants sympathy.

Or his \\"postcards on the floor, but his pen can't write lonliness no more\\" (-- The Ataris \\"Road signs and Rock stars\\"). This album takes the rather opposite approach. Chris Conley (Lead singer/song writer/guitarist) writes about getting back at the girl who has broken his heart. Chopping off her legs, splashing lemonade in her face, shoving mud down her throat, etc. If you have ever been dumped by a girl and instead of feeling bad, you want to take some action. this album is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saves The Day, not the best, but close.","review":"This album was very good, when I bought it I had only heard 2 songs off of it, I wasnt sure what all to expect but I was definatly not dissapointed.

If you like the Get Up Kids, you will proabably like Saves The Day."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Saved Me!!!","review":"From the first time I listened to this CD it hasent left my stereo. STD \\"Saves The Day\\" is by far the best pop\\\\punk band around. I have been through some tough times with girls, and STD always helps me out. They're lyrics are realistic, and I can really relate, somthing not found with most bands, and Chris has a very unique voice. \\"Somewhere under water, maybe you can find my heart, 'Cause thats where I threw it, after you had torn it out.

It's got tons of catchy hooks and teen-ridden angst, but it also shows the development of the band. It's a little less raw than their previous album, but it still has some of those elements. I guess the best thing to summarize \\"Through Being Cool\\" is that it set the stage for all these bands today that are making a living off of the \\"Saves the Day sound.\\" If only they'd come out with this album a few years later, they'd be huge.

To me, it sounded like a completely different band. All of the songs sound exactly the same and, honestly, they don't have that something that makes me love a song or album.

The complex yet simple rhythyms (?) formed part of my after-work chillout moments. I left in the sun 5 years later (long story), but thankfully, I had preserved it on tape. Found the source album on cassette soon thereafter, and fell in love with that, too. Now both are in my wife's mother's house (in Ireland, of all places!), and I miss them the way one misses old friends. I must posess this CD.

Terry's voice is very soothing and the music is relaxing. Best songs include: \\"Wherever You Are,\\" \\"I Don't Wanna Wait Till Tomorrow,\\" \\"It's You That I Need,\\" and \\"It Ain't Over (Till It's Over).\\" And there's even more great songs to be discovered on this CD as well. She can hold her own and sing just great alone without her fellow En Vogue singers: Cindy, Dawn and Maxine. Terry's solo album is far better than Dawn's.

Ranging from classical, metal, jazz, and combinied with their best singer, \\"A Change Of Seasons\\" is possibly DT's best work. Full of soul-blazing solos by John Petrucci and Derek Sherinian, this is one you don't want to miss!The rest are the Ronnie Club Gig, which has excellent covers spanning from Elton John and Deep Purple, to Pink Floyd, Kansas, and Dixie Dreggs...."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great.","review":"It's so hard to highlight one of Dream Theater's songs as a favorite. There are so many that are just too good. A Change of Seasons is musical virtuosity tweaked to the maximum. It really is an impressive song. The song itself I believe, makes this CD worth the price of admission. In saying that I am not saying that the rest of the CD isn't worth it...because it is. These guys just constantly amaze me. DT is the classic example that good music still exists... thank you guys so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This!","review":"If you were a progressive rock fan and into really accomplished musicians, this is definitely the next step."},{"rating":"2","title":"Change Of Pace","review":"This Dream Theater EP is a nice change of pace from their studio work. The opening title track is a 23-minute epic that is just simply vintage DT. Odd-metered and VERY intricate music from start to finish. The difference on this compared to their full-length studio work is that they actually included some cover tunes that were recorded live. DT covers quite a range from Journey's \\"Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin' \\", Pink FLoyd, Elton John and even Queen. While the title track is a terrific listen, the cover tunes are also great to check out as well. It's a showing of the bands that DT seem to have been influenced by. \\"A Change Of Seasons\\" is a definite keeper mainly due to the covers they perform. It's not all the time you hear a great band like DT record some great cover songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional album","review":"I remember when my older brother played this song a few times, I never thought to ask him what the name of the song was, but whatever that song was, it was phenomenal. Ofcourse, later on, I found out that that song was called 'A Change of Seasons'; one of the songs that makes this album stand out beautifully. And the others are worth listening too.'A Change of Seasons': A song this long, with many varied sounds, and some masterful voices and I mean opera-like voices, makes you play at least more than 4 times a day. The lyrics are profound, with some twists in it. This song is like a poem--very descriptive, very dynamic.5/5The above song is one of my favorite songs of this group. All of the rest of the songs in 'A Change of Seasons' are excellent songs, since these are some of the tributes to some of the very popular artists.I found this album very illustrious and vigorous and so will you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Nifty Stuff","review":"I had heard a lot about Dream Theater before I bought this, but I had never heard any of their music before. I've got to say that I am impressed. They don't really sound like anything out there right now. This CD has great instrumentation and vocals. The guitars and bass are especially great.The title track has to be one of the longest, but best songs I have ever heard. The cover songs of Led Zeppelin and Elton John are great. I totally recommend this album to anyone looking for some great rock n' roll. I am going to buy more DT albums soon. I give this on five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.....please stay original","review":"I think it's funny how some of the fans here love this album the most out of Dream Theaters entire collection.

The other cover songs are okay, but Change of Seasons (all 26 minutes of it) really shows off the band's talents. And though many versions of this song have been released (live variations), this version is still my favorite!This is where we get our first taste of Derek Sharidian thumping his fingers on the keys, and a great job he did too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sonic Mess","review":"I honestly don't see what the others found in this CD... Distorted, cacophonic guitar over layers and layers of frantic tibetan percussion? Compositions that are mostly driven by whining, atonal melody, backed by very little harmony - not very interesting. I got very agitated by listening to just a few tracks, perhaps that's the intention. If I want psychedelic eastern music, I'd rather listen to Led Zeppelin, Quintessence, Mahavishnu Orchestra or Shakti for that matter. Not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect to boot up from either Firewire Interface","review":"I got this enclosure for a Hitachi 1 TB disk which has 3 partitions, one of which is a SuperDuper clone. Connected via Firewire 800 and it was recognized fine by my iMac. I could access anything on the drive with no problems. Went to boot up from the drive and it wasn't recognized. Tried FW 400 and on 2 different machines with same results. When I hooked up via USB I could boot from it, but that's way too slow.Contacted Macally and the first question they asked was what power supply I was using, which is the 12v-3A supplied with the unit. Then he told me to contact their warranty department.Needing the drive and not wanting to wait, I had Amazon ship a replacement, but unfortunately, the same problem. Am returning the second one and will get something else.If you're happy using USB, the unit is fine, but why pay for FW, when you don't get the full use of it?Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when it works but a pain when it locks up my MAC","review":"I bought this hoping it would work out well as a external 24/7 drive enclosure. It does work but after a day or two of spin up's and down's, it locks up my MAC hard. I did narrow it down to this enclosure. I have two different ones connected to my Mini. The other will not lock the machine up. When it locks the machine finder freezes hard and I have to force quit everything and reboot. I only put a WD 500GB drive in it so the power supply should handle the load. The drive only pulls .75A. The power supply it comes with says is rated at 2 amps. I have tried changing energy settings etc. Nothing really fixes the problem. So for a occasional external drive it is OK. But, for a continuous on all the time enclosure it sucks. I am putting this on the shelf as a emergency drive tool and getting something that can take the work load."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power Pack too weak for large capacity drives","review":"I also had serious problems with this enclosure. I bought it because it was a nice looking enclosure. I put a 1TB Hitachi inside and it caused no end of trouble. The power pack is too weak for this drive. My hard drive IS NOT the problem.

I stuck my hitachis in a Vantec Case and have been there for more than a year without turning off."},{"rating":"1","title":"FireWire limited","review":"Although this enclosure appears to be of decent quality I quickly returned it after realizing that the \\"FireWire\\" port is only a FireWire 400 port. The 2009 Mac Mini for instance only has a FireWire 800 port. In order for me to connect this enclosure to my Mac Mini I would either have to use the USB port or purchase a 800 to 400 adapter. On top of this it only includes a USB cable and no FireWire cable. If you do any research on external hard drives you will find out that using USB 2.0 to connect a hard drive results in the drive being at least twice as slow as the same drive connected via FireWire 800. Instead I am looking at a Mercury Elite-AL drive enclosure which is more expensive but has multiple FW800 ports and cables included for all the ports."},{"rating":"1","title":"pros and cons of this enclosure","review":"Pros: has 3 interfaces which is a great convenience and makes it more interoperable with systems that may have only one of the 3 interfaces available.Cons: 1. Firewire is only 400, which is too slow for today's apps.2. Does not have an 8cm cooling fan on the flat side. Withoutsuch a fan, 7200 rpm drives die within 2 years of operation.I know! I have lost a few already! I will NEVER buy anenclosure without a large fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't knock it over","review":"It worked perfectly out of the box. Solid performance and didn't have any problems with it. But I took it to work one day, and while hooking up wires I knocked it over from standing position to it's side. I wasn't using the stand at the moment, but i'd expected at least some protection from knocking it over to it's side like that. This thing has no protection against even the smallest impact. In fact, I think this case amplified what little force it would've had, had it not had the case. It was an instant death for my wd hd."},{"rating":"2","title":"great lil case","review":"I'm VERY VERY happy with this drive, I now own 2 and I'm running 1x WD caviler Black and 1x WD caviler Green, I've had NO problems with the power units.

It locks up the entire computer (Mac Mini) until I manually power off/power on the drive unit. This happens every day and makes the drive virtually unusable. I tried adjusting the power saving feature to both extremes to no effect. The discussion boards explain the power supply as the problem, particularly when powering the larger (1 TB or greater) drives and that is indeed what I'm using. Hopefully tech support will send me a higher capacity power supply but even if they do, this type of problem should never have been an issue to begin with.Update: Macally sent me an upgraded power supply. The problem has lessened, but still happens about once every 3 days (instead of everyday). I gave up on it. But I do give Macally some credit for sending the power supply; too bad it was not enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice enclosure, but fails to spin up sometimes","review":"I have had 2 of these enclosures for about 2 months.

This has happened four times already, each time causing my raid to be rebuilding for 2 days. -- See also a negative review about power supplies in this thread.

The USB enclosure I have had for 9 months has worked beautifully for the 3.5 hard drive I removed from my iMac intel Core2Duo and replaced with an SSD. However, THIS firewire version did not work properly. It would disconnect, spontaneously, and on its own, while connected by firewire. When i tried connecting it with the USB 2.0 cable that came with it, the computer did not see it at all. I tried both the firewire connection and the USB connection on all 3 of our computers - a new Macbook Pro and a new macmini running the latest v of Lion, and also a 2006 iMac intel Core2Duo running snow leopard.

They have both been very reliable with 500g and 750g drives with eSATA connection. I like the round power supply connection, unlike some other enclosures (you don't have to bother to orient the plug just the right way).My only complaint relates to the support options. The cradle base requires the user to add some padding for it to hold the drive securely. It is very stable with both the cradle base and the front and back feet attached, but with the front and back feet alone it rocks sideways, with the cradle alone it is not very stable front to back. If you want to travel with it the feet come loose and have to be re-tightened and they add to the bulk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"This is a really cool-looking HDD enclosure that complimented my Mac Pro. But, that's as far as the niceties ended. While it was relatively easy to install the HDD (two external and four internal phillips head screws), it failed after about 40 days and would not couple with the computer. Before that, occasionally it had to be recycled by the power connection to get it to be recognized. This was the second one of these I obtained, the first being returned for replacement having failed within the 30-day replacement period. I should have paid attention to the reviews. If you want a handy paper weight that looks good next to your Mac Pro, then this is the thing. Otherwise, stay away.I can't say enough about Amazon. Their replacement policies are fantastic, their customer service quick and easy, and their polices flexible when the conditions warrant. My order arrived on time as expected with Amazon Prime."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Support??","review":"Great product, as long as you don't need support.I have been trying to get a reasonable warranty response from McAlly on my drive enclosure since mid-May of this year.

And since complaining to Krystel in California, no further feedback. At all.I have since written (last week) to Mcally using their website form, carefully outlining the timeline, the email communications back and forth, and so on. Nothing.

I've had no problems at all.The only gotcha -- and this is really minor -- is sometimes I forget that I have to press the Power button to turn it on. On the whole, though, I kind of like having an on/off switch on my external devices, so this isn't really a negative.It came with all the cables and the screws I needed, and the instructions were great.

OK, so it's a copy of Apple's MacPro form factor, but Macally did a great job of making an easy-to-assemble external enclosure. The power supply is external to the external enclosure, so the case requires no noisy fans. Set aside some time on your schedule, since it may take 60-90 seconds to have it up and running.What was very impressive, since it's quite rare, is that the cables were included . . . often one must buy cables separately when buying a complete external drive.Nothing is left out here.

The rest of the book is surprisingly \\"thin\\" and superficial.

The only one who actually sings can't sing at all. 3) Where is \\"In And Out of Love\\"???"},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift","review":"My mom loves this stuff, can't say that I mind since I have been around it for so long.

This is not the product I thought it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run From This Tornado","review":"I bought this movie because it was cheap, but it wasn't cheapenough. It starts out with what seems like hours of grainy stock footage of military aircraft in flight, landing, and taking off. This is without a doubt the most boring aircraft footage I have ever seen. Still, when the movie starts, it is difficult not to yearn for the stock footage again. The star is a female body-builder who pumps iron to get ready for the big battle scene. I guess her big biceps help here carry her automatic rifle. The actors all went to the Ed Wood School of Acting (E.W.S.A.). There is an imaginary love triangle which doesn't amount to anything. There is dialogue that wants to make you put a paper bag over your head. I gave this movie one star because I thought if I gave it no stars you might think I meant to give it 5 stars, but just forgot to type it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm... the system won't let me rate it with zero stars.....","review":"Watching this movie while intoxicated or sober will not assist you to enjoy it. I'm not sure what was worst: the destruction of Tel Aviv represented by a Cessna crashing into an empty pick-up, the endless amounts of stock footage, or the model jet fighter destroying the Nazi fort. This movie is long and painful the first time, and it only gets slightly better the following times.However, if you do find it in a bargain bin, have everyone chip in a dollar to buy it. The laughs derived afterward when thinking about it are worth the pain of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"B\\" Movies I love them","review":"Another addition to my collection.

Unfortunately, the album deteriorates quickly, almost as if the rest is filler to get to the requisite ten songs. I'm the Cat?

I can't give it 5 stars because the package I recieved had been torn open and then taped shut again with cellophane tape -- perhaps a return. Also because it didn't work straight away.When I installed it on my utility sink (which has a hose bibb rather than an actual faucet), it sprayed water out of the area where the hose threads attached to the spigot. I removed it, removed and re-inserted the provided washer (which didn't seem to want to lie completely flat), reinstalled it, but the leaking/spraying problem persisted.Finally, I removed the provided washer that was in the hose thread end, put my own hose washer in there, re-installed it and it worked great.

Especially one that said that George Bush would be reelected in 1992. But I have still found it interesting to hear the different interpretations of Nostradamus' quatrains.However, this book was an absolute disappointment. To start with, the ideas about the destruction are not far fetched, but slightly inconsistent within themselves. I do not even remember the book clearly although I read it not too long ago. It just wasn't worth remembering.I also think that the author should just stay away from religious points of view. For anybody who is interested in different world religions, and Islam especially, one will be able to find many mistakes. I doubt that the author has taken the time to read any books whatsoever on the Islamic faith.Do yourself a favor and stay away from this book.

His writings were a mixture of astrology and spiritism. He vaguely predicted many things, some of which have come true. But a true prophet bats 1.000. The Bible cautions us to avoid star-gazing and spiritism to discern the times. God's Word is our one and only written revelation. Even so, Deut. 29:29 tells us \\"...some mysteries belong to God (alone).\\" Jesus the Messiah, God's One and Only Son is \\"...the Way, the Truth and the Life, no one comes to the Father but by Me.\\" (John 14:6) I suggest you save your money and NOT buy this book but spend it wisely on a Bible.

Sometimes rambling, and a little tedious, but generally the best in interpreting the writings of Nostradamus.

The computer adaptive disk could not be more different from the actual exam. Their computer program even had a calculator built in. Anyone who has taken the exam knows that those things are not allowed in the exam room. I was totally disapointed.

Gov't Mule has great studio albums, but it's their live work that really shows Warren Haynes and Matt Abts to be the top-notch musicians that they are. \\"The Deepest End\\" is the culmination of their Deep End project, the Gov't Mule concert to remember for decades.At this concert (which I wish I could have seen first hand), the Mule jams with the best. Abts easily adapts to each bassist to maintain the rhythm of the songs. Haynes makes the songs works of art. His playing is effortless; his voice powerful and seductive. Listening to this cd and watching the dvd will make you absolutely burn to see them live.Aside from \\"Greasy Granny's Gopher Gravy,\\" which I think Les Claypool botches, all of the songs are performed with so much talent, heart, and soul that they'll stick with you for a long time afterwards. Then, next time they come to your area, go catch their concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always at there best on live recordings...GREAT!","review":"I was starting to become a fan of Gov't Mule. I had a few of there cd's, but when I purchased this one \\"on a chance\\", I was amazed! This cd(s) is great! Then I watched the DVD. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the DVD is worth the price of the whole set and the cd's are a bonus. Usually my attention span will not keep me watching a concert video, but this one is amazing. They have alot of great talent they bring on stage to play with them. Fun to watch and great sound. I don't get to see many concerts anymore(raising kids), but I will go out of my way to see Gov't mule if I get the chance. I've seen The Allman Brothers twice and they were excellent, but I think I will enjoy Gov't mule even more. This cd has made its way into my top ten and I have hundreds of cd's.

And what a purchase it is: over 6 hours of the most satisfying musical experience imaginable. The DVD hasn't left my player for days and the CDs are jamming my car stereo. No matter if you love rock, blues, soul or jazz, there is plenty of everything, always dominated by Warren Haynes' divine guitar playing, backed up by Matt Abts' great drumming and a colourful mix of guest musicians supporting the band. Seeing the Mule live would be a dream come true for me and this DVD is more than a consolation prize. To everyone else; do yourself a favour and get it, you will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have to agree.....................","review":"With all of the other reviewers, this is simply an amazing set of music cds and dvd.

Heaven's Here on Earth, The Rape of the World, Tell it Like it is, Give me one Reason, are enough to possibly make this a five star album, but she nails down any idea of making it a four star album with the song \\"Remember the Tinman\\". This song that could be called \\"Who stole your heart\\" is very subtle and she gives the solution to this cosmic problem at the end of the song, with the \\"Remember the Tinman\\" not even mentioning \\"The Wizard of Oz\\"; Nope she's far to subtle for this. This and the popular hit \\"Give me one Reason\\" make this one of the better albums ever produced in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This CD is by far among the top 10 in my collection. I could listen to it over and over again, especially \\"The Promise\\", which is one of the most beautiful love songs ever written. It's so soothing...I fall asleep to it at night. Both this and Tracy Chapman's other self titled CD are must-haves."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll Give You A Few Reasons.","review":"The third release from Tracy Chapman, New Beginning, is awash with great folksy tunes worthy of all the praise this collection received. At This Point In My Life is a gorgeous number sang with all the honestly Tracy puts into all her tunes. Heaven's Here On Earth is a jewel that makes you think. The Rape Of The World, Give Me One Reason and Remember The Tinman are the other standouts.

I immediately searched for & purchased this CD and played the song, \\"The Promise\\" at my mother's funeral. I cannot tell you just how much it has meant to me...it was as though it was a sign from my mother.

I love her voice and the cd is a wonderful addition to any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than One Reason To Listen To This","review":"It is fair to say that the sales of this CD were spurred on by the immense popularity of \\"Give Me One Reason\\". However, for those who bought this just for that song, thay have missed some truly great earthy music. The acoustic-folk aura surrounding this CD enhances every song. You won't find any toe-tappers on here however. The intellectually stimulating lyrics and comfortable tone of this CD puts it head and shoulders above any of the folk-pretenders out there today. Though \\"Reason\\" is definitely the highlight, \\"Smoke And Ashes\\" is superb. One listen to this song will almost make you forget about 'that other song' on this CD. The only problem with this CD are the songs' length - the longest being over 7 minutes. \\"Smoke And Ashes\\" never would have made it on to radio if it wasn't for an edited version. That's a small quibble though. This CD is very satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise","review":"I heard this CD at a friend's house and had to add it to my collection. I was never really a fan of Tracy's work, but I was feeling this compilation of blues and folk tunes. The lyrics are poignant and are well matched with the arrangements. \\"Give Me One Reason\\" is a standout as are the title track, \\"The Promise\\" and \\"I'm Ready. \\" I like the acoustics, guitar and strings on this CD. This CD made me a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album made me a Tracy fan","review":"Like a lot of others, I bought this cd because I loved \\"Give me one reason\\", and I was suprised at the other songs and style of them. I wasn't really familiar, before, of Tracys work, although I had heard \\"Fast Car\\" on the radio. Anyhow, at first I was a little disappointed, but, never one to dismiss something without giving it a chance, I listened to it a few times, and grew to love it. I think that's the problem with a lot of reviewers who gave this album a low rating. You really do need to listen to it a few times. I love the intimate, warm feeling it gives. Like being in a small club in the wee small hours. Her voice is very earthy and comforting, and she is a terrific song writer...her lyrics have things to say, not mindless, shallow lyrics like some (all of a sudden, Ricky Martin's \\"She Bangs\\" came to my mind). No, her lyrics are deep and thought provoking. Give it a listen,...I'm sure you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just keeps getting better and better!","review":"Rates in the top 5 of a 60+ collection.

My favorite song is \\"Give me one reason\\" I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not live up to original album","review":"Tracy never gets it going on this album. Chapman created a really good singer-songwriter album in her debut. Here, she just can't live up to that originality and verve. You know what I hear on this cd? I hear an artist who received a large recording contract to make multiple albums, and an artist who forced some output to make this session come together. \\"New Beginning\\"'s got Chapman's voice and melody, but not her inspiration. I suggest trying Catie Curtis--who just keeps growing as an artist; we'll wait for Tracy's next attempt and hope that she regains her fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good album from Tracy","review":"This isn't my favorite Tracy Chapman album, that will always be her self-titled debut, but this album has lots of good songs on it as well. My favorite thing about this album is that it has \\"the promise\\" on it which is my absolute favorite of all her songs. \\"the promise\\" is a hauntingly beautiful love song that never fails to bring tears to my eyes, I'd recommend this cd for that track alone, but the rest of the album definitely won't disappoint either."},{"rating":"2","title":"musical and lyrical depth","review":"This album took many listens before it really hit me. \\"Give Me One Reason\\" is an obvious standout track, but the other tunes take time to work their subtle magic on the listener, and for the lyrics to connect. But there is no arguing the depth and quality of these compositions. The opening cut, \\"Heaven's Here On Earth\\" and \\"Smoke And Ashes\\" are two my other favorites, but depending on the lyrical component of the song, other listeners will have different favorites. As another reviewer said, these are songs that you really have to listen to, pay attention to. Most of them won't knock you over the head at first, but any fan of Tracy Chapman knows the staying power of her music, and this album has it in bunches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetition, repetition, repetition","review":"Just as in my title, Tracy's songs repeat the same word or phrase over and over again, ad infinitum. After two or three songs like this, the album becomes incredibly boring. If she avoided this technique, her songs would be fine. I bought the album for one song \\"Give Me One Reason\\". I do like that song, but I wish I had saved some money and just purchased that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one reason to buy this album","review":"\\"The promise\\" is an absolutely fantastic song and my only reason for buying this album. Heard it first on Aer-Lingus trans atlantic in-flight entertainment. Simply had to have this song. Lot of money for one song but worth it. I listened to all the other songs to be fair and none made the cut to go on my i-pod. I suppose this is why people download..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very naive ............................","review":"The title song says, \\"The whole world's broke and it ain't worth fixing ...\\". But fixing it is all we can do because we can't \\"start all over and make a new beginning ...\\". \\"Create a new world ...\\" ? Get real. We're not God. We broke it and we have to fix it, not hide behind noble but hollow sentiments.And as for track 9, \\"Give me one reason to stay here ...\\", how infantile is that? She demands a reason she has no right to ask for. She should be making up her own mind whether to stay or leave. She sounds like a self-absorbed, spoilt child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way more than I expected","review":"I've been going to Moab to ride the awesome Slickrock for years. This place is Mecca for mountain bikers. I just wish I had this book a long time ago. I've bought just about everything that ever came out on trailguides to this area, but nothing compares to this book. The maps and trail descriptions are so detailed. Cool shaded relief on all the maps show every crater and canyon. I really will know what I'm getting into next time I go. Finally I'll have a book that shows me where to go other than Slickrock Trail with maps I can actually read! The best part of this book is the hilarious stories that the author tells throughout the whole book on everything from locals to the film industry. I've read just about every one (there are a lot of stories in this book) and I could hardly put it down. It's obvious thta the author knows this place and loves Moab and the crazy people who live there. This book is much more than I expected from a mountain bike trail guide. Great job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine riding info, but bad taste","review":"This book has fine details on many of Moab's great rides. Throughout much of this guide, however, I got the feel that this author has a chip on his shoulder. He seems to be getting all his revenge and mean spirits out through this guide book. Some of it is actually comical, but most of it just rude. One example (and I'm paraphrasing): riding the White Rim in 4-5 days is \\"boring\\". Note to author: some of us actually use our mtn bikes to take us to beautiful, tranquil areas. It's not always about how much air we get or how many miles logged. Anyone who would call 5 days in Canyonlands with a mtn bike \\"boring\\" is lacking some serious taste for life.Instead, buy the Falcon pocket guide by Crowell. It's got great info, is small enough for your pack, and without the rude gossip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought!","review":"I went looking for the well-known book that got a good review in Mountain Biking Magazine a while back.. it was called Mountain Biking Moab... but it was by David Crowell.. it has (I found it in Moab!) maps and profiles and such in a carry-along format..This book is a good read.. but buy the other book if you go. It is now called Mountain Biking Moab 2nd Edition Pocket Edition or something like that...I don't know what's going on with this publisher.. This book that I'm reviewing used to be called something else too.. but it looks like the publishers of the good book (the pocket edition) bought this one too... whatever.. but get the pocket edition if you're riding the trails!Keep the Rubberside Down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mountain Biking Moab","review":"The author provides excellent information, maps and important details that will help make your Moab experience much less frightening. The book will also familiarize you with the terrain/trails before you get there. However, Mr. Bridgers still manages to ruin it by being rude, crude and derogatory throughout the book. The text is full of swearing and blasphemy, crude descriptions of which body parts rock formations resemble, and put-downs aimed at Mormons; he promotes lies and almost never portrays Latter-day Saints in a good light. All of the information that you need from this book can be obtained in the Mountain Bike Moab Pocket Guide, and that book will fit into your Camelbak. Save your money, and don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother! Crass and unprofessional.","review":"Unfortunately, the author degrades himself and his readers throughout this book. Just take a look at how many are up for resale on the used list and that's all you need to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"This book is vulgar and demeaning. I think the author disgraces himself and gives a poor impression of Moab and the quality of people in that area. Furthermore, he hates the 4th of July, makes crass comments and seems to despise good taste. This book ended up where it belongs, in the trash. The only redeeming part of this book is the author's safety warnings and fair trail descriptions. However, it would be better to maintain your self respect by getting a more uplifting guide book since there are some good ones out there with excellent trail descriptions and advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Rocks!","review":"I wish all guide books were like this one! I have tons of guide books for areas all over the U.S., but this is the only one I've read cover to cover. Not only do you get the facts you need for the rides, you also get entertaining and humorous stories every few pages. The section on equipment even helped me decide which bike I wanted to buy! Not thin and dinky like many other books of this type either. Just order it! You'll like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Lee Bridgers has definitely set a new standard in mountain bike guide books. One of the best things about is how simple it is to follow the ride descriptions. Moab can be deadly and Lee makes no bones about it. If you plan on visiting Moab, this is essential equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor and biased","review":"I've read the book and biked with the authors company based in Moab and don't recommend either.There are many other guides to Moab which are cheaper and equally informative (try Biker Mel's.). Only when you meet the author, ride the routes he describes, the routes he doesn't describe and hear what the locals have to say about him (all bad) do you realise how unreliable this book is. It is just too biased by the authors own personal opinion.This guy is decsribed locally as a biker snob who made enemies after slagging off everybody else in Moab in this book and who refers to routes as 'his trails'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lee Bridger's Chip on the Shoulder","review":"There are a lot of rides described in this book however, this guy has a chip on his shoulder! He can't say much good about anyone except himself. As others have said - there are other good guide books with good trail information and not all the drivel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful about buying this brand","review":"I just bought these at my local health food store and the second main ingredient is now NOT safflower or sunflower oil but canola oil.

They are right up there with Linkin Park, Sum-41, Blink 182, Slipknot, Yellow Card, ICP, and the rest of the garbage.

These movies are awful. Spenser driving a Ford Probe, are you nuts. The only recognizable characters from the series are Spenser and Hawk. The shrink, the cops all different. A lot of it didn't even seem to have been filmed in Boston (perhaps Toronto). Plots were predictable, dialogue stilted, acting was wooden. I wouldn't pay $1 for these movies. Need to get the old series on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Robert Urich as Spenser!","review":"I am so happy to be able to see Robert Urich as Spenser again! I would prefer the television series to the movies for television, but I will take what I can get. I have read all of Parker's books. Hawk and Spenser as personified in the series are a perfect fit. Susan is the one I never thought they got right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spencer for Hire movies","review":"The movies were pretty good.

I thought I remembered a TV series a couple of decades ago that I didn't particularly enjoy (but I hadn't discovered the books at that time.) I enjoyed all four of the movies but the first two were better. Wendy Crewson was terribly miscast as Susan. I hadn't seen the Spenser, for Hire DVDs when I watched these four movies so I thought the woman playing Susan in the first two was perfectly fine. After purchasing the Spenser, for Hire DVDs, however, and seeing Barbara Stock in the Susan Silverman role I have to say that she was the best. By the way, the Spenser, for Hire DVDs that I purchased were of very poor quality. There were 17 discs and over 1/2 of them were damaged. Disc 16 was a duplicate of disc 15. So yes, Warner, let's have a quality production of this great series. P.S. Does anyone know why the Susan Silverman character is missing from Season Two?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spenser, Spenser Where are you?","review":"The four movies in this collection are based upon books written by Robert Parker. However, the movies are far from quality of the books which provide their foundation and the production values for the movies are rather limited and seem to take advantage of convenient settings. A major missing element is the humor one expects from Spenser and the plots while close to the book are rather predictable.The original TV series was much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spenser doesn't fail to please","review":"Having read most of Robert B Parkser's books, it was a natural progression to be curious about the Spenser TV and Movie series. I can't believe I never watched them, being a kid of the 70's. I found the movies to be a bit campy, as they should have been, and they were great fun to watch. They were authentic Robert B Parker stories and well worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spenser for Hire - the Movie Collection","review":"The movies don't even come close to touching the quality of the TV series. Spenser and Hawk seem like tired caricatures of themselves and Susan doesn't add anything to the mix. In fact, the movies would be better without her. If they ever put the TV series on DVD, I'd love to have it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Big Joke........","review":"I was at a local indie record store when I happened upon this DVD. I had heard that this video was \\"disturbing, violent\\" etc so I decided to give it a try. Once I got home my wife and I sat down to watch \\"Devils Experiment\\". Almost immediately I was sick to my stomach, not from the gore (or lackthereof), but from the fact that I had actually paid for this movie!!!!!!!!Devils Experiment is about as real looking as pro wrestling, which isn't saying much.

This boy was born to sing Country!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Knew he could do it!","review":"I must brag and say that I saw something in Bucky, during his idol time, that not everyone else had. He needed some training as far as performing, but oh my! that raspy sexy voice! My favorite song is \\"I'm Good\\". Wow - what a charmer of a song that is. I love blasting it and singing along. Really so many great songs on this - it is a must for a country fan - and even for someone like me - more a rock lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best I Ever Had","review":"Bucky Covington's self titled CD is the only CD I have ever listened to that I truly enjoy every single on it. I listen to it over and over and never get tired of hearing it. His first single from it, \\"A Different World\\", is approaching Top 5 on the Country Charts. I cannot wait to hear what his second single to be released will be. I think \\"Its Good to Be Us\\" may be it, followed by \\"I'll Walk\\" as a third release. Of course, when attending live concerts with Bucky, the crowd always loves \\"I'm Good\\". See, I love the whole album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Country Music","review":"I enjoy this CD, I owned it before but it came up missing one day. It was nice that I could replace it, I really missed listening to it. I hope He comes out with a new one soon. I first learned about his music on CMT, I enjoyed it so much that I had to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shamanism and dream power","review":"This book relates the author's 30+ years of interaction with guides in the mystical world of the Toltec and Maya and discusses the power of the healing energies that may be applied in healing and transforming the world.A meeting with the writer William Burroughs was the catalyst for a journey to Mexico. Here she was taught by Don Juan Matus, the same shaman that mentored Carlos Castaneda as documented in his best selling books. After the initial apprenticeship with Matus she spent 12 years as a linguist and teacher before returning to the world of Toltec/Maya esotericism after an AIDS diagnosis.Her story makes interesting reading. The epilogue contains a novel view on four different categories of illness, the methods of discerning these and the proper treatments. This is a great book on shamanism, dream power, sorcery and healing that will definitely appeal to fans of the author Castaneda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor imitation of Castaneda","review":"Carlos Castaneda wrote a series of very well written books.....starting with a reasonably scientific, anthropological work in \\"The Teachings of Don Juan\\", and ending many books later in the realm of mythology. His books are eminently worth reading. This book, however, is nothing more than one woman's fantasy....trying to ride the coattails of Casteneda. It amazes me how many authors are continuing to invent more of Castaneda's Toltec \\"wisdom\\". I suspect Castaneda would be appalled, although he did go off the deep end at the end of his life, so perhaps he would have enjoyed the attention. In any case, if you are going to pursue a spiritual path, I would recommend that this is not the place to begin. Try something with some REAL history.....say Buddhism...or Sufism...or Yoga. Don't waste your valuable time on pseudo-Castaneda nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off the hook","review":"When I first started reading this book, I thought this is a stupid book. I decided to continue to read it because I hate to start a book and not finish it.This book put you in the mind of a true hustler. Pamela aka Carmen was a single mother trying to make it by any means necessary. She was in love with a man named Chino who refused to be the man that Carmen needed him to be. After their break-up and her going without she thought the best thing to do was become a hustler. Despite many adversitites Carmen became the best hustler in her area.If I was to tell you anymore I would be telling you the book. Buy it you won't be disappointed.I can't wait for the sequel to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no reason ...to waste time reading this book","review":"I really expected this to be a good book. It starts out slow and goes no where. The dialogue is very unconvincing from people who are supposed to be from the hood and keeping it real. The only reason that I finished this book was to see if it would eventually improve but unfortunately it did not. It's been a long time since I have read a book this bad. I hope the author has better luck with her next book...but that won't be a reason for me to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"unbelievable","review":"a friend of mine suggested I read this book. I had no idea abot what type of book it was, but figured it must be good because my friend has never really sat down and read a book. So, I sat down for a few minutes to read \\"Let That Be The Reason\\" and , before I knew it, I was about half way finised.While I do not ordinarily read \\"gansta\\" type books, I was intrigued with \\"Let That Be The Reason\\" so much so that I read the sequel \\"Imagine This\\" the very next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"What exactly IS the reason?","review":"If you are looking for an engaging read, this is not the book for you. All the wrong aspects of the story are drawn out and those that should be discussed in lively detail are rushed along in a paragraph or so. If you like novels that get to the point but do so in an intriguing, suspenseful or worthwhile manner, let Vicky Stringer's novel be the reason you find something else to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"LET THAT BE THE DAMN REASON!!!!!!","review":"this book was off the damn chain wit it. i liked this book cause it showed a different side of the \\"game\\" ! from a womens view. carmen did her thang no doubt and she made sure she did hers so dat her son didnt want fa nothin. this book kept me on my heels all the way through. i read this book within a two day period and i would recommend it to anyone. now let that be the reason this book is at the top of ya must read book list ! thats wassup"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"I accidently came across the novel after meeting the author at an Expo in Chicago. Unfortunatley, the book which is touted to be a gritty, urban tale was a little stiff, especially the dialogue, and lost its focus at times. Sometimes the character's actions were completely off-base, and the ending was totally rushed. The introduction of vital characters toward the end of the book was a crucial mistake as I wondered, where the heck does he/she fit in? This could have used a better editor and I only finished because I make it a habit of finishing every book I start. I hope Ms. Stringer does better on the next round."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let this be the reason not to buy this book.................","review":"I brought this book back in 2002. Dotn ask why am I just now writing a review. But I must say 10 years later and I never finished this book. I think I still have my copy of it. I tried and tried but it made me dizzy and I just couldnt finish........ I have never brought another book from this author since. That is all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it alright","review":"its okay, i liked the sequel better, but it was cool with the way the character carmen or pam was. as in the type of person and heart she had but all the stuff i just couldnt get into i was disapointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I Guess it did have a slow start but it did eventually pick up. I really respect Vicky for putting her sh*t down the way she did. Being that this is an Novel and she may have had to embellish a little she still kept it true to life. Personally she (Pammy) was way too Naive as far as Chino. Every woman with a split between her legs has had a Chino but, enough is enough!! I would have Been a snitch to save and be with my child and thats called the code of mama... There is NO loyalty in the Game. It is what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth your while","review":"I really enjoyed reading Let That Be The Reason. I think it was a very good book and the author did a outstanding job putting her thoughts on paper to create a crediable novel. The thing I enjoyed most about the book was that it was fact based and it didnt have a fariy-tale ending, since we all know that isnt how things go in real life. It was good to see a females view on the da game. Carmen was jut trying to make it in life, and that is why most people enter da game in the first place. Only when it is time to face the consquences, do people start to think about the decisions they have made. Ms. Stringer had a wonderful debut novel, and I will be awaiting the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"What the H***","review":"I lie this book and then I don't like this book. Want to know why well my reason for saying this because of how the some of the main vharacters madw me sick. I just felt like putting the book down and walking away but I finished, and glad I finished but thought it was a lot better than it was hyped up to be. BIG up's to Ms. Stringer she locked down and still doing BIG thangs.Read By choice"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let That Be the Reason","review":"This book was good, however, I think the author was hustling the readers by ending the book when it was really getting interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"O.K BOOK","review":"THIS BOOK WAS OKIT IS ABOUT A WOMAN WHO HITS ROCK BOTTOM AFTER HER DRUG DEALINH BOYFRIEND LEAVES HER, SINCE HE TOOK EVERYTHING ALL SHE HAD WAS HER SON AND NOTHING ELSE.

I am usually the one who reads a book nonstop, without putting it down. This one, NOT! Ive had this book for almost a week now and I still havent finished it. Ive actually jumped a few chapters and just started reading Chino's return to her life hoping for a bit of excitement.I am a fan of African American authors and I support them all and give them credit where its due, but this book isnt all that. This is one time I can truly say I didnt agree with the reviews given by my fellow Amazon shoppers.I give this book a 1 out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Elementary!","review":"I'm sorry Ms. Stringer, but Let That Be the Reason was not believable at all to me and style of writing was more kidish than what I'm used to. The only thing I liked about this novel was the \\"self-love\\" message the author portrayed. Other than that, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Read","review":"It took me forever to read this book because it simply wasn't interesting. I don't like not finifshing books, so I finished it. It was one of many books passed out to the women at the shelter where I work. I thought it would be a good read, but it is not written very well and though the story is somewhat interesting...Stringer feels the need to explain the meaning of every ghetto or \\"hood\\" lingo or slang, some of which I had no original clue, but most which I was already aware of and explaining it on almost every page just began to annoy me. I do not recommend this book as a good read, but if you do get it, sheer curiousity will keep you turning the pages...mostly \\"Could this possibly get any worse?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST AWFUL","review":"I have read a lot of Triple Crown books and I've enjoyed most of them so I would have thought that the women that started the company would have been a great writer. WRONG! This book was just long and drawn out way to far. It was just repetitive. Its like when something happens and you have to repeat the story five different times to five different people and you get tired of telling the story. Well I was tired of hearing it. I didn't even finish the book and I hate to start something and not finish it. I just couldn't torture myself any further. Then the author had a never to release a part 2 to the book. OH HELL NO! Saying I was not happy with this book at all is being kind. I absolutely HATED IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Interesting","review":"I read this book because I enjoyed Vickie Stringer's Dirty Red series. But Let That Be The Reason does not even compare. The plot wasn't good at all. The authour kept repeating the same thing over and over. I did not like it at all and I'm so glad that I did not pay for this book - I got it from the library. I believe that Ms. Stringer could do a way better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"let this be reason not to read this book","review":"This book is so very poorly written its starts off very good and goes down hill fast. It seem like the book deadline was coming fast so she just started wrighting stuff to have the book in on time. she reapets things over and over, there are to many contradictions and its just stops making any sence after a while. Its just bad dont waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just AWFULLLLLLLLLLLL","review":"This was my first time reading a book by this author and it will be my last! This was thee worst book that I have every read. Let That BE The Reason no one else suffers though this book. I understand that this is fiction, but I know women in the game that are single mother n trust and believe that if a deadbeat that never did anything for your son and after you put him on he still does nothing and You keep suppling him so that his other family can eat just isn't going to happen. She was so dumb that it was unreal.

There is absolutely no comparison to be made, \\"Winter\\" was incredibly well written and this author is still fine tuning her skills.

Except for the fact that all three recorded in Paris, there appears to be little connection.

June Richmond, accompanied by the Quincy Jones Orchestra, sings \\"I've Got a Right to Sing the Blues\\" through \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\". Excellent renditions all.

They do have an aggressive sound to them but the guitar work is too interesting to sound anything like your run of the mill tough-guy hardcore. The song structures are also more complex than your normal metalcore bands & there are also more time signature changes within the songs. My only complaint is the riffs on a couple of the songs I find a little annoying and some people may find the vocals annoying.standout tracks - bring out your dead, american hollow, misery dance, valley of solitudeThe 'bouncy' breakdown bit at the end of 'bring out your dead' just kicks ass and the drumming is great too"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Band","review":"Martyr AD is one of the most uniquie Hardcore bands. They have the extreme heavieness of Slayer and a few gothenburg type of riffs that would remind you of In Flames at certain points. Though, they do not use harmonizing which band's such as In Flames and At The Gates do, they are heavier. It's perfect music to mosh or to break things to. Pure aggression at it's best. The only bad things I could say about this album is that it does not contain any guitar solos and it's very short. I'm hoping to see this band evolve more and maybe adding a few guitar solos. There are a few spots where you think of Dillinger Escape Plan. Not as chaotic and excellent as DEP but a few riffs remind of them. Buy this record if you like Killswitch Engage or Slayer. The vocals are a bit more harsh than Slayer. Typical Hardcore vocals. It's a good Cd to listen to while your driving or trying to stay awake."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLY GENERIC BUT DAMN GOOD","review":"These guys are nothing new, are not aggresive, and are not heavy.

I ended up choosing Project 8, because of the price and people didn't seem to like Proving Ground. I was horribly disappointed with this game. First of all, you can't disable auto-kick, which is a huge let down for anyone who actually skates. Also, the semi-realistic scaling achieved in THUG, has seem to disappear completely. Second, they removed some of the most iconic skaters from the game, THPS without Reynolds, gimme a break. Third, the game is rated T for teen, but game play seems to have been created with children in mind. I would definitely not recommend this to anyone who skates, or is over the age of 12."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Tony Hawk's Project 8 tries to go back to the basics of what made the first games so likable, while still keeping a \\"story\\" for those who thought that was a good addition.

In holding true to the Tony Hawk's series you can string together tons and tons of tricks and there are even a few new ones that you haven't been able to do in previous games to rack up points, to complete goals, to eventually become one of the top 8 skaters and join Tony Hawk's new crew.

All they could have added perhaps would have been some clips/vocal bits: might have been nice to 'set up' the pieces on this CD. For more of that, we'll all have to wait until the movie is out on DVD, but we'll probably all buy that too...For example they could have had Homer singing 'Spider Pig' and then the orchestral version.

Not awesome as in the generic way that the term has been driven into the ground, but literally this album leaves you in awe after listening to it. It encompasses every possible human emotion from the eerie start to the tear jerking Faded. If you want balls to the wall, badass rock and roll, Honky's Ladder will fit the bill better than ANYTHING that Korn or Limp Bizkit have ever put out. The Afghan Whigs are the greatest rock band in existence, and Greg Dulli has a voice that is beyond compare. I could write over the 1,000 word maximum singing the praises of this album, but I will digress and leave it up to you to buy this album and listen to it as often as possible, I promise you will never get sick of it. Hell, while you're at it, buy two copies, one for your car and one for your house. My favorite CD of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"faded\\" takes your breath away","review":"I had the pleasure of getting to see the Whigs live in Cincinnati on Saturday night, and as usual, it was an incredible show! They opened with a cover of \\"The Boys Are Back In Town,\\" so you knew we were in for something special. They played a lot of \\"Black Love\\" material, and I have to admit I forgot how great an album it is. I think the whole is not as good as the sum of its parts, but each individual song is amazing. Hearing \\"faded\\" live was like listening to a church choir, or watching two people dancing to a jukebox long after last call has come and gone - it just blows you away. It's not as smooth as \\"Gentlemen\\" (in my top 10 albums ever), but hearing those songs again showed me what I had been missing - PICK IT UP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not enough can be said","review":"Quite possibly the greatest album of the 90's. An amazing combination of raw emotion, power, and soul. Before the 1965 tour, Greg Dulli said it was mentally unhealthy for him to perform some of these songs live. One listen and you'll understand. It still depresses me to think of how this album and this band went almost completely unnoticed by the general public."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated Moody Classic","review":"I absolutely agree with Mr. Clifford's review, I love this album and feel that the whigs really came into their own with this one. Greg Dulli is a wonderful lyricist and writer, I was so happy with this album I went out after hearing of the Twilight Singers album (their first one) and was really let down. I heard a song off Blackberry Belle and fell for it imediately, thought \\"man he has come back to this album's sound, awesome!\\". I have not picked up the Blackberry album yet, it will be my next purchase however. I have every Whigs album with the exception of Congregation, and I love them all, mostly all... Gentlemen is great but in different ways, this album with all it's dark narrative and moody, languishing crying out for forgiveness, haunting beauty I definitely give it a Fiver. It is truly a classic carved into it's own category which I challenge anyone to compare this sound and writing to?

Let's bring the guys back and make a Twilight/Whigs tour out of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a \\"Desert Island Top 5\\"!","review":"The Afghan Whigs are one of the most underrated bands of all time. Dulli shines on his own with the Twilight Singers project, but was at his peak when working with the Whigs. In my most humble opinion, this album was the pinnacle of their career. I am a fan of every one of their albums, but Black Love really brings out the intensity that they were best known for. No Whigs fan should be without this record. Anyone looking to discover something new should buy this on FIRST! Most whigs fans will insist that Gentlemen is the album that should be first purchased (and it was the first I bought), but this is my review, so f**k off.

The 777 segment reuses much of the same content and has many glaring errors where the voiceover does not match the video. For example: the British Hermes airliner is discussed as footage of a Lockheed Constellation is shown, and the manufacturing process of the 777 is discussed while showing footage of a 747 under construction. It's obvious that the producers of the 777 segment did not bother to research their subject matter and merely hacked the show together with footage they had available to them.

Unlike some who found issue with the dialect, to me it was one of the facets that brought this tale to life.

While the other 10% (The bad guys - If you have ever seen the movie Fallen with Denzel Washington, the bad guy is book and movie have the same power to touch and take over a body) knows about it and uses their brand of magic to dominate the world. In fact the want to control the re-emerging magic.The book is fast pace, but it does get confusing at times. The action is most believeable.

If you once had a chance to have a glimpse to the inside of this book in a bookstore, just looked up what you want and left the book on the bookshelf.

Never ever give MIRAMAX distribution rights as they will censor/cut it. The cuts are painfully obvious yet unnecessary.

I was amazed and outraged, as that scene, as originally played, could easily be included among the best love scenes of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Linus Roache in a Performance of a Lifetime","review":"Anyone who can appreciate superb acting will marvel as Linus Roache's turn as the title character, a priest whose very life is up-ended as he confronts his inner truth and sexuality. Roache infuses his character with charm, grace and wit, while at the same time becoming everyman....not an easy accomplishment by any stretch considering how distant most religious figures are to the general population. The film soars perhaps today more than ever before, due to the relevance of its topic, especially as the Chuch itself confronts unseeming topics like child sexual abuse and the sexuality of its chosen leaders. A heartbreaking, emotional film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart warming...","review":"As a gay man planning to train in the Anglican Church, I was deeply deeply moved by this film. I watched it with my partner and afterwards was so overcome by despair I bawled my eyes out and gave the best \\"spontanious sermon\\" I've ever done. I identified so closely with Fr. Greg, knowing how he felt, not being able to help a girl whose life is very endangered, not being able to love with a completely free conscience. All I was able to say to my boyfriend (a Catholic) was, \\"There but for the grace of God go I,\\" for homosexuality is not, thankfully, a problem in the Episcopal Church.

Usually while watching I either get bored (if the characters face religion in a wimpy way) or get upset/angry if I am being beaten to death with a Bible. I have never found a story that made me feel comfortable and eager to explore more. The difference to me in this film was the referencing of the two (2) types of \\"rules\\" when it comes to religion. The \\"Rules\\" based on God's Laws and the \\"Rules\\" based on Man's Laws.Now I clearly see the simplicity of God's Laws and the negative, self-serving, bigoted and unhumanely torturous Laws created by Man. The latter, sometimes under the guise of \\"poor interpretation\\" or the Religion Steamroller overtaking people who wish to enjoy religion, but don't want to be herded through their lifes following preposterious, man made rules.This film has made quite an impression on me (could you tell?).Linus Roache could get me on my knees in a snap! <tic>"},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE SPEECH","review":"\\"Priest opened after it was originally scheduled for a Good Friday debut. The Disney-Miramax film not only showed five priests with serious problems, it also placed responsibility for their dysfunction on the Church. Two priests were having affairs, one with a woman, the other, with a man. A third priest was a drunk, another was psychotic, and the bishop was evil and cruel. There was not one well-adjusted priest in the film. The Church was depicted as the cause of all the troubles; the celibacy requirement was targeted. Stereotypes abounded which served to stigmatize the Church and presented it as contemptible and destructive.

I can scarcely believe that people are sidding with this morally reprehensible man. I was hopping the entire movie the congregants would reject him for his two faced hyporcrisy. I don't know.

Thielemans plays terrific jazz guitar licks, there is no harmonica but some whistling now and there. Compared to Montgomery, Reinhardt etc. this guy maybe was too laid back to become a star but in many ways his playing is far more listenable than most of others due to an atmosphere between musicians involved that clearly states teamwork instead of competition.

Personally I love it, with the exception of one or two tunes (P.C. Keen, most notably). The more mainstream style would seem to mirror the Levs settling down a bit in their old adage, but as they've always said, \\"Home is where you make it\\", and if that's what they choose... the protests are still there, particularly in the vitriolic Hope Street and Maid of the River, but it seems the band is settling down to enjoy themselves, and credit to them if this is the result.

Tracks 2 - 5 have a good beat but were is all the singing, you have to wait like 3 mins into the instrumental part until they start singing, but these tracks would probably be good to dance to in a club. the last track number 6, is horrible it is 2 mins and 9 secs long and their is NO singing at the end of the track they just sing \\"cause you wanna take my picture\\" and the the track is over!

He is wandering around his neighborhood late at night, hoping to get ideas for his novel. When he sits on a bench, a young fellow named Bradley has a marvelous idea for a novel. The name of the novel is The Feast of Love.This is a wonderful piece of literature. It vaguely resembles Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, except that this novel is utterly contemporary. The novel is about love. The author explores different kinds of human relationships. There's Bradley: the hopeless romantic; there's Harry Gingsberg: an old philosopher with a troubled son; then there's Chloe and Oscar: the young, wild lovers. Chloe and Oscar touched me; their love was so pure that it made me cry.This novel is breathtakingly beautiful. I love the language; the characters' voices are very expressive. I highly recommend this novel. Now run along and get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait until it comes out in paperback...","review":"Mildly entertaining but there is not enough substance to engage the reader. The one interesting character was a young employee of the protagonist. The character of the protagonist was not fleshed out at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Feast, Not a Snack...It Is A Scrap","review":"The characters in this book are memorable, but generally not believable. If it weren't for the genuine, sad Jewish couple who's son torments them in his insanity, I would have thrown out this book without finishing. The teenage character Chloe's dialogue is sometime profound, but so out-of-character, the words become ridiculous. There is more hate and discord in this book than love.Charles Baxter's attempt to align himself with William Shakespeare's \\"Midsummer Night's Dream\\" is a shameless attempt at greater book sales. Mr. Baxter's opinion of the value of his own writing is shocking.Most books I read I pass on to friends when I'm finished. This one went into the recycling."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this were a bathtub, you couldn't drown in it...","review":"Vraiment! On beyond light or even lite.

A guy's wife leaves him to become lesbian...then his next wife leaves him to be with a previous lover. So sad. A girl's wonderful husband dies but fortunately she just knows that she'll someday meet a reincarnated version of him...oh how wonderful, why can't we all be so romantic?It's basically a book about stupid people doing stupid things and believing they've found something profound. You can sympathize with the characters but don't expect to find them reasonable human beings."},{"rating":"1","title":"When marketing is more important than substance","review":"The only justification for the glowing reviews for this book must be that the publisher is trying to push the writer.This book was read by myself and my monthly book club, after being suggested by the local bookstore owner.

The rest should never have left the editor's desk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, if a bit light.","review":"I found this book to be entertaining, if not particularly deep.

The author could nor decide which story he wanted to tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Playful ensemble piece w/ interesting character development.","review":"The book reminds me of a well done Robert Altman film. The story is background to the development of character in an ensemble environment. In the end, the sum is greater than the pieces.Essentially this is a series of intertwined short stories concerning the intersection of lives and love in a smallish town, the sort of place where even after on has loved and lost the former love is still part of the scene and a major intersect point in the carrying on of life. There are no \\"deep revelations\\" and the book never orients itself to judge the nature of love--seemingly a major failing if you read previous reviews. (I find it hard to condemn an effort for not accomplishing something it never set out to do, but whatever.) This is a deft and engaging effort that I think most folks-if they will only accept it for what it is and portends to be--highly engaging beach fare--will like enormously, as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Moving Novel","review":"I just finished this book last night and found it to be the most moving book I have read in a long time.

It's condescending, big time, especially towards the female and younger characters. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Please","review":"If you like your sentiments heavy-handed and your cliches in great big servings, this is the novel for you. I have to admit, I put it down on page 107, figuring that if, after a hundred pages, I had not read a single thought I couldn't have read on a Hallmark card, I wasn't going to waste any more of my time. My advice to those who are thinking of reading this novel: Try thinking about love as shallowly as you possibly can for a few hours instead. It will be the same in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is about infatuation and self-serving love.","review":"This book is badly titled. It is as if a gifted junior high or high school student had written it. Naturally, he deserves an A in English Composition, and naturally the other school students will think it's cool. But this book says nothing about love and responsibility as shared by adults. Amusing, yes. Profound, no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled and Masticated","review":"Some books are truly repugnant to deserve a well-written review. But this book is just plain boring.

I wished I could've spent the time reading this book ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Ann Arbor","review":"I enjoyed this book quite a bit, but I think I particularly enjoyed it because it clearly takes place in Ann Arbor, where I live. I could envision all the settings about which he wrote, the neighborhood park he visited at night, the stadium, and the drive across town after the football game. The characters he describes are all very true to the college town that Ann Arbor is. His writing style keeps me engaged. I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"abit confusing to read","review":"this story drug along a bit much for me and it is rather confusing to read. i couldn't quite get a grip on the story until midway through the book and i know i am not illiterate and i'm even a college grad. i really liked the book after 1/2 way through, but what kind of enjoyment of reading is that?!most of the other reviewers liked this book a lot, so i'm definitely in the minority here, so maybe you should read this and see if i'm not being fair. with all of the serious happenings and insecurities of this past month, i'm probably just not myself. but this is certainly not one of my favorite books."},{"rating":"2","title":"It makes you wonder...","review":"The book's point is that we all deal with our problems and loves in very different ways... This book was amazing and demonstrated how Baxter can write from the perspective of an 18 year old to a 65 year old. It is the difference in style combined with the different experiences that make this book alive. Baxter has some very deep insights about how we deal with life and love, and he has pretty good points. I recommend this book for anyone who has been or is into a relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Terrible","review":"The writing is banal & the characters are barely one dimensional. The plot(such as it is...)is a poor attempt to modernize Shakespear. It's like a poorly pieced together puzzle (in that nothing seems to fit). The relationships between the characters seems forced. I paid $1.00 for this book & I was grossly overcharged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called the \\"feast of sex'","review":"The book has an interesting structure and the writing is solid. However, many of the characters (especially the women) don't ring true. The story is very focused on the sex that transpires beteween the characters...which can be related to love but isn't the same thing. He doesn't flesh the relationships to what I'd describe as love, so the whole story struck me as shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"never coheres, never believable","review":"too bad. i've read stories by baxter that i've liked. but this never reached me, and i was never sure that the author was really in control of what he was trying to do. who's the lead character here, for instance? the so-called \\"punkette,\\" chloe? she comes across as more like an older male's fantasy than as someone breathing and real. the whole book is marred by some cartoonish touches, such as having a character named bradley who also has a dog named bradley... it's not that meaningful or cute. the more i consider it, this book really ends up being small potatoes [an expression i don't normally use]."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read","review":"This is a conglomeration of stories related to the author by friends, neighbors, ex's, & acquaintances about their current situations in life. Some of the stories are very sad in a strange way. Not the crying, gut wrenching sad, but more like \\"how sad that their life has come to this\\". The characters are wonderfully written, easy to care about, & their stories will touch your heart, and genuinely have you wanting to help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"The reviewers have promised more than Charles Baxter can deliver. These are not real people. Nobody talks this way.There's something sad about about a tight-laced, uber-midwestern, middle-aged man trying to invent a couple of madcap stoner kids; in the first place I doubt that the way to become a love-happy laid-back dude is to have an evil, drunken, sex offender for a father.The ending of this book (and yes, it is too a novel) is both predictable and disappointing. You will not fail to note the page upon which we are invited to cry. You will also note (if you please) the page upon which we are to feel uplifted at long last.I do not recommend this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enlarged Heart","review":"One of Baxter's characters suffers from an enlarged heart, and that's what this reader suffered too after reading The Feast of Love; pangs of sorrow hit me hard in the concluding chapters. Baxter chronicles the love stories of several of our neighbors in a voice like an aging Holden Caufield's. Somehow Baxter's hypnotic prose moves us to realize the wisdom of both Soren Kierkegaard and a roadside psychic in the character of a clerk in a suburban mall coffee shop. And the Michigan setting is perfect--from the moonlit 50-yard line in the U. of M. stadium to the ill-fated honeymoon up north. Reading this novel was a wondrous experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful feast for reading!","review":"I really liked this! It seemed quirky at first, but as I continued the interweaving of the stories are more real and lifelike than any other I've read. Baxter spins the tales of the seemingly unconnected people - and you find yourself traveling the threads and realizing the connectedness of everyone. The humour of love is barely concealed beneath the surface of what initially seems like a series of bad love mistakes. I enjoyed every word of this novel and while I would have wished for a 'happier' ending I was not disappointed in the least. The humans are real and fallible and even the dogs are amusing. Highly recommend this excellent story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it at all","review":"I read it as this was our bookclub choice for the month. 5 out of 6 of us disliked it. I actually had to force myself to finish it, as I try to finish all the books I start, and needed to for the club. The characters were flat, underdeveloped. We noted that Charles Baxter seems to have difficulty writing in a woman's voice. His 2 wives were potentially interesting, but were notfleshed out enough to understand. The only characters that felt \\"real\\" were the Ginsbergs. After reading the glowing description of the book, I felt deceived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story...Difficult to follow","review":"This was not a book that I looked foward to reading and finishing, but I did finish it. The first 3/4 of this novel was dry and very hard to follow, in my opinion. The last few chapters were real interesting and enjoyable to read, so instead of 1 star, I gave this book 2 stars.This novel seemed like a survey, of sorts, about relationships, commitment, and love between different couples of different generations. That was interesting but I find it hard to enjoy a book that is so difficult to know which couple is narrating, since it switched back and forth alot.This is not one of my favorites and it's not a book that I tell my friends \\"you just have to read this\\".Based on the other reviewers, I'm in the minority with my review. I do admire authors that will step out on a limb and write a little bit differently. I liked the story but I wasn't fond of the way the book was written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banal","review":"It should have been written in third person, as all the characters sound alike anyway.

I was surfing Amazon one sleepless night a few weeks ago and the title caught my eye. When it arrived, I read it in about a week and a half. (I'm a busy gal.) The author has a different approach to writing, which I like. I didn't know what to expect when I read this book. I'm glad I selected the book on the title alone. It lived up to it 100%.

This package has clips of a slightly better quality than others I have ordered, though that is relative, since the films are about 100 years old and show it. Still, the point of buying these films is to see what people did with the film medium during its early years and how Edison tried to sell the idea of moving pictures to a public that did not know what to expect.

When I finally called it quits and washed the silver under hot water, I found that I had achieved some cleaning but nothing I would call a polish.

I bought this tape for my 15 month old. She really loved the More Barney Songs video. I bought this one to add to her collection, we all sat down to watch it - when Barney started to talk, he sounded like Elmer Fudd!! Anyhow, 5 minutes into the video, my daughter got up and went to her room and played with her toys.

I don't like to use the word \\"timeless\\" when describing music, but that is what this album is. All of the music is straight forward Rock N' Roll.You can hear the influence of the Beatles, Big Star, Husker Du, Cheap Trick, the Kinks, et al. and you can still hear a sound that is all their own.If you haven't heard their music before, this is a good album to start off with."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is AWESOME!!!","review":"Well, if you know what Enigma, Era, Pilgrimage and Adiemus are (and like them), then this album is definitely for you.

Quite strange, this cd is little known even here in Europe, but, believe me, it deserves proud stand near Era and Enigma. By the way , the subtitle of this cd is \\"A storm of dreams\\".

The craziness of the mother-in-law, the bigotry on both sides of the \\"odar\\" presence, the genocide by history, and all the quirks I as an \\"odar\\" often see from the outside looking in. I think back to my daughter dating an Armenian man and his mother loath at the idea he could potentially marry a non-Armenian girl.The story, characters and background make for a fulfilling read.

And 'High School Confidential', is, and always was, a little gem. Big-time film director Atom Egoyan used it in one of his movies not so long ago. It still gets radio airtime 25 years later. You can evaluate music on a technical scale - can they sing? Are the cord progession interesting? Can you dance to it? You can also evaluate it by it's impact - Did it touch people?

I rarely cook because I hate the smell that lingers around. The other night I made seafood and the smell was horrible. This air purifier removed it up within 2 hours. It has a sensor and the speed of the fan kicks on when it detectors odor. I have it 24/7 and we will see if it lives up to my expectation.

Unlike the Winix, it has a dust sensor in addition to the odor sensor. Also better than the Winix, it has a handle designed into the top, making it much easier to move around. The charcoal filter means business - it contains actual charcoal, rather than a charcoal-coated plastic mesh.

I read at least five books a week, and this rates on my top 10. I snap up copies in second-hand stores and occasionally find a new one to buy (or order). I am dismayed that the publisher has let it go out of print again. This is a book that you can open at any page and find something to delight you. Blue is the saddest mood, but reading about the blues here, even when your own blues are so blue they're black, will cheer you up. If you're already in an up mood, you'll go even higher.

One of the large bottles leaked slightly via the cap despite being tightly closed, staining a t-shirt. This is the only reason I did not give 5 stars. I suggest filling them a couple hours early and laying them out on paper towels or a white hotel towel as a test before loading them in your luggage. I definitely plan on using these again!

I had played the demo and found it fairly amusing, but I can tell you that the game gets old really fast. The first few levels aren't too difficult, and the game was fairly interesting. As the game progressed, however, it got more and more difficult and I got more and more bored. It was not uncommon for me to lose most or all of my sheep to cows in armor, grinding machines, or comets. The sheep were incredibly stupid and resisted my attempts to herd them. I assumed that I would get better the longer I played, so I kept trying. However, the game didn't prove interesting enough to justify my time and effort.

That stuff I still have trouble with.I got these cause I had a ton of questions about how stuff works. And they break it down. I had done well in Physics before, but this was a whole new ball game. The mathematics is not explained especially well, but the physics behind it is.

When I disconnected the SUA750 from the power grid and it switched to battery, it did NOT provide a perfect sine wave output. The crests and troughs were flattened for approx. 10% of the voltage amplitude (top and bottom each). Along with the flattening there was a small ripple on the leading edges. If APC is going to charge a premium for SmartUPS's they should step up the quality of the output.

Maybe in a year or two I will give it another watch but no time soon. So if you big fans of there's and want to support what they do, I guess pick it up and make your own judgement on it but otherwise I would recommend staying away. It's not really any different than there around the town videos (which you can watch anytime on youtube) besides the fact that they go across the country.

For myself, my collection could not be complete without this movie. My love of music and history are both completely satisfied with this movie. The acting all round is very well done. I'm a 56 year old man who can not get throught the speach that the \\"Governor\\" gives in the final scene without sheading a tear, usually several tears and going through several tissue also.

Richard Dreyfuss does a great job playing the part of Mr. Holland. My mother told me to watch it because she knew I would get a good lesson from it. I watched it and learned that life is not always what you want it to be. Instead of putting focus on one goal in life, this movie shows that in every little obstacle in life there is something rewarding in it.....it may not be what you wanted or expected, but take it and make the best of it....one day you'll look back and will be thankful for everything that happened......good and bad. This movie is a great reminder to enjoy what you have.

I bought the soundtrack and after listening to it several times; I decided to start looking around for the movie.

Very awesome movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Do Guys Cry at the Movies? Watch this one; You'll know!","review":"In 1965, Glenn Holland is aspiring composer who needs to pay the bills for himself and his photographer wife. He winds up taking a job as a music teacher at the local high school. As usual, one thing leads to another (she get's pregnant, the road gets a little farther away) and he seems to be stuck there. Then, to make it worse, their son (the light in Glenn's eyes) is discovered to be deaf. What seems like defeat after defeat is continuously becoming just another way for Holland's devotion to music and kids (even, in a very unexpected way, his own, deaf son) to shine through.Yeah, this hard-core \\"macho\\" geek was moved to cry at the end, when the Gov shows up at the recital. So shoot me. It's STILL a great flick, even if it isn't John Wayne or Star Wars (wow, there's a combination...nahhhh)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tubas are for fat guys with pimples","review":"I must say, this is one of the best movies ive ever seen! Not many movies or shows portray band as a good thing. For example American Pie Band Camp, That 70's Show, etc. And the opus at the end is one of the most amazing songs ive ever heard. And refering to the person who left a review before me... To me and most people in band, music is more important than core classes and funding SHOULD be provided by the school. My band has to fund itself, meaning the students have to pay to be in marching band, and we have to do fundraisers to collect much needed money. Its like trying to run a theme park on $100 a week.Anyway, i would recommend this movie to anyone who loves band and/or music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart Warming Movie","review":"I just can't say enough about this movie. It is one of my favorites and the soundtrack is hot too. Everytime I see it I just feel good. It's an amazing movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre film","review":"First, the good thing about this movie: I think that it has called to people's attention the great dedication that many music teachers have for their work. It also may have raised people's consciousnesses about the lack of funding and support for public school music programs. There are some funny and touching moments in this issue.And then the bad: It's Hollywood, and it's cheesy. All of us who have struggled with a musical instrument know that you don't really get THAT MUCH better by \\"playing the sunset.\\" The good-bye concert for Mr. Holland is also cheesy, as is the idea of a lovely young high school student falling in love with old Richard Dreyfuss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fail.","review":"The good: some of the acting.The bad: everything else. Especially the titular musical work. Hordes of composition students could've hit this one out of the park, and would've done it for free, but instead they paid gobs of cash to Michael Kamen, who decided to suck. Seriously, the \\"Opus\\" he wrote as Mr. Holland's proxy, should have come in a white can w/ black letters reading \\"music.\\" In other words, generic as can be. If I spent my whole life working on that piece of trash, like Holland supposedly did, I'd stab myself in the eye with my conductor's baton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy, Vapid, and a Little Creepy","review":"OK, let's see. Mr. Holland is a neglectful, sullen, and resentful father, who diminishes his son because of his deafness, and neglects his wife in favor of his obsession with completing his decidedly mediocre \\"opus.\\" He also develops an inappropriate relationship with a female student; while there may not have been physical contact, he also obsesses on her, and actually entertains the idea of running off to New York with her. Later, forced out of teaching (maybe due to his attitude problem?) his alumni all gather for a tribute concert, where the opus is revealed in all of its unfortunate banality.

And it's a movie that reminded me of how much we ask of our educators and teachers.And I think most folks can identify with the lead character. Who really feels 100% certain that they are living thir life to its fullest potential? Mr. Holland is plagued with doubts that he has wasted his life, but when he takes a few steps backwards and looks over the landscape of his life, he sees his life was immeasurably successful.I loved it.

With Richard Dreyfuss (\\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\") in the leading role, the story spans a 30 year time period in the changed life of the teacher. The story is one most of us can relate to as we try to achieve our hopes and dreams. If we only realize the lives we are truly touching. The movie offers some unique transitions between the years including archived film footage and real-life events that changed our nation. While not based on a true story, it certainly could be. The only issue friends had with the movie was the speed with which the non-musical high school became an overnight sensation. Considering the fact the movie covers such an expanse of time, one's imagination must be employed to lay the timeline.

More importantly, however, the introduction of Jean Louisa Kelly's George Gershwin solos to movies -- particularly \\"Someone To Watch Over Me\\" -- is incredible, and just plain sensuous! I find myself drawn to hear her sing it over and over.

It teaches us that we all can make a difference in anothers life, no matter what your job or status is in life. Be the best that you can be! This movie is rated PG, and is not filled with gore, foul language, or explicit scenes that are demeaning to women.

What a disappointment. Dreyfuss is fine (though I don't think he deserved the Oscar nomination). The movie is treacle of the worst kind. I don't mind being manipulated by a film, but when that manipulation is so obvious, I just can't get past it. The harder they try to make me cry, the harder I resist. (Don't think I'm unfeeling; I bawled my eyes out at \\"Terms Of Endearment\\", \\"The Elephant Man\\" and many others). The whole subplot of the deaf son was unnecessary and there only to \\"tug at your heartstrings\\". Yuck.

So's the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbingly glib, this movie glosses over tragedy.","review":"While it portends to be an uplifting tale of a person drawn to teaching despite other aspirations, this movie glosses over the destruction of musical education in many parts of America by tacking on a Mickey Mouse ending where the audience is meant to cheer when it should be outraged. Mr. Holland's fate, in the end, is to be cast aside and denied the further pursuit of his life's work- teaching music to children and young adults in the public education system of America.In the end the students at Holland's school are deprived of music in their curriculum. A tragedy that is glossed over by the trivial festivities required by a Hollywood obsessed with the \\"bittersweet\\" ending.This movie infuriates me, and I do not recommend it to anyone of good conscience and good taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST, WORST, WORST Film","review":"Terrible in every way. Aweful acting, an insultingly stupid story, and horrible music. This movie is a parody of itself. The ultimate insult coming at the end when the \\"opus\\" is the worst piece of music ever written--the type of thing that would make a 'real' music teacher crawl out a window. I can't believe reviews on this site say this is a tribute to teachers. God forbid our schools would fill with more Mr. Hollands who hit on students and don't know anything about the subject they teach.

They've said it made them cry, and think. This movie didn't provoke a tear from me.I am not sure I'd attend classes that begin with rhetoric like 'What is music?' but Dreyfuss does a decent job of a quasi-inspiring teacher. Although this band master could be a little less mean when returning assignments.The acting overall in the film is pretty plain though, and the somewhat interesting premise gets old real quick.Some scenes are even borderline idiotic. First, our supposedly great teacher expects kids who don't know how to play their instruments to be playing Mozart after one day.Then, there is a scene where he is teaching a girl how to play her clarinet. She has been playing the thing for 3 years but still can't get out a note. He tells her to think of the sunset, and suddenly she can play perfectly.Corny. Very corny. Dreyfuss is pretty much the only thing going for this one-time rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft Music Movie","review":"I hated this movie but there were some parts that were ok my mom loved this movie she likes soft movies.

Dreyfus) plays Mr. Holland, a young man whose dream is to write the All-American Symphony. While doing so, he obtains a teaching job at a local high school. It turns out, he enjoys teaching music more then he does writing it.He also has to cope with his son, Cole, who is almost deaf, and can't enjoy the gift of music as much as his students do.When the board of education decides to end the music program, all of his students throw him a commemorating surprise.Overall Mr. Holland's Opus is an inspirational film portraying one man's dedication to helping others understand the great gift of music in an unforgettable way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr Holland Opus","review":"My wife and I loved the movie a bit of a tear joker for her great family movie a must see"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr Holland's Opus","review":"Given as a gift and the recipient enjoyed it very much.

It throws a little punch at you on just about every page. It is written in a cocky, sharply humorous narrative that keeps you snorting and turning the page. It will make you laugh, contemplate life, relationships, and running water (and all those other things we take for granted). Dan's adventures (and misadventures) will make you cringe, reflect and laugh out loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"The concept of living on a deserted island is a wonderful one. However the author describes the experience in language that only a teenage boy, full of sex hormones, could possibly enjoy.

This book left a lot to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, Unusual Deck","review":"I purchased this deck a few months ago during a troubling point in my life and upon opening the deck, I could tell this was THE deck for me. The images themselves are just breathtaking! I have used this deck often and now it is the one I go to first. It's a bit different than a traditional Tarot as the images are all female and most of the major arcana are given different names. The readings I have gotten from the cards have been extremely accurate and I love the chakra cards which can be used alone or with the other (alchemy) cards. The book which comes with it is lovely, although the writing style is a bit \\"flowery\\". However it is very sincere and you can feel the wisdom of this deck and \\"understand\\" it even without the book. There is a section on each card where it will recomend a food, herb or flower to help balance you. Beautiful deck for women!"},{"rating":"1","title":"missing so many key songs","review":"\\"Beautiful Girls\\" is one of my all time favourite movie. One of the many reasons why this is so is because of the classic songs found in the movie. So needless to say I wanted the soundtrack.

Not a very good selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Soundtrack but missing a song","review":"A very good movie about 20 years olds revisiting each other for their high school reunion and the relationships they're in. The soundtrack is just as good but I have to correct one persons review that said all the songs in the movie can be found here. THIS IS NOT TRUE! It is missing a classic 80's one-hit wonder song: \\"I Ran (So Far Away) by A Flock Of Seagulls. I am not sure why this was left off the soundtrack as it's the only thing keeping it from being perfect and that is why I give the soundtrack 4 stars instead of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite movies; unfortunately, most of the best songs in the movie aren't on the soundtrack.

Take my advice, buy the movie, don't buy the soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cliched soundtrack that clicked","review":"Good set of music for a beautiful movie.

It is cheaply made. I bought two in July of 2009. We do use the coffee make almost daily, but I already had to throw out one of them. The top cover portion that covers the spout broke off within the first two monthes, but that's not that big of a deal. It leaked around the rim where the black plastic meets the glass almost immediately. This was really only an issue for pouring the water into the coffee maker, but a very big inconvenience. Finally the handle cracked and broke. It's supposed to be designed to handle hot liquids, but clearly it is not a durable product. I wonder how many people may have received scalds due to this joke of a product. Luckily, we've known it's faults and have known to be very careful.My 2nd carafe, which I began using about six weeks ago is already starting to leak around the rim again. I do not recommend any coffee maker that uses this carafe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great coffemaker, crappy carafe!","review":"This is the second replacement carafe that i have bought in a year. I LOVE the coffemaker, but the R&D team at Cuisinart must be taking alot of coffee and donut breaks. This carafe lasts about 3 or 4 months before it starts to leak where the plastic meets the glass at the top. It only takes a few times for the water to leak all over the counter when you try to fill the coffeemaker, or to pour hot coffee all over yourself, to make you want to throw out the whole thing. I wish they would make a better carafe. This one stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly-designed carafe and lid","review":"This is my third time replacing this carafe because the nibs that hold the \\"flapper\\" in place on the lid become brittle over time and break off.

The hinge-type part that keeps the lid on is a tiny little plastic part that snapped one day, so I ordered a new one. (Which, for $18 is a TOTAL rip-off.) I was really annoyed, when, about a month later, the tip of the lid (that hinges as you pour) broke off. I am exasperated by this carafe, and am on the look-out for a new coffee-maker so I don't have to waste any more money on replacing this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The carafe cracked on the coffee-maker's hotplate the second time I used it.

However, the carafe has been replaced 4 times. Either the nibs that hold the lid on break off or the plastic handle itself breaks and/or comes apart. After 1 or 2 times, this gets frustrating -- it seems to be a systemic problem with the carafe design. But, what do you do if you aren't willing to yet abandon the coffee maker and get another model? You're stuck buying multiple carafe replacements over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a re-design","review":"I've purchased four of these replacement carafes. With the exception of the carafe that came with the coffee maker, damage appears within weeks of use. The tangs that hold the spill guard break first, then the handle breaks near the top. There doesn't appear to be any noticeable difference in this \\"wear and tear\\" between hand-washing and dish-washer cycling. Tested pure hand-washing on the first two and dishwasher cycling on second pair. It appears to be either a design flaw or just flat-out crappy plastic (the carafe is made in China after-all).The carafe is cheaper than buying a new coffee maker, so we keep buying them. We love the grind-n-brew coffee maker, even after 7 years of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"KRUPS is KING","review":"Considering all the bells and whistles on the coffeemaker itself,(all excessive, by the way) the carafes have much to be desired. It seems as if they are made with spun sugar. EXTREMELY FRAGILE, awkward handle and like a comment already listed, I too have replaced the carafe twice...making three so far. My Krups carafe of 10 years is still intact. If they still made the filters, I would still be using that machine.The Cuisinart coffee bean container is hard to clean, still maintains rancid oils and leaves an oil slick on the top of the coffee.

The first one was defective (band was broken in box). On the second, the band only lasted about 40 shots. Obviously, quality control is an issue. I did replace the bands and they have broken yet--about 500 more shots.Since buying this slingshot, I have tried 2 others--the Daisy B52 and a TruMark with fiber optic sights. This one, the P51 Daisy, is my least favorite. There's something about the pull and it being adjustable that I can't pinpoint and I've tried it adjusted medium, shortest, and longest, that just isn't as powerful as the other two.Just an FYI--for long range I really like the band that TruMark uses (even though I don't use the sights) and for close range, I like the B52 since it has more resistance.

The album sounds a bit different than most Van Gelder recordings, probably due to updated recording equipment and the overall '70s vibe. But the songs are good, especially \\"Liberated Brother\\" which has an awesome groove laid down by Mickey Roker. Hey, it may not be one of his classics, but if you are a Horace fan you won't be disappointed with this CD. Nice to see Blue Note reissuing some of the obscure stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swings like Clockwork","review":"Reviewer: Ken Seidman from Victoria, BCThis recording definitely has a bit of \\"showbiz\\" sheen to it, but, as another customer reviewer has said, it also has a dark day and mysterious depth to it that makes for an interesting tension. The soloing and ensemble work is immaculate throughout and I have always found it exceptionally accessible to the ear. It grabs you and doesn't let go. \\"Gregory is Here\\" should be singled out for its straight ahead and insistent joy (a quality of much of Horace's music!).

No character in this movie was completely developed and bits of the plot were left hanging. A little explanation on a few points would have gone a long way toward developing even a single character in this confusing melodrama. As it stands Bridget Fonda spews 40's era cliches and tries to look alluring, while Russell Crowe (who can usually pull off a decent American accent) sounds ridiculous and seems to fall in love with Fonda's character for no reason whatsoever.

As in most films Russell Crowe is in, he gives his all, but the story is pretty convoluted and doesn't give you much to care about. It gets pretty stupid towards the end. We kind of understood the owl showing up but never could understand the green lizard. The saving grace is the scene between Alec and Myra in the church and of course, somehow, Russell winds up dancing with his leading lady, something that happened in several of his earlier films. In the beginning of the film Russell and Bridget are very Bogart & Bacall and the banter flows pretty well, even if we have heard it before.

But the rest has nowhere near the power, intensity, or edginess of the original UK. The late vocalist is a little Gabriel-esque, but is also no Gabriel, and the lyrics don't have Gabriel's flair for poetry. Overall I found the whole thing a little flat except in occasional flashes (besides AH's contributions). Not an unpleasant listen, but would only merit 3 stars if not for AH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great PROG","review":"Nice to hear Holldsworth in this prog supergroup.

Frank Strozier is a lesser-known altoist who shines and soars on this, his first date as a leader. It is unfortunate that his playing was overshadowed by other, though deserving, sax players of the same era. This album is particularly exciting due to the playing of trumpeter Booker Little. Booker's remarkable solos and interpretations of the mostly original Strozier tunes (not to mention his own tune \\"Waltz of the Demons\\") are full of emotion and inventiveness. The rhythm section is none other than that of Miles Davis-Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers, and Jimmy Cobb. The well-honed interplay between these three more than adequately back the dynamic duo of Strozier and Little. This album is over 75 minutes of fantastic hard-bop (edging on post-hard-bop)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Fantastic","review":"I have known of the great though not well known Frank Strozier for many years. In fact he is the man that made me want to become a saxophone player, the very night I heard him live when i was nine years old.I purchased some of the music on this release on cassette several years back. This Cd is so much better. The audio quality of the music has been improved, and more importantly this release includes alternate takes of some songs.It is a mystery why Mr. Strozier has not enjoyed the recognition he deserved then and still does. This early session with him as the leader is documentation to that point as he is heard here in top form both as a player and as a composer. The playing of Booker Little is the perfect compliment to Strozier's smooth alto. The use of the Miles Davis rhythm section of Jimmy Cobb, Wynton Kelly and Mr.PC Paul Chambers makes this release one that all true aficionados of Jazz should have in their collection"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not necessary","review":"The lense protector is useless but the body will come in handy when the camera is swinging around your neck out in the elements to keep it pretty for when you use it indoors.

The armor fits almost perfectly, with two minor exceptions. Number one is the bottom area, where the wide tripod base usually gets stuck, but then, armor isn't really needed on the tripod. The second are is the SD card door, which is slightly blocked. Again, just thumb back the rubber and you're good to go. Aside from this, the lens hood does not stay connected to my 18-55mm kit lens well, so I normally leave it off, although it does work as a lens hood when I need it.All that aside, it is a good product. The buttons are not labeled quite as clearly but once you remember where they are, you shouldn't really need to see them anyway. I leave it on just about all of the time. It keeps it from sliding around and can stop the harm from minor bumps. I think it is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt quite fit","review":"I own a Nikon D80 with the 18-200mm DX VR NIKKOR len.

Provides a better grip on the D-80 camera body.2. Provides some superficial protection against minor bumps and scratches, but useless if the camera is dropped.Cons:1. The body armor limits accessibility to some of the controls and the diopter adjust is completely blocked.2. The rubber body armor material is a magnet for dust and lint. The material needs to be treated with automotive interior sealant (applied with micro-fiber towels) to eliminate the static problem. This will add an additional $20-$25 to your overall cost.3. The body armor kit includes a plastic LCD screen cover, but it's the same as the one provided in the standard D80 kit.4. The body armor adds additional bulk making it impossible to fit into the Nikon D80 camera bags.5. The body armor lens hood is a practical joke and should not be included with the package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camera Armor for Nikon","review":"If you absolutely know every control on your camera then this product will provide excellent protection. However, if you need to see which button is which, don't use this product. There are embossed labels on the rubber, but, being the same color they are very difficult to read, even in strong sunlight.

I always felt Preema was lying - no matter how many reasonable justifications she gave for herself...it felt incredibly manipulative and heartless. I do admit the book itself was interesting to read and almost exciting at points, but the end left me feeling disgusted...not enlightened or even educated.

Unfortunately some topics, i.e. analog (?) amplifiers, are presented in an oversimplified and confusing way which leads students to get wrong concepts on them. Others, like signal classification (chapter 2) are quite arbitrary and lacking foundation. At worst the book has some severe errors, for example in chapter 1 page 9 , or the description of RTD senesors. I think the book needs a detailed revision in order to find other gross errors. With respect to topic presentation I think it is always possible to explain the right ideas without using neither complicated math nor basic semiconductor theory.

Best of all, the deep texture of its tapestry of ideas was a pleasure to receive into one's own mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my vision of reality for kids","review":"I understand that some kids like Barney. My 1 year old has been watching this video lately (I didn't buy it; it was given to us). But personally I can't stand Barney, and I think that good children's productions are also appealing to adults. The kids remind me of Stepford Kids and they are sooooo cheesy in how they are nice to each other. It is so fake. It gives the impression that real people aren't this way, which isn't the message I want to communicate about being polite!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The watch is durable, but the nice looks fade fast","review":"I bought this as a low-cost diver's watch. The 200 m rating, easy-to-read display, and Velcro strap give it the versatility to wear on the boat, in the pool or scuba diving. I'm happy to report that the watch still works fine after six months of wear and a week of diving. But it looks as if it's ten years old. The decorative trim on the wrist strap started to crack and decompose after two or three hours in salt water. The finish on the grey plastic case has also started to chip. I haven't babied the watch, but I haven't abused it either (running across bricks or concrete, for example). I'm disappointed that a watch marketed for being rugged has proven to be such a wimp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"The Alibi ManNot her best book. Hard to get into the story. Seemed very long and boring. Would not recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bad boys club","review":"The novel is set in central Florida horse country near Palm Beach. Action takes place during Polo Season. A group of wealthy men and athletes think the world belongs to them and they make their own rules. They band together to cover each other's tracks and provide alibis. They use women and treat them badly. Then a woman from their party scene shows up dead - the body dumped. Elena Estes knew the woman and is drawn into the investigation.Events get dangerous. Some men have violent tempers. And there is a dangerous wild card seeking his own justice. The story has a twist at the end. Some people get what they deserve, but in surprising ways. The novel has sex, violence, and some language. I would rate it as adult only.There is a prequel about Elena Estes, but this novel reads OK as a stand alone novel. There are some references to events in the prequel.If you like this novel, you might also like \\"A Prisoner of Birth\\" by Jeffrey Archer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have a question","review":"Shouldn't the five star rating be given to writers who last though decades, through eras?Sure, this book is fun.

I usually like her books. I did not care for the characters at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"just so so...","review":"I normally adore anything written by Tami Hoag - I even loved Dark Horse, but this....I found I really didn't like her lead Elena very much at all...do I understand why she might be the way she is...absolutely...but all I could think about was what an absolute B*tch she was....after every scene with every person I kept coming away with the same thing....she is incredibly unlikeable....The story itself is not really what I've come to expect from Hoag...it was very slow. That coupled with the unlikeable heroine left me cold..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another page turner from Hoag","review":"Alibi Man became my alibi to read this book instead of doing something else. This book speeds you through twists and turns like a highway begging for you to reach the climax. Tami knows how to hold your interest and build to that climax and along the way some of the scenes she describes are so vived they are grotesque. Will not reveal plot as that is the story. A fat book with many pages that I finished in less than four days and read at night only for one hour each."},{"rating":"1","title":"she can do better with her writing","review":"a bit boring and slow --something too obvious and the leading caracter was always angry and irritating --was glad to finish"},{"rating":"2","title":"alibe man","review":"I enjoyed the book very much. I'm a new Tami Hoag fan and will purchase more of her books. I really like her characters and the way the stories unfolds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly Bad","review":"Cashing in on the success of her last novel - Dark Horse, Hoag uses the same female lead character to weave a story that's, painfully slow and unnecessarily graphic in the gore department. Furthermore, it's hard to enjoy a book when one cannot like or respect its lead character. Elena Estes is a charmless, self-centered Eve Dallas wanna-be(In Death Series by JD Robb). Yet, unrealistically, several men seem to be attracted to her. The author repeatedly mentions how \\"cynical\\" Elena is, but has her sympathize and almost melt with sorrow for a psychotic killer. I found that a little sickening. But then again, perhaps it's not surprising that one psycho would have sympathy for another."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Alibi Man, by Tami Hoag","review":"Like always book came quickly and in good condition. It is alway good to look for titles by certain authors that you missed when new."},{"rating":"2","title":"alibi man by Tami Hoag","review":"This is the second time I've submitted a review on this book. Please don't ask for a third one.If you like mysterys you will enjoy this book. I admit that some of the discriptions of the dead and dieing were pretty scary and disgusting, but they fit the story line. Tami Hoag is a greater writter and when I see her name on a book I always buy it. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"escaping tornado season","review":"A wonderful book, although I wouldn't call it poetry; more like a diary. I met the author and she is a wonderfully funny person.
