The final few pages address the emergence of the Nazi influence; other books thus are left to relate the ensuing horror that befell Berlin. One of my favourite Berlin books. Also worth a read are \\"Before the Deluge\\" and \\"Faust's Metropolis\\", two excellent books which cover Berlin in the 20's and 30's."},{"rating":"1","title":"The vendor was awesome to deal with.

I've owned it almost 2 years and am on the 3rd repair for Laser Assembly, which won't read. It tends to go out approximately every 6 months.

Getting tired of that, the expense and time out having to go back in several weeks to pick it up & $$$; it is a two hour drive one way.I would not recommend this Gig Master to anyone...bad quality from Vocopro. I will buy components next time from Numark or a another company. No more Vocopro products for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this unit","review":"I bought the Gigmaster new in June. It did not work properly from the beginning and continually got worse. It often would not load a CD-G and after several tries it might accept it but then would hesitate or stop completely while playing. Pretty embarrassing when you're in a gig.It would often play the wrong track. In September I called their tech support who had me take it to a local repair shop. It took Vocopro almost three weeks to send the replacement head that the technician said it needed. He also informed me that this is not the first one he has had to replace on a new unit becuase they are made with the cheapest componenents in China. This unit has a lot of features but , if they don't work, what good are they? I would be very reluctant to ever buy anything from Vocopro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice while it worked","review":"Very nice, heavy, and portable for three months. Then it went dead.

The resulting pedagogy is full of revealing stories and basic principles that most teachers would like to have learned before they ever stepped into a high school classroom. In particular, the last chapter of \\"maxims and aphorisms\\" is replete with practical wisdom. Inchausti's engaging style adds a lot to the charm of the book. His current work is at the university level where he has a chance to influence for the better many future teachers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and inspirational...","review":"This movie is incredibly informative and wonderfully filmed. The fishing action is covered in tremendous detail without giving up the \\"treasured\\" spots to the masses. If you want specific details, you can call the fly shop, but knowing your prey and catching is covered in detail.If you're looking for GPS coordinates, this won't help a lot, but to the thousands of people that fish this river regularly, it is a pleasure to watch. Highly recommended and truly a well edited piece of film work.Thank you Guy and Tysun for your incredible work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call the fly shop instead","review":"The video is short and covers 3 techniques that can easily be learned through reading about setting up their fly rods. I did not learn anything from this video that I was hoping too. There is no direction as to where to fish on the lower Kern River but only images of the host fishing an area he deems as a good spot without any reference to where the area is. The lower Kern River runs 40 miles and there is nothing that provides which stretches to fish or anything. If you are looking for details about where to fish on the Kern, this video does not provide that. If you are looking for what is working on the Kern, call the fly shop. If you are looking for a \\"how to\\" video, go to youtube."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I wanted","review":"Nicely filmed, but be warned--this short video doesn't really doesn't tell you much about the Kern River at all, just how to use four different techniques on it. A first time visitor to the Kern would probably have to hire this guy as a guide to figure out the spots he was fishing.It would have been better if they would have shown some maps of the area relative to other features nearby; they could have discussed what times of the year are best--things like that. If they'd have spent at least an hour and discussed some of those things, it would have been way more useful.I am glad I bought a used copy from an Amazon vendor--otherwise I would have felt pretty ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"a book of nonsense","review":"This book is a bunch of incredible nonsense that Jack Herer just made up about industrial hemp and its history, uses, environmental qualities, and agriculture. He exaggerates its productivity, lies about its economic history, and fabricates all kinds of bogus claims for the crop. Rather than dig into minutiae, I'll just point out some major areas where the author's claims are ludicrous:hemp was not made illegal in 1937; that didn't happen until 1971hemp was never a major crop in the UShemp does not produce even close to 10 tons of biomass per acrehemp does not outproduce trees in terms of paper pulphemp was never even close to being the world's largest industryif you want more info on industrial hemp and Herer's misinformation campaign, check out hemphoax.org"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emperor is Jack Herer!","review":"Well, shall we say this is not really very authoritative? I picked up this book hoping to learn something. I have adult children who smoke M and I wanted to be able to agree or disagree based on objective research. I cannot draw any conclusions from this book. The book certainly gives no answers to any objective thinker. It is entirely biased. He gives very poor citing. A careful analysis of the book indicates Mr. Herer believes the entire world is involved in a conspiracy. The result is a propaganda like tar and feathering of all his enemies including religion. I was particularly offended by Mr. Herer&#65533;s interpretations of history. I found his history to be so suspect that it completely undermined any credibility he had."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Cd Rocks....

Why on earth doesn't someone recall the first season so they can add the pilot to the disc? Or, at least, put the pilot on its on disc. Whoever got the bright idea of adding the pilot to season 3 as a bonus should have realized that this wasn't such a brilliant idea after all.

The teacher in my town couldn't even begin to teach as well as Madeline does in this book and DVD. I have loads of dulcimer books and CD's and this is by far the most well done set for beginners. A MUST for the beginning student; there is nothing better than seeing (on the DVD) an accomplished player playing each of the tunes slowly so that you can pick up the proper way to hold, strum and work the frets. I've been playing for two years now and still play some of the tunes from the book. My favorite is Soldier's Joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very helpful way to learn","review":"I am currently teaching myself to play a mountain dulcimer and have several \\"how to\\" books.

Actually, it's a clear rip-off of most of today's young, \\"hip\\" female singer/song-writers like Michelle Branch and Avril Lavigne. Lucy is a far better singer than the ones previously mentioned, but the songs on this CD don't do any justice for the talent she does have. The lyrics are as generic as can be and the music is boring and unoriginal. I believe that Ms. Woodward does have talent but she definitely needs better songs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"We all know that Lucy has a great voice. I think her songs were very good. Especially : Dumb Girls,Blindsided,and Trust me (you don't wanna see this). I was a little disappointed with some of the words she chose to put in her songs (swears),but luckily she wasn't saying them like a 100 times in a row. I really liked this CD,and I'm looking forward to Lucy's next album!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Suprised","review":"I bought this album after hearing \\"What's Good for Me\\" on the What A Girl Wants soundtrack. I figured if it had one or two good songs, it would be worth it. I was really shocked when I listened to the album! It's a great album full of insightful lyrics and rocking music! Lucy should not be written off as a Michelle Branch wannabe, this girl can truly stand on her own. From sassy numbers like, \\"The Breakdown\\" and \\"Trust Me (You Don't Wanna See This)\\" to thoughtful reflections like, \\"Standing\\" and \\"Something\\", Lucy expresses her ideas and experiences through her amazing lyrics. I highly recommend this album if you like Michelle Branch/Sheryl Crow-sytle music. Lucy's debut album is fun to listen to all the way through and will have you singing along in no time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Dumb Girl, True To Her Words","review":"I saw her perform at Wall Township Speedway, I mainly went to see 4 spectacular NASCAR drivers raced there, unfortunatly I didn't know I was in for her so called \\"talent\\" here. When she started singing most of the redneck racefans, including me, went to buy earplugs to block out her noise. We took them out when the races start. She didn't dance well either. It seemed as officials turned off the power later in the day so she wouldn't need to perform again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few good songs, none worth remembering","review":"I an dissapointed with Maxim in featuring this artist. While Lucy has a reasonable voice and fluffy pop music that is certainly going to be popular with those who like bubble gum music, this album comes out like many pop albums. That is, there is one pseudo hit (always the first track) and then track after track of filler. I feel this artist could do more but she gets an underachiever's grade for this release.I like female artists in general, however she barely reaches beyond the total generic bubble gum experience that plagues our airwaves. We don't need more of this musical spam. Buy this album if you need to placate a bunch of pre-teens and attempt to sound current, however if you like music worth listening to, it would be better to find another artist that is willing to risk a little effort to create something that expresses something, anything. The lack of creativity and boilerplate sound simply leaves me cold on this artist.This album is pablum."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS CD WHILE U CAN!!","review":"THIS IS MY FAVORITE CD RIGHT NOW!!

The best songs on the album are: Dumb Girls, Is This Hollywood and Always Something. I actually think she could squeeze two more Top 40 hits from this debut. Her songs have nice guitar licks and just enough chord changes/modulations to make everyone happy. Her lyrics are simplistic, but they match nicely with the actual album content (not a bad thing).I would be a shame if this album didn't got Platinum and a REAL SHAME if it didn't go Gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good CD- worth every penny!","review":"I had first heard about Lucy from the \\"What a Girl Wants\\" Soundtrack with her song \\"What's Good for Me\\" and fell in love with it. I loved this CD so much. Each song was carefully put together and there wasn't a song I hated. I really think that she is a great writer and singer and should be more appreciated and become the next chart-topper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost","review":"I do appreciate Lucy Woodward's debut - enough that hearing \\"Dumb Girls\\" twice spurred me to eventually chase down the album. I especially like \\"Done\\", but \\"Dumb Girls\\" is still my favorite. It, unlike every other song, sounds different. It works a novel topic in with the we're-not-together-anymore lyrics of every other song (that topic being the ditzes of the title). It's catchier and more clever. Absolutely every other song, though too-obvious effort was taken to make the beginnings different, has the same combination of Lucy's singing over a clear, mid-tempo beat and melodic chords. The lyrics are meaningful and well thought out, though not particularly amazing, deeply personal, or hard-hitting. Don't pass this up, but don't expect it to be your favorite CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut album","review":"I met Lucy last year in Los Angeles and found her to be so down to earth.

They are of uncertain origin and authenticity; however, the strength of the contents makes their authenticity academic. In five letters, we see the psychological movement from blind, passionate love to an awareness of having been used - while still valuing the lessons of what passion is possible in the heart. We see this movement through the letters of a young Portuguese nun who was seduced by a French military officer serving in Portugal. While this is a work of the 17th century, the insight into human nature could well have been written yesterday - the culture and the date are no barrier to the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but Magic Cap is no longer around","review":"This book at one time was the only source for examples of Magic Cap programming -- other than what you could buy directly from the company that made this revolutionary operating environment for hand-held devices.

I read the first chapter and it actually sounded exciting at first. By the time I had finished the 3rd chapter I was asking myself \\"What the h*** was this book about?\\". It seemed to have absolutely no relevance to programming whatsoever and very little relevance to anything at all! This book is just as incoherent as his collaboration with William Robert Stanek on \\"Java 2 Certification Exam Guide for Programmers and Developers\\" but at least that book seemed to be about something and stayed on topic (For at least 60% of the book). After reading 2 of this guy's books I am left wondering \\"Did this guy ever actually learn English?

Its very easy to disconnect and my 25 gallon sprayer will still fit on the back of the ATV even with the mounting bracket in place.

I didn't connect it at first but when I gave her the same treats the next day, exact same reaction!I have tried several different flavors of this same brand and she has had the same reaction!

I have been buying this treats for my kitty for years and suspected them all along to be the cause of him vomiting. Ironically, I even bought the hairball ones to see if they would make him stop vomiting. Now is official, I stopped giving them to him as often, and then monitored him whenever I gave him any. It soon became clear to me that he only vomits whenever I give him this treats. Sometimes he would vomit within minutes, and other times he would vomit during the night or the next morning, but if I give him this treats, I'm sure to be cleaning up orangee throw up off my carpet soon after. I think is a matter of allergy or sensitivity to one of the ingredients, and they probably don't do anything to other cats but I'm never buying this again for my kitty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Temptations Vomiting","review":"I have two cats.

This doesn't happen with any other treats like Whisker Lickins or Pounce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not safe for kittens!","review":"I don't want anyone to think this is an unfair review of the product, it's more of a warning from my own personal experience so others don't make a mistake.When I got my new kitten from the humane society they sent him home with a goodie bag that happened to include these treats. I started feeding them to him and he seemed to like it. Then I noticed he would vomit occasionally. It was only after closer inspection did I realize these treats are for cats 6 MONTHS AND OLDER. I'm sure there's a reason for this, they caused his vomiting. I switched to a different temptations medley and he hasn't vomited since. So keep in mind, there IS a reason they limit these to older cats, they really aren't kitten safe. I only wish my humane society realized this before sending them home with him. I can only imagine they feed these to all the cats in their care without reading the package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Some Cats Vomit","review":"You know, I was searching the Internet for the words \\"temptations\\" and \\"vomit\\" when I came across these reviews. I was surprised to hear that I'm not the only one who has had problems with this product. Within an hour of eating these treats my cat vomits for about 40 minutes. I didn't realize it was the cause until the second time I fed them to her. It's really bad because it doesn't cause the cat to throw up all at once. It's like she can just vomit a little at a time and you're forced to follow her around cleaning up all the vomit ((or locking her in the bathroom (which is horrible))."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick Cats","review":"I have fed my 2 cats these treats the last 2 days.

I stopped giving her the treats and so far, my cat has been vomit free.

In both the narration is a rapid-fire sing-song delivery which to me and my wife quickly detracts from the enjoyment of the video.

Howard Emerson has a gentle touch on the acoustic guitar. But from those fingers flow a variety of sounds that visit country blues, ragtime and modern ambient music. I especially love \\"Dew Rag,\\" and \\"Crossing Crystal Lake.\\" Both of these tunes evoke some very pleasant moods and inspire me to pick up my guitar and play. Howard has put time into learning alternative tunings and this gives his music different voicings or shadings and expands my idea at least of what is possible with the acoustic guitar. I highly recommend this album - not only for the music, but for the inspiration that it may provide you to pick up your guitar and get acquainted with an old friend...yourself. If after sampling, you find yourself wanting this album, it is available from Howard..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Album for Anyone who Loves Guitar!","review":"Howard Emerson's silky smooth fingerstyle comes through in this album. A very nice, well balanced blend of unique contemporary and ragtime pieces. Crossing Crystal Lake is a simple, yet elegant tune with an interesting, subtle rythme that reminds you of a canoe trip through a placid lake at sundown. Dust Mop is an upbeat, intricate rag that just leaves you wondering how he does it. Expertly executed; not overly-produced; sounds like he's sitting in the room with you.

Once I realized there was a cap on the end of the cable everything worked great. I didn't come with any instructions or pictures and I didn't look at the expensive cable that closely before I tried to hook up and I began to think it wasn't going to fit.

I'm pretty mad about it give the time and money I've spent on my sound system and this was my last loose end. So, I beg you...don't buy this POS.

It seems to me that the heads barley even touch the inside components, but with much poking and prodding, they work for the Xbox 360 ONLY if it is in a perfect spot on the output, and any movement sends my headphones into a static filled frenzy.

It is much better written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good content, abstract","review":"I like the content. I think it can be organized better and with a bit more aim. I also like that it is fairly abstract and not concrete. However, my main complaint is that the author repeats himself countless times which means you'll be reading over stuff that you read 2 pages ago. He could also use less words to express himself. Often whole paragraphs can be halved if he just expresses himself more efficiently. I think the book can be written in about 650 pages if such reductions were made. It's a strange thing to criticize but technology authors seem to have started competing on number of pages instead of quality of content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly structured and written","review":"I am a computer science student and I LOVE operating systems material, but unfortunately I had to learn it from this horrible text book.Pros:1.

Many times those paragraphs doesn't make sense and the \\"bottom line\\" from all these is a mystery.2. Many core concepts do not have clear explanations. Instead there are just long and unclear paragraphs of texts with no clear explanation once so ever.3. Crude and Meaning less drawings, the book looks like one big chunk of text, it seems that the author was just to lazy to add some more descriptive illustrations where he needed to. For example: he explains about hard drive structure and cylinders and tracks, and there isn't a single illustration that shows what a cylinder is.Conclusion:Covers a lot of topics, but as a text book or a technical book it fails to clearly convey core concepts. Wouldn't recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riddled with mistakes","review":"I taught an operating systems course at a top-30 north american university using \\"Operating Systems Concepts\\", 5th edition. At the same time, i looked at Tanenbaum's book \\"Modern Operating Systems\\" to get ideas for problems. Instead of just copying his homework assignments, i actually read the book and created homeworks from scratch using the figures and examples in this book.I got burned twice. IMHO, the book is loaded with logic errors. Not only were the programming examples wrong, but the logical concepts (e.g. examples of what constitutes deadlock) were also wrong. If i found this many errors by looking at just two chapters, you know there are hundreds more buried elsewhere in the book.Don't screw up your students' minds with this book.

Travolta displayed his singing talents on radio airwaves in 1976 with LET HER IN,which sounds like a song the R&B group The Stylistics would record. Another great song from this album is GREASED LIGHTNIN' from the GREASE movie soundtrack with moral support from pre-Taxi Jeff Conaway.

I think our 5-month-old baby's favorite must be Lullaby (Take 6), because she is usually sound asleep before this one ends. I find Spirit Lullaby (Sweet Honey in the Rock) amazing. She was a really fussy newborn who didn't sleep much, but since she was 3 months we lay her in her bed, put this lullaby on, and she smiles and coos until she drifts off. Maturity gets some credit, but I think the music helps too. We interchange other lullaby CD's but this one works best.UPDATE: Daughter is now 2 1/2 and still falls asleep easily to this CD.

I like the cultural diversity of the music and the quality of the recording and artists. I am not a fan of Music for Little People productions, but this compilation is outstanding.

He presents all the logic and reason to deny mythology. Anyone with a family who is as faithful as the actors portray in this film might want to explain it to the family with this film. I especially loved the patio scene where they attempt to have breakfast. Dismissing some gods and not others is prejudice bigotry based on a selfish desire from an irrational hope of going to heaven. It's a no frills movie as far as Hollywood stunts and there is a few cuss words. So little children might be the wrong audience but once they grow up they should understand atheism before they confuse it with devil worship. I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not feed material! Jams on everything.","review":"This is a gravity feed spreader. Since the drum is flat on the bottom, there is just a 4\\" hole. While this seems large, due to the lack of a \\"funnel\\" into the hole, the side pressure of the material at the bottom causes the hole feed to bind. If the material isn't \\"PERFECT\\" then it cloggs and does not FEED AT ALL. If it does feed it comes out so fast that you go through 300 lbs of material in about 5 minutes, and you can't drive fast enough to make it work. Plus the motor is so weak that you have to get out of your truck and spin it to get it started. I paid $500 with Northern on this and because I got it in the fall, prepped for winter, when the snow came and I found all about this terrible equipment, Northern would not exhange, refund or make it right.

This feels like a selfless act of mothering and gives the reader a more balanced view into Sharon Geyer's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too deep","review":"This book was an easy read, and to me, the author does not focus enough on her emotional struggles leaving her children behind in Iran. She goes into so much detail about so many other things in her life, that I never really got a feel for how her heart felt leaving her children with her abusive husband in Iran. She focused too much detail on all the characters that she met when she left Iran and was living in Israel.I never felt any sympathy/empathy for her as a mother, she just drifted around so much, and seemd like she never tried hard enough to get her life in order and get her kid back.She does not go into great detail about her life in Iran, or the abuse she suffered. This book is more like a tale of her adventures as a single woman in Israel.

The lines in her irises (the colored parts of her eyes) are way too dark and make it look like she's been hypnotized or that she's in a trance. The person at MGA who approved this doll's face should be fired because I doubt anyone will find her eyes attractive! I saw Wild Wild West Fianna and Yasmin and they both have regular Bratz eyes so I wonder why they gave Dana such weird eyes?

Really, the whole premise that you are going to get 'smart' people together to conference, and then tell the Dalai Lama something he does not already know is preposterous. Every agenda from boycotting China (for the sake of Tibet) to 'I wanna speak to the Dalai Lama' comes up and it's not pretty. This is mostly a pass for sure.

The infusers are nothing like the usual tea bags at all. They contain true first rate tea fully equal to fine tinned whole bulk tea, and of an excellent quality. No tea dust or floor sweepings here. You get the real bits of tea leaf and stem and white tea flower. A fine bulk tea with the convenience of bags - the best of both worlds.The flavor is superb without any addition. It is neither sickly sweet nor bitter. For best results, like any white tea, brew for no more than 1-2 minutes using pure water which has been briefly boiled and then cooled a bit: 190-200 degrees works fine for me.The only feature that is less than perfect is the lack of strings on the bags. Guess they had a misguided green save-the-planet moment.

It is the poorest of them all outside of being a handsome thing. Itwill not give a close shave no matter how hard I press or what direction I move it. I don't like cleaning it after every use. The side burn trimmer is nearly useless (too short and poorly located). I used my old Norelco for my last shave and it still shaves much closer. The side burn trimmer on the old one is great. I clean it only when it is full of whiskers and it has worked well for three years. I am glad I didn't throw it away. I do like the charging system and the display on the 1090 but the cord should be coiled and stretchy. The cord is difficult to store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Norelco I've owned","review":"I've been a satisfied user of Norelco razors for years.

Even with multiple passes it won't give you a close shave. Useless. I changed the blades thinking that may be the issue but it works the same.It has other design problems.

The first problem is the pop up trimmer, on the Arcitec it is useless. When I need one I always go to the 5801XL. The second problem is that sometimes I don't shave on weekends so Monday mornings with the Arcitec the job gets only half done and I have to finish up with the older model.

It shaved just ok, but definetely not worth the hefty pricetag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality and performance, but pricey","review":"The Philips Norelco arcitec 1090 is a quality product. Being able to just rinse the heads to clean it is a big advantage, and it gives a close, comfortable shave. Some reviewers have said it does not suit the crumpled features, the facial nooks and crannies, that some of us have. I really think they are not using it correctly. If you hold it perpendicular to the surface, press very lightly and allow the heads to do the work, they will search out the nookiest and cranniest folds in the most convoluted of faces.The Power Pod supplied with it is a great idea, allowing you to take it on trips without having to worry about recharging it, but it is a little too bulky for my taste. I prefer to travel very light, and I think I'll continue to pack a couple of disposable razors rather than this pod.For quality and performance, I give it 5 stars, but I deduct 1 because I am not convinced that it is significantly better that other, cheaper models."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaving Failer","review":"Always loved NORELCO, but this time \\"ALL FALL DOWN\\" very rough on throat area ,doesn't cut as close unless you go over&over&over.

I was disapointed, the product has very good quality, but the results aren't what i expected. I waste about 5 minutes for shaving but my skin was very bad after that with large irritated areas. The necessity of pass the shaver many times was terrible for my skin. I tried sometimes like recomended by the manual, but notice no change nor improvement. I think that it would be a great shaver for those that don't have sensible skin, not my case. Besides that i don't think that the flexible heads helps a lot, in fact i get the impression that fixed head it would be better for closer shaving.

I consider this a step backwards from the 8894xl. In their quest for a really cool design, and I have to admit it does look really good, they have lost sight of the fact that it actually results in a worse shave.I find myself having to cover the same ground many more times than in the past and have to concentrate much more to check for missed hairs and spots that I have to go over even more. Also, the statement that the new design improves the ability to shave your neck is not true, I think it is also worse in this regard.My advice, dont bother with the cool Arcitec design, buy the top of the line traditional Philips/Norelco model instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I have used Norelco shavers for over 30 years.

I recently ordered replacement blades for my previous Norelco model and have retired the Arcitec. The Arcitec blades seem to dull materially quicker then previous models. It does not work on cord and in my view does not travel well. The blades individually lift for cleaning and the stubble pit is too shallow. I have always owned top of the line Norelcos.

I started with a 3-head rotary system similar to this, then switched to a foil cutting system, and back to a 3-head. None ever seemed to give me the close shave that I expected...until now. Right after I got this charged up, I gave it a go and was simply amazed. The shave was close and smooth, and it didn't feel like it was eating my face alive! The ease of cleaning makes this razor a no-brainer too. Simply open up the heads and rinse under hot water after shaving. If you want it cleaner than that, you can then close the heads and submerge the cutting heads into soapy water or Norelco's cleaning solution and turn it on for about 30 seconds. The only drawback I could think of with this razor is that it cannot be used while it is plugged in. I know after a few years, my old razor wouldn't hold a charge for very long, so I generally just used it plugged in.

It is weird (certainly a very different design from other Norelcos).I'm replacing the James Bond Spectra, which served me well for years. I noticed a couple of things about this new fangled thing. First, it seems to cut the whiskers on the first or second pass...as opposed to 5 or 6 or more passes. Especially on the lower neck. Second, while I'm not convinced that the shave is any closer than my old razor, it's definitely faster (hey, it's the same techology, isn't it?). Third, it does seem to be a little \\"delicate\\" in that I'm not sure this razor is going to survive bouncing off the bathroom floor like my other ones, but the design and grip is far superior to any previous Norelco I've owned, so I shouldn't be dropping it.It's kind of weird...just like it looks...but I think I like it.

I only have fine hair but even on my face, this shaver just doesn't do a good job. I am so frustrated with this shaver - it cost a lot of money and the shave is bad.

I've always found them to work well and be fairly comfortable. After a few years use, instead of replacing the heads and/or battery again, I pick up the latest top of the line Norelco that's available. The Arcitec 1090 looked awesome, and I was looking forward to using it when I received it. What a disappointing product. Bottom line, it does not work nearly as well as my Quadra Action or SmartTouch XL models. I gave it some time thinking maybe my skin needed to adjust to it, but it has not improved. It just gives a mediocre, uncomfortable shave. I've since returned it, and ordered new heads for my older Norelco. I would seriously think twice before spending $200 on this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks amazing, shaves fine","review":"As far as visually impressive, you'd be hard-pressed to find another shaver on the market to beat this. It's beautiful, and feels great in your hand. The display is clear on it and it helps you know exactly how much of a charge you have left. I love this feature because the shaver I've used in the past only had a light that eventually went out when it needed a charge, and that's not handy if it dies in the middle of a shave.The only problem I see with it is the shave. While the heads do move independently just as they advertise, it still doesn't feel like it catches every contour of your face. For this price you'd expect flawless performance, and while it's very good, it's not perfect. Still, if you're going to give this as a gift or just want to use a razor that looks cooler than anything your friends have, you can't beat this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never again a Arcitec.","review":"Been using Norelco's for about 25 years and have been using this one for about 2 years now.

Third, cannot plug it in if I forget to charge it (luckily I still have my six year old model (8140xl) that does plugin) and Fourth, If I don't rinse this shaver after every shave (which would be everyday) I would get shavings all over my robe,etc. on the next shave.

However, this seems very tinny and over designed, especially given the premium price. The trimmer simply doesn't work well; the grip is awkward, and the trimmer very narrow.Worse is the fact that the shiny metal cover on the front edge of the razor simply falls out if you put the razor in its travel case.This is a case of marketing demanding shiny, but no one remembering to make it work and durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Performance doesn't match it's good looks.","review":"I've used nothing but Norelco razors since switching to electric from blades nearly 20 years ago. This razor looks impressive, but the shave is subpar. With the original head that came with the razor, I noticed that it seemed a little dull compared to previous models. I started having problems with in-grown hairs due to the shave being more of a tear than a cut on the whiskers.I've replaced the head twice, but both replacements seemed more dull than the original. I'm not sure if the quality of manufacuring went down at the Company, but this razor definately looks better than it performs.I just made the big leap to Braun by purchasing a 790CC. I'm reading mostly great reviews on this razor.

It gave me terrible irritation, cut the hair very slowly and refused to pick up some. My face would not adjust to it. I struggled with it for a month and returned it to Norelco who hopefully will refund my money. Since I no longer had my old Quadra Action, I decided to give Norelco another try and purchased the 8151XL. I only shaved with it once, however, it was the best shave in my life. It picked up all uneasy hairs without struggle and I never expected the closeness it gave me. I love it and actually look forward to my next shave.

Other good songs are \\"As Real as it Gets\\", and \\"These Tears\\". The reason this album didn't get the full five stars is that sometimes they can get too repetitive, and the singer's high pitched voice can get a little bit annoying. Also, they should have put some more breakdowns into their songs.

Is it terrible? No, but it's nowhere close to good, the vocals are typical, so there's not a whole lot of criticism for them. The musicianship appears held back, as the actual music is simple, but precise. The tracks themselves are very forgettable save the first and last track (Sworn Enemy and These Tears, I believe), but are decent for a simple, mindless headbang. Lyrically unimpressive, with random profanity and pseduo-emotion. The underlying subject matter of Sept.11 is respectable, but the delivery could be much better. Overall, \\"As Real as it Gets\\" is a good choice for a workout or angst record, but if one is looking for skilled musicianship, diversity and depth, steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"......","review":"This album seems so shallow, I mean I'm a huge fan of hardcore but this album just...sucks. I never use that word to describe an album because I can think of better things to say, but with this band upon first listen all I could think or say is \\"This Sucks!\\" It's just a bad excuse for hardcore or even metal. Listening to a rock hit the pavement from a 5 story fall has more to say than this album. These guys are just repeating things that have already been said by better bands, and the 9/11 thing is so corny. Sick of it All, Hatebreed, Hemlock (Lv) and Martyr AD just to name a few write music just like this, but with more thought and it sounds better. The only impression I get from this album is the one I got listening to Nu Metallica or Slipknot, and that is \\"This record was written and recorded in about an hour!!\\" That's how little of attention to detail these guys put into it.

Out of the fifteen songs on this album not one lacks musically, lyrically, or even lets up on its intensity.

And those 2 pages give the stale old chestnut that you get in every drawing instruction book--the hold up your pencil and mark with your thumb way of measuring. We expected a little bit more here. She also states \\"Da Vinci was fond of using squares and rectangles to assess proportion\\" but then she doesn't give any examples of how he used them or, more importantly, how you can use them to assess proportion. So, it seems like very superficial coverage. Since no one is now alive who actually saw Da Vinci draw 500 years ago; no one can probably tell us how he drew, and no one should pretend that they know or will show you how he did so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"This books will teach no one to draw Like Da Vinci, or to draw at all.

Bruce presents a well-written and insiteful commentary on the development of various religious sects through-out history, leading right up to present day.The only two complaints I have about the book are -it was not longer, -the endnotes are at the end of each chapter, instead of collected at the end of the book.

Both song selections are dull when placed in the hands of these want to be artists. Evans manages to iritate more than Day simply due to the bad vocal guidance. She attempts to \\"Houston Up\\" her vocal performance...and badly falling very short. Anyone listening to this single with an average sound system will find it quite painful (after reviewing the bias remarks on this Amazon board; one can tell from the posts that her parents and grandparents are proud stage parents, however, the audience is far from being won over no matter who is backing this flawed project with massive amounts of funds)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blossom's 2nd Single Delivers","review":"The second single of Blossom (a.k.a. Blümchen) is a really great listen. The 'Radio Mix' and 'Extended Mix' on the CD are somewhat different than the album version as there are some fun breaks at the beginning and nice vocals during the bridge, which stay true to the happy hardcore, euro-rave feel that Blossom is known for. The 'In The House' mix is fun to listen to as the track consists of more house beats and funky tempos. In my opinion, it's quite refreshing to listen to as this track does not have the happy hardcore feel that she is know for. I appreciate this as the single has some variation.All in all, this CD single is awesome! The music is bright, happy, fun and will make you want to smile and dance. If you are a Blossom fan or are passionate about euro techno and electronica music, this is definitely worth adding to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just short of a dream..","review":"This is one of the few US Edition Blossom (Blumchen) albums available, and despite a varied genre feel to the remixes, it's definately worth a look.

I can't get over how powerful this comes across and words fail me in describing his desire for the world to \\"be free\\".

When \\"Peace at Last\\" came out, I was overjoyed. And then I listened to it. Some of the rhythms of the old Blue Nile were there, but I did not buy the album to hear somewhat-prettier-than-Christian-pop proselytizing music. I'm glad that his faith has brought Paul Buchanan comfort, but he has definitely lost this customer. I hope he \\"finds his way\\" to making good music again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best bands EVER!","review":"This CD and this band deserve more than just 5 stars. This is truly what music should be - a moving work of art. The words of the songs, the instruments and vocals, go straight to your soul. This is the kind of music you actually sit and listen to and appreciate, unlike most music nowadays, which just serves as background noise for our lives. Get this CD and get Blue Nile's earlier CD's also - it will be music that you love to listen to over and over again, for many years to come. A new classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A somewhat lesser accomplishment still rewards","review":"Though it may be unsurprising that anyone could struggle to live up to the quality of the work on the Blue Nile's first two albums, the music in Peace at Last still occasionally approaches the mood, evocation, and richness we've come to expect from this marvelous duo.Particularly Happiness, Tomorrow Morning, Love Came Down, Body and Soul (an original composition, not the classic), and Family Life remind us of why we love their music. That their sound is simpler, pared down, and, yes, happier, suggests that the band was trying for something different from their other releases.Still memorable and strong, this accomplishment is worth the attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jade bracelet","review":"The purple jade looks great it matches some earings I bought for my girlfriend last year.

For a Canadian film, it really impressed me then, as does it now. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good, realistic, action packed, edge of your seat, drama. Johnathon Crombie and Olivia D'Abo are incredible and it really makes u wonder why they havent achieved success more than they have in the movie world.

A scary looking bunch that can't afford dental care or even razors. I can suspend my belief only so far. And not with movies that want you to believe that a family that runs a town doesn't own a bathtub. I'm just assuming they don't since that percentage of the cast look like scrubs that bathe in a muddy pond. I did not like this film it had bad performances (by a cast of unknowns), cinematography (bad lighting in the last 35 minutes), lame script (100% unbelievable), bad direction (well the director did allow all of the above).

The only problem I had was reading it and maintaining my life. Once I started, I didn't want to stop. Yes, I did read French Relations first (was rooting for Hugo throughout) and was so happy to rediscover characters I knew and loved. This is a much tighter novel though: in plot and writing. Pure escapism so be prepared to stay up all night and re-read chunks. Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Those Fiona Walker books!","review":"Most of the time, the sequel is never quite as good as the original - not so with \\"Well Groomed\\", the sequel to \\"French Relations\\". I simply loved this book, couldn't put it down! I've read every single one of Fiona Walker's books and can truthfully say, she is now my favorite author. I like how she thoroughly develops each character - in some to the point that they reappear in another book in a supporting role.I can't wait for her to publish more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of both worlds!","review":"I'm torn between whether Grey Eye Glances' CDs are the cake and the live shows the icing or vice versa. What I'm not divided on is how truly incredible their music is. GEG Live is the best of both worlds - cake and icing.Songs such as \\"Halfway Back,\\" \\"The One,\\" and \\"The Lost Coast\\" draw each individual into their adaptable stories. You'll find you just have to sing along with the upbeat \\"If I Was\\" and \\"Big Red Boat,\\" which capture the bands energy and talent.If the artful, soul-searching lyrics don't pull you in, (and they will), surely the beautifully stirring vocals of lead singer Jennifer Nobel will. The band's unique approach to folk rock puts Grey Eye Glances in a category all their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Music","review":"I bought this CD for one song, We Are, a powerful anthem that I had been taught by a dear friend. However, every song on this CD is powerful in its own right and has served and nurtured me over time. Sweet Honey is an amazing a cappella musical group that has evolved out of the African American political and historical experience. With Sacred Ground, Sweet Honey focuses on the spiritual dimensions of political and social challenges such as prejudice and poverty. The result for me, is always a sense of renewal and energy that feeds the soul, soothes the heart and harmonizes mind and body. Sacred Ground is an invaluable CD for any one who works with dispirited and often disembodied people. While most \\"new age\\" music, emphasizes a certain spaciousness, Sacred Ground which has its roots in traditional gospel and folk music argues in favor of groundedness as a source of heartful strength. Its just this side of divine."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tops","review":"I adore Hello Kitty, if you do too get this box before it's too late.

This wonderful compilation does not disappoint! From the haunting \\"Call\\" (a longtime crowd-pleasing live staple) to the newer \\"Cafe Racer\\", this album projects a tangible sensation that many of us who live in Northeastern urban areas can relate to implicitly.

The works of this album can only be produced in the studio, where track fading, complex effects, and just simple \\"spacy-ness\\" are available and abused by this usually live band.

Definitely."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehh...","review":"They missed the perfume, I missed the jam. If you are looking for intelligent, creative, and innovative jambased music, get the disco biscuits' first album (Uncivilized Area,) cuz you're not going to find it here.

I hate to say it, because I absolutely love Disco Biscuits, but this CD honestly just sucks. It's pretty much nothing like their other albums, it's just some weird electronic [poop].

If your a BISCO fan this cd is a must for any collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmmmmmmmmm","review":"Not sure about this. Uncivilized area is much better. There isn't much if any jamming on the guitar. The little guitar there is resembles a Yanni album. It is almost like the CD player is on \\"repeat last song\\" when listening through.

This is one of them, and it shows how talented she is. This album is a fine example of her great bluesy singing and an awesome showcase for her backing band, too. Believe it,there is something here for everyone. No one has ever phrased a lyric like Etta. No one. You feel her pain, her pathos, her happiness, her despair and her loneliness. It is a completely joyous experience to listen to this woman sing. Others have greater range or greater voices. None have the inimitable gift that Etta James possesses, allowing you to understand a lyric and feel it deep down in your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe her best ever.","review":"Since the day in 1962 when I borrowed an LP titled \\"At Last\\" I have been addicted to the voice and style of Etta James; I've amassed everything she's ever recorded. We have been the benefactor of her incredible strength in overcoming serious personal problems and returning to us in the 80s.If you've never actually experienced this dynamic lady but would like to begin, I would recommend you begin with \\"Let's Roll\\". This recent release captures Etta James at her most powerful and sensuous best. Every cut demonstrates her trademark style. If after experiencing \\"Let's Roll\\" you don't immediately seek out many of her other recordings, I can only assume you were born without a central nervous system. I believe this may be the best she's ever done. Now in her 60s, the lady can still bring it."},{"rating":"1","title":"just aight","review":"I'm a Big Etta James fan&always look toward Her Newer Projects but this Set seemed by the numbers&never showed me much.pretty much was just digging Her voice but the music never caught on with me fully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Clean Fun","review":"We love the Wubbulous World series.

That product ran out so I tried Spa Perfect, and with 2 new filters and a fresh water change, it only took 1 week for the water to cloud up. I used their product \\"Clear and Perfect\\" to get rid of the cloudiness with no sucess. After following their directions for nearly 4 weeks, my tub does not smell, but still has a cloudy, unsatisfactory appearance. The Spa Perfect product is a brown color like dark tea with particulate material floating in it which seems strange. I've e-mailed the company to ask about this with no response from them.

Ian has a pretty decent voice and his drumming is spot on and his songs are top notch. It is VERY crimsonish paticularky on 'too much dogma' and 'castaway' (shame the intro didn't last longer) there is mellotron aplenty and it could well fit into 'islands' no problem. There is some Beatle-ish chorus's throughout and the band are tight and if the latter tracks are like Steely Dan with the funky bass lines so what! It does lose its way toward the end, but it is a good and unusual debut album. Actually if you pine for early Crimson or rate Pete Sinfeild's 'still' album you could do a lot worse than buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"View of another nutrition writer","review":"Inflammation is an important topic, and until recently, badly neglected by the medical community.

He was jaw-droppingly good. I am now discovering his albums in reverse chronological order. This one is a mind-blower. I have rarely encountered an album that so successfully covers this many musical genres. Everything from swing to alternorock to blues to country to some other forms of music that I'm not sure are named can be found here. This sounds like a recipe for a disjointed disaster, but it comes together as a brilliantly energetic and thoughtful masterpiece. Bird's violin would be impressive enough on its own, but add to it his imagination, inventiveness, intelligence, and incredible voice and you get a must-own album. I can hardly force myself to remove this one from the CD player. Definitely the best new music I've come across in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"a depressing change","review":"oh how very depressingly bad this cd is! I bought it on pure faith after being thrilled with his previous efforts, only to be very sadly disappointed with it. It lacks the passion and creativity the Oh! The Grandeur and Thrills held. I get shivers of revulsion just thinking of some of the songs. I respect his desire to grow stylistically, but I just don't care for the boring songs he's produced. It honestly does depress me, because his previous combination of modern meets swing was exactly to my liking. People might suggest I turn to Squirrel Nut Zippers, but their poppish shallow jazz is no consolation -- not even worth comparison.

However on this cd, there is nothing but very shallow pop music, with no artistic value what-so-ever! A very bad descision of bird's part, as I'm sure this cd has lost most of his fans who expect much more then this. His last two releases featured jazz, blues, syncopation, swing, improvisation, creativity, and highly artistic music, but this release is just like a blow on the head with a crowbar, it's shockingly painful to listen to, and boring, and not interesting. Skip this one, and let's hope he goes back to Squirrel Nut Zippers sounding music, after all, I oanly started buying Bird's cd's because SNZ sold out to comemrcialism on thier latest bizzare cd Bedlam.

If the workers, for one bright, shining moment were able to bring about a paradise for the people, even only for a short time THAN surely, one day, it can happen again.The second part is a small timeline of minor and major events.The last part greatly adds to the author's writings with photos on daily life, militiamen and militiawomen, meetings, ruins, tanks and more.I would of liked to have more, but I think the book really helps you see the beginning of the war from the view of the people instead of, like the larger books do, filling your head up with names, parties, political movements, every leader who picks up a gun and so many details you can't keep it all straight."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont like it!","review":"I dont like it at all.

I think Mr McAulffe did an outstanding job in researching his grandmother's life and reviewing the history of the Osage Tribe in Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma. I made friends with the Osages I met and understand, by having known them, what it means to be an Osage. Mr. McAuliffe made it plain why this Tribe became wealthy through their negotiating skills with the The Great White Father's agents. I understand why Mr. McAuliff is proud to be an Osage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good reporting - yet author simplifies his \\"minority status\\"","review":"Although this book brings an excellent historical perspective (of a tragic period in the Osage history) to its readers, the author should have refrained from giving the book a \\"Dances With Wolves\\" feel when talking about his new-found identity as an Osage Indian. I found it particularly out-of-place when the author says he, \\"as a white man\\", used (or I believe abused) his piece of Indian heritage to try to get a job. Unfortunately, his tone at the beginning of the book turned me off to the rest (and subsequently best part!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Progressive rock revisited","review":"I indeed recommend this recording, it is a very interesting musical experiment of how groups like Yes could have been if the had turned in a different direction.

Flash is anti-synergism. One can listen and appreciate the great talent of the individual musicians but collectively it just doesn't work.

I waited forever to get this album, and could barely stand school on that tuesday when it came out. When I got it I was so upset. But I guess if I didnt compare it to Break the Cycle, than it is by far one of the greatest albums of all time. Aaron's voice and writing has evolved so I will say that, but it doesnt hit the mark. The songs seem so sugar coated as a opposed to the first three albums. But I would suggest to anyone to get this album and get the other three they are by far the greatest writing ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Staind I Know","review":"I've been a fan of Staind since the 1999 days of Dysfunction, and when Break the Cycle was released, I thought that there was nothing these guys could do wrong that would ruin their career. Well I bought 14 Shades of Grey and found it very disappointing. I'm not one to rag on soft music, but Staind is not the band to go more soft than hard. Sure there are some great songs on hear like \\"How Bout You\\" and \\"Yesterday,\\" but I can't buy into this cd at all, even after a few listens. Do yourself a favor and go buy Break the Cycle. That's a classic Staind. Hopefully, Staind will realize that they need to get their balls back from the media and stop putting out this weak material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"I really tried to like this CD, as I liked Break the Cycle.

INCREDIBLE!","review":"This is the most touching piece of artwork I've ever had the pleasure of listening to.Every track is laced with pure emotion that shows you how much the band has grown over each album.My personal favorite is \\"Zoe Jane\\" which is about Aaron Lewis' daughter, and it's the most beautiful song I've heard since I started listening to staind in 99'.I rate this album 5 stars because it is the most emotionally driven album I've ever listened to.BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More melodic than past albums","review":"[...] This CD works much more in the slower department of strong chords and high notes in the background. Here are my reviews for some of the songs.Price to play 7.5/10-a single, one of the faster songs, nice chorus and great opening riff, but it lacked a creative bridgeHow about you 7/10-easy on the ears, definitely more positive lyrics than usualSo far away 9/10-beautiful song, great chorus, great bridgeYesterday 8/10-once again, a faster song, with a great beat and a cool bridgeFray 8.5/10-cool little intro, a nice interlude between chorus, and an awesome, heartfelt chorusZoe Jane 8/10-not spectacular, but a nice ode to aarons babyFill me up 10/10-beautiful song, pure perfectionThat is the best first half of a CD i have ever heard, but the tracks become more mediocre after that. Still, the playing is stepped up a notch from btc in this more introspective album. Check out this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Staind- 14 shades of grey review","review":"This cd is the greatest!

But a lot of people also mention how Staind is fake, with the unreal depression. I don't know the band, I won't defend Aaron Lewis saying his depression was all an act, but I'm at a rather severe loss for finding that fake side on this album.Regardless of whether or not it's an act, Staind has tried something new, instead of following the same old direction that most \\"metal/nu-metal/hard-rock/whatever you want to call it\\" bands are going in.Personally I found this more quiet ballad-filled album to be a nice break from the same old \\"My Life Sucks Give Me Money\\" dribble that everyone else is singing.Obviously not for the hardcore, but this is something the contemporary listener can enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"14 shades of greatness!","review":"I loved this cd the only problem i sorta have with it is it all sounda like one big song aside from a few most of the songs sound exactly the same and i often mix them up so theres the minus of 1 star for the lack of originality but lucky for staind its one kick ass long song. The stand out songs on this album are Price to play, so far away, fray, and zoe Jane which are all great songs. I definitley reccomend this song to all its a great cd and its always good to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this CD","review":"Wow... I got this cd because of the song \\"so far away\\" simply because of an \\"x\\" so I didnt really listin to it at first. But then, I started to listin to it, and I really really really liked it. I couldnt stop listing! I really liked most all of the songs... 1-10 are the best!... in my oppion. I would recomend this cd to anyone! this is so cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, repetative, DISSAPOINTING!","review":"Unlike the great Junior effort of Cold, Staind's new CD falls short of every expectation I had. I am an \\"old school\\" Staind fan and I'm sick of everyone saying that the third Staind album is coming out. It's the fourth album and the worst. There are no memorable guitar riffs, no angry, brutal lyrics, just a CD filled with talking about how good life is. It's great that Aaron is happy now, but with the happiness comes a type of music that speaks to MTV TRLers instead of people who enjoyed Tormented and Dysfunction. The riffs and lyrics are repetative and at times may drive the listener insane. I suggest buying the new Deftones or Cold album, because they still have \\"it.\\" It's too bad my favorite band has lost \\"it.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not going to say much....","review":"I was extremely disappointed by this cd. I'm not going to trash the band because they put out a cd that completely related to me and helped me through some problems (Dysfunction), but this cd is just not my thing. It's too pop rock.

However, the only similarity between this tripe and the White Album is a monochromatic cover.This is a lackluster poor excuse for a follow up to their previous albums.

This cd is mellow radio rock not at all what the first two Staind cd's were (and no Break the Cycle is not their second cd)I think Aaron has an incredible voiceand mix that with screaming guitars and you have got a winner but alas there are no screaming guitars on this one.Comming soon to your local soft hits radio station!All you Johnny come latley's that jumped on at Breack the Cycle will love it old school Staind fans......time to move on !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing","review":"This album is even softer and more mainstream sounding than the already dissapointing \\"Break the Cycle\\" Aaron Lewis continues his pity party with whiny high pitched vocals. The music is very perdictable and boring. If you have heard \\"Its been a while\\" you have heard just about every single song on this new album. This was a waste of money. Go spend your money on the new Cold or Deftones album. This album blows chunks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop the whining!!!","review":"...This is one of the most whiny, boring albums I've ever heard. I thought Billy Corgan was a whiner but this sad sack takes the cake. No more whining about mommy/daddy issues! Enough already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Staind Hits Hard","review":"Staind's album of 14 Shades of Grey will keep your ear glued to the speakers from start to finish. This is a softer side of Staind then most of their other albums, but is in my opinion the best. It can give you hard core rock with the incredible song \\"Fray\\" and \\"Price To Play\\", followed up by a great display of softer rock with the hits, \\"How About You\\" and \\"Zoe Jane\\". This album is the complete package and definately worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cashin in","review":"14 Shades of Grey is Staind's way of trying to obtain more pop success. What happened to more the heavier(but not too heavy) rock songs that I enjoy. Break the Cycle had these type of songs(ex. Fade and For You). When I bought this CD I was expecting more songs like this, but instead you get more melodic songs like \\"how About You\\" and \\"Fray.\\" Staind's success that they had with \\"Its Been a While\\", \\"Outside\\", and \\"Epiphany\\" had obviously gone to their head and they decided to make practically a whole cd of these types of songs. Maybe this is just a progressive trend to a more melodic tone, but I'm sure it seems to many of people that they are just looking to cash in. What happened to more rock tone that they had with \\"Mudshovel\\" and \\"Suffer?\\" This is the type of sound I expected with 14 Shades of Grey. If Staind keeps going in this direction with their next album they can not expect me to come along with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected that!","review":"If anyone has read my review on Break the Cycle would probably know that my opinion about Staind is extremely negative. Anyway, as I expected, this album offers nothing new. The tunes are too predictable: Every time while listening to any of the songs you feel what the next note or chord are going to be. Staind's musical visions are too limited, they show no creativity on this project, only humming the same tunes over and over again.I was very passionate when reviewing Break the Cycle because I felt its success as great injustice. Now, I am calmer since I can see that this album's going to put the band where they belong. That means: out of the charts for good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No matter what you say they sold out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Take it from a huge Staind fan.I'm not saying they sold out because they have softer songs now, I'm saying they sold out because this album is pretty much exactly like Break the Cycle. Don't get me wrong, I like this album, but Staind hasn't really evolved since their last album.Take Tormented, for example. It has tons of awesome,heavy songs but the songwriting and production aren't the best. Then came Dysfunction. It had great, heavy songs, the songwriting was great and the production kicked. Then Break the Cycle. The songs were softer, but it had some of the best songwriting ever! Now with 14 shades of Grey, Staind repeated what made Break the Cycle so great, making at best a mediocre album. The only tracks that stood out for me were \\"Layne\\" a tribute to AIC singer Layne Staley. And the single \\"Price to Play\\". Download if you have the time. The only thing really cool about this is the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and enjoy \\"Break the Cycle","review":"If you're looking for the good old Staind, look again. This CD is full of rock ballads. If slow mushy songs are your thing, this CD might be for you. I can take a few of them, but I like Staind's hard edge, like we have heard on their past CD's. Aside from the singer's distinctive voice, this sounds like a different band. Pretty disappointing, especially since their last CD was so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"Every member of Staind (Fred Durst helped them out there) should be shot. Their fans should be shot to, it's fine if they hate their parents for feeding them and giving them a home and putting up with their whiny ass all their life, but do we really need a guy that's an adult sining about it? How about his desire to kill himself and it's all his parents fault? oh boo hoo grow up kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hackneyed, Trite, Unoriginal...","review":"This is a horrible CD. I first heard the single when they played live on a talk show. This band honestly has no more talent than most of the garage bands in my neighborhood, and probably less. Their guitars were out of tune, the \\"singer\\" had no sense of pitch whatsoever, and the chord progression is the most overused in pop history. I can't believe labels are still releasing songs like this. Any idiot with one guitar lesson could write a Staind song. Hell, they'd probably write something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAIND sucks","review":"Just when I expect Staind to have advanced beyond the level of regurgitated death metal riffs, they turn around and write a pop album. While they try to capture the best elements of an easy-going top 40 album and a hard rock death metal album, it's really just pop when you turn the rock over to see what's underneath. I always thought if Aaron Lewis wanted to be a psychiatrist, just quit the music business and get his Master's degree, because all his lyrics are about are his gripes and moans about his lost childhood. It reminds of a therapy session. I don't want to be reminded of therapy when I listen to your music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm","review":"Unfortunately i was waiting more of Staind but thats Life. Our expectations are somtetimes more that reality! lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most boring Album From Staind","review":"I bought this album thinking that it would be as good as Break the Cycle. I was very disappointed to find out that there would be only one song that was ok and only ok to me which is the last song Intro. This album doesn't catch my attention any. All the songs are the same tempo, very slow. The lyrics are all about the same. No loud guitar riffs or faster pase songs. And as for the DVD, not worth watching.

Staind has done it again by putting out another great album without being repetitive of their previous releases. This album is anything short of awesome, from it's heart-felt, yet powerful lyrics right down to it's still dark guitar riffs and kicking drums. If you have not already heard this album or own it and are a fan of Staind, what are you waiting for?! You will NOT be disappointed. Although I think very highly of this album, it is not totally perfect. Nothing is, and nothing ever will be perfect. BUT, this album is pretty close. It has everything on it, from heavy and dark songs to the nice, mellow ballads including one of my favorites, 'Zoe Jane'. Therefore, I stand behind my rating above and I give '14 Shades of Grey' 4- stars. And if by some chance Aaron, Mike, Jon, or Johnny read this review, I would just like to say: GREAT JOB, GUYS! Keep on rocking."},{"rating":"2","title":"14 Shades of Grey","review":"I just love this new album!!! When I heard, Price to Play, I new I had to get this Staind album, too.

I thought the CD would be OK, but after listening to it twice, I am totally addicted to this album. Many people say its not hard enough, but you have to admit this was a great effort by Staind. Lyrics and guitar work are great. True, i don;t care for some of the softer slower songs, but most are just great. So don't trash this album cuz its not hard enough for you. Maybe they decided to do someting diffrernt? Give them a break!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!!","review":"I think this cd is great. I think after awhile a person's life changes (in this case Aaron Lewis') On this record there are defintaly more \\"happy\\" songs, such as \\"So Far Away\\" and \\"Zoe Jane\\" but they work, and they have a nice flow. Sure the old Staind was heavier, but you definately get the best of both worlds as far as heavy, like \\"Price to Play\\" and my favorite \\"Yesterday\\" so it works. Another great CD by Staind!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great not perfect","review":"this really deserves 4 stars but i give it 5 because on days when it raining or ur really pissed at someone or just feel down songs like\\"so far away\\" and \\"yesturday\\" make you forget or give you in a sense a break from the world and just rock out and thats why it gets 5 stars. Or in other words it can give you a soundtrack to your life on bad days"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"This cd is alright. The songs can get old though as only a few appeal to my interest. However, I do enjoy listening to them every once and a while because some of their songs give you that rush.Again, this cd is only alright. It could be better, but it is a good cd to purchase if you want to hear some heavier rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Dysfunction or Tormented","review":"I like this cd, my favortie song is Layne. It has a nice AIC feel to it. In my opinion Staind is better as a heavy band, not a radio friendly band. TORMENTED their indie release is a great cd. Dysfunction is cool too, but they definetly changed with Break the cycle. All Staind fans should own this cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"14 Shades of Grey","review":"I bought Staind's 14 shades of Grey the very day it came out.

Is Staind going soft now?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gr8 CD","review":"This is a great cd.

Break the Cycle had a very good mix of fast and heavy to slow and melodic songs that made for a great mix. It is a good album with some good songs, my favorites are \\"so far away\\" and \\"layne\\". I have been a fan since I first heard mudshovel 4+ years ago and have enjoyed their progression. Hopefully they they get back to the heavy stuff next time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Staind's newest release starts of very promising (Price to Play)and then goes downhill very very fast. I guess they figured out the commercial sappy droning ballad that gave them commercial success. What happened to the great hard riffs (A Flat, Spleen, Crawl, Pressure, etc.) If you like Staind for the hard rock they can play then save your money because this album just drones on and on from one sappy ballad to another.

This cd is so [bad]and a total dissappointment. I know, that's my opinion. But if you're expecting anything like Mudshovel from Dysfunction or anything off of Break The Cycle, you'll be totally let down. Now I bought it on reputation. I gave it a listen twice, well I tried twice. I couldn't get through it the second time. I have been defending them since the Cycle came out to all my buddies, but no more. This is [awful]....They are all wimpy. I'm sure the radio will push some song, but that's when I'll switch the station. I'll stick with Chevelle, Flaw, From Zero and 40 Below Summer. They rock, Staind sucks. It gets no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved the last, but this was just [unacceptable material]","review":"Back in 2001 staind took the rock world by storm. While the songs weren't the greatest, they were catchy and very marketable. This time there is no postives whatsoever. The lyrics are artificial, the instrumentals are imporved, but they won't sell because they differ greatly from that in which the fanbase desires. I tried to listen to the entire album with an open mind, but around the 8th track I had had enough. Hopefully in their next album staind will return to what they are good at, decent and marketable rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"When rockers are happy, the music suffers","review":"I've read a few of the reviews on this album and I agree with anyone's assesment that happiness is not something to play or write heavy metal music to. Dysfunction was a great album and I still enjoy listening even after several years of listening to it. But this fru-fru lovey dovey album is just not them! Hey guys, stick to one formula. Developing your music is fine but this radical change to \\"hey, I feel great, and you should too!\\" is just no good. Buy Dysfunction, listen to someone's copy of Break the Cycle, and leave this at the store. You'll be happier in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"I never liked staind because they always bored me and continue to do so...All the songs are realy slow and its not heavy at all.

Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite A Change!","review":"when i think of staind, i think 'angst', 'depressing', 'heavy'. they kinda changed that with this album and it's not all that great of a change. i like the cd, unlike everyone else i actually like price to play b/c i don't listen to the radio all that much so therefore i haven't heard it a million times. i like so far away and zoe jane, basically everything everyone else. i also thought it was cool the way they made 'layne' sound exactly like an AIC song, AIC being one of the greatest bands ever. and considering i just bought this album, i'm sure after time i'll like it even more, but for now, if you want the best of staind, get 'break the cycle'. songs like 'epiphany' and 'for you' don't have a match or a similarity with anything on this new album."},{"rating":"1","title":"14 Shades of ...yawn","review":"I'll start by saying that I was a big Staind fan before this debacle. Tormented, Dysfunction and Break The Cycle were all very good. Each release building from the one before it.I expected a real masterpiece with this new disc.Well, I didn't get it. In fact, this CD is a great sleep aid.Every song is pretty much the same. Sad verse, sad soaring chorus, sad verse, etc. What happened to the band that actually rocked? The thing I liked about this band was the two sides they represented-the light AND the shade. This is just boring, radio friendly, sit by the window and cry manure. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"This album doesn't even deserve a 1/2 star. Usually a band will steadily grow and progress with each new album, Staind has done a complete 180: peaking with Dysfunctional and progressively getting worse with the last two LP's.

This album just isn't up to par with Tormented, Dysfunction, and Break the Cycle. WHERE ARE THE DEEP LYRICS??? We are used to Staind giving us lyrics that leave us in awe. Lyrics that help us to feel their pain. But lyrically Aaron just doesn't seem to have the passion he had in prior albums. Above all though this is still a descent record. But as a avid Staind fan...I was quite dissapointed. I was expecting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"It makes me sick!","review":"Ummmmm... Since when was Staind a softcore rock band. They should consider doing a colaberation with Kenny G, they could call it Gettin' Old. I was so pumped about the new staind cd after hearing price to play i went out and bought the cd right away... bad idea. Staind has lost all its cred and gone out and made a CD that i would let my 4 yearold listen to. I miss the staind of old when they were making songs like epiphany and outside. Now, now theyre just making 2 good radio songs and 10 piles of turd. DONT BUY. If your looking for better cds get Colds \\"year of the spider\\" or Disturbed's \\"Believe\\", you wont be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost their balls","review":"Ok. The first 4 songs were good. But the whole album sounds like Nickelback. Where's the balls man? All ballads don't cut it. This is not Metal, or even Rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing and unique","review":"I thought it would be difficult for Staind to release an album that would top Break the Cycle, but they did it. I just got the CD yesterday and I can't stop listening to it. Every song is amazing. I find myself concentrating on the music one time and the lyrics the next, both are incredible. You can really relate to and feel the emotion in all the songs. Truly inspiring and unique. Just buy it and you'll see."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best staind CD yet","review":"I have all the staind CD's and this is the best yet.Staind has alot more feelings in the songs. I've told everyone I know to go and buy \\"14 shades of gray\\".if your new to staind music or you followed staind form the start you'll love this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"let's be real this is crap","review":"Okay, I used to like this band, back when I was a sophomore in high school, and the only knowledge I had of rock and roll was what they played on the local \\"heavy\\" rock station. I soon broadened my musical palate, and in doing so discovered how whiny, derivative, uninspired, and trendy Staind is. Their sound is completely boring and washed out. Grey, indeed. Go ahead and click the unhelpful button! Come on, Staind fans, show me how mad you are! Then go listen to Aaron cry about his \\"pain.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Staind","review":"If you are looking for something new and exciting from Staind, don't buy this album. If you are looking for haunting lyrics, lots of guitars, and an album that rocks, then this is the album for you. I don't hear anything new or different; but then again, I wasn't really looking for that. I like Staind for who they are and the music they produce. Sometimes change is not good and it is best to stay with what works. The band footage on the special additional DVD that was included was pretty cool too."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good, but kinda different","review":"I just picked up this cd last night, and I think it is very good, It is alot lighter then I expected. It still sounds like a Staind record, but don't expect the heavy guitars like on Dysfunction. The song writing is very good. Aaron's lyrics are awesome on this album. I think the best songs on the album are \\"Price to play\\", \\"Zoe Jane\\" and \\"How About You\\", but all of the songs are good."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPEND???","review":"What happend to this band? They were good. I am VERY dissapointed with staind's last to records. All of their new songs sound so much alike it's not even funny. I hear songs like \\"so far away\\" and I start to think of \\"it's been a while\\" or \\"outside\\". Staind's best album by far is Dysfunction. This band had been sold out to MTV. How often do you see the video for \\"Mudshovel\\" or anything else off Dysfunction??? Hardly ever. Why? I don't now, someone please tell me. Anyway, if I had it to do over again, I would not buy the last to CDs. If you have purchased them, use them as coasters for your drinks or as hockey pucks, certainly don't subject your ears to the music that's on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"more useless garbage","review":"I can think of about 3,000 bands with more talent in their big toe. This is just more whiney (and I mean whaaaaney) garbage music like most of the mainstream junk that's popped up over the last decade. This is one of the most annoying bands I have ever heard. ALL their singles sucked [whaaaaaaaaney]. Quit following the mainstream herd of sheep and find yourself some real music...simple minds for a shallow society."},{"rating":"2","title":"14 SHADES OF GREY","review":"Once more Aaron Lewis is able to express himself aloud through his lyrics accompanied by his band to help the lyrics flow. The sound matches to the moods of the song, letting you feel what the lyrics say. The band makes a list of talents, coming up with note after notes of ingenious music. This cd is awesome and I recommend it to anyone who looks for music with true life in it, both lyrically and musically. They have always been able to demonstrate themselves as creative musicians, i recommend all of their music. It's pure bliss."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Side of Staind","review":"Staind latest CD is different but still has the feel of being Staind. great guitar licks and emotional lyrics. With Staind being usually deep and dark, they had a change on most of the songs. With fame and happiness taking effect on the lyrics, you can still relate. Now Staind is there for all ur moods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cd","review":"Excellent Cd! Definitely worth the money to buy! Very impressive album; Staind just gets better and better with the more albums they make!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD Rocks!","review":"This album isn't as hard as the other three, but it still rocks. \\"Yesterday\\" and \\"Fray\\" are two of the best songs, I think. If you like all out headbanging, you probably won't be happy with buying this one. If that is your preference, you should go to [out] and buy \\"Tormented\\". That's the only place you can get Staind's first CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"break the cycle 2...but not quite...read to understand...","review":"Staind's first album... FIRST album Tormented is totally different than all three albums combined, very hard, screaming, yes, the album is \\"tormented \\" lives up to its name. Its ok, different but ok. Then they come out with dysfunction, a great album with a hard rock edge to it (\\"mudshuvel\\", \\"crawl\\"). Then comes break the cycle where Aaron slows it down a bit for the melodies but still keeps it kinda hard with a mix, yet a really great album. And now 14 shades of grey, where he still has that melodic, hard mix but its not quite up to break the cycle's standards. There are some songs on 14 shades of grey that are not their best work honestly. One specifically, which is a tribute to lane of alice in chains, where he switches his style up to try to make the song sound like an alice in chains song, it doesnt quite work for Staind. But it is an ok album. Yet, Staind is an awesome band in general, so any thing they do cant be too dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I used to love 'em","review":"But times have changed. When my older brother turned me onto the good bands to come out of the early 90's grunge scene(Soundgarden, Tad and Alice in Chains), I couldn't listen to Staind the way I used to. In fact, I gradually began to realize that most nu metal sucks, even though I myself was a diehard fan.I didn't buy this album, I just shrugged and checked it out at a friend's house. It is a lot less depressing, but also less interesting. Aaron Lewis and his band must have a fair amount of money by now, yet they still complain about how much childhood sucks.Gimme a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"huge dissapointment","review":"I bought this album expecting another great CD from staind. Man was I dissapointed. I didn't really like \\"Price To Play\\" when I heard it on the radio but I still expected a great album from Staind. At first listen I didn't like a single song on the album. There were only 2 songs I didn't like on Dysfunction and Break the Cycle combined. After a couple more listens, I realized how great \\"So Far Away\\" is but still thought the rest of the album was alright but nothing good. It sounds like you're listening to the same song over and over and it's not even good. The plusses are that they gave Layne Staley some respect by writing a song for him and the DVD made it worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I understand bands change but....","review":"This is definitely not the Staind I fell in love with. I won't go as far as to say they've sold out but now that Aaron has a few million in his pocket, he suddenly runs out of good things to sing about. \\"14 Shades of Grey\\" was a result of this and is therefore exactly what I have listened to numerous times: Endless, monotonous, unoriginal garbage. I know that bands do change, and I understand. However, I have to say that as Aaron's sadness disappeared, so did his talent. I still have faith in them though."},{"rating":"2","title":"14 Shades of Grey is a solid album through and through","review":"Many artists have a hard time producing a great album that lives up to the hype after selling 6 million copies on the previous LP. This is the first album of the year that does. There aren't the huge singles like \\"Outside\\" or \\"It's Been Awhile\\" but this is one of those rare cd's you can pop in your cd player and listen to every song. \\"Price to Pay\\" may have been the first single but it is not the best. \\"So Far Away\\" and \\"How About You\\" will be the next 2 singles and there are about 5 other songs that could be the 4th single.Break the Cycle had 5 or so great songs but the rest of the album lacked depth. It just wasn't something you wanted to listen to. There are a lot of people who will criticize this album as being soft but ignore them. This is a great album that will have a lot of success over the coming months."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING","review":"Warning. If you like Dysfunction or Tormented and are giving Staind one more chance to get heavy, don't bother picking this one up. This CD is dreadful. Very slow, not heavy at ALL. The tribute to Layne Staley is really bad but it is the highlight of the CD. I'm sure if you liked Break the Cycle, you will love this junk, its even slower and more radio friendly. So, I say goodbye to Staind, a band I once loved, because they have lost me as a fan. I understand that Staind has moved on as a band, but for me its the wrong direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Staind not that old Staind","review":"WOW Staind has changed a lot lately this album is pure horrible when I heard \\"Price To Play\\" i think that's thy name it was too REPETETIVE like in chorus i think it was 3 minutes and a half and 30 seconds of thy song and it's just bad my friend got me this album and it's just that bad it's horrible!!!! notthing to see ppl you guys want to check out some good \\"metal\\" bands go for Arch Enemy or something like cause Staind is like Britney Spears in the \\"Hard Rock\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star = smart people, 5 stars = stupid and fooled people","review":"WAKE THE HELL UP!!! This is not metal this is not even rock. Nu-metal is dying and rotting and here's an example like this terrible band. This album was created in a garbage bag. Real rock people toss this CD out of the window and get something like Blind Guardian or Iced Earth or maybe Stratovarius. Staind, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit and others are totl s**t they are like music from your flushed toilet. 14 shades of crap this album should be named. The others break the cycle and dysfuntion are also c**p. Aaron Lweis's voice in not comparable to Hansi Kursch or Bruce Dickenson. I feel pitied to the victims of nu-s**t-metal because media is showing the stupid vesion of it. There no solos there are no creativity in guitars. My 3 yrs old nephew plays this terrible music. STAIND SSSSSSSSSUUUUUUUUUUUUXXXXXXXXX."},{"rating":"1","title":"Staind is dead","review":"Frnakly I was quite disappointed by this album. Apparently Staind died once its glory emerged. Its music reminded me more of the Nickleback and other pseudo rock bands playing kind of ballads with a mediocre originality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did Staind go?","review":"Why is it when a band get famous they suddenly think they need to make their next album all artsy fartsy. This is'nt the Staind I know. Price to Play is about the only song somewhat worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"14 shades of fantasic melodies","review":"14 Shades of Grey is by far the most intiricatly musical album the guys of Staind have put out. While there are the usual heavy signature Staind songs with the power vocals, difficult drum lines, and pounding guitars, there are many more melodic, dare I say \\"power ballads\\" on this album. The final song, oddly titled, \\"Intro,\\" can be easily described as a heavier and more powerful \\"Epiphany\\" from \\"Break the Cycle.\\" Overall, the entire is much more positive and flowing rather than the depressing, anger powered freshman and sophomore relases. 14 Shades of Grey delievers everything a hard core Staind fan wants, and so much more. Every rock fan needs this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they even bother making this","review":"I have been a fan of Staind's since the \\"Dysfunction\\" days. Then ventured onto Tormented and was eventually hooked. I had hope that they wouldn't go soft, and low and behold, what do they do, they go soft. For those of you that liked the lighter moments of Break The Cycle, this is the album for you. I listened to it the day it came out, I was furious because it was soft, the next day I listened for lyric content. Lyrically, it's a more happier Staind, but nonetheless, it's Staind. I, however, am not a fan of the album, and not sure whether or not to hope the next album will be the real Staind or to just give up. We'll see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Staind has gone soft!","review":"I purchased this cd with high hopes, especially since I really enjoyed Staind's first two albums. But unfortuantely, they have gone soft in a major way. They have sold out to the MTV lifestyle. The majority of the songs are quite soft, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but they suck too. The vocals are off key and the backgrounds are horrid. The first song on the album is pretty good, but it is all downhill from there. Track three is the worst, I think they sound like a boy band with guitar riffs. Oh well, they used to rock and I will still listen to Dysfunction and enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want a refund...","review":"Some people may like this new album, but for me it's too far away from the music that made me a Staind fan. They even managed to follow suit with Creed...just listen to 'Zoe Jane', song 6 I believe. It's the sequel to 'Arms Wide Open'. Although, on this new album, Staind has even gone softer than Creed. Don't let 'Price to Play' fool you, this is a soft rock CD. If I could get a refund for an opened CD, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this Staind?","review":"I bought this cd being a huge Staind fan. I thought Dysfunctional and Break the Cycle were great, so I'm not a Staind hater. This cd isn't even hard rock. It's more along the lines of Michael Bolton meets Justin Timberlake. Price to Play is the heaviest song on the album and the only song which his scream occurs. Track #6 sounds like a O-Town song. Track #2 sounds emo. Track #3 is happy enough to make any true Staind fan puke. Maybe the sold out, maybe their label has them on a leash, but whatever it is, it's horrible. If you want good pop songs, this is the cd for you. If you want a new Staind cd, don't come here."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to this band?","review":"I guess I got spoiled with Dysfunction, which was Staind's second album back in 1999. That album had it all, the angst, the fury, and the emotion. 14 Shades of Grey is absolutely horrible, it is worse than Break The Cycle and that is not saying much. Oh well, at least they payed homage to one of rock's greatest singers, Layne Staley, but they could have been more original with that song. I am sorry Staind fans, don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is too much","review":"All the lead singer is doing is whinn. Go get some therapy and sing better songs. The bands playing is annoying too. No wonder why no one talks about this crappy album. Cause it sucks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is The Best Cd Ever!!!","review":"14 Shades Of Grey is a triumph for Staind i thought Break The Cycle was great but this blows it out of the water Zoe Jane is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. Fray is also a great song. Layne blew me away on how much they sounded like Alice In Chains great song in memory of Layne Staley. But my favorite song on is is So Far Away I love that song. Ive had the cd on repeat everynight since i bought it i recommend it to anyone and everyone. GREAT ALBUM!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"you wont believe it!!! its perfect!!!!!!","review":"This album is by far one the the best albuns ever...in break the cicle you can still feel a lot of anger, pain and suffer bottled up inside...which makes you feel that you're not alone, but in this alone you feel cured, its like a therapy, coz aaron feel the same way too, and he can transmit that feeling to us...the song to his daughter and wife ( i supose !! )are specially beautifull, and i dedicated every sing word of the song layne to aaron lewis !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great sound, hard or not","review":"Ok so here's how it breaks down. Staind's new CD is a great album for 3 main reasons:1. Although they somewhat changed their sound from hard to humble, they made a great transition.2. The songs on this CD are emotional and deep, which really stands out from the industrial written [garbage] around the country.3. I would have to agree that a few songs sound similar, but every song leaves you wanting to hear the next, and so on.My Favorite Tracks (no particular order):\\"Zoe Jane\\" - very deep and emotional, great lyrics\\"How About You\\" - one of the more upbeat songs on the album\\"Layne\\" - eerie almost, awesome sound, great tribute to AIC\\"Yesterday\\" - great chorus, awesome vocals\\"Price to Play\\" - hard song, a refreshing difference on the CDTo sum it up: This CD is a great buy/download, and don't listen to people saying it [stinks] because it aint hard. It's great music, and that's how it shall be judged, not by whether it's hard or not.--- Matt Dog"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, anyone who doesn't own it realy shoud!","review":"Staind has produced another great CD, following their great break through with Break the Cycle(no punn intended) they follow it up with yet another stunning performance with great guitars and vocals. Zoe Jane, So Far Away, and Price to Play are obvious hits but the whole CD packs a great punch that makes you satisfied to a full extent. This album is 14 shades of awesome(I know that was corny, but whatever)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its great","review":"I like Staind because it seems to reflect my personality. I like the cd because it has a blend of great tracks that flow with mood like Break the Cycle, Staind's first album. I have read others reviews, and it seems as if it is just a bashing for the band. For someone who like at least one of their songs, i would recomend purchasing this cd. And for those who havent really listened to this band, i suggest you check them out and see if they are to your liking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as I Hoped","review":"I don't really mind the change that Staind has made in there music. I like some of the new stuff they have out, but after listening to the whole cd I can't say that it is that great of an album. The beginning of the cd is good, till about song six or seven, then its down hill from there. I don't know what happend, they just couldn't finish the good cd they started."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"Staind's second best album.

Dysfunction was by far a great cd. Break the cycle wasnt too bad, but a little soft. 14 Shades of Grey is a contstant reminder that bands like to sell out to try and make more money. My opinion? if you like older staind you're going to hate this cd. If you go for more touchy feely music, you're gonna love it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Shades of Gray is an appropriate title as this album lacked the passion that previous albums had. I kept waiting for a song that would stand out and capture my attention, but one song just droned into the other. I did not enjoy this album at all and will probably sell it to a used CD store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run For your Life","review":"Wow! This album is garbage. It makes me wanna jump out a window it's so bad. Staind was my favorite band until I listened to the new album. There isn't one good song on the entire cd.

I havent really like staind since break the cycle but I thought Disfunction and Tormented were amazing so I always give them a chance.

If you ask me DO NOT buy this cd, total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.......................Awful!!!!!","review":"I've read all these reviews about people saying how Staind sold out or how Staind didn't progress with their music. I mean what the hell did you expect? Did you think Staind was gonna bust out some crazy mathcore album full of complex riffs and time changes? It's Satind, they're a Fred Durst band and that's all that should have to be said to get the point across. But unfortunately some 16 yr. old kid in Alabama wearing an ICP shirt who hates his adoring parents doesn't get it. Then I also see people writing about how Aaron Lewis really helped them through some tough times. HOW?!?!? SO basically he's proven that no matter what you do, no matter if your living out your dream life still sucks. I'm sorry this band sucks and so does anyone who supports it.

Actually I think this is Staind's hardest album yet, just listen to the lyrics and how powerful they are. Aaron Lewis leaves his lyrics imprinted into your head forever, one of the greatest voices and innovative writer of our time backed up by an unbelievable group of talented musicians. This album shows so much maturity and growth in their music. 14 Shades Of Grey redefines rock and gives me even more reason to love them as a band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrice Staind","review":"Staind's newest album 14 Shades of Gray, has that same special something about as Break the Cycle and Dysunction. Staind's music contains a little something something most other bands dream about, it's called truth. Aaron Lewis is a real person, who has the ability to take his thoughts and emotions and turn them into an astonishing sound. All of Staind's albums are the kind you can pop into your CD player and get that feeling in the middle of your chest that makes you say [WOW!]. 14 Shades of Gray is definately worth the [money], pick it up, and if you have more money pick up BTC and Dysfunction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I think this is by far the best Staind cd.

These are so poorly made and bad quality it's not even funny. The wood has dings, nicks and cracks and has been sprayed with a 'cherry finish' to hide the poor quality. You have to assemble them which is fine if the pieces fit together properly but the joints are lose and flop around. The stairs come with a bunch of glue that you are supposed to used to 'weld' the stairs together and keep them from collapsing.

I put an old ottoman at the foot of my bed, its about 16 inches high, half the distance to the top of the bed. Now Casey can easly get on and off the bed using the ottoman.

So if it was moved and landed in the wrong position there would be no sound. I figured since this new cable i bought fit into the Western Digital HD TV Media Player it would fit into my receiver...not the case. It didnt even fit into the Xbox360.The problem is not that it doesnt fit, or that the end is too short, the problem is the teeth that hold it into place are not big enough.

It does have a tendency to pull out easier than other cables, but as other reviewers have suggested, cutting a but of the housing solves the problem. There is absolutely no need to pay more for a cable to get a digital signal from one spot to the next. It's a digital signal - either it gets there or not - the signal doesn't care if it's going over a $100 cable or a $5 cable. It still gets there. Save yourself the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great. Unbelievable price. Minor connector issue","review":"I purchased two cables, one for my Tivo HD to Onkyo receiver and the other for my Panasonic Blue Ray to Onkyo receiver. The connector did not want to stay in the Tivo optical port. I realized that the rubber body on the outside of the cable connector was to fat to fit into the recessed receptacle. It was hitting the square cut-out on the frame of the Tivo. After carefully shaving the outer casing of the connector with a razor blade, the cable pushed in far enough to make the proper connection and click in place. Both cables then worked great. Unlike analog signals, a digital signal either works or it doesn't. There is no such thing as a inferior cable introducing noise and degrading the picture. These cables work, period. If I spent lots of money for the cables, I would rate this lower because of the modification I needed to make, but getting two cables for less than $2, wow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Price WoW","review":"This Optical cable was a bargain on Amazon and works great.

I ordered four cables at the same time from the same seller and they arrived in one envelope, yet I was charged shipping for each individual cable for a total of $11.92. Combined shipping for all four together should have been at least half as much. The problem lies in Amazon shipping polices. I am not happy when people achive their profits in this round-about manner. Amazon refused my initial request to reduce the shipping charge.

Some reviewers have complained that the cable does not fit correctly and falls out. This has not been my experience at all - the cable connected perfectly and securely on both ends.

What I got was a very thin cable, no tethers for the caps, and the connectors are loose and go in crooked.See the customer photos that have the thin wire for what is shipping now for this item. The connectors on mine looked flimsy compared to the ones pictured, but they are similar. Maybe some people like the thin style cables. For me, they just seem too easy to damage. The bigger problem is the connectors.I ordered a different set at the same time as this one (Amazon 2 x 12ft by cablemart). I'm using the other set that are made with the standard cable diameter and the connector went in with the normal solid click."},{"rating":"2","title":"I might say excellent for the price.","review":"Well, I'm by no means an audiophile but I think you don't need to be an expert to know when something just works fine and in my personal case, this cable is just perfect.I think there's not much to say about a cable besides its quality and I might say It looks and feels very well made and certainly works the way it's meant to and let's be realistic.. for this price, it's just a bargain!I use it with my logitech Z-5500 speakers and so far I'm very satisfied with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm","review":"The cable shown in the picture is exactly what I got.

Eforcity shipped within reasonable time and the cable arrived in perfect condition. The connectors fit snugly in my Sony DVD player and Yamaha receiver and do not fall out. The protective caps are attached to the cable as shown, preventing them from getting lost. Many reviews could not believe how thin the cable was, but I found it to be very durable and plenty thick. I honestly could not believe the quality for this price. If the mixed reviews scare you, I would be sure to order from Eforcity.

Apparently, either the reviewers leaving positive feedback are getting cables with the correct prong length or they're buying these cables for another purpose.

The weight of the cable alone can cause it to fall out of the socket, but hey, I paid a couple of bucks for this, so, I can't complain...but then again, I can.

I am the type of person who researches things to death before making a decision to purchase and base it largely on reviews (both on Amazon and elsewhere on the internet). I ignored the reviews that said the cable was and that the connectors were small and would not fit snugly into the inputs/outputs on my tv and receiver. I was wrong...VERY wrong. When I opened up the package, the cable was thin, but I figured that it may still do the job. Then, much to my dismay, the connector ends were small and basically just slid into the input/output holes with room to spare around the edges. The cable would simply fall out of the tv and receiver if the cable was moved ever so slightly.Consider this your warning...DO NOT buy this. I tried to save 5 bucks and ended up with more headaches than it was worth. Plus, now I have to return it and order a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toslink","review":"This is a second time I have ordered the cable from this seller. The first time - 3 cables worked like a charm. Second order - 2 wires(thicker fabric) and this time I'm totally disappointed because once I connect the wire to my Samsung TV and Philips sound bar it simply pops out in one or another end...seems like the \\"head\\" is too short or something. I used a blade to remove some plastic so the it could get deeper in the slot, but sill it is not holding as good the ones from the first order."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does what it's supposed to do","review":"This is a good cable, nothing fancy and yes, it is flimsy and think, but so is fiber optic. That is precisely the beauty of FO, you only need to take the bits from one side to the other, no fancy gold connectors or think shielding. Don't spend more than you have to, this cable will do the same work as the $30 cable, you won't notice any difference because there is none.Two negative comments: one side of the cable was a little hard to fit into the DVR, not a perfect fit, but it just took 5 extra seconds, and it then it connected perfectly, i guess the have a little higher tolerances for the plastic case, but hey it's $2! Also, with the other cables I own, the little plastic caps that protect the fiber-optic are attached to the cable, you cannot lose them. Not the case here, it comes protected but once taken off, it's yours to store and lose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Item works as it should","review":"Nothing much to say.

This size matches perfect from my PS3 to my optical switch.Consider, if you would like a GREAT and expensive cable, it is no logic if not all your cables are \\"HQ\\" cables.

They came with standard RCA inputs but they also had a TOSLINK connector. As soon as I hooked up the audio from the std RCA to the TOSLINK he could hear an amazing amount of detail he was missing. He plays lots of shooter games and now he says he could hear guys creeping up from behind him.As far as I am concerned digital is always the way to go. You either get all the signal or you get none of the signal, it is as simple as that. Audio quality is super and the price was ridiculously low compared to what the big box stores want to charge - even Walmart was completely blown away.HDMI is my preferred means to connect AV but I had to compromise when my son wanted to integrate these headphones to play his XBOX 360. Overall Component/TOSLINK connections come really close to HDMI, I just have an extra 3 cables snaking behind my system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Value","review":"I ordered this product after spending 33 dollars on an identical product from RadioShack.

I have no idea why everyone here isn't having this problem. I must have gotten a cable from a bad batch.edit: I threw this cable in the trash since I didn't want to have to deal with some elaborate silly putty scheme to keep it in place while messing with my cables and went ahead an ordered the amazon brand version of this cable (AmazonBasics Toslink Digital Audio Optical Cable (6 Feet/1.8 Meters)).

I can only blame myself for buying this cheap alternative, it really was worth a shot, so no big loss. I did have to pay $5 in shipping though which is lousy. So overall i'd say buy at your own risk.

One day I was moving things around, unplugged the cable, plugged it in a few minutes later, and...my receiver gave an error indicating it couldn't understand the signal.

The major problem was that the remote speakers kept cutting off for a few seconds every few minutes although the speakers were just 15-20 feet away from the base unit. We tried the extended range option but that created a really bad delayed effect you could hear throughout the house. It was very disappointing and a real deal-breaker and we are sending it back.

I found myself confused. Maybe not so much confused as disappointed, as spy novels aren't my bag. Perhaps it's all metaphor, I thought. And what's with the film crews lurking in the background? Only twice did I read more than 20 pages at a sitting -- once at an airport and the last time was just to finish the darn thing. Which is also unfortunate, as I bought the book in Mexico and was looking forward to an intriguing read. It was a bit intriguing at times, sure. Ellis has a massive 6-plus-page sexual interlude about two-thirds of the way through, and then there's the celebrity stuff and some \\"cool\\" torture scenes. But mostly I found myself wondering: What's with this celebrity terrorist thing? Whatever."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited five years for this?!!!","review":"Well, really eight years I waited for a new novel from Ellis. In 1994, he published a collection of short stories titled \\"The Informers\\". I thought that it was pretty good but I couldn't wait to get the true follow up from the classic \\"American Psycho\\". First, the endless list of celebrities that are named are annoying. Second, what was the deal with the \\"camera crew\\"? I didn't understand whether the actor/model was actually being filmed or if the events were really happening. To make matters worse, there was a \\"second camera crew\\" informing him that he wasn't sticking to the script. WHAT??? Third, the book should have been titled \\"Loopholerama\\" because there were plenty of them. If Ellis' goal was to confuse and annoy the reader, he accomplished his mission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Countdown to...less than ever","review":"Cute gimmick Ellis uses in his new book: all the chapters in each section are numbered backwards to zero, except for the last section, which counts *up* from zero. Still, all the gimmicks in the world can't hide the fact that this is the same fake \\"oh, the world is so shallow\\" routine from an author well-known for his nightclubbing and partying. I count this book backwards to...one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"This book alternates between being boring, redundant, and vacuous (is this satire?) and revolting, shocking, and mindnumbingly repulsive.

So poor I couldn't even bring myself to read it. Send this man an idea, pleeeeze, he's been eating too many magazines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect writer for the 90's","review":"To understand the rise of Ellis, you have to understand modern publishing -- the more controversial the better. Ellis is the literary world's posterboy for controversy. And he'll stay there because controversy sells, especially to those elusive, non-reading but well-heeled 18 to 34-year-olds who will depart with their brass only if the experience of doing so fortifies and furthers their deeply-held desire of never appearing anything but cuurent and cutting-edge. So very 90's. The culture of immediacy. Forget talent. Forget art. Forget the days of old when authors wrote to bare their souls or change the world or both. In publishing, the risk is to over-shoot your mark, to miss the connect. So you meet your target audience head on and feed them the sensations they crave. Ellis is the pure reflection and product of our techno-age -- shallow, immediate, without heart, signifying nothing redemptive. And shouldn't that be the goal? Shouldn't we expect more?"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can tell where this one is going from about page two","review":"Some people will enjoy the repetitive, predictable, aren't-the-beautiful-people-truly-shallow-and-aren't-I-sensitive-for-pointing-this-out droning that comprises this \\"novel.\\" Different strokes for different folks, etc. But anyone who expects any real human or social insight, truly creative and incisive prose, complex characters, or an intriguing plot concept should skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Everytime I listen to KMFDM's \\"Megalomaniac\\", I am reminded of the 2nd half of this book. The lyrics seem to fit in nicely with the nihilism and pointlessness of this pile of rubbage.I will say that Victor is a \\"protagonist\\" that you can actually feel a shred of sympathy for, which instantly puts him a notch above Patrick Bateman.However, that's not to say that Victor isn't a self absorbed, vain, sociopathic scum bag that you could care less about. In fact, you could care less about him, just not much less.Typical Ellis nonsense that is tough to ignore, but has little to no shock value. If you've read one Ellis book, you know what you are getting into from the onset, and there really aren't many surprises in store for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total mess","review":"A complete waste of paper/time/money. 500 pages of utter lunacy.

Namedroporama?","review":"I might have enjoyed this novel if I hadn't had to wade through the piles and piles of name droppings. And hey, if I had a dollar for every time Victor put on a Prada suit, I would be rich. This is my first Bret Easton Ellis and I have to say, I don't think I have the strength to muddle through another. Thanks, but not thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"What???!!!!!!","review":"I love reading. But, if this were the first book I had ever read, I would be turned off reading forever! I knew Bret Easton Ellis doesn\`t write for the Norm after reading American Psycho (which I did like), but Glamorama loses it!. The book has no plot that makes sense. It jumps from being an almost logical story to one that seems like the author was having a major drug trip! Nothing is explained, there is no climax, no start and no finish. I don\`t recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real trip","review":"Ellis had to have been there. The mood he sets in each scene is astonishing, half the time you think YOU've been there. This one is too good. Up to now I thought Tom Wolfe's \\"A man in full\\" was the play, but no, \\"Glamorama\\" is the real trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glamorama by Bret Easton Ellis","review":"Reading this book is like watching a car accident. You are horrified and disgusted and fascinated, but can't seem to look away.Let me first say this. I am avid reader and ALWAYS finish books, but the first 100 pages of this one made me want to throw this one in the trash. The \\"hip\\" lingo was annoying, the characters are/were vapid and flimsy, the tone is muddled. But I hung in there, and found that I became captivated by the turn that the plot took, and although I have been frequently confused by some of the events (who are these directors? What movie are they making? And why is it so damn cold?), I am intrigued to see that Victor, the air-head model, is finally starting to get in touch with something resembling some emotions. I am not sure that the author is going to explain all of these vague coincidences and seemingly magical way that the bad guys can \\"alter\\" everything, including real life, but it sure has been an entertaining ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"can you give a book negative stars?","review":"If I only had the energy to find every person even remotely interested in this book, I would beg and plead with them to spare themselves the misery that I just experienced in reading this. It had to be the worst book I have ever read. I think BEE should find some way to pay back all those readers for the hours in their lives they've lost because this painfully annoying \\"novel\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great. Just Great.","review":"This is an excellent example of the stereotypical world that we live in. Specifically that of the late 1990's, and the celebrity culture that we as a society have come to exist within.I had to read this for a college course on Modern American Fiction.It was an excellent read, and I would like to sit and read through it agian, without having to take notes and examine the text, and read it as it was meant to be, as a novel for enjoyment, and as a comtemporary commentary on our society."},{"rating":"2","title":"laughably frightening","review":"Never has Euro-American elite cultural fashion been parodied so lovingly and viciously as in \\"Glamorama,\\" where Ellis renders celebrity, glamhood, and modelhood into a shimmering super-world of symbolism and semiotics where every interaction between Victor (the male model protagonist) and his urban elite friends and enemies speaks volumes about our late 20th century minds that are inseparable from the voluminous media they devour hourly. Unfortunately, however, the book becomes laughable in its second half as it attempts to depict fashion models as anti-Zionist terrorists working to influence American elections by blowing up Parisian cafes. Ok, sure, it's a cool idea. I'm not trying to be some kind of zealous nerd here. But it comes off as absolutely laughable, and Ellis betrays his total ignorance of world politics several times a page. You may think that this shortcoming is irrelevant to the book's goal, but it sure makes it damn hard to take seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confusing, but Enjoyable","review":"Glamorama, Bret Easton Ellis' latest book was, to me, very entertaining and interesting. At times, I was so confused, I backtracked to see if I had missed anything, but the plot and the character developement.. they're great. I especially liked how he elaborated on the relationships of people from previous books. I loved this book, even though the ending was quite confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a lot of name dropping","review":"I honestly did not finish the book-I only read maybe 50 pages. Every other paragraph was filled with a who's who name drop of the mid 1990's, which may be fine for exemplification of the story, but did little to entertain, especially reading it 10 yrs after it was published. The mixing of chapter parts had the potential to be interesting; I just didn't care enough to continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"This book is full of characters about whom we care nothing, with a plot that makes 100 Years of Solitude seem clear and concise. It's pretentious, annoying, and completely unrewarding. I liked Less Than Zero, so I plowed ahead, thinking that eventually something good would come of this book, but it just gets worse and worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's human, he'll die eventually.","review":"I've read all his works, up to Glamorama.I'm sick and tired of him. More and more viciousness, more and more shallowness. He writes about what he knows, which mostly seems to me the solipstic sociopathic universe centered on Times Square, with a diameter of about two miles.I'm praying that the superheated inhabitants of this little universe will soon self-combust: I'm tired of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a visit to a tourist trap","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read (er-sort of read; the last 2 sections I skimmed). Ellis' characters do not ring true in the least, and his too too precious manner of describing the very vanity and vapidity he is lampooning left me yawning. He acts as if he has a secret wistful admiration of all banal celebrity-driven things (and all things Prada--Jesus, aren't there any other designers in New York?), and one cannot have it both ways. You can't satirize if you are unaware of yourself. Even the ludicrous sex \\"scenes\\" were boring and unimaginative. This book is cheap, dumb, and doesn't quite know what to do with itself. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ellis fails to live up to his own hype","review":"Ellis wrote this book for himself, as he freely admits. That's how he always writes his novels. Of course, he has no problem then selling them and living off the profits.This book is sensationalistic at best, and incoherent and worthless at worst. The writing is mediocre, and Ellis seems awkward and overwhelmed as an orchestrator of the elements of story. The plot doesn't weave and flow so much as tangle on itself. There are a few exceptionally harsh (and maybe even poignant) moments in this novel, but otherwise it represents a school of writing that is high in pretension and low in richness and depth. This novel promises a lot but turns out to be a fickle friend which never completely delivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"And the Director yelled Cut!","review":"This dribble is a mindless romp into oblivion without the presence of a captivating protagonist. Where should I start?The Character: Mr Glamour Boy Victor Ward, is extremely boring particularly with his loud and stupid remarks. Victor's antics were about as exciting as watching paint dry. This is in stark contrast to Bateman, our beloved American Psycho who so artfully articulated his views of the world to us.The Story: The plot was just dry with no spark of life.This book however did prompt me to ask two questions: How can a talented writer produce this garbage? and What the hell was his editor thinking?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable contemporary fiction","review":"A great read from Bret Easton Ellis that lives up to the expectations of Less than Zero and re-established him as one of the best contemporary writers today. I rank Ellis up there with D.M. Roman (the author of Fried Calamari) as the leaders in contemporary fiction. While Glamorama meanders in the last third of the book, it is still a very worthwhile enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bret does it again..","review":"It is simple: You either like him or not.I do.Glamorama describes the celebrity-life in a way that shakes, stirs and shocks. The main character Victor is so hollowly described, and his life empty and without substance that you wonder where the author got his inspiration. As the plot goes along, and you find yourself in a different world, you ask yourself \\"How did he (Ellis) manage that?\\". Reading Ellis' books are like reading MTV. Tempo,tempo,tempo and always in the fast lane. Just like MTV, Bret Easton Ellis is here to stay. Read the book, and become hypnotized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This was the first book I read by Mr. Ellis and if this is any example of the rest of his work, please allow me to say \\"Don't Bother!\\" I found his writing to be jumpy and disjointed and relatively childlike in nature. There are about 1,000 subplots to the book that are never resolved and truth be told, I was never sure what the real plot was (if there was one to begin with!). The book reads like a who's who in early 1990's celeb circles. Mr. Ellis seems to want to make his readers know that he knows who's \\"in\\" and lists everyone from Kelsey Grammer to Bobby Flay. I shudder to think that all models/actors in the world are as shallow, idiotic and whiny as he represented them in his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to write a book like this one...","review":"Take Jay McInerney's Model Behavior, rip off the back cover, then take Frederick Forsyth's Day of The Jackal, rip the front cover. Then glue both books together... continuity? Forgetaboutit! This is absolutely one of the worst books I've ever read. Buy at your own risk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it seems to be.","review":"After skimming through other reviews, I thought this book was going to be like American Psycho. It isn't, though, it tries to be. 3/4 of the book is setting the scene (a serious version of Zoolander?), while the last part of the book is such a leap of faith into fiction that it was difficult to finish. Why does the author use Christian Bale as a character in this book? It's like he's just trying to cash in on the success of American Psycho. I like his writing style (except when he's naming so many celebrities, it's like he's just trying to fill a paragraph). This story just doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's going on in this book?","review":"It took me so long to finish reading Glamorama and after the umpteenth time I picked it up, I forced myself to finish it. It's a little confusing with all the name dropping and plot turns, but rather than being intriguing, it was much more of an effort to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title is fun, but not much else","review":"Didn't even finish the book. I didn't care enough about the characters to continue. What do I care about what happens to a witless, self indulgent male model? I couldn't relate to it and it wasn't original enough for that not to matter.Ellis always gets thrown into a litery catagory with Chuck Palahniuk but at the end of the day, Palahniuk's books feel fresh and original whereas the Ellis novels seem redundant and not all that interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"glamorama","review":"I read this book while on holiday with my annoying family, and it was the perfect way to get your mind off them. Though I had some trouble getting into the book, but once I did I never wanted to stop reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Contemporary Fiction","review":"For fans of contemporary fiction, this book is a winner although it tails off at the end and does not live up to the level of Less than Zero. Still, Bret Easton Ellis maintains his status as one of America's best contemporary writers. I would rank him and D.M. Roman (the author of Fried Calamari) as the best contemporary writers today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointed!","review":"After reading 'American Psycho' I was excited to read 'Glamorama' and I was so disappointed by the book. The book (so far) is 200 pages of names in the movie and music business - there is no story at all - I am trying so hard to push on in the book to see if something happens at all, but it is getting more and more difficult to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once Again Ellis Writes Another Page Turner","review":"Bret Easton Ellis is one of my favourite writers. I have read all of his books. Glamorama is another masterpiece from such a gifted writer. If anyone can get through American Psycho and still be able to grasp what Ellis was trying to convey, they can get through Glamorama the same way. Ellis writes about the great things we all loved and hated about the 80's. A great, great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst book I've ever read!","review":"Now that I've finished this book, the only thing left to do is burn it, so no one else wastes a minute of their time reading it. This book is graphically violent and filled with deranged male fantasy. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the most incoherent piece of trash that I have ever","review":"I bought the book because I saw three people on an airplane reading it -- too much of a coincidence? No, we were all headed to the Cannes Film Festival. This book is totally unfollowable, incoherent and disgusting. Not just the violence, but the sex. I have read a lot and I am not by any means a prude, but this was too much for me. I usually pass my books along to others, but this went where it belongs. Shame on the publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little more than zero.","review":"I' m not fun of Ellis but I have read his previous books without wanting to drop them in the middle. This was not the case and if I had not hoped for a miraculously interesting end, I would leave it half-read. The surreal situations in Victor's life confused me immensely and in the end I felt totally lost. I don't know if the whole point was to leave the reader like this, but either way I didn't like it. As for the description of the life-style of all these \\"glamorous\\" people, I don't know if its accurate, because in my country the situation is very much different, even in these circles, but from what I know, I believe Ellis has managed to describe it very well. Finally, although it's a little uncofortable to talk for someone you don't really know (even though you read his books,) I found extremely to the point the remark of one of your readers, who said that he wouldn't want to be in the same room with the reader!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ellis is the psycho","review":"I wouldn't spend a minute alone in a room unarmed with Ellis.Can you say \\"foreshadowing\\"?The book is horrible, a disgrace to the publishing business, and quite possibly a cry for help from a serial killer in the making.

Don't believe the hype on this guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little bit of Kafka","review":"Ellis seems to give it a try with a little bit of Kafka. Everything is uncertain, even the label on your suit. Victor Ward or Johnson in Glamorama does never really know whats going on around him - may be the same is valid for Ellis: May be he has written two or more scripts and could not decide which one should be the one. So I was happy to reach the end of the book, uhm, like, the last page of the text?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellis is a typical american writter","review":"Glamorama has an intensity most of our recent writters don t have, neither here or even in Europe.

He has the credit and now underestimates his audience. It is a talent to use your talent mr. Ellis. If you don't like hard work, find another job. Now we have to struggle through it. It's a two starr for the strong beginning and the respect to get all these words on paper. I could not read it to the end though..."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to the American Pyscho?","review":"BBEllis was one of my favorites until Glamorama. I had ordered the book 2 months before it came out and I'm still struggling to finish it. I believe the problem lies with Ellis not even bothering to help the reader enter his own bizarre train of thought. Weak plot and not a page turner, and too many open ends which leave quesiton marks: whatever was Ellis trying to say about Victor getting chills all the time. Well I'm dissapointed but if anyone would like to present a counter argument I'd be most happy to read what I've missed out.Sam Ahmed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellis achieves surprising success","review":"It is an unusual book in that if you don't read it right now, and I mean this month, or at least in the next three months, it is going to seem dated.

Also it is highly entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"trying too hard","review":"Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of Bret Easton Ellis. But this book was horrible! It had nowhere near the malaise of Less Than Zero nor the comedic satire of American Psycho. In Glamorama he tries to do for the 90s what these other two did for the 80s, and fails miserably.

I have honestly never read a more pointless book in my life. This novel had so much potential, and Ellis just threw it all away. He created a protagonist too stupid and annoying to grab you. And because the character is too stupid and high to notice anything that goes on around him, you miss tons of possible storylines and character development. The main character's self absorbtion and stupidity made me almost physically ill. Ellis took a subject matter that could have been used to create a great social satire and instead used it to create more manufactured and movie ready tripe. Skip this one, unless you dislike thinking for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brett Easton Ellis goes to Hollywood","review":"This is the revenge of Brett for the endless torture he endured while the movie \\"American Psycho\\", adapted from his book, was in the making. He became so involved in the making of the movie that he began to confuse truth and reality, which shows in his book, where fantasy and real life of the actors are inextricably intermingled. This is a great book for the virtual world that is coming, where you have many identities and begin to wonder which facet of you is the real one. You never know who the hero really is: a gigolo, a band leader, an actor or the son of the future president? I will not bore you with pseudo-philosophical and sentimental thoughts, but that is an interesting question to ponder for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellis is still strange and interesting.","review":"Really a great read. the story takes you on a rollercoaster ride of time and places... first half is ok and then..BAM!, YOUR A WITNESS TO REAL TERROR AND ESPIONAGE...AND FASHION...YES. fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the continuation of The Rules of Attraction.........","review":"No one has yet to mention that the characters in this novel are the same as the Rules of Attraction.

Ellis is so tres, tres je ne sais quoi. He even manages to make models look positively dunderheaded. Can you imagine the *effort* that went into such a satire? Making celebs and other partiers look silly? Why he must have spent *afternoons*, absolute *afternoons* on the manuscript. I think even *I* am mentioned in there somewhere.

Oh aren't I too, too wicked?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast read slow burn","review":"I read this book in a weekend; Ellis writes at the speed of light or city life, and you find yourself caught up in Victor Ward's impossibly full days...when the story shifts, however, and Ellis embarks on his thriller mode, the tale becomes tedious. I suppose at this point we as readers are meant to get lost in the switching allegiances, the bundles of names and deaths and parties, and to equate the shallow model life depicted in the first half of the book with the callous politics and terrorism in the second half, as if opening a club in New York is as cruel and meaningless of a sport as bombing a club in Bali...I do find it interesting that several contemporary authors wrote about terrorism in the 90s(DeLillo, Palahniuk) before it became the defining term of all we should fear - and that it is treated in Glamorama as a rupture and corruption in the cool smooth magazine life we are supposed to desire."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is unique and brilliant","review":"Pure B.E.E. from begining to end - this book is amazingly funny and has great perspective in a twisted kind of post-post-modern way which it would probably condemn itself for.

The choice is yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written and Terribly Boring","review":"After reading decent reviews of this book, I decided to finally read it. Big Mistake. It's basically 700pgs of name dropping, where Ellis drops names of people whom he most likely doesn't even know. I would be terribly insulted if I stumbled across my name in this book. I suppose this book was supposed to be funny or something, but I didn't find anything of the sort. Satirical or not, the whole book was just absurd. Ellis basically rambles on and on about the fashion industry and society (both which he knows very little about). So here's a future tip for Ellis: Leave Camus to handle the absurd and Dostoevsky to write the 700 pg novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, so boring...","review":"It took me months to finish this book, it was so boring. I had to read other books for fun while I read it, but forced myself to read Glamorama, just to finish it. I love all the other B.E.Ellis books, but this one killed me. Don't waste your time, there are plenty of other good books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"An insight into the fashion world?","review":"I liked this book. It's full of fashion labels, unexpected twists & humour. This is my second book by Bret Easton Ellis & it won't be the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby, Baby, This Book Is Like, Too Very","review":"From word one, you are dunked under the surface of reality and submerged into Victor's world. The book holds your head under while you struggle against the name-dropping onslaught of party boy conversations and narration. Ellis paints the 90s like a photograph.Just when you think you know the book's tone, just when you've become accustomed to vacuous Victor, cloying Chloe, antagonistic Allison, dangerous Damien...the book flips you on your head and the entire thing changes. I'd give too much away if I said anything else.Man, is it cold in here to you? Clean up that confetti over there before you go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick","review":"Sick is the only word i can come up with if i\`m asked to make a on-line summary of this book. The book is sick , he is sick (both the caracter in the book and the person who wrote this book Mr.Ellis , and perhaps the person he or she who buys this book.The only great thing about this book is the end wich are very simmilar to American Physco. DONT BUY THIS BOOK"},{"rating":"1","title":"Raymond where are you","review":"Take the incoherence of a typical Raymond Chandler plot minus Chandler's magic, add all the suspense of a major golf tournament which Tiger Woods is taking part in, sprinkle occasional splurts of blood that looks like ketchup and of hard sex that looks like a porno session at the gym, and you'll get a book that does not work, just like its protagonist - idle, debauched and immensely forgettable Victor Johnson alias Ward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful People in a Really Bad Book","review":"The only thing vaguely interesting about this book is that it takes place around beautiful and famous people. The main character, Victor Ward, is a thoroughly dislikable semi-famous moron. There is no story for three hundred pages and then an idiotic one--supermodels as terrorists. I kept hoping it was a spoof.Ellis tries to pull some little tricks like fading in and out of a movie shoot and mixing up the chapter numbers and 'inserting' some lead-handed symbolism like cold and confetti all over the place. I was embarresed for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrid","review":"But then it's my fault for continuing to read it, hoping it would magically get better. There isn't a single likeable character; the author has only a fleeting grasp of his expansive subject matter (i.e., the fashion industry, international terrorism, copious sex scenes). It seems all he wants to do is talk about dismemberment, violent sex and self-absorbed shallow characters ... and this book is a vehicle to do that. None of it was believable, none of it was enjoyable & my advice is to discontinue reading it because it does NOT get any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is boring","review":"so far Bret Easton Ellis has just been able to write ONE single good book 'American Psycho'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe his worst","review":"I've read Mr. Ellis's Less Then Zero, Amer. Psycho and Rules of Attraction and enjoyed all three of them more then Glamorama.Glamorama takes similiar themes from Amer Psycho and makes them more outlandish but Patrick Bateman is a far more intriguing character then Victor Ward/Johnson.The book does get better after Victor leaves NYC and heads toward Europe (the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1)but I was at this point reading the book just to finish it as I was fairly bored by the non-stop celebrity babble.Lastly some of the characters were still in college in Rules of Attraction so if you've read Amer Psycho and are dying to read more by Ellis at least read Rules... first and then Glamorama but don't be surprised if Glamorama is a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well done","review":"Ellis wrote American Psycho, and I honestly loved the insanity behind it and the way Patrick Bateman was developed as a character. The Amercian Psycho style worked because Ellis literally bored people to death for the first 250 pages before beating them back to life with a complete plot turnaround (More or less).Now imagine if the plot never did turn around. Glamorama is tied with one other book for \\"worst I ever read the whole way through\\". It's something like twenty thousand pages of drabble and zero plot. I think Ellis tries too hard to remake the shock value with the sex and murder scenes in here, but essentially it felt like this book was just ten or fifteen short stories crudely pasted together. I also tried \\"Less than Zero\\" by Ellis and I actually set fire to the book just to get some entertainment from it. Sorry for the harsh negative comments, but I am retaliating for wasting so much time on this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The better you look, the more you see","review":"Besides American Psycho, Ellis' best work. The book follows model/actor Victor Ward. Victor's life consists of getting laid, doing drugs, partying at the hippest clubs with the biggest stars of the 90s. He's trying to land a role in a movie and open a nightclub. This is the first half of the book. The second half consists of torturing/killing, bombing buildings, and crashing 747s. This book will confuse...you. By the end of the book, Victor is stripped of his identity and sees a clone of himself back in New York from a hotel room in Milan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Drivel","review":"I can't help but leave a few words of contempt for Ellis' work. \\"Glamorama\\" was nothing but a wild conglomeration of mindless, obnoxious BS. The character introductions in the first chapter absolutely sickened me with so much hartred and disgust that I was unable to focus througout the rest of the novel. Sure, Ellis does have a knack for realistic and flowing dialogue, but with so many perephial characters who basically all revolved around each other's sick, sad, lives, towards the end of the book I felt like I would rather live as a deformed hermit for the rest of my existence than spend even an second with these [characters]. I understand that the purpose of the novel is to reveal the whole psychosis associated with 'glamour,'(yes, psychosis) as in American Psycho's corporate banking plot, yet the absence of any sympathetic characters made the book literally unbearable. Do not read this book,it will be a complete waste of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"first half - great! second half - totally out of control","review":"The first 100 pages were slick, self-mocking and very, very funny. The rest of the book descended into chaos and confusion and truly I didn't care what happened to any of them. Does anyone know what the ending means - I'd love to know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not even superficially profound","review":"A terrible disappointment. Hard to understand how Ellis could write such a bad book. Making mistakes he so deftly avoided doing in the past. There are plenty of jokes, but this time they aren't funny. The 'social message', boring, is stated with the subtlety of a battering ram. Dialogues aren't merely dull, they're simply unnatural, implausible (and I never would have expected that from Ellis). It seems some people actually.. um, liked it! Well, if you're planning to buy this book, maybe you'll be lucky. I suggest reading 10-20 pages before clicking the 'buy' button and I hope Ellis' next book (or the one after) will be great.Mmmmmm, if this book would be re-edited and issued as a long short-story, perhaps 60 pages long, it might make for a really cool book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A world where everyone is a dispensable commodity","review":"Glamorama is extremely polished, funny, dark and cruel. Taking you from a world that is shallow but harmless to a world that is shallow and deadly, a world where even your children are dispensable commodities.Or has it always been that way?. Its impossible to put down, so much so, at the end you are left with such a mass of unsettled questions it takes a full day to really put it all together.It's a book for those who want a bit more than just a story.Glamorama is possibly one of the best books I've read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anagram: See L.A. Snob Litter","review":"More unintentional laughs from the Jackie Susann of my generation. As long as people never tire of reading about how tough the beautiful, rich and/or famous have it over the rest of us, writers like Ellis will always find a book contract; his tendency toward endless streams of \\"ironic\\" name-dropping and product-placement ensures that he will be taken seriously in publishing circles. Ellis novels are the kind of novels that characters in Ellis novels might read--or at least have displayed on their Phillipe Starck coffee tables; mere decoration, they remain untouched and unread."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will Ellis hang it up?","review":"This guy keeps on writing and being published even though he is known for his utter lack of style and insight, and for being the ultimate hack of his generation. It's amazing what good connections can do. And a sorry state of affairs that this is what publishers pay money to produce. Ugh, enough already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy writes like he gets paid by the word","review":"I have a feeling this novel's life cycle was something like that of a kilo of cocaine: it starts out 99 per cent pure in Colombia but by the time it hits the streets of New York it weighs about 50 kilos and is largely baby powder and drain cleaner. So much of this reads like it was faxed over by a researcher and just pasted in, particularly the endless lists of celebrities. You start reading faster and faster, skimming pages, then gulping down whole fistfuls of pages in an effort to extract some kind of hit but it's still the same mindless monologue, in which a disembowelling is described with the same flatness of tone as a fashion shoot, and London is exactly the same as New York.Maybe that's the point, but I think this is a lazy book, not the solid read the book's bulk implies, and if you buy your books by the pound you'll feel exceedingly ripped off by this one.."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST BOOK I EVER READ","review":"Probably one of the worst books ever written. This guy thinks that he speaks for a generation, when in reality all he does is pilfer conversations from any cool place he's ever been to and namedrop, namedrop, namedrop. The main character, Victor, is such a jerk that you wish someone would push him off the runway so he landed on his head. Whatever. Dumb and poorly written with pseudo Tom Wolf-ish aspirations. Not. Doesn't get much worse than this. And to think that I spent $25.00 on this garbage in an airport in Italy."},{"rating":"1","title":"a series of video clips a little bit to long","review":"Felt like I zapped at the wrong time into series of video clips on a music, fashion, about music and fashion channel watching artificial 'real characters dropping their written lines', clips about making the clips and being pointed to the feeling 'hey, look, you are backstage where the first crew (Ellis) shoots clip after clip'. Every piece, clip, character is loose connected with the other. And: it's a sequel to Ellis former books. To be continued... Anyway, if it's your first reading of Ellis work, you will probably enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Mess","review":"Glamorama is a mess. Lacking logic and form, this novel races to its absurd finish without ever looking back and asking why. I did enjoy the first 150 pages or so...the fast and furious name dropping was amusing, and the dialogue was off-center and fun. I don't know what happened to Mr. Ellis after that. There are passages of disturbingly gratuitous violence and torture. I have a pretty strong stomach, but some of this was too much to take. And finally, as a twentysomething reader, I found little if anything to identify with in this book. Two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll hate yourself in the morning...","review":"...or perhaps you'll just hate yourself. From the first page, I was exhausted. By page two I was angry. By page five, I had already gone through the Elizabeth Kubler-Ross stages of death - but instead of reaching \\"acceptance\\" I just called ATT and asked for Dr. Kevorkian's home number. I just wanted the pain to stop, you know? Yeah, I'm bitter.. who wouldn't be? He got 500,000 in US dollars for this elongated InStyle profile. Clearly, Random House has lost thier collective marbles, not to mention thier credibility. Those folks in New York should do less indoor smoking and more editing. (No offense to Disney, proud owners of the irrelevant island of Manhattan - the lengths a city will go to for a Pocahontas tie-in, huh?)File this one under CRAPORAMA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anything But Glamorous","review":"I couldn't make it through American Psycho, but I devoured this work by Mr. Ellis. This is an amazingly energetic work, almost relentless in pacing, at least through the first two-thirds of the story. The dialogue is mesmerizing, the characters sometimes elusive but generally captivating, the storyline often hard to follow, but never boring. The protagonist, Victor Ward, is a hero so shallow that he actually generates sympathy in the reader and even becomes an unlikely underdog. I like writers who stretch the envelope. If you do too, you'll probably enjoy this work. Be warned though. The violence and the sex both reach levels that most will find pornographic."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American masterpiece for our times","review":"I don't think I can emphasise how much I enjoyed Ellis' latest novel. This book, with it's commentary on the nature of celebritydom and our obsession with it, had so many twists and turns that it left the reader wondering where Ellis was going to take us next. The concept of a group of glamarous, superficial models/actors taking part in international terrorism and political conspiracies, was so bizarre that it could only have come from a writer as refreshingly unique as Ellis. This is a novel I would recommend to anyone, but be warned as soon as you read the first few chapters, you won't be able to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like reading lists...","review":"This is the worst book I've ever read my entire life. It is merely a series of lists-- lists of celebrity names, restaurant names, fashion designer names... The story doesn't really seem to start until page 285, forcing the reader to hash through 285 pages of drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"only if you like Ellis","review":"Vapid prose, useless dialogue, faulty plot, hanging conclusion, what else? I am not a fan of Ellis', but attempted to read this book to see what he might come up with this time around. Disappointing at best - come to think of it, I am changing my rating to 1 star. Middle section is decent. Only worth reading if you have too much time on your hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plagio-rama","review":"I think I understand why Ellis, and his soul bro' Jay McInerney, are so obsessed with models: they desperately need figures to whom they can feel superior. Ellis may have to look even harder. Glamorama blandly recycles entire dialogue, scenes and situations from his previous formulaic books, and in at least one instance early on completely plagiarizes a routine from THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE (1995). I refer to the \\"hilarious\\" bit where a model repeatedly says \\"Guess,\\" referring to Guess jeans, and Victor repeatedly tries to \\"guess\\" what she means. That's right, folks, Mr. Annointed Satirist steals his material from Hollywood comedies. I'm calling your bluff, Ellis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't he once a brilliant author?","review":"I have been an avid fan of Ellis Since I read Less than Zero. However, I found Glamorama to be poorly written coming from a man who is usually ahead of the rest. It was confusing and incredibly irritating. Who cared about Victor Ward? Not me. Not by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful confusion","review":"man oh man, this book is nuts. The first half of the book was pretty linear, pretty easy to understand. Nothing spectacular, but definitely cool. For the most part just character development and giving you an understanding of the scene the main character, Victor Ward, is coming from. And then Victor is approached by a man named Palakon about a job (more of an errand). That's when things get absolutely insane. There are points in which you have no idea what's going on. What's real and what's just a figment of Victor's overtaxed mind. Just when you think you've got things figured out, some small thing will destroy your theory. The thing that puzzled me the most was the presence of the camera crews. i won't say more about them. Overall, i think the book was a raging success. A great satire about the glamorous side of life. Great characters. Great ideas. Great amounts of gore. Great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I ever finished!","review":"My God this book is bad!It actually made me wonder if Bret Easton Ellis thinks being a good writer is all about thinking up schocking scenes - but after the first 100 -200 pages even they become boring and routine like. The plot is badly constructed, the main character isn't even remotely interesting, and it seems to me that the author is trying to writer \\"over his ability\\". He'll never be an Auster, and should just stick to writing college novels about sad teenagers with nothing to live for or horror stories about mass murderes, not this \\"wanna be hip\\" trash! (And yes, it upsets me that i wasted time on this book!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Would Have Given Zero Stars But That Wasn't An Option","review":"This book is quite possibly the worst thing I have ever read.

Safely Home hit me hard on several counts. First, it provided a great counterbalance to so much we have heard about freedom of religion and expression in China. I will travel to China with my eyes open. Second, I gained an incredible appreciation for those who sacrifice all for their faith and who don't have ready access to God's Word. Finally, the author made heaven very real to me in a way I've never experienced. I have a much more vivid and accurate picture of heaven than I ever have had before.This book sometimes is a bit melodramatic and preachy but by the time I got to the end, this didn't even seem like much of a drawback. I'm not sure how Safely Home would be received by someone who did not already have a personal faith in God, or at least was close to such a faith, but believers will find it very inspirational."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother?","review":"\\"Christian\\" fiction is a hoot!

I loved it so much that I even named my son after one of its characters (the angel Jadorel). Safely Home is right up there with Pilgrim's Progress, and a \\"must read\\" for all committed Christians who are living for another homeland (Heaven). It's also great for lukewarm believers who need an exhortative kick in the pants (like me at the time that I read it). Well done, Randy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read~","review":"Safely Home by Randy Alcorn is one of the most convicting and wonderful books I have read lately. It is an extremely well written novel about a American businessman and a Chinese Christian. They were roommates in college. Their paths collide again when Ben, the American, is given the assignment to go live in China for six weeks and find out the best ways to improve their business presence there. What he finds is not what he was expecting. This is a great novel about the persecution in China and how easily we take things like the Word of God for granted in America.Randy Alcorn really did his research to bring to light the persecuted church. I highly recommend this book to everyone. This is one of those books that I would love to buy in bulk and pass out to every Christian I know. I can't recommend it enough. Plus, all of the proceeds from the sale of the book goes toward the persecuted church.

One incident in the book was recognizably based on a real event that happened in Romania. Randy Alcorn is a skilled writer: I have read two of his books now. I first heard of him when I bought \\"Lord Foulgrin's Letters,\\" which was also good. But this new effort surpasses by far Lord Foulgrin's Letters, which by the nature of the genre was understandably didactic and \\"preachy\\" in style. This new novel is wonderful. However, I wonder about one thing: Does Randy Alcorn have some sort of preference for using arrogant businessmen as protagonists?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read","review":"I received a complimentary copy of the is book from Tyndale House Publishers. This book is the story of two men that were college roommates who meet again 20 years later. One has embraced his christian faith, even though it has cost him much, while the other has turned completely away from his. I thought that this book sounded intriguing, but when I started reading it, I had a really hard time with it. I don't feel like there is much of a story in the book. It mostly felt like I was getting preached at. I found the character of Ben Fielding very annoying. He seemed like a know it all. He kept lecturing his friend about how things worked in China. When his friend was the one that lived there, while he just visited every now and then. I did not like this book at all, and would give it one out of five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can not put it down","review":"Be ready - You can't put this book down. It is so wonderful.

It made me think about so many important things , like what would I do if persecuted the way Quan was? I can hardly get this book out of my mind and even dreamed about it at night! Very meaningful and touching to the heart! Undoubtedly worth it. I read the Kindle version but also bought a hard copy to share with people. It is impossible to keep from sharing this book when you are done with it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"I would give this book lots more stars if they were available. A novel but written with correct bibical information. I read this twice. I bought a second copy to pass around to friends because I told everyone they needed to read it. God really used this book to touch my heart for people who live where persecution is a reality. I pray that Americans come to realize how blessed we are as a nation to have freedom to worship God. This story is about two youg men who take very different paths in life. It is amazing to see the hand of God in each of their lives and where they eventually find themselves. I couldn't put it down, a definite must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! Powerful book!","review":"This is a very powerful book about those who are persecuted, even killed, for their faith. I like this statement by Li Quan, the main Chinese character: \\"My father used to tell me that a good follower of Yesu (Jesus) is like the ox - ready either for the plow or the altar, for service or for sacrifice. I do not know what lies ahead on this earth. I do know something greater awaits us beyond it. That is what I choose to live for.\\"Great book! Really inspires one to live with an eternal perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly, wonderfully good","review":"Not being someone who is easily moved, I could never have anticipated the effect this book would have on me.I stayed up two nights in a row until 3AM to finish it. I almost literally could not put it down.Randy Alcorn follows an interesting style of interweaving numerous facts about how God is moving in China and the nation and culture itself with the storyline. The story was relentlessly compelling, the characters were incredibly real, and the perspective changes between earth and heaven were unique and dangerously joyful.Be careful reading this, it -will- change your life. I absolutely recommend this book to anyone, I thank God that I read it, and plan on circulating my copy as much as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense","review":"An American businessman goes to China to visit his old friend from college.

The great part is it is so well written you will find it hard to put it down to the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Safely Home\\" is awesome","review":"This book is the most powerful work of fiction that I have read in a long time. I am an avid reader, but knew nothing about the author when I picked up this book in the local library. (Now I am reading \\"Heaven\\")\\"Safely Home\\" was so inspiring and it made me realize how blessed we are in America and how much we take for granted. Once I have read a book, I rarely read it again. This time I was anxious to read it again. I downloaded it to Kindle so that I could have it for keeps."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not read to the end","review":"A family with cell phone and an Internet connected computer making hand written copies of the Bible does not sound real, does it? The book is a patchwork of facts (not so new) and fiction, mixed with pentecostal ideas. Not the kind of reading I enjoy, even being a Christian. It seems the author tries to insert a 70's and 80's persecution picture in today's scenario. Being a Brazilian I can tell a foreigner author usually misses the point when he tries to explain a different culture environment (old American movies always pictured Brazilians wearing those large Mexican hats you would never find anywhere in Brazil). It seems the book describes what most Christians would like to read about China. Put together persecution, angels and spirits and you have a bestseller for those who enjoy this kind of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfactory","review":"While the message of \\"Safely Home\\" is important, the book largely failed to resonate with me. The writing is just plain poor, with flat, stereotypical characters; a plodding, cliched, predictable plot; and long passages of dull sermonizing as the author preaches to the choir. (Mild spoilers?...) The frequent shift to the POV of characters watching the events from heaven was hugely ham-fisted, irritating, and (especially towards the end) a bit blasphemous as the author takes it upon himself to think God's thoughts for him. I think it's a shame we let ourselves be content with poor writing such as this simply because it's \\"Christian\\". I continue to be underwhelmed by modern Christian fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safely Home","review":"This fascinating story appears to be poorly bound: two books split! Mine split the first time I opened the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life-changing experience","review":"From the time I started reading this book until I finished it, I could hardly put it down. The concepts contained within this riveting story are not easy but they will touch every aspect of your life. It definitely challenged my faith and caused me to reflect on the meaning and purpose of my own life in a deeper way than ever before. I'm extremely grateful for the impact this book has had on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dying for Jesus","review":"I don't read a lot of Christian lit, but a friend put this in my hands and said, \\"You MUST read this!\\" The endorsement holds from me to you. The book is simply written, but the message is TNT. Thankfully, we don't yet have to ask ourselves, \\"Is this the day I die?\\" for our Father. But are we going out into the world, preaching the Good News...that He commands us or are we keeping quiet and trying not to rock the boat? Does \\"coexisting\\" mean that we Christians have to quietly refrain from voicing our beliefs so we don't make the atheists, Muslims, wiccans, agnostics, Buddhists, gays, New Agers, et al feel uncomfortable? This book prods this type of introspection into one's faith. The section when the two main characters visit a local lamaistic Buddhist monastery gave me goosebumps and I felt like I wrestled with the devil the night after reading that section. Read the book and see why."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing book!","review":"This book truly moved me. It made such an impact, I bought the book on tape so my 3 kids could experience it as well. We listened on the way to school every morning. Although it is written as fiction, it exposes the true persecution that is happening in China to people who have any interest at all in learning about God or the Bible. Book starts a little slow, but by the halfway point I could hardly put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"inspiring","review":"This is the second book by Randy Alcorn that I have read.(lord Foulgrin; excellent) He has a true gift for inspiring and making you think about what goes on in the unseen world around us. Very satisfying story with SO much to think about! As a cancer survivor, I loved how Quan explains that we shouldn't wonder why bad things happen to us, we should wonder why good things happen to us! (we really don't deserve it) We can't see God's tapestry from this side of heaven. Well done Mr. Alcorn!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic Christian book about suffering!","review":"A wonderful fiction work that gives an amazing biblcal perspective about suffering of all types.

The projects are easy enough, most are made with paper, buttons and beads. Over half the projects are made with polymer clay, which is fine, but the instructions for all clay projects are poor, i.e. \\"make from polymer clay\\".

But, because of Prince Alloran's deadly mistake, the Hork Bajir world fell to the Yeerks. You will also know about who actually is Visser Three. The prologue and epilogue are touching to read.

Despite a promising start with its faux trailers, \\"Tropic Thunder\\" goes downhill quickly. There's nothing wrong with over-the-top humor, but director Ben Stiller draws few chuckles from his \\"Three Stooges Meet Apocalypse Now\\" premise. As film comedians, Stiller and Jack Black are painfully unfunny - easily trumped by Tom Cruise's amusing cameo appearance.

He writes with a strong conviction that the Bible is without error and is 100% the Word of God for the people of God.

However, he does this in a very rambling, disjointed and highly unconventional way. Don't get me wrong, convention is not always good, but by the time I was 1/4 the way through this book I was longing for some convention. It's not hard to see why the author has self-published. The book needs an editor for many reasons, only one of which is the highly disjointed fashion in which the author takes on the purported subject.When I listen to John Rappaport on the radio I listen with great interest and I always leave the show fealing better informed. However, I cannot say I was better informed by reading his book. There are many, many better books on this subject to choose from and unless money flows into your bank account try another author."},{"rating":"2","title":"great reading, allows one to relate to his/her surrounding","review":"this book provides u the shades of truth, in our histories past, and present. it cultivates u to be aware of the future and youre surroundings. it tells u that u are not alone, when it comes to saying why do things happen the way they do. thats just the tip of the iceberg, if u have read the books or were aware of the topics reffered/sited in this book, then its is a blast! u have to be at the right frame of mind to read it, which also means tha u are not bound or dictated by what u have been indoctrinated to believe. this cant be a \\"must reading\\" in colleges/or universities as there the mind has to be fully/partially controlled/influenced, upon completing this process then breaking down the falsehood is easy for an individual who has been on the path of enlightment. minimum age requirement suggested for reading 32+."},{"rating":"2","title":"Petty Cool","review":"Zero One has always been great chill electronica.

You can't wait to see what happens next in the evolution of the chest of drawers or the porch -- because you don't learn only about the chest or the porch, but about the people who designed and used them. And you learn answers to all those questions you've always wondered about and never known whom to ask.The pictures not only make it a great gift and perfect coffee table book, but tell you what something looks like exactly when you're trying to imagine it.Most of all, I learned a lot without it even hurting a little bit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"I purchased this book, because it was recommended as a Family Read Aloud for the Ancient History Program that I am using this year with my daughters. We are also reading Genesis right now. It was confusing to them and to me to try to explain to them what parts of the book are true, and what parts are the authors imagination. I did not like how Biblical Truth about God was mixed in with interpretation and complete myths. If you are looking for a good read aloud I would not recommend this book. We read the first 8 chapters, because I keep saying maybe it will get better, but it didn't.

It is a work of fiction. Children interested in ancient history can learn absolutely nothing form this book. It is claimed that author has used sources such as linguistics, archeology, astronomy and other sciences to write the book. In the appendix some sources are listed, most of them about 100 years old. She even quotes an astronomy book by Immanuel Velikovsky!! This is called pseudo-science.

Parents should be warned against giving their children this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian mythology","review":"There is just not reconciling christian mythology with actual history and more than there is with any other mythology.

Just like christian mythology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read! Excellent addition to ancient history curriculum","review":"The author is very clear that not every theory about creation or the beginning of human history is used. And that's not the point. It is meant to be a novel of what might have happened. One does not have to buy every theory, but it is still extremely interesting because it \\"fills in the blanks\\" of what you might have wondered about the Genesis accounts. It makes sense and I think it makes an excellent companion to Bible study and ancient history study."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do NOT recommend this book for Bible-believing Christians.","review":"After hearing all the rave reviews when this book first came out, I purchased it and began reading it to my children. There were inaccuracies pretty early on in the book that continued. I found myself (often) telling my children, \\"We don't don't believe this,\\" or \\"The Bible actually says...\\" After a few chapters I thought, \\"Why in the world am I reading this to my children if we don't believe much of what's being said?\\"So, I got rid of the book!

The product I purchased is on DVD and, as viewed on a 42\\" plasma TV, I rate the production quality as top shelf. The scenery was exceptional and the commentary was quite educational. To gauge the entertainment value I can say the content was sufficient to hold the interest of my three boys, ages eight, ten and twelve."},{"rating":"1","title":"TV in a box","review":"I thought the series would detail the National Parks listed. It seems like the series is a collection of past National Geographic television episodes slapped together.

Photography remains good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very hidden message","review":"This set is not what you think it's going to be. You'd think it was going to show each of the highlighted parks and show what makes each park unique; flora, fauna, natural formations, beautiful scenery. Instead this series hits relentlessly up side the head with dire predictions about global warming and the horrible consequences of civilization. Not once, but many times. In the Death Valley disc, they mention global warming 12 times in one hour.The message even flies in the face of science. They talk about how parks have changed with it's habitat being constantly threatened by the hand of man and state quite clearly that the natural denizens will be unable to adapt to the changes when species adaptation is a well-founded scientific principle.So if you're looking for wonderful travelogues showcasing our national parks, keep looking.This was a great disappointment at many levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Expect Much","review":"As a previous reviewer of this DVD set noted, these five \\"National Parks\\" programs were produced for television. As such, they're skewed toward sensationalism and lots of \\"gloom-and-doom.\\" It's the gloom-and-doom that's tedious to watch, albeit there is some truth in it. Actually, the rock climber's three-day ascent of El Capitan on the Yosemite disc is quite impressive. The Yellowstone and Death Valley discs have their moments, whilst the Everglades and Hawaii programs put me to sleep. I've watched a half dozen DVD productions on America's national parks (including Ken Burns).

It's small enough to omit lots of info you may need, and without an index you can't easily pick out what might be useful. So it's not very helpful.Rather than buy it, get a copy of Gormly & Brodzinsky's LIFESPAN HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. It's a textbook that is clearly written. My copy is from 1989, so it is dated.

In what is possibly the best book yet, Mary C. redefines the title of Grandmother when the calypso warriors re-emerge. This is an exciting read which is almost impossible to put down once the reader begins the story. The evil Eve returns to Mayport and brings quite a surprising character with her. Miss Margaret's daughters are still conniving ways to capture Jason (body and soul) only they didn't factor in the power of the magic carousel and how it would captivate them. The novel also has about 18 illustrations which enhance the stories. Don't miss your chance to read a really exciting and totally original novel.

It is extreme, dark, sinsiter, and beautiful all at the same time. Despite the numerous times I have listened to this record, there are still new musical textures I hear anew with each listen. The lyrics to the first track, \\"Felonies of the Christian Art\\" make me feel vile, but still, they make total sense.

It does not get any better. I have always marveled at how Galder nearly alone can outdo the whole of Dimmu Borgir but that is just what he does.

(If there was an Academy Award for hair, she'd get it. And why shouldn't there be one? More people care about hair than Sound Effects Editing.) But a plausible story would have been nice. And some narrative momentum to keep the eyelids open couldn't have hurt.

The script made Movieline's top ten yet-to-be-produced list in Hollywood. I remember wondering what the script was all about. Well, after seeing the film, I wonder what all the talk was about.My biggest problem with the story was the pacing. It seemed misguided and melodramatic at times. There seemed to be no punch. I never felt like any of the characters were real. They all seemed to be demonstrations of people rather than revelations of real human beings. The only scene that came across real was the food ordering scene with Amos McPhadden and his children... the rest were attempts.Finally, the ending was plain awful. I hated how the climax was shot, executed and written.Overall, I applaud the effort.

I purchased this video for the History of the English Language course I was teaching, thinking it might be a useful teaching tool. Unfortunately, it proved useful only in that I was able to have students point out the fallacious statements. For instance, Prof. Engel says that there are only twenty-six sounds in English, confusing letters and phonemes, it seems. One need only consider the vowels to see that this statement is erroneous. Then there are palatal fricatives and affricates and the voiced and voiceless interdentals.

I showed this in an upper division course on Germanic phonetics and history and spent the rest of the hour correcting the information my students had just heard.

Everyone who has a problem with Elves - mostly players who have Dwarfen charakters - should forget the existence of this book, it would only upset him. Sure, this book can change the balance between the races, giving Elven charakters more advantages. But most rules are optional, no DM has to acept them. But in my oppinion, there would be nothing wrong in making the Elven race stronger, if you have 100 years time to learn something a Human has to learn in 20 years, guess who will be better! And, many Elves faces big problems everywhere: Many Humans, Dwarfes and evil Humanoids hate Elves and many DM don't forget this fact and let you pay for being a Elf.

It is noted in the box that the balls have a clear coat added. Some appear to be dirty, others have markings on them left by previous users. I got 3 extra balls in my bag, which is cool, but with shipping added it's not really an awesome deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The description says that the balls are supposed to be HX Hot Bite. Well, only 13 balls are HX Hot Bite and the rest are HX Bites. I can understand getting about 3-5 wrong ones in the package, but not 23!

Most of the balls are in pretty good condition with only a few (6) discoloured or roughed up. The main reason for my disappointment is that 10 of the 36 ball were the older HX Bite and not the HX Hot Bite I was promised. You may think I am being pedantic, but the reason I bought these was because I knew the Hot Bites were relatively new and would be more likely to be in a good condition. My fears were confirmed when I looked at the HX bites and discovered that all of the discoloured balls or rough edged balls were in fact the HX bites and not the HX Hot Bites, which were in far better condition. I still think these are a pretty good deal for the price, I just don't like being sold something different from that which is advertised, especially if it means the quality of the product is lowered."},{"rating":"1","title":"more then have of them were not as decribed","review":"I ordered 36 pack of HX HOT BITE and received MORE THEN OF HX BITE WHICH IS A DIFFERANT BALL.

I laughed a few times, but that was only about three times through the show. I understand how some people enjoyed it, but it's the same humour you'd find in an Ashton Kutcher movie: none. They're right in thinking that all they have to do is drop an F bomb and they'll get some laughs (since they did), but that doesn't make it funny. The show could have been really good, but it's nothing but dick and fart jokes defending its writing by calling itself an opera. If you want opera, go see Turandot. If you want a funny musical that knows how to use its material, go see Avenue Q. If you want a cheap laugh, then see Springer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scudder not dry","review":"Block runs his alcoholic detective Matt Scudder through the bar scene of the 70\\"s in Manhattan. The problems he is presented with all revolve around denizens of his alcoholic world. The amazing thing for this series is that Block does not have Scudder agonizing over his drinking. Of course, he is surrounded by others who drink the way he does which serves to conceal his drinking. Block inserted this title into the series outside of the chronological order giving him a chance to close on an up-beat note. Readers looking for a straight crime novel will not find it here. Readers interested in a gritty potrayal of the low end of life in Manhattan will be mesmerized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Matthew Scudder prequel","review":"In this book, Matthew Scudder reminisces about a period in the early seventies, when he was an alcoholic and helped out some of his drinking buddies. The narative is taut, the language is excellent and the scenarios are entirely plausible. This is perhaps one of Scudder's best books, although it is somewhat underrated. This book does not have the anticlimactic ending like in the later Scudder novels, and leaves the reader refreshed. I simply could not get up before finishing the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh that wonderful sleaze!","review":"This is the first time that I've read a Matthew Scudder novel, and I must say that I enjoyed it. Matt Scudder is one of the most human hard-bitten detectives that I've ever come across. And Block does not shy away from hard and dismal topics. This book is about drinking friendships. He points out throughout the book that people really don't know the people that they drink with. It is also about betrayal, greed and it even has a cold-blooded killer. Block really knows his city, and that comes across in these pages. It reminded me of \\"The Maltese Falcon\\". Block knows New York and its people in this setting (which is 1970's New York) like Hammett knew 1920's San Franscisco. This is high praise indeed because The Maltese Falcon is such a perfect detective story. This one measures up just as well. I will have to read more of Matt Scudder, I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"About as good as it gets","review":"This is about as good as it gets.

And Lawrence Block is without a doubt one of the leading practitioners of the art. In this Shamus Award nominated novel, PI Matt Scudder takes on two seemingly unconnected crimes--the holdup of an after hours joint and the murder of a friend's wife, seeking justice in both cases.As always, Block is especially good at writing about the drinking life. And boy does Matt Scudder drink. Block is also excellent at creating a sense of place and making it a part of the story. In this case the place is New York City and by the time you finish the novel you feel like you've taken a trip to the Big Apple. All in all, this is a highly readable addition to the genre of PI fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shobu's Fire Deck","review":"My friend has this deck, and man does it rock. Just cause it has no blockers, don't say it's no good. Because it is. Very good.

The rarest card in the deck is Metalwing Skyterror. Cost: 7, Power: 7000, Effect: Destroy one blocker when this creature attacks, Mana #: 1. Very powerful, with very nice artwork. Go buy this!(Just for the record, I demodified my deck to a Kokujo deck for the duels.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deck!","review":"Duel Masters is one of my favorite card games, and Shobu is one of my favorite characters from the show! So when I bought his deck, I was assuming to see all the essentials we all know and love from the show. Bolshack Dragon, Armored Blaster Valdios, Gattling Skyterror, Scarlet Skyterror, y'know. I am very happy with this deck, however, my only disappointment is that none of the above cards were in it! It still rocks, and has all my favorite swarm creatures, and Metalwing Skyterror is awesome, too. So I still enjoy it. Buy this deck, it's worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleasant spur-of-the-moment purchase","review":"Reminiscent of Buddha Bar-type stuff, this album's chock full of psy/goa fusiony sitary goodness. The title track (Ocean Birds, #3) is fantastic, mixing East, West, and South East Asian influences with what reminds me of far West European/Celtic melodies. Truly inspired stuff. I also like track #9. Although each track is acoustically distinct from the rest, the whole package sticks pretty close to the worldbeat style and will be to some listeners somewhat monotonous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Made of Leather","review":"These new Protec valve guards are not made of real leather, but synthetic leather. The older guards were made of real leather. Normally this is not a concern unless you are in a situation where your left hand sweats when you are playing - then this valve guard can get quite slippery. And since the new guards are synthetic, they do not mold to your horn like the original real leather guards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discolored my valves","review":"I used this valve guard for about a week, and when I took it off to clean my trumpet, I noticed coppery discoloration all around the valves of my silver Bach strad. I am not sure if this valve guard was designed for a brass trumpet, but definitely did not expect this on my silver trumpet. The discoloration is not coming off with my wipe cloth.

To say the least, the text was wordy and often got distracted with details that are insignificant to the general practitioner and unnecessary for the pre-doc student. The faculty at nova have promised to review other texts in preparation for next year's class. Trust me, this book will force you to wade through a sea of useless information to find the clinically pertinant information. Don't waste your time unless you are obsessed with details. I hope this was helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the series so far.","review":"Still not a great story, but a very good one, this book is better than any of its predecessors in the \\"Stargazer\\" series, and is the first of the series to really live up to what I expect from Michael Jan Friedman, who is a solid, dependable storyteller if not generally a producer of truly memorable tales.The characterizations in this book are excellent, with even Admiral McAteer being somewhat less 2-dimensional than usual, and we finally have some real progress made in a few of the subplots that have been treading water since book one. As usual for Friedman, there are few if any of the careless typos that all too often show up in mass-market paperbacks, and the story unfolds smoothly and competently. Definitely worth a read if you enjoy Star Trek at all, and possibly even if you're not overly familiar with the genre. If you're already familiar with the genre and hostile toward it, there's nothing here to make you change your mind, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great characters, good Star Trek, average plot","review":"I have read the Stargazer series from the beginning. The stories are loosely interconnected much like the TV series. To get the full understanding of the plot ending, you will need to read the two preceeding books. However, the plot ends abruptly and without much notice.Read the book for the characters, who well done and are a pleasure to read. I actually like the series for the interaction of the characters.

Necessary Roughness is all about the fun. Every episode has laughs and at least one ahhhh moment.I like the way they have taken characters they introduced in the first season and are building on them. This is a young show and has a lot of potential for growth.My only complaint is that I find the romance between Dani and Matt forced. As much as I like the actor who plays Matt, I don't really see the chemistry between this couple. Add that to the fact his life is in a very different place than the newly divorced Dani and it isn't working for me. If they want to find a romantic interest for Dr. Dani Santino, they should look no further than the character of Nico, the 'fixer' for the football team. That is a couple that has chemistry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show is loosing its apeal","review":"This show is starting to loose its apeal to viewers.

Great story. The kids in the film are wonderful, particularly the middle daughter. This film is about creativity and inspiration, but it is also about the way human beings depend upon each other for that magic we call a good life, a life worth living. This is one of those little gems, like Field of Dreams, that makes film-making itself appear to be magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't You Wish It Was True","review":"The people who were involved with this film put together a nice little magical trip into humanity. I see some reviewers pigeonhole this film as a family film. Personally, I think it is a film for everyone. I usually enjoy a good comedy, science fiction, drama, or suspense journey in a movie. This film is none of the above.I have toyed with watching this movie for quite some time. Finally, the names Rob Reiner and Morgan Freeman yanked me into this magical opus. I do respect both men's abilities.I think John Lennon's words best sum up this movie...\\"Life is what happens while you're busy making other plans.\\"As for the neighborhood portrayed in this film, I wouldn't mind living there.Road Trip"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie!","review":"I was surprise how much I enjoy the movie the actors did a really good performance.

Good for famly if your trying to explan death to younger children and some adults who never really get it. Morgan as usual imparts some very good life lessons courtesy of Reiner. I jwouldve enjoyed the lake if you ever really got to see it. You dont have enough of a back drop to make good on the lagging storyline. Its an \\"eh\\" for me. really wanted to like it due to Morgan and Reiner teaming up. Not meaty enough the story, couldnt figure out what the magic was either with a drunken old man in a wheelchar railing against everything including air!

Morgan Freeman is the only bright spot. Seriously. All the other actors are terrible in comparison, and the whole movie feels stiff and fake. The dialogue is flat and in no way believable, except for Morgan Freeman (the lone reason this review manages 2 stars). I am surprised to be writing this negative review because I am definitely not a harsh movie critic, but I was very disappointed by this movie. It should be a great feel-good movie, but all I am feeling right now is that I wasted almost two hours of my life that I will never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah!","review":"I usually like Morgan Freeman's acting, but I didn't like this movie at all.

They are somewhat heavy-handed in their cold war propaganda, and the costumes (particularly the wigs) leave something to be desired, and this combines to make the movies a bit more comedic than intended, but the acting is fine and I personally found them enjoyable movies.The subtitles are generally well-done (readable and relatively accurate), and the dialogue is clearly spoken, so they would also be good for students of German.If you like these you may also want to check out the Czech \\"Lemonade Joe\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A must-read for fans but...","review":"After reading Rudy Rucker's Software, Wetware et al, this book is a must have/must read. But I found it a bit of a letdown compared to the others. I kinda had the feeling that Rudy was trying too hard to \\"be a better *writer*\\", like maybe he took a writing course and it ruined him <grin>. The ideas stop coming around 1/2 way through the book, and the rest gets to be \\"she went here, he did this, she did that, blah-blah...\\". His previous books left me with a lot of ideas and images that I can never forget... ice-cream trucks that steal and freeze your head, cosmic rays that encode alien personalities... but from this one, mostly I remember being unpleasantly stuck in bubble.I loved the others in the series but this one fell flat for me. Still, if you've read the others you have to read this one too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rudy Rucker's NICE book - Beaver Cleaver, Clean & Sober","review":"Nice, yeah, like warm milk and chocolate chip cookies. (Rudy, what were attempting? did you get what you wanted? what your editors wanted?) This book doesn't have the insane edge, like his earlier three books of the same series (Software, Wetware, Freeware), as well as, Hacker & the Ants. I've read all these other books at least 3 times each and own numerous copies of them. I think they are great reads and have given copies out to friends for years to turn them onto Rucker. But this latest? It ends with a wonderful double wedding and everyone lives happily every after. Yucch! Too Wholesome. I get the impression that Rucker was trying for a \\"Caledcott\\" award winner. Vapid & insipid, as accused above? Yes, I'd have to agree. I'm still a Rucker fan. But this one tastes like baby pablum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Realware is nowhere near as much fun as the other three books in thewhole Ware series.

Chuck in some aliens and other dimensions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's paranoia but...","review":"I loved Rudy Rucker's other books - all of them - to the point of obsession. This \\"clean and sober\\" [stuff] in this one finally cinches it for me: I'm now CERTAIN the ONDCP's antidrug campaign is targeting book publishers as well as TV, radio and movie producers. Essentially, the media is being paid by the government to pump out antidrug propaganda, and make it come from the very mouths of the drug culture heroes and top minds. Two weeks ago I just heard Neil Young praising the Patriot Act and giving a speech saying \\"we all need to give up our freedoms for a while so we can keep them for the long term\\". Now it seems they've got Rudy, too. How do they do this? Pay them off, or threaten to off them? Who knows?

The story line, what there is of it, is laughable - and I don't mean that in a good way. Rucker's misogynistic view of women is insulting and very sad. His take on the elderly, or elderly consciousness anyway, is so completely off base I have to wonder if he knows anyone older than 15, besides himself. It makes me wonder how much he paid the publisher to get this on the shelves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute holiday coasters","review":"Was looking for holiday coasters and these fit the bill.

A score is good when one is able to visualize in his/her head what is happening on screen at the time of the music. This is one thing that I noted when I listen to this score. It was like I was watching Daredevil again on my ride home from work. Although I am an advocate of putting movie dialogue in the score, and the DD score didn't provide us with any of the wonderful quotes we could have gotten, I still liked this score, and would place it at the top of my list, and reccommend it to any Daredevil fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my style","review":"I don't even remember what prompted me to purchase this item.

This game no longer spins in my disc tray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Game had an unfinished quality...","review":"I'm at a lull in between playing the newer releases, and decided to pick up Lionheart on a whim. Even at a fraction of the original cost, I found this game virtually unplayable. While the premise is original, I found the subject matter distasteful (too much focus on the inquisition), and the graphics tiny, outdated, and the character avatars really, really ugly.The game had an unfinished quality, and I found the combat at the beginning way too hard. Entering into dungeons my character was immediately mauled and killed. There is almost no tutorial, and no learning curve for new players, and hardly any place to get money or weapons.Also I chose and built a female character, I was surprised to discover that her voiceset sounded very male!

Black Isle has produced better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn!","review":"Dull, dull, dull... This game is really not up to the standard we have come to expect from Black Isle and Interplay. Primary Headaches: Inability to pause and target enemies during combat. (Makes archers and magic users just about useless), Boring quests - the kind we expected in the early days of roleplaying. Games is not the most stable I have seen either. All in all, you are better off going back and paying an earlier Black Isle game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Une déception totale","review":"Lion Heart est un jeu plein de déceptions. Malheureusement, le nouveau système de jeu est très inovateur, mais très mal exploité. De plus, la qualité graphique des animations n'égale mme pas celle retrouvée dans Baldur's Gate I. Le personne se déplace brusquement et ne possède aucune fluidité ou de mouvement naturel. Il ressemble à un robot. J'ai été fortement déu de la qualité de ce jeu et je crois que les programmeurs au niveau des graphiques auraient pu fournir un effort supplémentaire lors de la conception des animations. De plus, les arrières plans ne sont pas plus impressionnant, ils ont tous le mme ton et il cache ce que le personnage devrait voir à cause de l'Effet 2D. Lion Heart ressemble au jeu des années 1999.

The first half of the game plays well, it is balanced and fun to play. The second half on this game after the Crypt of the Lance and Nostradamus quest (English Invasion of Spain) is THE WORST thought out combat system of any RPG! From here the games is no longer an RPG, it becomes a hack and slash with the games combat engine favoring enemy character which you CANNOT go one on one melee without allied help or more healing items than the games merchants allow you to buy.Overall, I give this game one star.

It is wonderful! The author is a trained psychologist, but he writes with tender romanticism about his beautiful, brilliant wife. Although we meet her as she is teetering over the edge into the darkness of dementia, he brings her vividly back to life by telling us about her as a young woman, a mother,a musician, college professor, community activist and good friend, so that we mourn with him as he watches the woman he knew disappear. He offers a lot of insight into how to understand the Alzheimer's patient and what kind of help the caregiver needs in order to make the right decisions. This book is not a downer, but ultimately a moving message about how great faithfulness makes life's sorrows bearable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a \\"how to\\" book","review":"I was swept off my feet by this book. It is a love story between a man and his wife, Roberta, who was fighting the battle with Alzheimer's, and between both of them and God. The author's faith grew even as the strain of taking care of his wife increased. His training as a psychologist enabled him to reveal his feelings in many difficult circumstances and to empathize with the horrors that his wife was going through. At times I cried and at other times I laughed. This is not a how-to book. Rather, it is a book written from the inner experience of the caregiver as he accompanied his wife day by day from the earliest days of her journey into this horrific disease, until the day he placed her in the keeping of professional caregivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great start to a great band","review":"I cannot say enough about Swell. They are a wildly underrated band, sort of an indie-pop Helmet, if you will. This is, as far as I know, their very first album first released on vinyl in the late 80s and then again on cassette tape shortly afterward. Poppy upbeat songs alternate with shoe gazing, and sometimes even menacingly dark tracks. 'Sick side of a church' is an electric organ peice with a sample of a man on a street corner preaching his twisted views to an uncaring world. Wooden Hippie Nice [wouldn't it be nice] is about as happy as I have ever heard this band, almost dreamily euphoric. A very fun album from a band destined to do great things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Last fall I used this book to study for the PSAT. I found it to be of minimal value.

She is very interested in animals and has already expressed a desire to be a vet. Admittedly I am a little biased but I think she is a very intelligent child and she loves the animal hospital. She had to get every piece out and examine it immediately upon opening it. I think this would be a very good experience for any child who is interested in animals. It allows them to see some of the instuments that a vet would use and they can set up their own little office. This is not to be used to treat real, live animals though. There are lots of pieces in the set so if you have a child who gets frustrated easily or has trouble keeping track of lots of pieces, this probably would not be a good selection for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves it...","review":"I think that this item is a bit overpriced for the size and durability.

Although it is short, it makes some significant points about the strengths and weaknesses of the fundamentalist movement in America. Written by Richard Mouw, president of Fuller Seminary, the book draws upon Mouw's personal experiences growing up, as well as with his later evaluation of those experiences using his tools as a philosophy professor. I grew up in a liberal mainline denomination and found myself, both in college and later, drawn to the passion and committment of a more conservative faith. This books helps to explain this attraction. It is must reading for anyone 'burned' by 'fundies' or anyone who looks at fundamentalism with the smug prejudice of a pharisee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as thorough as I'd hoped","review":"As an evangelical, I had reason to read this book.

If you could combine Dr. Schweitzer, Dr. Doolittle, Tarzan, and Wonder Woman into one person...it would be Jane Goodall.

For example, she learned that some of the Africans are killing mother chimpanzees for bush meat and then selling off thedistressed chimp babies. Rather than let these orphans suffer cruel lives, Dr. Goodall began a compound where these animals are given \\"round the clock\\" care, attention, and love.The movie also explores the social world of chimpanzees as well as the range of passions of these primates. I learned that somechimps are as brutal as Attila the Hun and others as gentle asFlorence Nightingale. This film embodies all of Dr. Goodall's work and is a delight for children as well as adults.

It attathes with velcro instead of the ties. It attatches all the way to the top of the crip railings so your infant cant use it as a step stool to get out like a bumper would. Since I bought the cribshield my daugher has slept through the night because her little legs dont get caught.

Numerous people who blindly believe in everything they are told always try to connect such things to their beliefs. It is stupid, shortsighted and narrow-minded to express such thought. J.R.R. Tolkien said himself in foreword of the book: \\"As for any inner meaning or 'message', it has in the intention of the author none. It is neither allegorical nor topical. ... I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence.\\"The least people can do is respect authors wishes."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST WANTED TO POINT THIS OUT","review":"When Tolkien wrote the Lord of the Rings, i gather from all i have read on him that he had no intention of having relate to god. If you read the history set forth in other books he has written on Middle-Earth you will find that while the god in the books is the one and only god they have many god-like beings, unlike the cristain religon. The elves for instance worship countless numbers of these \\"beings\\". Tom Bombadil is only one example of this. However for all i know Tolkien may have for some obsure reason written the Lord of the Rings with refrences to the christian religon but as he devoloped it, it is clear to that he evolved it out of that phase. Now, do not think me as a disloyal christain, because i'm not a christain. So, buy this book if you like, but for my sake please stop and laugh at it every ten seconds."},{"rating":"1","title":"find god in tolkien???","review":"the idea of finding god in tolkiens works is absolutely ridiculous. if tolkien knew such a work of literary garbage existed using the title of his books he would roll over in his grave. don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"god in LOTR?\\" Which one?","review":"This book is laughable. The unfortunate truth is that this book, like all religions, is a fairy tale. The good news is that unlike christianity, no one has been murdered, raped, or otherwise brutalized in the name of Tolkien's masterpieces. My advice is to read LOTR with an OPEN mind. Appreciate the books for their own merit and don't attempt to associate them with your religious beliefs. Their content is wholly allegorical. Period. Those who find confirmation of a biblical god in these works are the same unfortunates who find the virgin mary in a lopsided bagel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe for nervous parents?","review":"I rate this book with two stars only because, as an apologetic directed to Christian parents who may be nervous about content in LOTR that mentions \\"magic\\" and occult-like situations, I think \\"Finding God\\" succeeds in providing insight into the actual ethical and even godly applications of Tolkien's themes.David Zampino's review stated: \\"There were also the odd factual error (which only a Tolkien trivia buff like myself would notice) which should have been caught by the authors or the editors.\\"I think Mr. Zampino underestimated other Tolkien fans. I was so disappointed in the number of factual errors that for me the authors' credibility was compromised.

Factual!","review":"To the reader on January 31, 2004 and to all who think like this person: J.R.R. Tolkien himself was a Christian and thus his rendition of the Lord of the Rings was a Christian work. Tolkien may not have written his work as an allegory, but he did write his work with a Christian conscience.

I had expected a literary study of Christian themes, the relation between myth and truth, Christ imagery, how prayer works in the books, etc. Instead, what I found was a series of brief chapters in which the authors spend a couple pages rehashing some aspect of the story, then a couple more offering a devotional application to our own lives. This might be suitable for family worship if everyone in the family has seen the movie, but it's of no use to me. To others interested in this Christian themes, I recommend \\"Tolkien: Author of the Century\\" and another little book on \\"Virtues\\" in \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" the exact title of which escapes me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding the man","review":"If one reads other works about Tolkien, the man, not just as the inventor of Middle-Earth, one does take into account the uncontested fact that his faith did permeate his life. Although he didn't write LOTR primarily for any 'religious' purpose, it's simplistic to dismiss the fact that his faith, precisely as the life-blood that ran through his veins, does surface at various, unmistakeable points throughout LOTR.(The prior review, albeit with numerous spelling errors, tries to criticize the book for its allegorical approach. Perhaps we should give the authors the freedom to conduct whatever literary study they choose. Re: Tolkien's \\"hate\\" of allegory--I would like to see the source of that comment. That sounds more like C.S. Lewis' comment relating to his Chronicles of Narnia rather than Tolkien.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent early cinema","review":"A revelatory three-disc collection of early films from Gaumont Studios that demonstrate the studio's technical and aesthetic brilliance at the dawn of commercial cinema. Discs are devoted to the studio's first three house directors--Alice Guy, Louis Feuillade and Léonce Perret. Guy is revealed as a founder of cinema; all three made films as good or better than anything produced in the United States. Note particularly Guy's THE GAMEKEEPER'S SON (1906), Feuillade's THE TRUST (1911) and Perret's THE CHILD OF PARIS (1913), the last a two-hour feature.

It is one song (if you want to call it that), 43 minutes + in length. A long drawn out series of sounds that I personally can find no connection with.I talked with Simeon (the founder of the group) at a concert, shortly after Decatur was released. By his own words \\"We kind of stuck our necks out on that one.\\" I'll say. It is kind of relaxing in its own way, but I warn you, don't buy it if you're expecting music like Silver Apples/Contact or Beacon - this is completely different.

My favorite tracks are 9 and 14, which is a collaboration with a Sex Styled Kool Keith. 14 might actually be the most fun to listen to, since Keith is so entertaining in his perversions. But the album is great. My biggest question is: WHERE IS THIS GUY NOW? This album came out in 96.

This is going back to the dealer. The software is not at all intuitive, and is very clunky. My one last effort of scanning a slide resulted in a \\"post-processing error\\" and terminated the slide scan.Maybe if you're a professional and/or have all day to tinker, this it can be made to work.

There are two pieces of software (one to view,one to scan) with overlapping functions ( eg resolution) and they do not seem to communicate well with each other.....no problem, I changed the settings on both pieces of software. I try scanning at maximum resolution and the file size turns out to be about 130 mb for a negative. I try lowering the resolution but it wont allow it.

But there is no batch mode at all, no slide feeder available, and getting through a roll of slides or 5 strips of film takes all night! I had the Minolta ScanDual before - it was much faster to scan batches but the quality was not nearly as high. I think at this price point, there has to be a tradeoff, and Nikon chose to go for quality of image at the expense of speed of operation.With 1,000 slides and hundreds of rolls of negatives to scan, I know I'll become very close to this new device over the coming months - hopefully the speed won't drive me crazy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Not the cheapest film scanner, but for ease of installation, ease of use, and quality of results, this is the way to go. I particularly like the dirt and scratches filter (ICE) which works amazingly well, and the Kodachrome profile (which older versions did not have).Downsides? It's slow. It makes noise (though not nearly as much as others I've heard). It's fussy when you try to feed in the film strip.

This gifted threesome (hehe!) has put out one of the most original sonic offerings in the expiri-metal world; their sound is like nothing you've ever heard. Drunk on \\"phaser\\" pedals (circa 1973) and playing knee-bendingly heavy riffs that build up to completely demolishing crecsendos, changing to BOSS heavy-metal pedals and INSANELY-LOW death growls. However, their use of death roars only once in a-long-while makes the music sound so powerful it could even make scrawny unpopular white people like us flex a muscle (what do you mean you're not scrawny? I can see your arms right there... oh my, their big... and smooth) . The best way to explain these guys accurately is, \\"Pink Floyd meets The Melvins at a Cannibal Corpse show\\". Incredible progressive heaviness that no self-respecting music listener should be without. Buy it!...Actually, buy two"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect VAIO Travel Bag!","review":"I love this bag.

Gerbert's greed leads to the Giant's capture of Roary. All ends well, however, as Gerbert realizes that Roary is much more important than any toy or possession. <Based on the video jacket>This is a video for 3 to 6 year olds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Force read","review":"White Teeth was a tolerable read however I tried to read this on and off over a period of 2 years until I was determined not to let my money go to complete waste. Result was I skim read it all just to get it over and done with. I found the phrases repetitive with a lot of useless details. I think the characters were written with the aim to have enough flaws as to appear realistic but I found them all rather flat and I held no particular regard for any of them. In the end I couldn't care less about what happened, I just wanted to get to the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"Unfortunately I have to agree with those who have given a 1 star rating to Zadie Smith's sophomore product. I thought it might be my fault I didn't seem to enjoy this \\"genuinely funny and entertaining\\" book...alas! it's not me who is \\"guilty\\" here. I just fail to understand why promising authors as Zadie Smith and Monica Ali are such a flop in their second effort! I loved Smith's On Beauty, it must be the best of all three, and decided to fill the gaps by buying The Autograph Man, but it's indeed a torture to read as another reader has commented...

The story of a half-Chinese, half Jewish halfwise autograph man, a drunkard and drug addict who doesn't get along with life, love and religion, sadly isn't even half-interesting or - behave - intelligent. In fact it is really annoying: the initial situation offers some some basic aproaches but Zadie Smith doesn't manage to develope them thrillingly.

What a let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torture!","review":"I hate to be the first person to give this book a 1-star rating but after about the first 50 pages or so I found it a TORTURE to read. Zadie Smith is a talented writer, and I had very much enjoyed her first novel, but I could barely make myself finish this one. Some of the problems with it: I didn't like the main character enough to really care about what happened to him. Also, (I'm Jewish myself but) I found all the stuff about Judaism tiresome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many repititions...","review":"I am halfway through this book and I am already so annoyed by the references of \\"international gesture\\"...the first two three times it was somehow funny...I am now on page 164 ..and she still keeps on using it..that is quite a turn off...repeting stuff over and over again...also, why does she has to refer to the singers always as \\"the popular singer John Lennnon\\", \\"the popular singer Leonard Cohen\\"....small details like this made me quite annoyed while reading the book...and most of the jokes are not really that funny...I think it is still readable...but I must say that I have to put some effort to finish it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Smith's Best","review":"Other than the first few pages, this book is a huge disappointment.

Every attempt to read this book has been painful and each time I have given up.I have decided to sell it to a bargain book shop in the hope that someone can appreciate it more than I have.After loving her first book, I was deeply hurt by this one. Nothing, absolutely nothing motivated me to continue reading this book and I have finished some real doorstops in my time.Sorry Zadie but I just didn't like it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"The prologue was wonderful - every bit as good as White Teeth - but the body of the book is terrible. The characters were dull and self-absorbed, so I really didn't want any of them to meet a happy ending. Reading about them felt like being the only sober person at a party - that is, a party full of glamour-slumming 22-year-olds who thought they were being very deep. I'll keep my faith in Zadie Smith, though. White Teeth and the prologue to Autograph Man were too brilliant to just give up on her."},{"rating":"1","title":"No seconds, please...","review":"I wanted so badly to like Smith's second novel The Autograph Man. However,half way through the novel it was becoming more and more difficult to convince myself, that the novel would turn around. Two reasons I decided to give this book one star:(1) Alex Li-Tandem's character wasn't developed enough, to even make the reader care about his trail of destruction.(2)The book simply wasn't humerous, and I expected humor, after reading White Teeth which I loved.I know Smith is coping and trying deal with the themes of celebrity in her sophomore novel, but she she has come up short with the Autograph Man."},{"rating":"2","title":"try the audiobook","review":"The Autograph Man is made for listening-- especially because the reader of the audiobook, Stephen Crossley, gives one of the best performances I have ever heard.

The first chapter was pretty good but since then I have not been able to motivate myself to sit down and read it. I am at page 100 and after reading the other reviews I am giving up. It just has not caught my interest. I don't care what happens to the characters. A boring read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I supposed to follow this?","review":"I picked up this book not only for Smith's reputation, but b/c it seemed odd enough to fall in love with. It was odd. And although I can appreciate the lack of energy/motivation the main character possesses as a general stereotype on the new English generation, this book fell extremely short of readable. I haven't read White Teeth, but I did see the short series that came out and if anyone is wanting to read Zadie Smith, stick with that and steer clear of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Ain't No White Teeth","review":"Reading this book is a grind.

However, I couldn't get past p. 150."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has all been said","review":"I have little to add to the previous reviews of this boring book.

If you are expecting something completely different then you will enjoy Smith's latest novel.At times her main characters seem one dimensional at best, but what is to be expected in this tale of the search for celebrity. Throughout the book I found myself loving and hating Alex (the main character) at the same time, just as I did Holden Caufield (Catcher in the Rye) so many years ago. Any relatively sociable person can relate to his friends and business associates, aggravating at their worst, necessary at their best.There are plenty of laughs to be had and Smith has once again forced readers to look at the absurdity of everyday life and smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not Recommend","review":"I really enjoyed all of the characters in Smith's debut novel called \\"White Teeth\\".

I often read historical romance, and although I tire of page after page of descriptions, I would like some! This book is VERY simply written, no flowery language or heated dialoge. A description of the hero's house reads like a kids book report, \\"It had a fireplace...It had good windows...It had four bedrooms...\\" The characters are undeveloped, and halfway in they've spoken less than a page of dialoge to anyone. I'm the type that can't put a book down whether it's good or bad, I just have to finish it, and yet this time, I have no interest in what happens to these people. Although the author seems to be able to come up with a wonderful plot idea, her telling of the story seems stilted and unemotional, her writing unorganized and uninspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I have always loved Norah Hess' books, but I was really disappointed after reading this one.

Nonetheless, I'd skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good...","review":"I bought this film yesterday and put it in my VCR with great excitement, only to find the story disapointing. It showed poor Alvin being chased by a wolfman through a forest! There was another scene where Theodore was being picked on by a bully, when Dave wanted to go up there to help his son, the principal said, \\"He has to fight his own battles.\\" After about 20 minutes of watching this tape... I shut it off. I liked the Frankenstein one better... I am begining to question the type of material that Ross Jr. uses to make these films... Some scenes were quite frightning in the begining... I hope that in the future Bagdasarian Productions does less monster movies and more family type films.

Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolfman is great. It was really funny. It's scarier than the Chipmunk Adventure but it's still good, though the Chipmunk Adventure definitley has more songs. At first, I thought Alvin HAD gone around the bend thinking that Mr. Talbot was a were wolf but he was right. I like the part when Alvin got the auditorium covered in green goo."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love the Chipmunks, this one's for you!","review":"Ross Bagdasarian and Janice Karman are back with an all-new, fun, and exciting adventure featuring the chipper trio of Alvin, Simon, and Theodore. Like the last feature video (Frankenstein) this latest video revolves around the spooky misadventures of David Seville's creatively overstimulated sons, with the Chippetts tagging along this time for good measure. Admittedly, the video lacks the thrill and excitement of The Chipmunk Adventure (it's not made with quite the ambition or reverence) but still won't disappoint those of us who grew up with the Chipmunks (especially those of us who grew up with the 80s version of the show). In an age where daily animated programs have all the charm of the average protozoa, this latest installment of The Chipmunks is welcome relief."},{"rating":"1","title":"bought this for Samsung T809...don't!","review":"I bought this for my Samsung T809 as amazon said it would fit my phone.

But with this product I HAD to review it.... I struggled with the ANNOYING childproof lock that makes it virtually impossible to take it apart and it hurts to open it. I have to soak it EVERY time to get the food out so I can open it, but I would deal with it. But that is NOT why I am writing. I just discovered that this product will fit perfectly over his mouth and nose, like a match made in heaven. Which is pretty bad because it could easily suffocate him. These lids are going in the trash. I will continue to use them WITHOUT the lids (lest someone else let him play with them. However, given the hassle that it is to open it I think we may just go with the Munchkin ones. Very upset about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"I thought this was a great idea until I tried it. My first thought was to try this with a piece of frozen banana. Terrible idea. My baby was not only not interested in trying to suck on this (probably because he never liked pacifiers and it doesn't look like food to him), but he just painted himself and his toys in gooey, sticky banana mess. I then thought about washing it and trying again with a different food. It is nearly impossible to take apart and clean!! Once I got it apart, I realized that every hole in the net was stuffed with banana. I let it soak..I scrubbed..I let it soak some more. Ultimatly, the net got \\"clean\\" but is now stained brown. Yuck. I don't understand all the positive reviews on this product. It is such a bother that I doubt I'll ever try it again. Unless your baby loves pacifiers, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"messy and difficult to use","review":"This product is a good concept but poorly designed. You need a steady supply of replacement nets - it gets really nasty especially after eating foods that turn brown like bananas or avocados. Tried boiling them and scrubbing them, but they're stained a nasty brown.The other problem with this is that after your baby eats, this thing is pretty much slimed. The system they use to lock the net in place becomes really difficult to unlock once it's all slimey."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly designed, pain to clean","review":"Awful product. I would not recommend it to anyone. It's not only poorly designed (too many parts, too many little crevices that food can get trapped in that make it a pain in the you know what to clean) but it's also poorly constructed -- the mesh bag is not completely finished on the inside. It has a raw edge which helps the fabric unravel fast, posing a danger to your baby if you are not careful with it as another reviewer wrote earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuts Down on Mess!","review":"Good tool for that time when kids are transitioning to solid foods but don't quite have the motor skills necessary to pick them up or eat them properly. Cuts down on the mess produced too, the option to fling small pieces of food everywhere isn't present making it easier for parents. Replacement nets are available though may not be necessary depending on how fast your child transitions to eating whole foods."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT buy this product","review":"Within three uses, the stitching at the end of the mesh bag had come open and my 6-month-old baby had a large piece of fruit (aka a choking hazard) in his mouth. Do not buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Feeder but babies either love it or don't","review":"Our first baby wasn't interested in using the feeder - and we tried several different items inside. I thought it was a great idea and know plenty of parents who love it. We tried it with our second and he LOVES it! He's interested in EVERYTHING we put inside. It's great to use when you're out but of course bring a bib. Using the feeder, keeps him occupied during dinner and he loves feeding himself (but hasn't yet master the pincher grasp). In addition, to frozen fruits/veggies as well as a few fresh fruits, we also use the teething biscuits which prevents him from choking/gagging (again babies are different b/c my first son didn't have a problem with the teething biscuits but our second does...so the feeder works great). Each baby is different but honestly I think it's worth a try!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big for baby's mouth","review":"I got it for my then 5-months-old baby. The mash net was too big, so it makes it really hard for my baby to use it. I only tried it twice and had stopped using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential Hazard to your baby's health - Do not buy!","review":"I initially loved this product until I found green chipped paint from the feeder. It probably came off from my son's gnawing. I didn't even realize that there is paint on the feeder until it chipped off. If you look closely a the rim, every other square is painted green. I was so upset to know that paint was used on a product given to babies. The paint serves no such purpose an is barely noticeable. I am appalled to think that my son may have eaten some of the chipped paint for no reason. I will not buy any more product from a company with no regard for children's safety."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this!","review":"We just got our Sassy feeding teether and it's an instant hit with our 8 month old son.

Locked the food in place with no problem. Easy to grip. But the mesh is super thick and large. My little girl, who loves food and puts everything in her mouth, didn't want to put this in her mouth. She tried it, made an awful face and refused to put it near her face again. I introduced at 6 months, and then every few weeks after that. I've since given up.I don't blame her. I tried to eat an apple slice through it. I got hardly any juice and the feel of the mesh in my mouth was gross.

I have tried a couple different brands, but this one is my favorite because when it has replacement bags for like $2.99, so when you've washed one several times and it starts to look dingy, you can just toss it- this one also comes completely apart for better cleaning, but it isn't white, so it doesn't look dingy after the first round of carrots :) It is a little hard to open (especially with banana-covered fingers) because you have to push the tabs and unscrew, but better safe than sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Dreamer","review":"Excellent CD.

The mixing is so smooth you can't even tell when one track ends and a new one begins, except for when he cranks up the bass drum kick in each transition. This stuff will blow any good club or house party up. Chris Fortier's latest Bedrock release, Danny Howells' recent stuff and Digweed's G.U. LA CD all come to mind when you hear such skillful mixing and such nasty beats. If you like drivin' house music without diva-ish vocals or techno-ey synthesizers, then this is the album for you. Definitely the best prog house release so far this year (2003)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and incomplete","review":"While this book will give a newcomer *some* idea of how to use XML with Microsoft's XML parser, the examples are weak, and it is difficult or impossible to find detailed information.

The examples don't work the way the author says they should (I've confirmed one example of this with Microsoft Press, whose rep couldn't figure it out, either), and worse, the author slides sideways into very technical discussions about concepts that haven't yet been defined.

The background information is still informative, but there isn't enough coverage of the API. The DOM API documentation is out-of-date and few useful examples are given. There is no coverage of the SAX API (which is supposed to be easier to use) whatsoever. None of the examples work with a webserver and only work if you open the file locally! I found myself using the MSDN Online website instead of referring to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a text on learning XML?","review":"Chapter 1 -3 are interesting. However, few examples are provided, and the content is real weak on syntax. I feel gipped, but hey, you will get plenty of screen clips containing the IE browser!

Mr. Pardi covers just the right technologies, and has clear examples of them. Immediately after reading the book, you'll be able to start using XML productively.

There seems to be no mention of MS's (important and controversial) extensions. Much of the text repeats the obvious without wisdom. For example, the author tells us that to declare an element with free form content we use the declaration <!ELEMENT test ANY>. He doesn't tell us, as other authors do, that, except for prototyping, this is a bad idea! In the theory and for IE 5 coverage Paul Spencer is much better. This book will especially disappoint database modelers."},{"rating":"1","title":"No practical use","review":"A great book for those who want to know in very general terms what XML is all about, but who don't actually want to do anything with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource and the code for the examples really works!","review":"I needed a book to teach me a lot about XML quickly.

XML could be expresses much easier...and this book really only touches some of the amazing abilities of this truly powerful language."},{"rating":"1","title":"A must NOT! read. 20% XML, 30% Java Scripts, 50% ??","review":"I did not like this book. It was a waste of money as far as I am concerned. There is not enough of an overview at the beginning, and the author quickly buries you with DTDs and JavaScript examples without very clear explanations. XLinks are one of the most important features of XML and they are not even mentioned until Chapter 7. There was very little in this book that I did not find on the web at w3c or xml.org. There is another book \\"Just XML\\", by John Simpson that I have only glanced through, but it appears to be much better organized and focused than this book. Sorry William."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broad but not deep","review":"This book is great if you use IE5 and you want to understand XML quickly. The author really focuses on the language and syntax, not really on implementation (I would have picked a different title). But the examples are clear and you get a lot on the CD. If you're new to XML and you want hands on exposure to some of the different XML technologies, this is one 'must have' in your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hand-waving, too many errors","review":"This book su**s. After reading the first couple of chapters, I thought it was great. Then it got way worse. Actual syntax gets almost no coverage. This leaves the reader to puzzle out the syntax from the examples. Unfortunately, the examples contain numerous mistakes. Also, Microsoft is apparently attempting to hijack XML just like it's trying to hijack Java and the Web in general. This book functions as a propaganda organ in that campaign. The section on data typing is a case in point. There is a bit of a disclaimer in there, but it's impossible to tell what is MS-specific and what isn't. Finally, the book makes almost no distinction between what is and is not codified. I had expected to read all about namespaces and URNs in the XML spec. Nooope. Experimental."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY POOR SOUND QUALITY on this MP3 album","review":"The sound quality on this MP3 album is horrible.

That tub is for the larger size and to be totally frank, I was soooooooooooo disappointed when this package arrived.

With the advent of no roaming charge within the USA cellular packages, the CIT200 is mostly used now for speaking to relatives outside the US and for making travel arrangements. You just cannot beat the Skype-Out cost for making calls! Prior to exclusively using the cell phone for long distance, the CIT200 was the mode of choice. To a person, nobody could tell that we were using VOIP through Skype on our desktop or laptop computers. Only drawback? You do need to have the PC on but heck, for the huge cost savings, no big deal. Since the date of our purchase in early 2007, the original rechargeable handset battery is still going strong. Buy the CIT200 and you'll be making a wise choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok.","review":"I got this phone cheap, as it has been discontinued. The phone is nice, durable, easy to use, and convenient. However, installing the phone will 'hijack' your audio capabilities, meaning that you can't listen to music or watch the news after install.

Return.","review":"Linksys tried, you have to hand it to them. They even made the phone look like a regular phone.Skype, however, does NOT support wireless phones. Every single wireless phone I've tried for Skype has dropped the calls. EVERY single one of them! Every call, you're mid-sentence, and can't go further. The wireless function is simply not supported by Skype, and Linksys won't be able to support you for that very reason.Verdict: get a USB phone for Skype, like the FRee1 from IPEVO. They are the #1 in Certified Skype phones for a good reason... mac compatible, great echo cancelation, you can travel with it (reliable and sturdy), and they have great customer service (which Skype won't give you, so you have to make sure the manufacturer does)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was nice, when it worked","review":"I went through two phones, returned both to Amazon.

(2008) for its appearance and the Kitchenaid brand. But it died last week (Aug 2009) for only light use. I have used several toaser ovens in the past and none of them died abruptly like this. The reason I replaced each of them was that they looked too old and too dirty. I can not imagine a solid brand like Kitchenaid (I have its full size food processor, mixer, dishwasher, etc) would make this kind of stuff to ruin its reputation... Anyway. I replaced this one with a Cuisinart covection oven. Looks great and works ok so far (only for a week).

This toaster oven is the worst I've ever owned, and that includes the ones you find for $20 at a garage sale. It doesn't heat quickly or evenly. In fact, it dries out toast before it toasts it. It also doesn't have a knob that allows you to set a normal toasting level, you have to use the timer every time, which is too imprecise to remember what level you want. I never thought it was possible to have such strong hatred of a small appliance, but now I know it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Addition to my Kitchen!","review":"I LOVE this countertop oven!

Not only is the quality very poor, the engineering is substandard and the company could care less. Kitchen Aid used to be a great brand, which swayed my decision to buy it, but now it seems to have become the low end brand of its parent company, Whirlpool. I am unsatisfied with its performance in all of its cooking functions and disappointed with its usability. In the end the single thing that really insulted me was the shabby treatment I received from customer service. The function selector knob broke (due to underdesign). Replacement parts are only available from the local service center. I was charged 10% of the MSRP of the entire appliance for a lousey plastic knob! $16!! and I had to drive 35 miles to pick it up myself or pay an additional $12 S&H.

The price is too high for what it offers and I really dislike the timing feature-WAY too annoying as it shuts off after 30 minutes max. It takes a LONG time to toast a few slices of bread, so I recommend using a toaster instead. The other way to improve this toaster is to avoid the black paint on the sides and top and replace it with the brushed stainless- as it is on the front. The paint wears off and scratches easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst toaster oven ever","review":"Takes forever to toast, burns everything when baking.... timer is useless at only 30 minutes.

My previous Panasonic toater oven worked 15 years. This one did not last five months. I sure wish I had read these reviews before buying a toaster oven.

Kitchen Aid should be ashamed about putting out such a poor product."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a pretty terrible toaster","review":"Ditto all the other bad reviews. I put this on my Crate & Barrel wedding registry because it was the more expensive of the two they carried at the time. Why on earth is Crate & Barrel still selling this thing?

The first thing you toast takes forever, and then if you put something else in after it's already hot, it burns in three seconds. Terrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This toaster oven is junk!! - 1-28-08","review":"This toaster oven was a replacement for a DeLonghi toaster oven we liked and had for years until it finally gave up. We have had other Kitchen Aid products which have seemed of good quality. I have finally had it with this piece of junk after burning our 10,000th piece of toast (no I didn't count). Burnt on one side and untoasted on the other. Brilliant. But who has time to go out shopping for kitchen appliances? That's it for this thing. I am quite certain the engineer that designed this is homeless today. I just purchased the Sanyo SK-VF7S from Amazon so I am crossing my fingers! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected better from KitchenAid","review":"I expected a lot more from this oven, bought to replace a flimsy B&D large capacity that lasted nearly 2 years. The paint was chipped where it met the chrome in my case too. I can live with that. The timer works for only 30 minutes, a definate minus. One hour should be minimum. I made a potato casserole and the top burned. Likewise, garlic breadsticks that were in for only 2 minutes, not the 4 called for. Toast is beautiful...on top only. A Barber Chicken Kiev was dry. I bought this because of the brand name as KitchenAid always meant the top of the line to me. I have a chicken I want to try roasting in it...but the timer will have to be reset. The handles are not necessary and stick out too far. You must keep this 4\\" away from all walls, backsplashes etc. A real downer. Some insulation would be welcome. It seems sturdy, but performance is lacking. They should have given this one a little more thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smoke doesn't look as nice","review":"The great appearnace and slide out crumb tray made this seem as if it was a really good oven. The first few times that I tried toast it took too long and came out dry and uneven. The 4th time I tried toast, I went for broke and put in 4 slices of wheat bread. It must have sensed that I was trying to tax its cabilities because it issued thick smoke from the control chamber on the right side. The smoke just doesn't look as nice as the oven, so I decided not to keep it. I think this is a pretty poor record of usage for less than a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Worth the price!","review":"I am VERY disappointed in this Kitchen Aid Oven. I wanted to get rid of my huge four slice toaster and try this beautiful six slice toaster oven, plus my husband sometimes eats a little later than the rest of the family the days he hits traffic coming home so I thought this would be GREAT to keep his food warm in without putting on my oven. Well, I gave up after 10 minutes trying to toast a bagel,it just dried out and NEVER toasted! The timer which is only 30 minutes drove me CRAZY with the constant ticking sound and the plate I tried to put in the oven did not fit! It was just a regular size dinner plate. I always read reviews on items before I buy. This time the item was on sale, it looked nice and it had a reputable name. I guess none of that matters because now I have to lug it back to the store!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working 2 weeks after the 1 year warranty expired","review":"Plus, it takes a long 7 minutes to toast, and you have to watch it carefully so that it doesn't burn.

The lettering wears off within 4 to 6 months--especially if you dare to clean them. I've called Kitchen Aid and they have replaced them 3 times already. Of course I have to tell them each time that the unit is only about a year old, otherwise they would not replace them. I will not pay for new dials because they literally are unreadable after 4-6 months anyway.Save yourself the hassle and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Design, Shoddy Materials","review":"What a disappointment! This toaster heats unevenly and takes forever to do the one thing it's supposed to do well: toast bread. The rack has no stop built into it so it shoots out of the toaster as if it were on greased skids every time I attempt to retrieve my dried out, poorly toasted toast. On top of that, after minimal use the function knob broke. I decided to look online to see if I could replace the knob and noticed that there are a ton of reviews with basically the same complaints. I've decided to put this one up on free-cycle and get a different toaster all together. KitchenAid used to stand for quality appliances, they seem to really have gone downhill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Toast","review":"Bought this toaster oven about 5 years ago. I like the look and size, the crumb tray pulls out and cleans easily. I like the 30 minute timer and that the oven shuts off when the time is up. I use this for heating and warming, good for muffins and warming frozen soft pretzels, I don't have high expectations from a toaster oven, except one. I use this every single day for toast, and it does a really poor job. I'm looking forward to replacing it, wish I did so 5 years ago!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but made cheap","review":"I bought this item to get a quality oven. It was fairly expensive compared to several other items but looked well made. After minimal use the knob broke. Parts are difficult to find except at Sears.

My wife and I registered for this toaster oven as part our wedding registry from Fortunoff's and unfortunately someone bought it for us and we were unable to return it. Let's start with the amount of time it takes to pre heat, if you live a leisure life and have plenty of time to wait for a toaster oven to heat up, this is the oven for you. Next the amazing ability to burn toast. For the past 6 months, I don't believe I have had evenly toasted bread, it seems like they designed this oven to burn toast unevenly. And what I love most about this oven is the extremely hot handle when you are done cooking with it. Be prepared to burn your hand just like your toast. I am very disappointed that Kitchen Aid would badge their name on such a product as I have thought they produced quality products. I would never purchase another Kitchen Aid product. Fool me once, only once!"},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't toast bread!","review":"I bought this item[...] and toasted bread as a trial.

Oh, it looks good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems like a quality oven until you start using it","review":"Like other reviewers, I am very disappointed in my purchase of this toaster oven. I find that when making toast, it either leaves the toast crispy but white, or toasts very unevenly, or burns it completely. When toasting two slices, one comes out much darker than another. The heating elements take a long time to come on, and when they do, the top one is much hotter than the bottom. I have to keep turning the toast manually to get an even toasting. Plus the ticking timer is annoying, and it runs on after the timer shuts off. I haven't tried baking anything yet -- I'm an excellent cook but I suspect the oven will pretty much ruin everything I try in it. This oven looks attractive on the shelf, and it seems to be very well made in comparison to others. But its performance is very poor. If you are considering it, shop around some more. I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd Read the Reviews Here Before I Bought This!","review":"This oven broke down about one week after the one-year warranty expired! The door wouldn't close properly and as a result, the oven wouldn't turn on. I explained this to the company, hoping they would be decent enough to honor part of the warranty, due to its collapse so close to the warranty date (NOPE!). And I know now that other people have had trouble with that door. Plus the door got really hot at times... Now I'm looking for a Breville because I've read that they're excellent. Live and learn. I paid close to $200 for this one -- def not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate Choice","review":"Unfortunate choice and me a kitchenAid loyalist! The thing that bothers me the most is the interminable wait for this oven to heat up! I may as well use the regular oven. I had an old cheapy Black&Decker (I think it was) that would heat up in a couple of minutes, this oven can take a good twenty minutes which defeats the purpose and convenience for me of having a toaster oven. In addition it does not heat evenly and so I have to rotate the food. I am beginning to shift my loyalties to Breville and although this oven is fairly new I think it is going in the Goodwill box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kitchen Aid Toasteroven Needs Help!","review":"Don't buy this toaster oven! Absolutely the worst oven ever! Takes FOREVER to heat up, burns everything unless you stand and watch it, takes up a lot of room and when it does toast, does it so unevenly. If you have more than 1 piece of bread toasting, all outside edges of the bread burns before the centers are toasted. I am so lucky that mine just caught on fire and burned so I can get a new different model that reviews better! Only thing good about it is that it looks like a quality piece. Like a museum piece...totally unuseable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"give me back my old Krups!","review":"It's as hot outside the oven as inside.

Who knew you couldn't trust the Kitchen Aid brand?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it!","review":"Bought one as a refurbished unit; thought I was getting a good deal. It takes 8 miniutes to produce toast that is dark brown at edges and un-toasted in middle. The maximun time you can bake for is 30 minutes. If you want a longer time you have to re-set the timer. The baking tray is small compared to the size of the oven. The handle stays relatively cool, but you can burn your finger if not careful on the oven front. It cost more than half of the price I paid to return it. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't be fooled","review":"This item is a shadow of a product supposedly an oven that can be relied upon.

In short, this Kitchenaid toasts unevenly and takes one cycle to even warm up well, seems to be cheaply made, the ticking timer keeps right on ticking way past the shutoff and doesn't coincide with the bell (which may or may not work), and is just a big disappointment overall. We went with it because of it's smaller size and features that we wanted, but I will sacrifice some counter space to get a well-made toaster oven the next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"stuck with it","review":"I received this as a Christmas gift and couldn't take it back. It is the worst. I have to babysit toast to keep it from burning and it takes forever. Both my son and I have been burned trying to get waffles off the back portion of the rack when the wire rack suddenly tilted forward and into our bare wrists. I tried to give it to my daughter for her college apartment but she wouldn't take it (that should tell you something right there!). I miss my old 4 slice toaster and can't wait for this thing to break so I can get something else. This just goes to show that spending more for something doesn't necessarily mean you are getting a better product. Also, looks can be deceiving as it looks very nice sitting on the counter but it isn't worth the space it takes up. Please don't waste you money on this item as you will regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mmm, lofi synth pop rock.","review":"What more could you ask for?

The songs -do- remind me a bit of TMBG's earlier work. That said:I don't know who mixed this album, but they appear to have been -trying- to wash out all the vocals with the music behind them. If this was their intent, they succeeded magnificently. Those of you who want to understand the lyrics will be out of luck.The music is unoriginal, at best. After a few tracks, and with no lyrics to queue from, I found it hard to tell one song from another except by the track-changing gaps on my CD player.I really wanted to like this album.

Montreal-via-British Columbia's The Unicorns are heroes in both Canadian and U.S. alternative press on the basis on their sophomore effort Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone? To say it's a hodgepodge isn't really to do justice to the disjointed forces at work here. Nick (Neil) Diamonds and Alden Ginger are not of the \\"everything but the kitchen sink\\" school of songwriting - they start with the kitchen sink and progress (or devolve, depending on your POV) from there. They're as abrasive as you'd expect. Lots of fun, too. One tune even has a nifty Irish pennywhistle motif. Still, as interesting as much of this is, the songs that truly work (meaning make a gut-level impact) are the simplest ones - the rocking \\"The Clap\\", the rocking \\"Les Os\\", and the very rocking \\"I Was Born (A Unicorn)\\".

The over indulgences with 4/4 sound manipulation, casio beats, overtly quirky vocals distract from their talent at deconstructing and undermining a catchy pop song with respectable guitarkid-chops to boot.

They then need to be positioned into the plastic body and somehow held with 10 hands that can contort into unexplainable positions to hold it all in alignment with the body and be glued at the same time. If it were not for the fact that my daughter REALLY wants this thing completed, I would have taken great joy in smashing it with a hammer.

However, this book is filled with complicated, esoteric language meant to alienate the average reader. I don't know who the author thought he was writing for, but it was definitely not for young people who would be intersted in this stuff.

Old House on the Hill is definately something different, just hear it for yourself.

Most of the information can be found in other sources. Franky I think the book needs more specific information and stories about and from women to justify the title. However, if you are a woman or have a female partner who is worried that guides are anal sex are really for gay men, this could be a good way to get to read up on the subject.

It would be rather too easy, and indeed unhelpful, to label it the musical heir of either. If anything \\"Everyone is Here\\" illustrates that there is no such thing as a Finn Brother style. The individuality of Neil and Tim is borne out by numerous musical references to their separate projects (mostly the post-Split Enz era). If there is a \\"Finn brother effect\\" it is that, at times, the total is more than the sum of the parts. The result is an album that will hold something for every long time Finn fan. Downside is of course there are also likely to be some tracks you won't care much for."},{"rating":"2","title":"It sounds So-o-o Good!","review":"I was never a Crowded House fanatic -I was more into Split Enz, if the truth be told. But credit needs to go where credit is due. This album is simply a delightful collection of harmony songs, put together by some of the creative heirs of the Byrds and the Beatles. The sound of this album is just lovely - it floats. Roll over Jayhawks and tell the Eagles the news. Miles better than the last Finn Bros production. In all honesty, the songs are probably not as classic as some of the earlier Finn Bros stuff, but this still makes the grade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finn Brothers Don't Dissapoint!","review":"I love all things Finn, and this CD does not dissapoint!

Perhaps it is not fair to compare to them to CH or even to Neil's solo ventures, so if we look at their very fine debut Finn Bros album, I think we can see that their latest shows that they have turned in their usual strong performances: great writing, fantastic singing, fine arrangements. I am also looking forward to the single for this album as I have heard that \\"Sunset Swim\\" is a very good piece and could have been included. If you like good melodic rock, you can't miss with this. It's a shame this music doesn't crack through radio -- it'd sound great pouring through those old transistor radios for picnics on the beach."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's always great to hear these guys","review":"I've been a Finns fan since their Split Enz days a quarter-century ago, and have enjoyed their music all through the various permutations and combinations. So I snapped up this new disc as soon as it appeared. My initial impression was, \\"great musicianship, same infectious passion as before, but with some mediocre tunes.\\" But then I gave it another couple of spins (as I urge any other doubters to do), and am currently high on the CD. There are some real strong winners, from the catchy opener, \\"Won't Give In,\\" to the sweet and tender closing track, \\"Gentle Hum,\\" and many points in between. Most of the songs are melodic, Beatle-esque rock, but there are a few surprises, especially the crunch and energy of \\"All God's Children.\\" In the end, though, the most enjoyable aspect of Everyone Is Here is the singing of Neil & Tim Finn, both in harmony and individually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Endearing","review":"Easily they're best album since the two played on Crowded House's \\"Woodface\\", the two former Split Enz leader come together with some of the best songs of the year. They bring back something missing today, the power of the songwriter. \\"Luckiest Man Alive\\" is a terrific ballad without being sappy. Every guy should want to be the guy they sing about. \\"Nothing Wrong With You\\" is better than therapy with catchy music for anyone feeling the world is against them. They rock out on a few songs like \\"Anything Can Happen\\", but this is a fairly restrained and beutifully constructed album. One of the best of 2004."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is a treasure","review":"This album is one of the best I have heard in a long time. The Finn Brothers are amazing songwriters and offer a reminder that good pop music does not have to be the fluff that is usually played on the radio. Most of the songs are inspired by the recent passing of their mother and a tribute to their roots, with incredibly moving lyrics. \\"Edible Flowers\\" is like a darker version of a Crowded House song, while \\"Won't Give In\\" sticks in your head after the first listen. I have not taken in out of my CD player since I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less was more","review":"A few years ago I saw the Finn Bros at the Whittaker Center in Harrisburg, Pa. It's acoustically perfect, beautiful and holds only 800 people. Because it was the last stop on their tour, all but 4 of them remained to play. The others had gone home.It was as if they were performing in your home. To see them play so many instruments, have so much fun, sound as if there were 10 musicians on stage and play way beyond the time limit (they even commented that they didn't want to stop) made it the best concert that I've ever seen. Every time I listen to this cd I transport my mind back to that night. If only you could have seen this performance.

I wish there would have been more time so they could have add more of the past in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing game for the franchise","review":"Being a keen cyberpunk enthusiast, gamer and RPG player I had high hopes that this game would be an interesting game. Sadly, aside from the 6 training missions, there is no real solo game; the multiplayer game doesn't allow you to choose your server, rather allocating you to one that matches your skills. This proves particularly problematic when you pick up a version late in the release cycle as most other players are miles ahead of you and it takes ages to get onto a live game, at which time you get smashed. There don't appear to be clear leaderboards and there's not a lot of additional features to keep you playing it for long.Great license - disappointing execution. No RPG aspects, and really a poor cousin of a game like Quake. What a flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shadow Run - First person shooter","review":"I used to play the Shadow Run role playing game and was excited to see it available as an online game system. I was hoping that this was an MMOG like WOW or Everquest. What I got was an online first person shooter game system that creates arena-like rapid fire duels. It attempts to create a system that combines magic with technology but it comes off as just labels for different kinds of healing vs. damage abilities. The graphics are decent and the action certainly works but it was not at all what I was expecting or hoped for. There is no story line whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic :-/","review":"Having played the original game on the SNES i was expecting alot from this game. I knew that it was first person but i did not know that all it was was an fps. And as far as fps games go this one is rather pathetic. You have only 3 races you can play as and there is no single player story option. The only options are online play or you can play against bots that are either really stupid or are overpowered and have perfect aim. There is a fun amount of mobility with your teleport ability and you gliding ability but it is not enough to save this game. Luckily harebrained schemes is making a new shadowrun game which is going to be amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"FPS with Magic not Shadowrun","review":"They should have just put out a FPS with magic. This is nothing like the Shadowrun game, I am very disappointed in this. The options are limited you don't really gain any weapons, spells or even cybernetic enhancements that you can keep, you have to keep purchasing them at the beginning of every match with very little time to decide what you want as it rushes you in to a capture the flag match. There is no real team feel to this game even you healing tree can heal the enemy or your team there is nothing that really stands out. I find it very lacking as even a FPS it fails to grab my attention and hold it. Lucky for me it wasn't very expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shadow run = Shadow nap","review":"This is one of those games that fell far short of its potential. To start with its combination of magic/weapons is poorly implemented. Each of which has beed done far better in previous games....can anyone say Star Wars with force powers. This game feels clumsy. Damage modeling is horrible, I'm sure they prefer the longevity of players is preferred by some, but as for myself, I can't stand to pump round after round into a player and do little damage. Some of the effects are cool, like waking thru walls, but shouldnt be enuff to levitate this game from the bargin bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"Wow, I was excited when first saw Shadowrun was going to be released. I played the original RPG and the Nintendo version. All I can say is what a disappointment. Other than the name and some content, this game is nothing more than a first person shooter. I am a bit upset that I had to sign up with Microsoft Windows Live in order to even play the game. I have a very robust AMD 64-bit multiprocessor dual core system with 4GB ram, 5 terabytes of hard drive space, and a 1024mb video card.

It was a disappointment the moment I opened the package and started to fit my phone into the case. It is too small (especially the upper part) for the phone. If you try and force the upper part into place, you would end up pressing one of the \\"smart keys\\" permanently and the number pad wont work. Also, once you fit this thing in, the phone wont close perfectly and looks too bulky. If you bought the phone 'cos it is RAZR thin, then this case is not for you.

Well, VH1 Corp, or MTV Networks, or Viacom or whoever the hell owns the show, I'm not biting. If you want my money, then give me a proper release.Good thing I read the reviews first, often I don't bother when it's something I already know I want.

Here's some examples whyIn the episode with 70's hardrock they not once mentioned some of the bigger bands of that era, such as Thin Lizzy, Uriah Heep, Ufo just to mention 3.And when they talked about heavy metal albums from 1980 not a word was said about Ace Of Spades, and apart from some smaller interwievs nut much has been said about Motorhead.And spending a whole program trying to find a connection between grunge and metal? Hadn't it been enough with just 5 minutes?And including Nickelback in another episode who is as much metal as Justin Bieber makes you wonder if these guys know wwhat metal is.So I would'n recommend anyone buying this DVD.

They have changed their sound completely: the riffs are alright, but nothing CLOSE to their previous works, and the vocals are horrendous. I guess the singer decided to take the most cliche path that most commercial bands take and try and sound like William DuVall [Alice In Chains]. Unfortunately, unlike DuVall, Sea Of Green sounds like an amateur band made up of 14 year-olds. And the lyrics... what the hell happened?!

You need a small round brush to make it easier, and even then, consider how much time you want to spend cleaning them. (The dishwasher will also scatter them all over, because they're too small to stay in one place.) If you try to get the cupcakes out while they're still hot, a cup might tear.

Besides I have been out of touch with Biochem since my college days. Aspects of RNA metabolism are plain fantastic!! What is more the layout and sequence of topics is just right.

If I speak loudly and hold the microphone very close to my mouth, the playback is still very muffled and you mostly hear puffs of breath.

Same on both).I've searched for work-arounds and fixes, but it appears that it's just poor quality control.

Except for the occasional background echoes i am pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Desktop Microphone","review":"I have a web camera connected to my computer and have been searching for a suitable microphone to use when chatting on the Internet with my friends and family. I quickly found that the microphone in the web cam had a lot of static and didn't work well. Then I have tried several headsets, but found that most of the ones I purchased (I purchased several) were also noisy. Every time I turned my head there was a bad crackle in the microphone.Then I found the Logitech USB desktop microphone. It's perfect for what I need. Sits discreetly on my desk when I am using the web cam so no one can even see it. It comes with a long cable so I can move the microphone as close to my mouth as I need to.It couldn't have been easier to hook up... just plugged it into an available USB port and my Windows XP computer recognized it immediately.I've also used this microphone to record several Camtasia \\"walk throughs\\" and the quality and clarity are great for what I need.Highly recommend!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for use with Google Voice","review":"I first tried a Plantronic headset before I found this, Logitech desktop microphone is by far superior. I use mine to make long telephone calls with Google Voice and it works very well.Super easy to use, just plug it in and unmute your microphone/audio input in your sound settings. It clearly picks up sound from even 3-4 feet away so you aren't anchored to being right in front of the microphone all the time in order to be heard.I liked this one so much I have even bought additional microphones for my friends who don't already have a setup on their computer to make VOIP calls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Microphone for Dragon","review":"It is very handy but quite sensitive.

Im petrified I might break it one day so I fold it safely away in my drawer after my use. I can talk at a distance from it and still be heard. The clarity is excellent! It has various voice formats like CD quality, AM radio mode, telephone (my favorite to use with Google Voice), Dictation (also my favorite). It makes my voice super crisp and clear when \\"on the phone\\" and videos. I do not sing but I think this could be great for singing. The cord is super long and the on and off button makes it easy to use. I do not like how it looks but still worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"/yells : Hello!

Just make sure to select/activate the mic from the Input tab in the Sound Settings application. I'm currently using Ubuntu 11.04, so YMMV.Con(s):* The device is not so great when it comes to noise-canceling. I could distinctly hear my air-condition and other noises in the background.* The mic is also super sensitive (even with the mic volume lowered), it picks up almost everything.* Related to above: Muting and unmuting, using the button at the base, can be distinctly heard and is kind of annoying.All in all, the device works perfectly, especially on Linux, which is why I decided to buy this USB microphone."},{"rating":"2","title":"This *DOES* work in Vista","review":"Very good microphone - probably the best one I've used and I have been through 4 or 5.I am about to purchase another one for another computer in another room.I can confirm this mic works perfectly, out of the box with no extra drivers/software required, with Windows Vista."},{"rating":"1","title":"No noise cancelling","review":"I just recently bought this microphone and I just wanted to point out that if you use a 64-bit version of Windows 7, there is NO noise cancellation.

By the way it cancels echoes as well, all echoes the other party hears from you has become history as well. No driver to download, easy setup, just plug it in and Windows detects the device automatically, and you are ready to explore one great Mic made by Logitech. Base unit on the Mic is sturdy, so it won't tilt or swing due to lack of weight. Long and thick cables, has ON/OFF switch on the base, lovely design...

The microphone seems to work perfectly with DNS, and I don't have to wear a headset. I also don't have to get my mouth very close to the microphone - being within 10 inches or so seems to be just fine. The accuracy in DNS is great, so the microphone must be doing a good job of producing a quality audio signal. This seems like a much better option than a headset, which would tether me to the desk, and I would be putting it on and off many times a day. The cable is quite long, so I am able to use it in multiple positions - for example, I work standing at a tall task, but I can also pick the microphone up and sit in my chair. In all, the product seems to work perfectly, and the price was very reasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product itself is great....but","review":"Good cancellation of white noise, good pick up on voice from a reasonable distance, nice and easy installation and so forth.

Just the drummer tapping his snare for the count off was clipped. So, you'll have to look elsewhere if you're wanting to record any kind of sound louder than just talking.I still give this mic a 4 star because obviously it's not meant for recording live music.

By comparison, the Mac's built-in mic had substantial distortion and was difficult to adjust the audio level.Installation on the Mac side couldn't have been much simpler, merely selecting the device (AK5370) in the System Preferences. On the PC side it was also easy. I first had to click on the icon to activate the mic in VMWare Fusion. This brought up a message \\"new hardware found\\" and without doing anything another message a few moments later \\"new hardware activated\\" (or maybe it was \\"drivers activated).

Can be adjusted up and down (note when adjusting it the mic actually stays in place!) All around awesome product. Not expensive!Cons: NoneAdditional thought: The wire could be a tad bit thicker.

It captures your voice really well, I had a fan running in the background and in some tests I did the notice was negligible. You can turn the mic on and off with the button on the stand, it lights up green when on. The only real qualm I have about this mic is that whenever you turn the mic on or off while in a chat, it makes a very audible noise.

As for the quality itself, it seems to be really good for the money. I talk on a voice program called Mumble (similar to Ventrilo/Teamspeak) and my friends say the quality is good.

This microphone produces really good sound quality and has fairly good noise isolation although it could of been improved upon. Although this product is really good there are still some flaws that i find very annoying, The first flaw has to do with the long plastic boom which is very delicate and wares out fairly quick if you change its position often, plus it's plastic unlike the base of the microphone that is aluminum. The second flaw has to do with its lack of portability, because of the awkward shape it is very hard to put it in a bag without breaking it.

It's admittedly cheap and easy to set up and use, but the recording quality is terrible. First, sound isolation is nonexistent; unless you're recording in a perfectly quiet room, you will not get a clear reading. It's just far too sensitive. I suppose that's great for people who want to do voice recording and live in the middle of nowhere, but for people like me who want to use it for Skype or Teamspeak and live in a normal town with cars, it is just pathetically bad. I can't recommend it unless you have a very specific purpose in mind, and at that point, you probably want to spring for something a bit more high-end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work at all for gaming","review":"I wanted a microphone for use with gaming while using speakers instead of a headset/mic combo because I don't like the feel of headsets.

My voice doesn't get picked up unless I have the microphone practically in my mouth, and my voice comes out choppy (with a few seconds of silent time stutter) and it's overly loud with a large amount of air/puffiness noise. I've been adjusting and readjusting this mic (moving it away from speakers, trying it with earphones so no feedback, varying push to talk vs. manual on/off, etc) as well as adjusting my voice software for over a year now and just had to go back to headsets because this mic is so crappy and I can't speak for longer than 5 seconds at a time without transmit problems.

I do website reviews and user testing and needed a properly good quality mic for the videos I record, and this microphone performs very nicely for my needs. It's quite sensitive, the audio quality of the recordings is really good, and its got a very elegant aesthetic to it as well; also the build quality is excellent as the base is made out of metal (probably aluminum) and the mic itself is made out of a very durable plastic.

The lighted on - off switch is placed on the base and is easy to see and use. I prefer the voice activated settings instead of using a hot key or the switch on the microphone to talk. Because it sits on the desktop it can pickup vibrations from the equipment when its in the always on mode. I put a simple soft pad under it and the noise stopped. I would recommend this product to anyone needing a PC microphone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rich story worthy of wide readership.","review":"In a field of much-hyped and overhyped \\"legal thrillers\\", some of which are merely poor imitations of Grisham and Taylor Rosenberg plots, this book stands out for its uncannily interwoven depiction of the many characters involved in a criminal investigation, from the journalists who cover it, to the politicos whose weigh in their agenda interests, to the prosecutors and police officers, to the victim who turns out to be not quite what he seemed to be in life. The characters have rich emotional histories which come into play, and there is even a very touching romance subplot. A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fort Warren's last prisoner","review":"This is a reprint of the original diary kept by Stephens while at the fort.

What did I miss, if anything, in my reading.I missed nothing. What little merit the book brings (the discussion of two opposing forces - white and black - in the universe) is so buried in pointless, overdrawn, repetitive, monotonous, utterly boring writing that I am amazed that this remains in print much less on any serious horror or SF reader's \\"must read\\" list.I cannot recommend reading The Purple Cloud for anyone unless they have a VERY good reason to slog through the pages. A reason like a PhD thesis or maybe a bet. It would have to be a serious bet before I would waste my reading time with it again.I think H.P.

Great care has been taken to offer the reader -most likely a modeller- not the 100th version of a Spitfire or a Messerschmitt, but some real unknown -for 1973- birds are shown, or at least rare versions of known planes.Every plane goes together with a photograph, side-, upper- and underviews and the sideviews are repeated in the colour section of the book, giving a modeller ample opportunity to change his/her kit into somehing special, providing of course he/she could/can find a kit as shown! Amongst the more rare ones are a Martin Baker MB.5, a Pyörremyrsky, a P-43, a Re 2005, a Bulgarian PZL-24, a Morko-Morane, a Ikarus IK-3, a P-55, a Curtiss CW-21 and an Avia B-135.

This lego is not to be played with by young kids, thats not what its meant for, most of the entire lego Star Wars series was built to be displayed, thats what Lego stated when they first came out. Obviously an 8 year old is gonna roll it around and crash it or put pressure on it, of course it's gonna break.

It dampens a lot of the bumps, which is a must on those rides over 30 miles. I've hit some serious potholes and road construction cracks, which I thought for sure not only cracked my frame but the stem, the stem proved very durable. I'm a woman so I can't speak for the durability this stem would have for a heavier male rider, but it seems like its extremely well built. The dial in set back is very customizable. You can dial it back and set it at different angles. The custom bracket doesn't stick out and is a very slim line design. I've been using this for almost a year now, an average of 20 miles a day and have had no problems with it. I would buy it again in a heartbeat just for the set back, they seem like they are becoming harder and harder to find a decent one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot, Cold or Pluff?","review":"I'm not really one to write reviews but this product was such a let down I had to say something. First off this toy is not worth the money from a construction stand point. On Christmas morning when my daughter turned the knob on the washer it fell off in her hand (this was from Santa mind you so that was awesome). Next after opening the washer door a few times it completely fell off, six screws at once. The door was assembled by the manufacturer, not me. Upon examining the door I saw the reason. Turns out the screws were more for show as the door was held on by two dabs of hot glue.The absolute best were the settings printed on the dryer which included a setting for \\"Pluff.\\" At least that made me laugh.And as mentioned in another review there's no \\"ding\\" or timer as stated in the product description.The good thing about this pink nightmare is that it breaks itself down for you which is a great time saving feature for shipping it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review for Dexton play washer and dryer","review":"This washer and dryer is not worth the money at all.

As wrestlers, but as actors, they leave a lot to be desired. Danny Hodeges dialogue is strained and he sounds as if he is reading from cue cards. The scenes that are supposed to be the Olympic trials which pass for a climax are totally unrealistic. They were obviously filmed in a tiny high school gym with only a few extras to represent the crowd. The story could be a good one but the film is a near disaster. If you want to see a wrestling movie check out Vision Quest, the slightly comedic Takedown or even Disney's Spooner. As a member of a wrestling family and a wrestling coach, I bought this video with high expectations but was greatly dissapointed.

My sister has the exact same model, and her hard drive also died after less than 1 1/2 years.Also, Sony's support is useless. It is very difficult to get a person on the phone without paying a tech support service fee. When I finally got them on the phone, they suggested I buy a better hard drive next time.

This includes two trips to the service center in San Diego. I love the size, its features and it's eye catching looks. However it's lack of an internal fan leads to overheating which I am sure is contributing to the poor performance--including the need to replace the hard drive after less than 6 months of light home use by my wife. I noticed that Sony produced an early micro similar for the Japenese market which was pulled due to over heating problems and have wondered if the TR3A is a relative.

It was always nonsens that Ozu made always the same film, but Bakushu has something special. At first its storytelling composed of anedotes and episodes. More than other films by Ozu, Bakushu seems to consists on a big number of HAIKUS (japanese short poems), one agter another. In all respect - there are very few like Ozu in the history of cinema. The decentralism of his storytelling can be found mostly in asian and especially japanese cinema. And the paradoxon of Bakushu is that its narrative style seems to be rather non-conventional for 1951 but on the other side, this film is Ozus most charming and most accessible film.

Most helpful is Pat's understanding of worship as a public act and not private family time. Public events and spaces are designed to welcome and incorporate strangers. When worship is thought of as a public act as opposed to a private family event it also will be designed to welcome the stranger.

A book every pastor and worship leader should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practicing Christian Hospitality","review":"\\"Welcoming the Stranger,\\" by Patrick Keifert is a wonderful book. Keifert attempts to show that liturgical worship and effective evangelism can be put together. In fact, Keifert maintains that these two areas of ministry actually complement and enhance one another.The manner in which liturgical worship and effective evangelism are blended, according to Keifert, is through a unique understanding of offering hospitality to the stranger. Worship is not a private matter and the church needs to reserve a place for the stranger, especially in worship. The reason is twofold: first, \\"God is the host of public worship, whose presence is often revealed in and through the stranger. Second, God who is present in worship is essentially a gracious God who gives to the stranger\\" (1992:58).

The scent is not cloyingly sweet, but has the type of overtone that catches in your throat, threatening to make you cough. I feel asthmatic when inhaling Calycanthus. As you might guess from this review, I definitely wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. The quality is that of any of the colognes that you might find in the drug store. It certainly isn't worth the $59 price.

Many of the games are not playable as key elements do not appear on screen. Most notably for me, some missiles in Missile Command destroy your cities site unseen and in both versions of Asteroids, your ship does not appear (try dodging an asteroid if you don't know where you are or where you are pointed). I'm not sure what QA was done before shipping, but the version of Flashback 2 with Pitfall appears to be a hit or miss, frustrating affair. Might this be an issue with television technology? For example, does a flat panel TV only exhibit these issues? For me that is still a QA issue that should have been resolved before shipping a product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun and nostalgia for the price!","review":"Bought this for our family for Christmas. Our 7 year old daughter loves the games! The games look and feel and sound just like they did in the 80's. Pretty easy to navigate around. We wish it had more of our old favorite games, many of the games included were unreleased prototypes that just aren't that much fun. Pitfall and RiverRaid are great. For the cost, it was worth it and we will get many hours of enjoyment out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a gift for Christmas.","review":"When I gave the gift the person was extremely happy. said it was the best gift they got. Everyone I knew wanted it as well. The deal was extremely great. After I purchased it I wanted to purchase more however I was not lucky to get the deal again. Great game though. Brings back memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I purchased this game because I have been looking to play Pitfall.

So, needless to say, i returned the game system."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Pac Man??","review":"Ok first of all I will say that to me I don't think this is very much worth owning... too many classics are missing to make it worth your while. Maybe it was a liscensing problem who kmows... But quintessential Atari games are not present. There is no Pac Man, Mrs. Pac Man, Chopper Command, Berzerk, Donkey Kong, Enduro, Grand Prix, Breakout, Phoenix, Pole Position, oh the list can go on. I will stick to my original 6 switcher and hope it never dies on me. The games on this unit are mildy amusing but like I said, you will keep scrolling down the list searching for the classics and they just aren't here in my opinion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT buy","review":"This is the perfect game for my little five year old cousin. He loves playing the atari and this is a great edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great throw back!","review":"I bought this for my husband who is a huge gamer and wanted an original system. he played it as soon as he could Christmas morning.

Nice to see the \\"old school\\" games again, but most of them were hard to figure out. Pong didn't work for us, which ,in my opinion, there is no excuse for.Had I bought it at a brick and mortar store, I would've returned it.

He was really excited about it, so as soon as it was out of the box we plugged it in to play. The graphics wouldn't work at all on the TV screen, they were constantly lopsided and flickering. Sometimes when we tried to get the console to work, the graphics would be only halfway visible, leaving half of the screen blank. The buttons on the console itself would stick and weren't functional at all. Only one of the controllers worked, which wasn't useful in itself considering the state of the graphics. I wasn't expecting anything flashy, just fun and the Atari Flashback 2 ended up being a pretty big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun trip down memory lane","review":"Fun piece of home entertainment history. Some of the games I know, others I didn't. Still, a good education to show the younger people in my house what things used to be like. Even though I was there, it's pretty amazing myself. We were entertained for hours by this things!! These days, I'm not nearly as into it but it's certainly a great conversation piece if nothing else. I have seen these at varying prices, so look around before purchasing. Also look at the entire list of games to make sure the one you want is there. Lots of stuff which I wanted isn't on this system unfortunately. Maybe for the best though as the memories I have couldn't possibly keep up with anything I've experienced playing these games now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not find favs","review":"Advertised my favorite game and although I went through all the games I can't find it, i believe the name is Snake Pit.

More difficult to operate than the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flashback a hit","review":"The Atari Flaskback was a great reminder of the fun games I used to play with my family as a child. We spent hours laughing and playing over Christmas. Many of the games were prototypes that were never released. The only downfall to the system is that very few instructions for the games were included and some of the unreleased games were difficult to figure out. Overall a great buy for a reminder of video games in the good ole days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Activision where?","review":"Another reviewer said \\"River Raid\\" and \\"Pitfall\\" are in this system, but I can't find them on the game, or listed in the manual. I'm quite disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Present for Gamers","review":"I bought this for a guy I work with and he loves it. He has been into gaming for a long time so I figured this might be a lot of fun for him. Sure enough he has been playing it a lot and has been telling me how many memories it brings back. I am not as much of a gamer but because of how much fun he has had with it I think I am going to order one for myself. When having friends over it would be a lot of fun to bring back memories of playing centipede, asteroids, missle command, etc.If you are looking for a decent priced present for someone who loves gaming this system should score big. Obviously it is not for someone who is only into the newest games but anyone who has a history of gaming will really enjoy this as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Disappointed!!!","review":"I had this bookmarked to buy and my brother suprised me with it as a gift for Christmas. We were both excited to plug it in and see all the games we played as kids but only about FIVE GAMES would load and play correctly! :( Huge disappointment except that the one game I really wanted to play was \\"Pit Fall\\" and that one loads up fine. Not sure if it's suppose to work better on one type of television verses another but my new flat screen wouldn't play it at all so I used the older television in my bedroom and that's when we got \\"Asteroid\\" \\"Millipede\\" \\"Pit Fall\\" and about 3 others to load...but since it boasts having so many games to play it really sucks that is all that I can get to work because I was looking forward to playing most of them. Seems most of the units got decent reviews, just not sure why my unit isn't working properly!!??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Atari Flashback 2","review":"I liked the orginal 2600 better but of course that is a mute point. I did not like the fact the power button is not lit and I did not like the the fact that you have to power off to get to the main menu after you have finsihed with a game. Other than that the product if pretty much what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't hesitate; read this book","review":"Lynne Cox's book detailing her long distance swims is fascinating. It is easy to get wrapped up in her adventures, and hard to put the book down. The writing is effective and engaging, and the stories themselves awe-inspiring. Somewhere around the middle of the book, I began to feel that her obsessiveness was somewhat over the top, and wondered what the point was in her taking on the increasingly difficult and death-defying swims. But near the end, when she is finally able to achieve her lifelong goal of swimming across the Bering Strait, it all comes together. I got the chills reading that chapter, not just because of the 32 degree water. Only downside to the book is the lack of details about her family and background, which would frame her story and put it into context. And, echoing another reviewer...where are the pictures?! Maybe in the next edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've never been so cold!","review":"Lynne is not only an incredibly disciplined and inspired athlete but an equally adept story teller. As a swimmer, who has never introduced myself to the outer limits Lynne does, I am thoroughly caught up in the thrill of her adventures. She gently reminds each of us that we need to take our talents and exploit them no matter how daunting that may appear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and inspiring!","review":"I have read this book several times now. Each times I feel more inspired than the last. It just goes to show you that if you put your heart into something you can achieve anything. This is a story of an amazing woman who really pushed the limits of what our bodies are capable of doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging story of setting and achieving personal goals","review":"This story is not only impressive in the athletic achievement; it is noteworthy that she refuses to abandon her goals even when faced with the impenetrable wall of the Kremlin's closed border mindset.Well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is she crazy? Yes, but in a good way!","review":"Lynne Cox is an amazing athlete and an amazing person but best of all, she tells her own story with a great deal of passion and humor.She recounts each of her swims in a way that I found very gripping, with details that made each experience really come alive.There were times reading this book when I thought \\"What is she thinking? Why would anyone do this?\\" She offers her own thoughtful and sometimes funny answers to these questions. I cannot imagine myself doing any of these things, but good for her for doing it. I would highly recommend this book if you want to spend a little time in the head of a totally unique individual who may be a little crazy, but in a good and inspiring way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable adventures from a remarkable woman.","review":"I have read many books about extreme accomplishments and loved the excitement of the adventure, but cringed at the narcissism of the adventurer. Lynne Cox's book is full of first-rate thrills, but her character is just as remarkable. (In her first major swim from Catalina Island to the California shore, she waits for her fellow teenaged swimmers to catch up because they had agreed to finish together. How many elite athletes do you know who would sacrifice the opportunity to set a record because of a promise to friends?) Swimming to Antarctica is a fantastic read, as well as inspiring. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stripped to its bare essentials","review":"Readers who enjoy comprehensive biographies and autobiographies won't find Swimming to Antarctica to their liking. Lynne Cox largely avoids emotions, trivia, sentimentality and similar extraneous materials to deliver a very tightly focused account of her remarkable accomplishments in cold-water ocean swimming. She easily could have gone into accounts of her personal life and fundraising activities, just to name a couple of topics, but elects instead to concentrate on her swims - and that focus, in my view, elevates this book ahead of most contemporary autobiographies. As for the accounts of the swims, suffice to say that I found them gripping even though it's the sort of activity in which I otherwise have little interest. Surely that alone is a strong sign of a well-written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swimming to Antarctica-Tales of a Long-Distance Swimmer","review":"Excellent book. This book was purchased for a book club read. Fascinating accomplished swimmer who details her journey and training to swim in such extreme conditions.

I like it on my desk so I can look to see which computer it is on. (It has a light.) However with the cables coming out of all sides it takes up a bit of space.

(It's genetic, by the way. .my dad had the same problem when he was my age). I started changing my diet to avoiding processed/fast food, and more whole grains. That helped, but I still had acne. Out of desperation, I found this website [...] and started using their 10% alpha hydroxy acid. Worked for about six months, then when summer hit, started breaking out even more.

I've been using this for about a month and I have nothing negative to say. It isn't sticky, doesn't have a horrible odor, goes on easy and hasn't made my skin dry. I was complemented by several people (strangers & friends) how good my skin looks. When my friend told me this yesterday I looked in the mirror and said wow my skin does look good.

Ralph gives instructions for holiday crafts and gives advice a la Ann Landers. Also included is a progress report written by Ms. Hoover saying that improvement is needed in most areas as he has trouble adding and subtracting numbers above 16, that he \\"forgets how books work\\" and mentioned that he once tried to subtract on his hands by attempting to cut off his fingers. Poetry written by Ralph and his many moods are very funny.There is a story about Wiggle Puppy that Ralph created, which is okay, but overall, it's a great book.

Endless play and entertainment similar to Atari style games that are unbeatable. Just as it says \\"Real Men Don't Need Instructions\\". When you get two of the same weapon in a row you get twice the power, construction hats are invincibility, and the More Power power up is like an extra life, or hit.

It doesn't massage. It vibrates. Y'all have sat in massage chairs before at Sharper Image or Brookstone. They can be really good, with kneading balls that roll around giving a surprisingly deep back massage.This thing doesn't even resemble those chairs. Trust me. I am sitting in one now. It is my main office chair. I have not turned on the \\"massage\\" function, or even plugged it in, since about three days after I bought it.The \\"massage\\" feature is more like an annoy feature. It just shakes you around a bit, but doesn't actually feal good in any way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, works well, not for tall folks","review":"Fast shipping from Amazon via UPS. Nice good quality, took less than 20 minutes to put it together. The seat is firm but comfortable to sit in. Easy to adjust the height and tilt of the chair. I am six feet one, so the only complain so far is the massage function won't reach my upper back (hense the 4 stars). All three mode of massages are pretty standard. There must be a timer after you start massaging, not sure about how long, maybe 10 to 15 minutes before it stops. Massage will stop if you stand up with lights flashing. A useful function to conserve battery power. With the current discount, it's a very good value. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four Motor Motion Sickness Vibrator","review":"Amazon should provide rating less than 1, like a 0 or -1.

Its too good to be true that they're selling a massage chair for around $80 unless its a crap. I would go for one of those portable shiatsu massage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I bought this chair for my work, as I thought it would be something that might help out with back and neck pain due to sitting all day. Charged the chair per the instructions, and things seemed to work fine through the 1st charge cycle. Then the battery died (would not accept a charge, or work while plugged in - vibrating function would not work, regardless of what was done). So now it's just a regular chair; which would not be all bad if it was a super comfortable, high-end chair - but it's not. It is reasonably comfortable, but I don't even use it as the primary chair in my office any more.On the plus side, setup was easy and it has been a sturdy reliable chair. But for anyone who looking for a true massage chair - keep looking. Buyer beware on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"massage office chair","review":"Great chair for the money!

Unfortunately, the author repeats himself too much so that the reader gets the impression that he could have made his point in a quarter the number of pages.

My husband had to screw the leg into the frame. When we set them up and put a piece of luggage (lightweight) on each, both began to wobble. He actually added some screws for extra support to each, before we could even use them. I wish the weight limit had been posted in the description of the product before I purchased them.

The other good thing is that compared to my old mitts I can hardly feel the heat at all. That being said, they are so stiff that it makes it difficult to handle the hot items.

Upon close examination, I realized that I had been had: the housing part was made of three thin plastic pieces held together by spit. The thing for which I paid $120.00 + shipping was never meant to last, and no warranty service would remedy this.

This is one great product but is very pricey. Go for the more inexpensive floating head shaver. (The shape of all of their float heads are the same. It's the same product. Just different packaging. Get the cheaper one.)I really had a difficut time trying to adjust back to a blade while I was waiting for this to arrive and it really made me realize how good this product is.By the way, I opened up the older one and found that there was some water that got in and probably was shorting the charging system.

This book is a rather dry read, filled with professorial slang. It's also very, almost offensivley feminist. According to the author, women get heavier sentences than men (incredibly false. Most women recieve far lighter sentences than men for the same crimes). And women only kill because centuries of opression and women hating and abuse brought them to it, which many know is false. As a woman, I found myself far more offended than intrigued. There is a fine line between feminism and degredation. The tone implies that all women are victims of society, incapable of being sociopathic. Isn't that a very sexist tone, that women are incapable of violence and are suited to drinking tea and shopping? Overall, too dry and stuffy for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Worked Upon first install. Replaced memory that went bad 1 stick at a time.

George Foreman has a super punch too but it is rarely effective.Positives: You have a super punch.Negatives: Where to start? Your super punch doesnt take as much energy as it should. This game wants to be Super Punch Out so bad but it cant even rise to the level of Buster Douglas Boxing on Sega Genesis. Your opponents have super punches that drain you heavily and since you move sluggishly, they can nail at any time with it. Also their normal punches drain you heavily also. Plus you have to mash three buttons repeatedly to get up and sometime George doesnt want to get up.In conclusion this game is not a challenge its just frustrating and badly made.

The descriptions of the book are generally good. Many of the characterisations are somewhat shallow, and some Stargazer crew appear just so we do not forget they exist. The few characters important to this story alone get the depth, and they are very well done. Andreas Nikolas is excellent. The depiction of the Barrier-affected Nuyyad is remarkable. He is one of the most inventively sadistic villains in Star Trek. The pacing is also well judged. About halfway through, I thought the book was turning to slow scenes of the life of the Stargazer crew. There were just a couple of those scenes, and then the author brings in some of the mind-bending scenes between Nikolas and the Nuyyad. To sum up, this is a good read. It is enjoyable in its own right, and you probably do not have to have read most, perhaps any, of the previous Stargazer books to understand the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picard's Pre-Enterprise Life","review":"The Stargazer stories lend important background to flesh out Jean-Luc Picard's life.

Unfortunately, the author brings much of his own life into the story and attempts to draw parallels betweeen his own family and the Andreassons. This normally wouldn't be too bad, but some of his \\"coincidences\\" seem like grasping for straws a la the Kennedy/Lincoln \\"coincidences.\\" In spite of this, the book's a decent read.

The only thing that is Mr. Francis about this movie is the title. The setting, plot, and characters are unrecognizable-I don't think any of them appeared in the book. There was little reference to horse-racing and one race shown-flat, not steeplechase. The sound quality was bad, the actors mumbled, and there was no character development. Francis' books are always delightful and educational in some fashion. Through his books, I've learned about many things as his characters find employment in different fields. I hoped to see Austrailia and hear about the world of art as it pertains to horses. I saw pieces of Canada (I think)and of Germany and was confused by the references to art.

I tried shorter cables, but the signal was still not strong enough for my receiver (it's a Samsung).

The other input was used for an OPPO 970HD Dvd Player & I already had the cable to use for that one.It's pretty straight forward how to use the splitter. The time spent hooking this up was maybe 10 minutes max & would've probably been even less had I had quick access to the back of my receiver. Originally I had no idea something like this existed & I stumbled upon this product by accident.

The technology apparently is not available that will split the sound on an optical cable. Optical cables appear to only work if they are a dedicated line direct from the source to the receiver. Any interruption, such as a splitter or a switch, somehow stops the flow of the sound and it does not get to the receiver. I have tried several vendors and both failed. These were products made in China. The Amazon customer ratings and reviews are very misleading. Beware to the customer.

I decided to take it apart, since I know cheaply made products are usually very easy to make work.Well I found the problem, and it can't be fixed, I tried. The problem with the design is that on the one end, the two fiber optic cables meet into one, but it is only two pieces of plastic slightly melted together to form one fiber optic, but it still remains as two and what happens is that the light does not meet up directly in the same place on the one plug end. So if your cables or receiver are extremely sensitive this product can not be salvaged. I tried re-aligning the two ends better so it made a more accurate alignment, but there is hardly any internal cable to work with.

Archaeologists have abandoned the idea that the Indian civilization is a result of some invasion or immigration. The chronology of the Vedic texts is thus an open question.

I am not one to bother with returning items but this was such a disappointment I was planning on going through the trouble for once. However, the return fee was almost as much as the mattress. So It is currently being used as a box springs for my daughters thinner crib mattress with a memory foam mattress topper. If you want memory foam this is not the mattress for you. I almost considered making it a dog bed but it was not comfy enough for even my dogs to sleep on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and plastic-y","review":"I got it the other day and shipping it back now (it costs an arm and a leg to ship it back, btw). It's basically cheaply made mattress, covered with thick white plastic, very stiff and rigid, not soft in any way, and there is no memory foam feel to it whatsoever. I can't even tell if there is memory foam inside, it feels like a bunch of springs covered with something. Don't waste your money, it's not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the love of a mother.....","review":"Judith Cain Dotson's first book is a smooth read. It is a journey from the tragedy of her mother's untimely death to a family's realization that while they cannot \\"bring back\\" their mother, their efforts to prevent this kind of tragedy from happening to others is one way to keep her memory alive. Ms. Dotson's courage to write about her mother's death and the events that followed makes for a \\"David and Goliath\\" tale that's a must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The book was soooo much better","review":"I had read the book and it was very good so I thought I would see the movie. The book was so much better (it usually is) then the movie. I did expect the book to be better and the movie to have some changes but they seemed to change the story way too much. Even the setting of the movie was all in daylight and in that part of Alaska, that time of year you get about 4 hours of daylight. I was disappointed with the movie. Some of the events and characters that were in the book, and made the story more suspenseful were removed. I am shocked that Nora Roberts allowed that much alteration to the story.

Particularly surprising was LeAnn Rimes acting, which was first rate. It makes me wonder if she is changing careers or just adding a second one. I enjoy her music, I think she is an much better actress than singer.I think that this was her first movie, but I am not certain about that. If it is her first movie she hit a real home run with her initial performance.While not a great movie it is a very entertaining movie and well worth the purchase price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible adaptation!!","review":"I love the book Northern Lights, and all the great interaction between the characters. There was a lot of depth to the characters, and it gave you a good idea of a small Alaskan town, and how everyone lives together as neighbors.This movie is truly terrible- the performance of Nate is wooden and he lacks any type of leadership for someone who is supposed to be Chief of Police--and he is the star of the movie after all. The movie was superficial and lacked any truly intimate feeling for the town and the characters who lived there.Save your money and buy the book- It's great!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad movie","review":"I am commenting on the movie itself- not a seller. The actually movie is awful! Actors are unbelievable, plot is predictable and some of the camera shots look like it was done by an intern.

I found I had a hard time staying interested in this one and finally put it down halfway through. I felt that it didn't truly adhere to the topic of mercy killing and failed terribly to construct any emotional connection from character to reader. I felt a lot of her ideas were flimsy, like trying to connect the whole Scottish clan thing to being a police chief.

Needless to say, I was not a fan of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and perfect!","review":"There are too many good things about this book that I can write about (trust me!). My review can be put simple in one sentance: How can anything by Jodi Picoult be anything less than perfection?I'm a great fan of her literature, as I've read them all, and I was just as impressed by the way this book made me feel and what it made me think about.

To be very clear it was NOT the topic that bothered me, I am not anti euthenasia, but I am very anti \\"Mercy\\" This is the only title that I would say totally and completely disappointed me.

It was one of the worst books I've ever read! Instead of 400 pages, Ms. Picoult should have kept it to 200 since 1/2 the book is repetitive. In the trial, the witnesses repeat, almost word for word, the same dialogue they used earlier in the book. THEN...the same was true for all the sexual encounters, of which there were many. I got to the point where I skimmed over them since they all started to sound alike.

I really think the author is right on with the reactions and feelings that every person would feel if going through those same issues. So much so that if you are someone who has experienced cancer or betrayal of a loved one it may become hard to get through. But hopefully it will help you in the same way. Her books are always on the edge of controversy and this one is no different. The only annoying thing of the book are the letters at the beginning of the chapters (?) They are an unanswered detail at the end. But overall I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her finest...","review":"Frankly, I'm surprised that I made it all the way through this book--all of the characters are so unlikeable! I'm not really sure why any reader should care about what happens to any of them. As one other reviewer commented, the only character that was kind of likeable was the cat--unfortunately, even the cat annoyed me as he was schlepped around everywhere in a backpack. He's a cat. He can be left alone for a day.Predictable plot outcome, and the melodrama was high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picoult","review":"I have many (most ) of Jodi Picoult books. I loved the first 2-3 I read. 19 Minutes, My Sister's Keeper and a few others. Mercy was not one of my favorites, nor was Keeping Faith. maybe I am getting tired of her books, but they use to grab me on page one. Both of these books seemed to drag. They also were more predictable than others in her series. It seems like she is researching topics of interest to her and spinning them into books. The discussion of stamata was interesting, but it seemed to occupy too much of the story. Mercy also seemed to drag in spots. I am accustomed to reading her books quickly, hardly waiting to turn the page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied","review":"I was disappointed to find that the copy of Mercy I received was in poor condition. There were holes, rips, tears, and stains throughout the book. Because I didn't have time to send the book back, it was relegated to the back of a book box that I keep for throw-aways. On the brighter side, out of many, many purchases with amazon.com, this is the only time I've had to complain. Most used books I purchase come in pristine condition.

The characters all develop incredibly, and a story line that could have gone either way ended up being compelling. the description of this book did not intrigue me, but since Picoult wrote it, I had to read it. And as always, I was not sorry I did. I did not like characters as much as I have in her other books -- but I loved it none the less, and could not put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book was a total disappointment. There were two story lines that could have easily been separate books but together they did not work. The first being a story about Mercy Killing which is a topic that we too may one day struggle with. The other story line was about a weak man who attempts to save his marriage, when his affair is over and he just wants consistency back in his life.My first introduction to Jodi Picoult was when I read her book \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" I recommended that book to all of my friends and family. She is a gifted writer but Mercy is not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This books haunts me still...","review":"I am a big fan of Picoult's and count her among my top 3 favorite writers. This is quite possibly one of her best, in my opinion (other faves of mine include \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" & \\"The Pact\\"). I've never become so emotionally involved by a book and it's characters. I found myself actually hating Cam for his betrayal of Allie (as I related so much to her character). I couldn't put this one down and it's intense emotional themes continue to haunt me long after I finished reading it. I was deeply moved by Picoult's character development in this book and her beautiful, romantic writing. No one else can deliver on human drama as well as Picoult. I highly recommend this one, but be forewarned - have some tissues handy for your tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating","review":"This is the fifth Jodi Picoult's novel I've read and probably will be the last one. I almost put it down because it simply got to my nerves. That Cameron Mc Donald was such a selfish, arrogant and weak man and Allie, his wife, such a pushover, that I just could not stand neither one of them. What irritated me most was the fact that after finding out that he was betraying her, Allie punishes Cam, but then forgives him (a deduction based on the notes Cam writes to Mia, which are on the left page at the beginning of each chapter). A good sequel would be one with Allie, leaving this guy for good, leaving town, overcoming her low self esteem and finding true love with a real man, not with the kind of male characters that Jodi Picoult usually creates, which seem to be very handsome and attractive but extremely stupid and airhead(for reference, see Salem Falls' Jack St. Bride and Second Glance's Ross Wakeman)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Picoult's books, but not this one","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed \\"19 Minutes\\" and \\"My Sister's Keeper\\"; I could not put them down and found myself enthralled with the characters and Picoult's writing style. This book however, was a little odd. The premise of the story was good, dealing with a loving couple and euthanasia, but the other main couple, Cam and his wife Allie, were beyond unrealistic. He cheats on her, she takes him back quite easily and in very minimal time, and he seems a little cocky and annoyed that she would even think of leaving him----pretty unrealistic I would say. It seemed like the whole last part of the book where they got back together was too abrupt and would have been better if it had been more developed but I am not sure because Cam just seemed too full of himself and Allie so pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have put it down","review":"I knew early on that I didn't connect with the characters. I simply didn't care what happened to ANY of them! I just read on and on because I thought Jodi might off one of them at the end and that might make it interesting. I don't want to give any spoilers, but really the end was just as boring as the rest of the book. Not her best, and I have enjoyed some of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"gross.","review":"hated it. Disliked almost all the characters, especially Cam and Mia who I had absolutely no sympathy for and didn't want them to have a happy ending. They didn't really, but there was no real punishment for their actions. Very selfish people, hated how it ended. Love other Picoult novels, this one I skimmed over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to my expectations","review":"This book was highly recommended to me, and I was particularly interested in the idea of a town than had kept the old overtones of the Scottish clan structure. I was disappointed. Although Picoult makes the characters very real, most are not likeable. There are two main story lines, one of a man who kills his suffering wife (at her request) before her cancer kills her, and one of a man who has an affair with a fresh young thing who also happens to be his wife's employee. At least the first storyline had some interesting twists and ethical dilemmas. The second was the \\"same old-same old\\" we've read before, or even lived through. I couldn't wait to give this book away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have mercy on yourself and skip this book","review":"Generally, I enjoy reading Picoult's books. Though the topics are often difficult, she writes in such a way that you wonder how you would react in the same situation. However, \\"Mercy\\" was an extreme disappointment. By midway, I could not have cared less about what happened to any of the characters. Cam and Mia are arrogant and selfish, Allie is too clueless to be believable and Jamie, the long suffering, tortured soul, is just too much.I have a hard time believing it was written by the same person who wrote \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" and \\"19 Minutes\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down after My Sister's Keeper","review":"So, I was really excited to read Mercy because I loved the way she wrote My Sister's Keeper. I thought euthanasia would be terribly interesting, and it was at first. I loved Jamie throughout he novel and the fact he loved enough to kill. Then, I just got frustrated by Cam's unfaithfulness and Allie's reaction to his deception. Frankly, I got more than a little bored (about the whole Scottish heritage thing) and irritated at the same time. The book was not what I expected it to be.I was really disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would You Help Your Loved One Die if They're Terminal?","review":"This book was really good and hard to put down. I enjoyed the story all the way through.The basic plot of the story was Jamie's deep love for his wife Maggie, who became terminally ill and suffered. She wanted Jamie to help her die, and so he did, but not without hardship and a big jury trial in the end.Cameron McDonald, a police chief, doesn't agree at all with his wife Allie, and this creates hardship and a betrayal in their marriage. Allie feels that Jamie was in the right, where Cam feels he deserves punishment for his actions even though in his very ill wife's best interests.The story reaches a great climax with many surprises at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of talent!","review":"I've really enjoyed Jodi's books, having now read seven... until this one. Don't waste you time! I wonder about other reviewers who gave it good ratings. Did we even read the same book? After struggling to turn the pages, I gave up after 100, and quickly thumbed through the remainder... an unnecessary task. The theme of mercy killing is merely a background. It could have been about any emotional topic that engenders strong response. These characters are totally unlikeable, the rambling plot awkward and disjointed. It presents a poor picture of anything Scottish! I question if the author was presented dollars and a deadline to come up with 'something' and this was the best she could do. Had this been my first Picoult novel, it would surely have been the last"},{"rating":"1","title":"Put me out of my misery","review":"Oh dear.. I thoroughly enjoyed the controversial subjects in \\"Sisters Keeper\\" and \\"19 minutes\\" -- but this book was painful. Couldn't finish it.

This book however,left me scraching my head. Cam is an absolute amoral jerk. Mia's reasoning for her behaviour (her parent\`s devotion to each other) is selfish and absurd. I couldn\`t accept how two people could fall into lust as quickly and intensely as the author would have us believe. The other characters were more believable and normal. I am like the other reviewers who rarely don\`t finish a book but this was a struggle and I had to skip ahead quite a lot. I really felt that I was being put on by the author and at some point the story would resolve itself and make sense. Sadly it never did.

As a nurse who has seen many terminal patients, let me tell you that does NOT happen anywhere in real life! The intensity of the \\"love at first sight\\" sub plot between the police chief and his wife's assistant was also a yawn. All the characters are flat, 2 dimensional, and totally unbelievable as real people. This is one of the worst books I have read in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Euro-Pro F2015L Cool Touch 1500-Watt Deep Fryer","review":"I just got this deep fryer in the mail the other day and I couldnt wait to use it, what a big disappointment. The next day I decided I would try something easy like a batch of french fries. The product sets up really easy and its pretty straight forward when using. The one and only problem that I have encounter which to me is a BIG PROBLEM is that each time I pulled the strainer out of the oil to empty the fries I had to reset the heating element. Its a pain since you have to lift the entire heating element out of the hot oil and press a button on the back of the unit. I made 3 batches of fries and each time I had to reset the switch. I guess we live and learn dont we. Personally I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor if you enjoy martin barre's guitar work","review":"i bought this unheard, hoping it was in the same vein as Crest Of A Knave which i also bought recently on the basis of a single song (She Said She Was A Dancer) and overall it's really excellent, particularly Martin Barre's contributions on electric guitar. Rock Island, unfortunately, is really poor in comparison. the only keeper from an instrumental point of view is the opener kissing willy, but the lyrics are too pornographic for my tastes. i guess my point is, if you want to try some later Jethro Tull (I'm a baby boomer who grew up listening to earlier Tull classics, e.g.Aqualung, Benefit & Stand Up), buy Crest Of A Knave and don't waste you money on Rock Island."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm overrating this album because Amazon won't let me give it zero stars","review":"This is the worst album by my favorite band Jethro Tull. I've tried several times to sit through and listen to the album from beginning to end and just can't make it through. The only listenable tracks are kissing willie and another christmas song. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your maney on this piece of crap (it pains me to say that anything Jethro Tull has put out is crap) but it just is.I'm glad that they rebounded with their next album Catfish Rising. This is the only release in the JT catalog that is pure rubbish. I wish that Amazon would allow the reviewers to give zero stars because that is what I would give it if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ian Anderson in top form","review":"Jethro Tull from time to time in their career have made milestone albums that have defined them. Among those albums would be Aqualung, Thick as a Brick, The Minstrel in the Gallery, Heavy Horses, Songs from the Wood, The Broadsword and the Beast, Crest of a Knave and Rock Island.Ian Anderson is on stride and his interplay with Martin Barre on guitar is outstanding. Ian Anderson with his flute and Barre on the guitar play what amounts to duel lead on their recordings.Among the songs are Undressed to Kill, Rock Island, Heavy Water, Another Christmas song and my personal favorite Whaler's Dues. Whaler's Dues is in my mind one of the finest songs Ian Anderson has ever wrote and my ears always perk up when it plays.Ian Anderson has put together a masterpiece that not only Tull collectors will love, but Classic Rock fans as well. This is Jethro Tull in its top form and a very nicely crafted album to say the least..................."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not without merit","review":"I am not surprised by the unfavourable reviews (below) by Rodney Parnell and Lance Law.

The album is not as bad as they consistently maintain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as bad as the PJTAS says","review":"This album doesn't deserve the bad press it has got in this forum. Sure, the songs are a bit uninspired, Ian Anderson's voice is a shadow of the past, the musicians are playing by rote, and the arrangements are formulaic. But that does not mean it won't be enjoyed by the American public, plus a few enlightened Proserpudlians. Give it a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"The blunt Mr Boule was right","review":"The instinct of the Jethro Tull fan, of whom I am one, is to nurture the band and protect it from pejorative comment.

Compare the divine inspiration of early (and even some more recent) albums with the utter absence of inspiration here."},{"rating":"1","title":"among the worst","review":"I've decided Ian Anderson must have started to lose his voice (probably a limited instrument to begin with) as early as the late seventies. In retrospect, I think the decline is evident on \\"Heavy Horses\\". In any case, by the time of this record, he'd clearly lost it, and as of this writing he clearly has not regained it.I say this voice was probably a limited instrument to begin with because I can't think (admittedly, off the top of me 'ead) of any even pre-Bungle songs that exceed an octave. Here Mr. Anderson drones on a single pitch or doodles on a tiny pentatonic subset. He attempts to mask his inability to sing by affecting sporadically Mark Knopfler and Bob Dylan mannerisms(inappropriately).Singing aside, this record is utterly devoid of lyrical or musical ideas. Melodies are non-existent; harmony is static; lyrics are inane."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Strange Dichotomy","review":"I've had this album for a dozen years or so, having bought it on a whim when I was nabbing everything Tull I could find during my college years. I've long thought that this album was Tull both at their absolute best as well as their absolute worst. Strange Avenues, Rock Island, The Whaler's Dues, and Another Christmas Song all fall in the former category with the bulk of the rest reserved for the latter. It may seem odd that I rate this 4 stars, but the three songs mentioned above are worth the meager price of admission.Recently, I've been playing a lot of Tull again, thanks to the requests of my 4-year-old daughter. Where most children her age are into Barney, she's got 'unique' tastes for one her age. She's been to her first concert (Seether/Audioslave), and also loves Live, Pearl Jam, and Evanescence. On a whim, I put in some Tull and she loved it. Her favorites? Rock Island (the song, not the album.), Silver River Turning, and Orion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatuous, uninspired, inane, token","review":"There is quite a dichotomy here.

Since it's bacon flavored, he loves it! It really does smell like bacon, too.Before I started giving this to him, he ate grass everytime I took him out to use the bathroom. I've always heard that dogs eat grass because their stomach hurts or they don't feel good. It may be a coincidence, but it he hasn't been eating grass anymore. As we know, many dogs have some pretty foul smelling breath. The smell of his breath really has improved due to taking Barley Dog.This really is a great product, and seems to last a long time. It is 11 oz, and I only give him 2 tsp per day. On behalf of my dog, Chester, I would like to say thank you Barley Dog for a really effective product."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely bad golf game","review":"golf games back in the day just were not that good. seriously 9 out of 10 golf games of the 90's were horrible, it wasn't until Hot Shots Golf, Tiger Woods and Mario Golf came along that Golf games started getting good. avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"LPCs for Dummies","review":"I got the book out from the library initially, but it is so insanely useful that I had to buy it.

Hoopla is a scaled back alternative. The best features are that two or more can play, the players are cooperating to beat the clock and it only takes a limited amount of time (about half an hour). The drawbacks are that it isn't a good kids game, since a large number of the cards will reference people, places or ideas most kids just won't ever guess (like Bob Dylan or jukebox). But it would be easily maleable to any theme, including a kid version, if one wanted to make up the cards. For example, I think this would make a great alternative to some of the tired annoying games that are inflicted on baby shower and bridal shower attendees! If you like Cranium, but find you can't seem to get enough people or time pulled together, try Hoopla!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fun!!!","review":"This is a battle of your brains versus time.

It may be synth overload for some as its more than just a taste of Synth Pop, its a whole damn meal. Catchy tunes, fun lyrics, just what you would expect from MWH. I would not rate it as high as Pop Goes the World, as I don't think the music is as varied. Then again, these albums represent different times and places.

They are definitely one of my favorite groups. However, I was extremely disappointed in this latest offering. It's not just that it's bad, it is so horrible that I've trashed it (I've NEVER done that with a cd before). To call it music is an insult to musicians. I don't know what made Ivan and the band produce this tragedy, but I hope that they get it together and can continue what was a grand tradition of quality work. Otherwise they should just hang it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lesser Tull album","review":"Tull have delivered some mighty albums in their 30-odd year history, this set doesn't rank amongst the top bracket though.Compared to their great prog-rock albums and latter day gems, Catfish seems short on inspiration.Perhaps Ian was feeling the pressure to release new product but to my mind he would have been better to have waited for better songs to present themselves.Their is a plethora of great Tull albums around. Better to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Was Left Wanting","review":"I am 41 years old, and have been a huge Tull fan since I was about 11. I probably have somewhat unique tastes among Tull fans in that I really don't like a lot of their early stuff, and really think their music took off with \\"War Child.\\" That being said, I find \\"Catfish Rising\\" simply, well, BORING. It seems like the band is holding back, and the electric guitar is way too subtle. For example, the track \\"When Jesus Came to Play\\" could have been a monster if they just powered it up a little, but as it is, it's merely so-so. Plus, Ian Anderson sings in basically the same nasal tone on just about every track. Again my Tull tastes are undoubtedly unique, but I thought the band really uncorked it with \\"Crest of a Knave,\\" and I'd like to see them release another CD with as much power and energy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A commendable release","review":"I've been a big Tull fan since 1968, and have seen them \\"live\\" 11 times over the years. I don't quite have all their releases yet, but I'm working on it, and am only missing a few.That being said, and being the Tull afficianado that I am, I have to say, this is one of the best releases of their later period. Granted, this is not up there with \\"Aqualung\\" or \\"Thick As A Brick\\", but this is a commendable CD, containing some great Tull tracks. \\"Rocks on The Road\\" ranks among my top 5 or 6 Tull tunes ever, and \\"Roll Yer Own\\" is also a great song. I think Ian's songwriting on \\"Catfish Rising\\" is still top-notch.Not the best Tull CD, but one definitely worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Farley's Musical Essentials 20003 Entertainer's Secret Dry Throat Spray","review":"My son is a singer and uses this product on a regular basis.

It's a miracle he is still alive after the life he has lived. Ozzy not wanting to relive what was obviously a painful part of his career by talking about Randy should not be held against him. Maybe it's reserved for a separate blu-ray, ever think of that? Or saying he forgot to talk about Jake or anyone or anything should also have no bearing. I am sure there was no disrespect intended. There are most likely hundreds of other people that Ozzy could thank or give honorable mention to but this is not an award ceremony. This is his story, in his own words, and on blu-ray!

If you want a great series on prehistoric sea monsters, check out BBC'sChased By Dinosaurs, which in addition to dinosaurs has a mini-series featuring sea monsters that is much longer thanNational Geographic: Sea Monsters - A Prehistoric Adventure (In 3-D) [Blu-ray].

It's both more entertaining and educational."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for your Samsung or other 3D TV","review":"I purchased the blu-ray version thinking that this would play perfectly on my new 50in Samsung 3d TV . Unfortunatley this turned out to be one of those red-blue 3D movies where you'd need to see it with the cardboard supplied glasses. The 3D effects are outdated and its just not that great after seeing some of the later movies with 3D effects.Actually shame on me for not reading the product details before buying it.but even with the supplied blue-red glasses on, the 3D effects are mediocre. The documentary is way too short and for the price i paid , it definitely feels like a rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT New Technology 3D......","review":"If you like 3D in Blue/Red colored glasses, this is for you. This is NOT for use in the new 3D movie technology (i.e. Samsung LED TV's)."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING","review":"Be very careful as this DVD is totally misleading its potential buyer.When they say it is a 3D movie in fact it is an Anaglyph red and blue 3D dvd and not a truepolarized 3D hence super low quality.So do not get fooled that those super big 3D letters as this is not a true 3D movie.Very misleading and disappointing from a company like National Geo to make use of a hypefor 3D product and lying big time to the product they are selling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story is great.

The characters are shallow and skeletal which makes them hard to like. The mysteries are incredible in the true sense of the word: not credible. The season only has two things in common with other British mystery series: Accents and scenery. And did I mention sex? Mystery and illusion are the pretense for a series in which groping, obsession, and inuendo dominate. It was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anthology of first 3 Starquest stories","review":"Nice read.

In my opinion I would have to say that Songs From the Wood is prabrably their best. It rates up in my top five albums. 1. Quadrophenia, The Who 2. Songs From the Wood, Jethro Tull 3. Crash, Dave Matthews Band 4. Tommy, The Who 5. Blood On the Tracks, Bob Dylan"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Celtic/Rock Masterpiece","review":"This is Jethro Tull's finest work - the pinnacle of their career.

There is a real sense of celebration in the music. Medieval Rock! Artists today are too self conscious. Too concerned with commercial acceptability. Songs form the Wood is a theatrical delight and everything that we know to be Jethro Tull. If you are a Tull fan and haven't heard this then buy it, as simple as that. Sit back, relax, and smell the green moss, if you don't then it's your loss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Casio calculators ROCK!","review":"I have been using these rugged, easy to use, menu driven calculators teaching a variety of levels of math for years! My own children used them all the way through college. I LOVE Casio. They are cheaper than others, more intuiative, no obscure code/key sequences to memorize and do EVERYTHING any level of math student needs. These folks who say otherwise have never used a Casio and probably think everyone must use a Windows based computer too. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this calculator!","review":"I've loved this calculator since the moment I got it. It's just as good as a TI-84. The graphic menu makes it quite user friendly. The only downside is that some of the operations, such as the factorial button, are hidden in the options menu, but once you know that it's not hard to find them. This calculator has taken me from geometry all the way through calculus IV. It's definitely worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good deal!","review":"I got this as my kid's high school graphing calculator. Works just fine, and about 1/3 the cost of the ones the teacher recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied with the calculator.","review":"It works but the display and the key symbols are hard to read at angle.Must look straight down at it. No factorial key."},{"rating":"1","title":"May not be what you need","review":"I purchased this Casio because it was a lot cheaper then a TI83/84. In it's advertising it says it does the same functions but I am finding that it does not. When it does do one of the functions it is off by it's rounding or it doesn't come up with the same type of answer (different form like decimal) which I have to then translate to the correct form. For me it was not worth the price break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Graphing Calculator","review":"I have used this calculator for 3 years, and it been of great service to me. The icon-based UI makes things much easier to find and use (there are also hotkeys you could push for faster access, they're on the lower right corner of the icons). I like the screen, it has blue on green text, and it's a higher resolution than the TI-83 (I haven't seen the screens on the newer TI models). Overall it is more user friendly, with some exceptions: instructions in math class, and programs and games. Most if not all math textbooks have instructions for TI calculators, which dominate the education market. There aren't games that are graphically based like the TI calcs (Then again, you shouldn't be playing games during class), also programming is somewhat annoying to do, because all the options are handled by the Function keys. I prefer the Casio over TI (based on the TI-83, I haven't tried any other models), because of its user friendliness, and its price."},{"rating":"1","title":"are you serious","review":"If I didn't know any better, I'd think this was a joke.

His advice and instructions can make the difference between holding on or falling apart. I highly recommend Richard Schell's book, Quick Cash, to anyone in financially draining circumstances. And these days, that seems to be more and more of us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Read for Quick Cash","review":"I heard author Richard Schell speak about Quick Cash, and found the book as easy to read as Schell was to listen to -- and just as self-deprecating and humorous at times.Schell is right, the strategies to raise cash -- whether it is to pay off bills or decide whether your child is going to Camp Timberwolf or Camp Nickelodeon for the summer are with in reach -- just so long as you don't wait for someone to hand you money for doing nothing! Schell tells you just what to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"rolling stones tribute","review":"this album sucked. it sounded like every track was by the same whining folk pop singer whoever she is. Just awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful!","review":"I grew up with the Playmobil Victorian dollhouse, and only recently did I start collecting other Playmobil sets. I bought this Fairy Tale Castle about a month ago and had the greatest time putting it together. The assembly directions include another building variation that seems to be a little more spacious, if you're planning to fit all the furniture sets in. Unlike the victorian dollhouse, this one is totally sturdy. I've moved it several times with no problem. And the accesory sets are incredible.I recommend getting this item from Amazon.com while they have free shipping in the States. I have had problems finding toys by this company in every toy store I've been to, and having it shipped directly from Europe is extremely pricey!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairy Tale Castle Great for Imagination","review":"I am a teacher and frequently use Playmobile products to bring history alive.

With just a little bit of play, the pieces come off and get lost easily because they are so small. We spent hours putting it together and it is frustrating to have it taken apart so easily. I have been keeping the pieces that she takes off but right now we don't feel like putting it back together just to have it taken apart again. We wish it would be more permanent once it is together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soveit Tragedy","review":"Very disappointing.

I can not blame Amazon for this as I failed to check with the manufacture prior to purchase. The required cross bars and towers are around $175 to make them fit. No big deal, I went back to the foam blocks until something better and affordable comes along. I gave them four stars because they look like they would work just fine, just not on stock Jeep Patriot racks."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these gunwale brackets","review":"I use these on 66\\" cross bars along with two Viper bike racks.
