I like the common sense approach that Chyna takes although some of the routines are difficult for those who might have knee problems as they rely a lot on deep knee bends. Even if you do not choose to work out with Chyna, this tape does provide some good suggestions for exercises that anyone may wish to integrate into their programs and some limited instruction in how to do them safely.

I was disappointed because I expected a better quality workout from an industry leader like Denise Austin. While doing all 3 walking segments at once did get me sweating, the routines were difficult to follow because there were little, if any, queues to take you to the next move. I clumsily stumbled along for most of the workout, which I hate to do. The only redeeming thing about the DVD was that it at least kept me moving at a fast pace, regardless of whether or not I was able to decipher what she was about to do next, but I didn't have to spend the money to do that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to follow","review":"There is almost no cueing throughout the workouts and it is almost impossible to follow along! Also, this dvd requires much more space than I have, though I've always had plenty of room to do a Leslie Sansone workout (Leslie has excellent cueing and is easy to follow). I don't think I have gotten a good workout once when doing this dvd, mainly as I spend much of the workout trying to follow along. Denise does use some arm movements that were new to me, which I am happy to incorporate in to my workouts for variety's sake. All in all, very disappointed after doing Leslie Sansone workouts for 2 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun and easy to follow","review":"The inddor walk is perfect for beginners, it is simple to follow and the moves are not stressful on joints etc.If you are an intermediate excerciser like myself, and you are worried about the reviews that say this workout is too easy, try adding ankle weights and weighted gloves during this workout.

I love the easy walk. It's low impact (which I need for my bad knees), easy to follow and when I've finished it, I really feel as though I've accomplished something. I've started doing the first 15 minute easy walk twice in a row (for a 30 minute walk) and can really feel it working on my muscles. For me, an obese excercise beginner, it's a fabulous way to ease into the habit of working out.

Divided into three 15 minute segments each progressively harder than the previous I found that I was never too challenged and it was difficult to follow the moves as they changed because Denise's pacing is off. I even tried to add heavier weights to the second workout but even that was too easy.Unlike the extras in the WALP series the women working with Ms. Austin seemed devoid of personality (enthusiasm) and were also poorly paced at points.This DVD would be an alright choice for someone who needs a very light workout or is just beginning but at this time I have taken it out my rotation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great workout!","review":"I got this as a gift for my mother who absolutely adores Denise!

She was never in sync with the people behind her. Her footwork was always \\"off\\" compaired to the other ladies exercising. Also, it seemed as though she was making up the mooves as she went along. I had a little trouble following her the first few time because there were several time during the workout that she didn't tell you what was coming next. She could have done with a lot less \\"That's it, Good\\". Must have said that a hundred times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upbeat Walking","review":"Denise has a rather distinct personality and I find her fun for this type of nice short workouts.There is a nice selection of an Easy Walk, Fat Blasting Interval Walk and a Power and Tone Walkplus stretches.I still use the Easy walk over half the time I use this and try the others from time to time. They are good, but I am not quite there yet, though I am close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need Upbeat Music","review":"The video is \\"okay\\". I thought it could use some upbeat music.

There is slight pause between miles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for hectic schedules and just starting out.","review":"I bought this for my mom who can't always get out of the house to exercise.

Her approach to coaching is not genuine and was absolutely annoying after only the first few minutes. She talked entirely too much.

I am happy I didn't pay too much for this dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, light workout","review":"This is a terrific workout for those who are getting started and who may want a short workout to keep her metabolism going. The workouts get the heart pumping without strain or shortness of breath. This DVD is wonderful. Also it is terrific for walking indoors when walking outdoors isn't possible.Denise Austin is encouraging and pleasant. I find her workouts and I have done many (Fat burning Yoga, Yoga Buns, Pilates, Kickboxing Etc) stimulating and encouraging. The only criticism I have is that she doesn't include women or men in the videos who are \\"weight challenged\\" All those shone with her are very fit, slim people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opt for Something Better","review":"I think Denise Austin does a decent job in some of her other videos, but this isn't one of them. She lacks any type of warm up in this one and often looks like she's just trying to make up steps in order to fill the time slot. The moves are not well choreographed and very awkward. Some may find encouragement in the times Denise gives the camera a bug eyed stare and says \\"We're burning butter.... yeah\\" but I found it annoying. I think there are much better workouts for the money out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO easy","review":"I am 38 and considered obese, however I work in a busy operating room all day and found this to be too easy.

I was distracted by her overall presentation, or rather annoyed by the bug-eyed breathlessness of it all. Just because it's walking, doesn't mean the viewer has to be addressed as if he, or she is just learning how to do so.

I did not like her fake, over the top, too perky 'sell this video' attitude. I did not like the 4 women she had with her, well, I didnt like their fake smiles. This is work, I want to see people with workout faces and maybe an occasional smile. The workout itself for the first 2 miles that i chose to do were kicking my butt and I could not keep up at times.

I will be donating it to Goodwill."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Keeper","review":"I've had this video for years. I recently came back to it to do more \\"cardio\\". One of the great things about this workout is that everyone of the three workouts is LOW impact. The first one is probably way too easy for all but beginners. I like to combine the cardio walk with the power walk (which uses weights) and it does make me sweat.

I prefer the older Christmas carols and songs (before the 1970's) and Como was a legend even in his own time for his vocal talents and his magnificent performances. I prefer listiening to the likes of Crosby, Ames, Como, Williams, Goulet, etc, before just about anyone of the newer singers, many of which do have good voices, but evidently would rather sing in any language other than English, presumably to appease the politically overcorrect thought police.

The rubber case is nicely made and is very durable. However - the case does not fit the 2nd Generation iPod Nano perfectly. The 2G nano will fit inside and is functional, but you have to stretch the case to allow room for the earphone jack and USB cable at bottom (otherwise the the rubber covers the openings slightly prohibiting the cable/jack to enter completely). Stretching it to allow room creates a little slack in the rubber and looks a little sloppy.SIZE: Some jokers here have left reviews saying it wont fit around their arm without giving a size, so I measured it. The elastic arm band is 15 inches unstretched, which does not include the last inch or so you need to loop through the plastic buckle for 'velcroing'. I suppose it could stretch another 2-4 inches, but that may make it too tight and look dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"The armband is too big.","review":"I bought this for when I workout and the armband is too big for my arm.

Since buying it, I've seen others that have a few more bells & whistles, but this is comfortable to wear and serves its purpose. The rubber holder holds the iPod securely. The holder has a little plastic piece that is supposed to be inserted as a screen protector. This piece is hard to manage, so I discarded it. The iPod seems to be adequately protected. The armband is a wide piece of elastic - no neoprene, nothing fancy, but it stays on. Good iPod accessory for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product, Good Price","review":"This product delivers exactly what it says it does.

Don't Buy it!","review":"Swayed by the overwhelmingly positive reviews on here, I bought this armband despite the few reviews that noted it might be too large for anyone with thin arms. Surely, I thought, since this was a product designed for people who RUN, its armband couldn't be THAT large.Now, I'll be the first to admit: I have skinny, wimpy arms that will look like sticks no matter what I do. But arms that are, you know, pretty typical for the class of people I had assumed Belkin designed this armband for. But this doesn't come close to fitting my arm--the Velcro would need to extend for about three more inches to make this tight enough to stay on. The case itself is fine, but not worth the purchase if you can't use the armband as well.After this sat in my desk drawer for a couple months, I gave it to my mother so she could use it at the gym. And you know what? Last time I went home I saw the ipod in its case, sans armband. Too big for her, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so happy","review":"I bought this armband for my husband for Christmas, and found that the screen and circular selector on the iPod nano 2G does not line up with the screen and circle on the armband.

This is ok with him because he doesn't really play with the nano once he starts running, but it still would be nice if it did fit the correct way."},{"rating":"1","title":"The armband is too big for those with slender arms","review":"I bought this product for my wife, and she'll have to work a lot more on her biceps before the armband fits properly.

I bought one of these about 18 months ago and I am done with it.Now I run 5 days a week, usually for an hour or more. 30 to 50 miles a week. I use the arm band during warm weather when I don't wear a jacket. About 6 months ago it started slipping a bit and I would have to tighten it a time or two during a run. The velcro is just too cheap. Since the weather got warm here this spring, it's almost useless. It won't stay on at all. Nothing beats running a race carrying your ipod!This is not for the serious runner, or for anyone who has the expectation of it lasting for more than a year. There has got to be something better out there! And I'm going to find it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, I guess...","review":"While the silicon used in the construction of the sleeve is very nice (feels grippy but not sticky if you know what I mean), some of the features are just wrong. For instance, the opening for the hold switch on top was apparently cut wrong and does not line up with the switch at all - requiring you to have to push the cover around so you can flip the hold on or off. Also, for whatever reason, the edge of the sleeve is right at the headphone jack which causes it to be somewhat difficult to keep some headphones seated during use (the sleeve can work its way in and pop the jack out).The armband is satisfactory at best - it's just a standard, no frills, velcro armband."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad result","review":"i got the product fairly quick for being in Iraq. however, the strap ripped after having 1 1/2 weeks.

I have already dropped my covered Nano once and I was glad that it was protected by this cover.I haven't used the arm band that came with it that much because it is kind of a pain to attach and detach. You have to loop it through two slots on the back of the cover which is harder than it sounds. Since the Nano is so small, I normally just put it in either my pants pocket or shirt pocket if I have one.

The little plastic protector that covers the screen would not stay in place over the screen and I was constantly losing it between the silicon cover and the ipod. I finally just gave up on it and returned it. I bought it because it is one of the only ipod accessories that has a fair price tag.

The silicon is smooth and not tacky and the fit is excellent. Unlike a DLO one I tried, it covers everything you want, and leaves every button available. The screen protector goes on well and is so clear you can't tell it's there. The arm band is kind of stiff and not very soft. I have arm bands from creative (mp3 player crapped out after 6 mo) and one from rio (same story) that I use instead...much more plush. That's the only reason why not 5 stars. More like 4.5.

It would work very well for people with larger arms, but slender women should know that it will not fit them.

While the acoustic can seem a bit distant at times, it suits Cole's instrument well. Listen especially to her playing in the Partita: the execution of the trills in the Prelude, the rolicking Courante, and a somewhat breathless Gigue. Like most performers, Cole omits several of the repeats in the Goldbergs (for reasons of space if for nothing else), which is a pity, since her ornamentations the second time around are so often excellent.

First, it now uses two cords that need to be tied together (if you use only the one main cord, it operates manually, which I've never needed to do in 15 years of using these pumps) which is very unwieldly, especially if it's raining already when you're putting the pump on the poll cover. Second, the main plug has a small plastic air tube that should not come into contact with water. Good luck with that if your power source is further away than these 25 foot cords allow and you're using an extension cord like I need to. Consider instead the Little Giant APCP-1700 (577301) that has only one cord, no strange plug air tube, and is even heavier so that more of the water on the cover drains towards the pump (a problem with lighter pumps - much of the water towards the cover boundaries just sits there)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pool Pump","review":"This pump was on my pool cover > It lasted less then 2 months .

When it works it just keeps clogging up from leaves. I talked with the manufactor who stated if frozen water gets in the pump, it is damaged. Don't get one if water ever freezes in your neighborhood. Also, for little giant warranty they will only deal the distributor, not the consumer. What a pain, and therefore the company does not have product registration online or keep a database of your personal product. The serial number only tells them when the distributor bought the product. Not a consumer friendly company, nor a reliable product for you pool cover needs! Think about some others."},{"rating":"1","title":"They do not like water","review":"I have to agree with many of the other posts. They only last 1-2 years. I am looking for something that last longer - even in cold winters etc. Many of the folks talk about taking the pump out of the water if \\"freezing conditions are present\\" - If the pump actually pumped out all the water, it wouldn't be sitting in water when temps got below freezing. Stupid design if a freeze caused it to stop working. Are you gonna run out every time the temp drops below freezing and remove your pump?

Premise is intelligent and hints are not around the first chapter.

Parts of \\"State of Mind\\" just flew by and I became quite engrossed...then periods of dull nonaction. Perhaps it was just too long. Were it not for my faith in Mr. Katzenbach's writing there were many times I would have quit this one. Kept figuring it would pick up in the next chapter. Ending is a pretty good payoff, but takes too long to get there and it's a plodding journey. Set in a Blade Runner world the overall plot made sense and the characters were well drawn. Mr. Katzenbach has entertained me before and will again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring! A waste of time!","review":"I was extremely surprised at this new book by John Katzenbach. I have read his other books with relish and found them to be thrilling. Until now.I believe you have to be in a certain state of mind to read \\"State of Mind\\". The book starts off with the right note. We are aware of a danger to the Claytons; and the way Jeffrey is roped into the game - nicely done. After that, it is all psychological mumbo-jumbo. Every chapter deals with the psychological makeup of the characters. One can say that \\"State of MInd\\" deals with the mind. But too much is too much. What thrills the book might have provided was lost in the jungle of psychology.How boring was the book? I gave up reading it at chapter 12. The good thing about the book? I did not buy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Katzenbach is a good writer. His \\"The Analyst\\" is one of the best thrillers I've read. And Hart's war and The Madmans Tale are well written gripping stories. However with State of Mind I found my own mind wandering as I read it. Somehow it is too long and not particularly compelling. The future America he devises where everyone is armed and guards escort office workers to their cars is not perhaps far fetched but felt superficial. It merely existed as a counterpoint for a new 51st State where everyone was safe.Don't bother with this book, especially when Katzenbach has written so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe when my son is older","review":"I bought this book to read to my 2 year old and it just did not work for him.

What about pink plastic yard flamingoes? What about refrigerators lined up against the trailer? What about the three cars up on blocks?

Not only is the quality poor (fading in and out, scratchiness, etc.) but there are only two episodes per video (on this one and on vol. 1). I appreciate the early episodes, but they definitely made a mistake by passing up some of the gems of the later seasons (\\"The Lake\\"/cara episode, \\"Goodbye\\", anything with Becky Slater...and of course, the 2-part series finale). Unless you're desperate and this is truly your only option, I would recommend holding out until something better comes along."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review","review":"The episodes on this video both really make you think.

He learns a few reasons why his father is the way he is. \\"Angel\\" is a funnier episode than the first, but it still manages to have a moral at the end and make you think. In it Karen, Kevin's older sister, has a new boyfriend, that Kevin discovers is cheating on her and Kevin tries to find ways to get rid of him.

I was sorely disappointed. All the actors did a good job, however the underlying story just seemed too scattered to me. Very unfocused. The writer, director, whoever should have picked ONE angle and stayed with it. It would have been hilarious if it was just all the family's dysfunctional stuff. It would have been romantic if it was a love story between Claudia and Leo. It would have been sweet if it was the family putting aside the bad times and remembering the good times and rediscovering each other.

The whole movie looks like it was shot by a single 40-Watt light bulb; even with my brightness controls at maximum, I could barely see anything. The outdoor daylight scenes look like they were shot at night (the only exception is the short fantasy sequence at the end). AND it's jittery, like something downstreaming from the internet, especially if the closed-captions (which flash on for half a second) are on.

I particularly appreciated the fact that there was an interesting mystery that went along with the girl meets girl story. Ms. Crist's skill with writing dialogue that rigns true and her use of Texas as a locale made the story more enjoyable for me. I hope there are more books in this author's future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Love Story","review":"This story is a great story that men and women can relate to.

It had style, pizazz, and much much more. Miss Jackson's first work is among the one of the best fiction novels that I've ever read. It dosen't give you the old \\"boy meets girl...boy gets girl...boy and girl get married and have two kids and a pet in the yard\\", it went to the absolute core of what relationships go through. It also showed what a family can go through when one wants to do one thing and another wants to protect the other. In my opinion, this book was one of the best examples of what a woman can go through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terry McMillan - she is not!","review":"This is an average dud.

She spoke of it in the book as a centerpiece of Jewish family life for hundreds of years. The mothers would read the weekly Torah reading to the children and then read the rabbinic commentary. I think the book was first published for this purpose sometime around the 16th century. It is a wonderful source of wisdom, encouragement, lore, knowledge.

This one is a little bit early in the time line of the stories (at least seemed to me) but is a good story as always.

Cant go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated and stupid","review":"Poor long-suffering overworked underpaid cops of the mythical 87th precinct ... none of them corrupt, none of them racist, all of them clever conversationalists. Here they again confront McBain's evil genius, the deaf man. Never occurs to anyone that witnesses that could identify him might need protecting. Also no one seems to think it might be a good idea to put his threatened victims in hiding, even after two of them are murdered. McBain presents the deaf man's harebrained scheme as plausible. What little good his beloved cops actually accomplish is by just plain dumb luck and bizarre coincidence.Was everybody really this dimwitted back in the 60s? How did this sloppy, uncritical, naive writer ever get his great reputation?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"Mysterious death threats against city officials seem like a joke at first. Then the bullets and the bombs come out, and the boys of the 87th Precinct realize that they're dealing with another caper by their old nemesis, the Deaf Man.This is an exceptionally well-crafted police procedural. The characterizations of Carella, Meyer, and Cotton Hawes are like being reunited with old friends, and the subplots all dovetail to support the main plot. Another great book by McBain -- fun, interesting, and absorbing.Reviewer: Liz Clare, co-author of the historical novel \\"To the Ends of the Earth: The Last Journey of Lewis and Clark\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"We Love Barney","review":"This was a great purchase.

The DK Guides are great for the amount of information they provide and this guide is no exception. There is information in this book that even a native New Yorker may not know. The book talks about the history and architecture of buildings that you may otherwise walk by. There are museums that I've never heard of. There are street by street maps of some of Manhattan's great neighborhoods. I have used the book to plan a walking trip from Penn Station to Rockefeller Center and back via Time Square. I am planning many future walking trips with this book. If the book is two heavy to carry, buy two. One for permanent reference and the other to \\"rip out\\" the pages of the places you are planning to visit.

The Waite's 'Photoshop 5 How To' has more practical information--and no brochures!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Most Useful Books on My Shelf","review":"I reference this book every time I scan a difficult photo. I think it is an excellent guide for designers, especially those working with small clients who can't afford professional photography. The book has advice on how to work with common \\"problem photos\\", which is a great help when you need to get a usable image out of a snapshot with poor lighting.I see the other reviewer's point about too much space being taken up by discussion of various types of scanners. It would have been nice to see less about scanner types no one uses and more space devoted to techniques for improving scans. Still, the information that is there is very useful.The information is directed at print designers, but many of the tips are useful for the Internet in a general sense. It would be nice to see specific advice for online images, but maybe that's for another book. All in all I found it a very valuable resource and have recommended it to several other designers."},{"rating":"1","title":"May Not Be The Best For Beginners","review":"I bought this book feeling that it would take the mystery out of scanning. It did not. The problem is that that the autor uses terminolgy that is never referenced in your run of the mill scanner manual.

I bought them for my 2 1/2 year old son and they have worn very well. They've been covered in mud, soaked in puddles (they're water resistant, not waterproof), and have cleaned up looking good as new. Another bonus is that he can get them on and off by himself. The fit is good too--my son has wide feet so I bought the half size up (they only come in whole sizes anyway), and they are roomy enough for him and still stay on."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST","review":"I had found these shoes at a consignment store originally. My daughter outgrew her first pair and was so attached to them that we had to get the next size up. She is 18 months old and is starting to work on putting on her own shoes. These are great for that.

I recommend this book to help you to find a true and loving relationship...."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting and helpful","review":"It was really helpful for me to read into this topic and recognize things about my former relationships and what went wrong. It made things clear for me about what is a healthy process of a relationship, because I had the tendency (as they also explain in the book) to blame myself for the lack of commitment my exes could handle. What I like about this book, is that is doesn't blame the guys, it just explains what happens with them during a relationship. For me it was a good eye-opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Men Who Can't Love","review":"I would suggest this book to anyone who has lost their partner for no explainable reason. While my partner did not fit the examples 100%, he certainly fell into the commitmentphobic catagory. I also did many of the things the other women did to try to \\"fix\\" it, which only made it worse. (I wish I could have read this book before trying to fix things!) This book answered so many of my questions and is making the pain a little more bearable.The book is very well written and easy to understand, but it would have been nice to see a chapter on 'how' they became that way (i.e. divorce, widowed, fear of losing again, upbringing)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carter couldn't have described this man better","review":"I would highly recommend this book to any woman involved with an ambivalent man. I found this book just after breaking up with one of these men and it was, in many ways, like reading my own story. I had tremendous difficulty getting my head around his hot and cold behaviour and would rack my brain trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. One night he'd treat me like the answer to his prayers and the next day I was treated like a complete stranger. Come her, go away. That was the pattern. After three months I stayed away. And this book was instrumental in my decision. Like Carter says, you can't change him and your self-esteem will plummet drastically. If you are trying to stay away from a commitmentphobic, keep this book with you wherever you go. Because, just as the book says, once he is feeling less anxious, he will want you back. And you will go through the hurtful process all over again. Don't go back!

Nothing in this book tells us the QUALIFICATIONS of the authors. Is she a lesbian? Is a castrated male? Neither are licensed psychologists. So they interviewed some weak and destroyed women who LET IT HAPPEN. Sorry guys, I'm just not buying it. If there was at least a line or two about the women having some adult personal responsibility, I might be able to buy parts of it, but it just gives all the helpless victim females an excuse and a free out. AS the abused male who wasa never accepted and constantly torn down and told how I should be to be good enough, I prefer Lousie Hay, PhD \\"You can heal your life\\". We are ALL perfect as we are. Sorry ladies, I mean victims, grow up and stop ball busting your men, and maybe they won't leave you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad stories about guys who run when love is highest and women get too close","review":"There are many stories about men who can't commit.

There is alot of repetition in this book...but that is ok..it helps it \\"hit home\\" more in a person's mind. The last chapter is what you can go to make it better. It is worth reading since it may help the person see it is many people who are like this and warning signs. It hurts too much to be abandoned at the highest point of love.

So much of what has gone on in my own life finally makes sense. I no longer blame myself for the terrible things that have happened to me and I've learned how the things I did in the relationship influenced bad behavior. I've searched for years for this answer.

Its somewhere a cross between White Zombie and Bon Jovi. Weird combination I'll admit but I really liked what I heard. The lyrics to one of the songs I heard, breath in my skin, gives me chills everytime I listen to the song. Powerful and deep.

That was a big mistake- every other song on the soundtrack is either incredibly stupid (Itty Bitty Pretty One, Stupid Cupid) or just mindless bubblegum pop by second rate artists.

See right after my dad took us to the theater, we went to umm I forget which store because he had to get something so I bought the CD. I was happy to get it, but then I went home & listened to it...yucky. My neighbor has it too and she thought it was great, so I listened to it some more to see if maybe it'd grow on me.

It keeps going on and on. \\"Hold On,\\" by B*Witched, has a new sound to it and is great, as is \\"Away With the Summer Days,\\" by Youngstown.

But I mistakingly figured that a soundtrack with the good taste to include Hanson would obviously have many other good songs. That is where I was wrong. Unless you like disgustingly bland pop music, don't buy this cd, except, of course, if you are, like myself and many other Hanson fans, buying it simply for their terrific song. All in all it was worth it for what I wanted, but nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for one song...","review":"To tell you the truth, I bought this album for one song \\"Wake Up\\" by Hanson. And it turns out, that is the only thing to be excited about. The rest of the album is bland pop such as a cover of \\"Stupid Cupid\\" by Mandy Moore and other such sticky-sweet pop.

All the songs are great. Some new songs are introduced to the USA like the one by the BSB or Hanson. It's mostly pop but I think even if you didn't like pop before, you will now. The songs make you happy and relive the movie all over again. You'll wanna get up and dance as if your life depends on it. I suggest you go and order the CD now or race to your store and buy it.

It's one of disney's movies. Ever since the commericals have been coming about the Princess Diaries I'vebeen interested. On the disney channel(zood disney) they have shown a show called \\"Movie Surfers\\" (\\"Movie Surfers\\" give a preview about the next disney movie coming up.) it really got me interested in the movie and the soundtack. Krystal performed during the show, her song rocked! I LOVED the song \\"Miracles Happen\\" by Myra. Although I am a preteen, Melissa Lefton's song \\"I Love Life\\" is like a pop song for teenagers that love there life. Other artists in the soundtrack rocked. I espically liked Nobody's Angel's song \\" Always Tommorrow\\". It's a pop classic! Hope this review was helpful to you!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good song is Hanson's!","review":"If you like Pop music, you'll like this CD, but I don't really care too much for pop music. I, along with many other Hanson fans bought this for Hanson's brand new song \\"Wake Up\\" which is truely amazing and itz the best song on that whole CD. So if you decide to buy it, skip all the others and go right to track #10 and prepare to be amazed, but don't let the \\"do do dah's\\" scare you :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Miracles Happen is a GOOD SONG","review":"It's very cool.Not Spanish,it's chinese.He's Chinese is very good.Better than Myra's version."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie was GREAT, the soundtrack I can't say the same for","review":"The movie was awesome, I liked it. The soundtrack... on the other hand.The songs aren't that great. Most of them are overplayed pop songs.

There are a couple other good songs, namely \\"Miss You More\\" by BBMak and \\"Supergirl\\" by Krystal.Other than that, unless you are all out on the pop scene, I'm telling you to buy a different CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the know","review":"Because I am familiar with competitive skating, both ice and roller, this was a very enjoyable movie.

While there is a basic storyline (which is 100% predictable), the constant flow of funny situations kept me laughing all the way through.Will Ferrell is funny to begin with in just about any film, but he has had a few that fell a little short (\\"Anchorman\\" & \\"Kicking and Screaming\\", for 2 examples). In this film he plays an anti-social, sex addicted, figure skater who is forced to skate with another guy in order to compete after a ban from singles skating.John Heder is also hilarious all the way through, which surprised me after seeing him in \\"Napolean Dynamite\\". He was great in that, but this is a completely different role.Much of the humor is based on the fact that while neither skater is gay, they almost constantly find themselves in sexually awkward situations.Almost all of the humor is low brow and \\"dumb\\", but it really works here. This movie is a non-stop gag from beginning until the hilarious end."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was aight","review":"this film was slightly better than average but while it had some good silly parts, the story line was all over the place. I got where they were trying to go with it,but it left alot of things kinda hanging. WIll Ferrell is good. he has a way of doing what he does and making it work. Jon Heder is ok,but he just pretty much plays the same role. the Brother and Sister team were a trip though. a few decent laughs,but the film was just kinda there in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Down with Paramount.","review":"Paramount go ahead and screw yourself, now because of you I had had lost my preorder."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!","review":"Classic Will Ferrell.

It's a piece of garbage someone threw together, probably in about as long as it takes to write an SNL skit. I walked out of the theater wanting my money back or wishing I'd seen something that was at least mediocre.

It would of been a lot simpler for us all if all these companies could of put their differences aside, and merged the technologies to give us just ONE great HD medium. But NO ... It's Beta & VHS all over again.So my hope is that the upcoming Dual-Player from Samsung will be reasonably priced, as the $1000 LG just doesn't make sense. Heck, you can buy both HD-DVD, & Blu-ray players for quite a bit less.The bottom line is that HD titles can really look awesome compared to regular DVD. Whichever one you choose, enjoy it.

Everything seemed very formulaic and predictable. Will Ferrell played his usual clueless-but-cocky character, and Jon Heder seemed out of his league as Ferrell's rival (and eventual partner). Some of the physical humor was mirth-provoking, but the off-the-ice scenes seemed labored. The highlight of the movie, for me, was the brother and sister team played by real-life spouses Will Arnett and Amy Poehler. I'd give this movie 2.5 stars if Amazon allowed that. I'm going with 2 stars to lower the average rating a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taledaga Nights On Ice","review":"I thought this was every bit as good as Taladega Nights and I really liked this movie as did my wife. Perhaps if you are a big fan of Ice Skating you will not enjoy it but keep in mind that the movie also stared Dorothy Hammil, Brian Boytano, Peggy Flemming, Nancy Kerrigan and several other famous skaters (not a fan of skating myself, but the previous folks were all named or were on a judges panel so I saw their names).The movie has a ll the cheese of the Olympics and the TV presentations with back stories that are damned funny and skating moves that are lewd and yes one of the best decapitations in modern film. The special effects are very slightly noticable so you can suspend disbelief except for the way over the top iron lotus maneuver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blades Of Glory Movie DVD","review":"Excellent condition and arrived very fast and efficient!

I guess I don't get why anyone finds Will ferrel funny, or why he keeps landing starring roles. The only thing I have seen him in that was remotely entertaining was ELF. Plus isn't he too old to be playing young men? He should be playing dads or grandfathers. If you think constant shots of ice-skaters staring into eachother crotches as they do maneuvers is funny, then this film is for you. The guy that played Napolean Dynamite must not have a good choice of scripts to have chosen this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Packaged poorly","review":"The sender mailed my DVD without its orginal DVD case.

The pacing of the movie lumbers along. The storyline is just bad, and overall, this movie was not good. I am a Will Farrell fan, as is my husband, and neither of us thought this was funny.

I dont think I will be seeing anything with him from now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back off people!!!","review":"Wow, some people are so whinny and short-sighted. Look at this from Paramounts POV, in one fell swoop they just made more money than they would probaly of seen in three years if they stayed neutral. There is no way at current adoption rates that they would see 150 million anytime soon from BD/HD-DVD sells, so why not go for the gold? And seriously, how can any BD fan be critical of Paramount when Disney, Fox, lion's Gate, etc all pretty mucch sold their souls to Sony and the BDA? Why is it bad that a studio become exclusive to HD-DVD, but its fine when they are exclusive to BD,studios being exclusive to any format is just idiotic as an whole in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"too dirty to watch","review":"I went and saw this with my friend who had to see it for one of her college classes. I like both Jon Heder and Will Ferrell, but in this movie all the humor is very dirty and crude. It's not just a litte bit, it's a lot... and that kinda ruined the movie for me.

Why did you have to sell out to go HD-DVD exclusive? I was planning on purchasing Blades of Glory off Amazon on Blu-Ray but I guess wont be doing that anymore. I won't even buy the DVD because of this. I'm so angry at Paramount for making such a stupid financial decision like this. A decision like this is what is prolonging this God-forsaken format war. I honestly believe that Microsoft does not give a rip about HD-DVD since they're making so much money and the losses that HD-DVD is already incurring does not affect them. But, I digress. I will longer purchase Paramount DVD's as a result of this! They just lost a customer along with every other Blu-Ray supporter!P.S. That means no more Transformers in HD for me :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Just to let you know, This Title will not be released on Blu Ray Now","review":"Uh, according to Paramount, they will be HD DVD exclusive starting with this release and Shrek 3 and Transformers.So Amazon has a lot of refunding to do.Don't waste your time buying this on Blu Ray, you will never get it.Get it on HD DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paramount's gone - get over it!","review":"First, this is for reviews of a product -- NOT a place to air your ridiculous lies about HD DVD!Microsoft paid nothing to Paramount, which has already been confirmed. Paramount dropped Blu-Ray because the format is too expensive and isn't selling well enough! Period! Why don't you go scream at Sony for tying up Fox, Disney and Lions Gate if you wish to blame corporations for the format war.Sony has launched another in a long series of losing formats. Blu-Ray will be dead as soon as the next studio drops them (Warner, anyone?), and we can all prepare for the inevitable success of HD DVD, the more consumer-oriented format that actually offers completed specs, lower prices, and equal (if not better) picture quality.

The BGO was remastered by \\"Sound Recording Technology\\". The EMI was REMIXED by Peter Mew. No mastering engineer is stated, but Mew is a likely suspect.In addition to the fact the 2 cd adds 8 songs, the sound blows away the BGO; likely more due to the remix than the remaster. The original just had too much hall ambiance/crowd noise & was very fuzzy. While the crowd still cheers too loudly in the same places, the EMI focuses on detail rather than the over abundant ambiance all to present on the BGO (& likely on earlier editions).While the EMI is a little too \\"modern sounding\\" for my liking, the added clarity wins by a landslide. Any brightness is also mitigated by the fact this is an acoustic show.There are apparently also 2002 & 2009 editions of the BGO 1 disc, I haven't heard them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Donovan Was Great Way Back Then","review":"Donovan was always one of my favorite artists.

The CD, though, offers additional cuts that were not on my original vinyl LP; so I was--and am--really happy with the CD!There's also a very interesting story on this CD about Donovan.

Marxism has manifestly failed, at enormous cost in needless suffering, political death, and the impoverishment of millions (please read \\"The Black Book of Communism\\"). Castro is much more popular among chic Westerners who don't have to live in his prison state than he is to his enslaved population. Really, the whole matter can be summed up by quoting some graffitti that was scrawled on one of Castro's innumerable propaganda posters.

These are superb recordings of Purcell's great works. But there is a big problem with this package. This is a Virgin Veritas x2 pack. The original recordings have been bundled up in a space saving jewel case and sold at half the price of the originals. Unfortunately, this comes at cost to the potential buyer. Gone is the original artwork, gone are the original notes by Richard Luckett and Eric Van Tassel, and most seriously, gone are the lyrics of these great works. Unless you already own versions of these works that have the lyrics, this is not the place to start. I strongly urge you to acquire these wonderful works in their original editions from Virgin: Hail! Bright Cecilia on disc #45160 and Come ye sons of art on disc #45159 (for some reason, Amazon has these listed under the label EMI).

My last camera (Canon Powershot) took very crisp and well-lit night shots, and didn't have a very long lag between pushing the button and taking the picture.I was very excited when I found this camera online for so cheap and with such perfect reviews.

The author talks about moving back home with her Female Partner, Holly to an old house. This means she is a Lesbian.She has two Lesbian books listed on Amazon and this is a different direction for her I guess. I have read many books and other than this one ,I can not tell you the sex habits of the authors. Anyway , after talking about Coyote and non Coyote things she is finally rewarded with a sighting. Out of 179 pages the total Coyote content is about one chapters worth .She does write about almost everything else. A bad condensation by me of her info is : Coyotes (female)and left over Northern Wolves(male) are mating and producing Big non typical Coyote's that act like neither species.

The first four Road series movies are all here, and they're all delightful to watch. I managed to watch all four of them at one sitting on a cold, snowy Saturday afternoon (WITH popcorn and a Coke!) and enjoyed myself tremendously.

The only study in the book is hardly groundbreaking because it yielded no useful results due to insufficient data. The author even admitted that. Then the author talks about another study involving out-of-body experiences, but can't do it because he has no funding, and that's where the research ends. The book is padded with anecdotal accounts of NDEs that the author received in the mail. That's hardly very scientific. There are terse rehashes of other scientists' work, but again it reads like a way to pad the book because the author has nothing new to add. In two different places, the concept of correlation was mentioned, and it was butchered both times. Don't waste your money if you're interested in science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guess what? Dr. Parnia doesn't know....","review":"This has to be one of the most diappointing books I have read on this subject. Basically, it is a bunch of theories by other researchers that are tossed around in a disorganized fashion (peppered by some anecdotal accounts from people who have experienced NDE's, which was somewhat interesting.) There wasn't even a study completed due to lack of funding, so nothing was ever examined. Very misleading and really a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING THIS BOOK CONTAINS NO RESEARCH","review":"I finished this book tonight with an overwhelming sense that I had just wasted several days reading something that at first seemed so promising... I kept thinking, well there is still 40 pages left I'm sure he will get around to discussing his \\"groundbreaking\\" study .....30 pages .... 20 pages ..... By the last 10 pages I was disgusted. I had been fooled. If you like anecdotal evidence and cute little stories, or if you have ever read a Sylvia Brown book, perhaps you will enjoy this book however, if you are looking for substance and objective research Dr. Sam Parnia would much rather write about his inability to secure the necessary funding to provide you with any. I assure you all of the other critical points made by other reviewers here are absolutely true. The publisher, author and proponents of this book are an embarassment to serious science and the reason why research like this doesn't get funding."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Buildup To... Nothing At All","review":"I was really intrigued when I picked up this book. I mean, who doesn't want to read about what happens when we die? I also read Mary Roach'sSpook: Science Tackles the Afterlifeand found it a tad bit disappointing.The buildup to the doctor's study results is definitely interesting. I like how he described the history of scientific investigations into the afterlife. Unfortunately, there was no real payoff here. The study was limited and he came up with no real conclusions. I would rather the author have written the book AFTER all of his studies were performed, not before. Overall it was a big disapppointment.If you're wondering what happens in the afterlife, Mary Roach's book is a good option to read. For Christians, I also recommend Josh McDowell'sMore Than a Carpenter. If you have a good book that deals with these topics, please comment because I would love to read it too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've read the book and was not impressed. Although there was great promise in the pretense of this book, the author never actually got around to conducting the 'large study' he talks about concerning NDEs and what happens when a person dies. He has some anecdotal stories to tell, but he never reports on any factual findings. All in all it was disappointing, and the authors writing style was amateurish and not very captivating.

Victoria and her family try to survive amid the suffering of the Armenian people during their conflict with the Turks.

The index is extremely frustrating and difficult to use.

All of Jimmy's work is great, but it's always good to see a little bit of the old magic storming into a Beach House on the Moon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mellow Buffett","review":"If you are expecting a typical Buffett CD when you buy this one, forget it. This is a much more mellow Jimmy with only really one typical song in \\"I Will Play for Gumbo.\\" And \\"mathsuks\\" does sort of suck. I'm not sure where that came from. But I was really moved by the title tune which is obviously written for his son Cameron. And most of the others like \\"Spending Money\\" are just nice quiet mellow tunes which feature Jimmy's singing without so much background hoopla. I think it really shows off how his voice has matured over the years. You can preview if you want but I found that I needed to listen to the CD several times before I really appreciated it. And if you don't like the music, then just find the lyrics and read those. They are very poetical."},{"rating":"1","title":"with just the samples heard I hope the rest of cd is better","review":"I'm buying it thru Amazon that way I know I got my money's worth if I'm disapointed.

But on the 3rd and 4th play I found myself really enjoying most of the songs. \\"I Will Play for Gumbo\\" is destined to be one of my all-time favorites.My only concern is that my rating may be premature. After a few more listenings, it may be a 5 star CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd half is terrific","review":"OK, first things first...the track listing on this page is all wrong. Same songs, different order.Having said that, most of the first half of this disc is rather disappointing. \\"Beach House on the Moon\\" is terrific, but tracks two thru five are pedestrian at best. Maybe even bad.The second half is where ths disc really shines, though. Every song here is outstanding. Bubba is back in fine form, even if it's only for half the record. \\"Flesh and Bone\\" is great. \\"Math Suks\\" is hilarious, and Jimmy may even have a hit in \\"I WIll Play for Gumbo.\\" No radio station will ever play it, but that's part of the fun of Jimmy's music anyway.All things condidered...use your skip button wisely, and this is Jimmy Buffett's best album in many, many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best effort of the decade! Jimmy, why did you wait so long?","review":"Like most, I did not know what to think after my first listen. But as I sat in the pool sipping a cold one and gave it three or four more times around I realized this is vintage Buffett. The lyrics are his best in years. The mix of the older Buffett sound and the more recent Banana Wind beat works great. Truly awesome. A decade from now we will look back at BHOTM and call it a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not his best.","review":"It's not classic Buffett, but it is enjoyable to listen to. A good laid back summer listening CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album since Coconut Telegraph","review":"What a welcome return to Jimmy's roots. I have been an avid listener since The summer of 1975.This album brings back memories of the stuff that got me interested in Jimmy in the first place. I think he has really hit the mark with this album. I hope all his fans really give this album a fair chance. Obviously some have been around longer than others, but if you go back to the early albums such as A1A,or Havana daydreamin or High Cumberland Jubilee, you cant help but see the similatities. Great job Jimmy and The Coral Reefers. Looking forward to the show this summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've heard much better from the boys","review":"Hi:First I am a big Buffett fan and have most of his CD's. I am disappointed with this new recording. It's too slow of a tempo in most songs with maybe a few good ones here and there. In fact, I think most of JB's work the last few years fits this pattern. Or, honestly, maybe it's just me. I prefer the uptempo songs that seem to reflect his earlier days. Songs like \\"The Weather is here, wish you were beautiful\\" , \\"Fins\\", or slow songs with meaning like \\"12 Volt Man\\" or \\"Pirate looks at 40\\". JB's latest efforts seem like they were recycled from bits and pieces of these old recordings (if you listen to \\"I will play for Gumbo\\" see if you hear the melody from \\"jolly Man\\" in there. I do. Granted there are a few worthy songs on this CD but nothing that will characterize it as a great cd. But in some odd way I'm happy I bought it. I guess that's why I am a parrothead. Even substandard songs can please us. Thanks,Francis"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kick-off your shoes and relax to this one {-:","review":"I've heard better from Buffett's older CDs, but if you're NOT into hopping on your feet and \\"feeling\\" the groove, it's a great CD to relax too."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best since Changes in Lattitudes.","review":"A vast improvement over past two CDs.

No strong single cut to carry this album through.","review":"As a long time parrothead, I was somewhat dissapointed,if not bored, by the offerings on this album.This was a collection of \\"fill-in\\" tunes without a strong single song to carry the album.A non-exciting collection of Buffet \\"formula\\" songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Buffett","review":"In these ever intensive stress loaded days, Jimmy lets every one know that it really is no big deal.The title track, \\"Beach House On the Moon\\", tells everyone changes will happen, enjoy them and do not let Y2K get to you. I wonder if Jimmy was playing with kids when he wrote \\"Math Suks\\".This song reminds me of things I wish I did not have to do, and the humor in it all, now that I am older."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Buffett music to hit the public.","review":"Found nothing redeeming in this whole CD, in fact gave new CD away to someone else. Sad comment from a life-long Buffett fan who was a fan back when Jimmy cut albums, before the term \\"Parrot Head\\" was \\"coined\\", and who owns everything the guy put on CD or vinyl. This CD's music sounds ominously like what one would hear from some lame old guy in a faded blue polyester suit playing a keyboard and singing in an old Holiday Inn lounge in some run-down town. Not folksy or neat, just sad, stale and a little off-key. Come on Jimmy, get back to your roots and sing and write the kind of songs that got you here. Give it an effort. This CD offers nothing traditional Buffett fans can get their souls around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another boring '90's Buffett Album","review":"As a long time Buffett fan, I once again was suckered into buying an album of his in the '90's hoping (foolishly) it would be a return to form (A1A or Changes in Latitude are IMO his best). Instead, this is merely more of the vapid mutterings of Barometer Soup, Banana Wind, and (yikes) Fruitcakes. While Buffett is a great storyteller, there is none of that here. \\"Math Suks\\" is typically puerile and the title track is almost too difficult to listen to for 6 minutes. \\"Pacing the Cage\\" is a great song, but was done far far better by its originator (Bruce Cockburn). Unless you have enjoyed Jimmy's '90s output, stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst piece of mess since 'Before the Beach'","review":"I was very disappointed in this album.

I listened to it about two or three times before I finally appreciated Jimmy's imagination and wit. The CD is also a great deal of fun with tunes like \\"Flesh and Bone\\" and \\"You call it Jogging\\". A MUST for all Parrotheads!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Start, Decent Finish","review":"As a loyal Parrothead for many years, I was more than excited come May 18th when Jimmy's most recect effort \\"Beach House on the Moon\\" hit the racks. After purchasing it, I ran back to my car in eager anticipation to listen to what I thought was sure to be a wonderful album. What I got instead was many uninspiring tunes including the title track, and a couple Buffet-worthy songs to close out the album.At first I thought, \\"I haven't listened to it enough, I'll warm up to it\\". Well, it's been a good 7 times through already, and I've yet to find myself impressed. A really dissappointing album for me, since I look to Jimmy to keep me warm during the long cold Chicago winters. This effort is just not going to do that. Good thing I've got another 20 plus albums by the man to get me through."},{"rating":"1","title":"We waited 3 years for this?!?!?!?!!?","review":"I have to admit, I have only recently become a Parrothead -- the \\"Banana Wind\\" tour being the first of my 4 concert attendances. \\"Banana Wind\\" is one of the few albums which can make any day better just by listening. With this expectation, I was anxiously awaiting the release of \\"Beach House\\". I don't think I've listened to one complete song on this disc!! I just can't do it!! I found nothing on this disc that would make me want to play it over and over again like most of his previous discs. Please, Jimmy!! Let go of the past and strive for a new and exciting future!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"where are the steel drums?","review":"This album does not have that fun Caribbean style to it. You can't dance and drink that cold beer to this music. There is a lack of the steel drums that brings that fun summer sound to buffett's music.

I hope that Jimmy does not end his carrer with this bed time story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffett's Beach House is a place where I wanna be.","review":"Jimmy Buffett's new album strays away from his beach bum, carribean flavor he's used for so many years, but that's ok....in fact it's better than ok. This album is amazing. The song writing is insurpassable and the feeling and pure bliss of this album will go straight to your heart.It uses a hugely wide variety of tunes, from the poignant \\"Pacing the Cage\\" to the very personal \\"Beach House on the Moon\\" to the rocking \\"I Will Play for Gumbo\\" This album wails. Be ready for an experience or a journey rather to that Beach House on the Moon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contractual obligation","review":"This must be a disc done as part of an agreement with his record company. I have been a Buffett fan since day one. This disc displays no emotion or typical Buffett atmosphere.There is no enthusiasm in any of the songs. It appears the great music has no powerful vocals. Any individual with no emotion or enthusiam could read the lyrics as well as Mr. Buffett does in this disc. I am sorry to say this does not deserve being in any catagory with past Buffett music. This one belongs in a recycle bin with all the other boring AM groups with no musical quality, just those in it for the buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where has Bubba gone?","review":"Sorry, This one, to me, may be his worst effort ever. Everyone can say that jimmy is now introspective and contemplative if they want. The truth of the matter is Jimmy has legions of fans because all of his old tunes were simple, rythmic songs you could hum along with. His music used to be repeating structures that the meaningful (or silly) lyrics rhymed their way through. With this album you need to have a masters degree from Juliard to appreciate the constant melody changes in songs like BHOM. The closest Buffett comes to his old greatness on this album is his version of \\"You call it Jogging\\" Buffett is not Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, or Paul Simon. If he were you wouldn't see PARROTHEADS at his shows. I've haven't missed an Atlanta show in 21 years. Don't plan on missing any future one's either. Hey even Ali had a bad fight or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"more guitar, less steeldrums","review":"I sat and listened to this album intently, soaking in every word and note. Jimmy's voice is strong and sounds much like it used to. \\" Lucky Stars \\" is a GREAT song as well as \\" Pacing the Cage\\", \\" I Will Play for Gumbo\\", and \\" Flesh and Bone\\" I thought it was refreshing in a time when music all sounds the same, JIMMY BUFFETT RULES!!!!!

I was so sad. I had waitied for this for so long. I feel he just does not have his heart in this any longer. He is not good at coasting... sure wish we had the old Jimmy back... Perhaps he should have spent more time working on songs, than writing in his diary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply disappointing.","review":"I hate to say it. It hurts me deep down inside to do so. But this CD is weak. Just plain weak. There is no song that just jumps out and shakes you up. There is no song to make you excited that summer is just around the corner. Maybe I haven't listened to it enough, but I just don't see this CD growing on me anytime soon. I can honestly say that there is not a single song on here that I like better than any of his previous efforts. Anyway, if you're looking for a CD to really put you in the mood for fun in the sun, pick up an earlier release. This is certainly not a return to an earlier Buffett sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimmy iz the best","review":"HEY all you people who call yourselfs true parrot heads need to step back cool down and listin to the CD agian cause it is good.

I mentioned this to a fellow Buffett fan and he acted like it was sacreligious to think this way! Sorry, but the writing is not there. The only 2 songs I really like \\"Pacing the Cage\\" and \\"Running around\\" were not even written by Jimmy. Hell even at the concert this year, Southern Cross (also another cover) was the best. Jimmy......Time to get back to your roots! I bought this CD \\"tracks unheard\\" as I normally do and am dissapointed to say the least. Head back to 'Bama.... some island....or even New Orleans... but try to remember where it is that you pulled all that great music out of!

Not a bad album mind you, just lackluster when compared to his other attempts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. This album should be a frisbee.","review":"Let's see: One of the \\"songs\\" on this album is titled, \\"Math Sucks\\" and it is complete with strings and a womens' chorus that intones, \\"Math sucks the big one\\" throughout every refrain.I have no idea how or why this album was made or why anybody who knew its contents would buy it. This \\"music\\" is clearly banned by the Geneva Convention as cruel and unusual punnishment. I'd rather stick my head in a 55 gallon drum and have the entire UCLA marching band kick it rather than hear ANY song from this album again.

This album is so boring and full of itself that I couldn't get through a single song. Even after months of trying to convince myself that I must give it \\"one more chance,\\" I just can't get into it. I've been listening to Jimmy for over 20 years and this album pales in comparison to the early stuff (heck, even the middle and late stuff)! Not only am I getting old, but I guess Jimmy is, too. My advice: save your money and leave \\"Changes in Latitude, Changes in Attitude\\" in the CD player for another spin. You won't miss a thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Emperor Buffett has no clothes","review":"Let's be honest here. Buffett has been spewing out total garbage since \\"Fruitcakes\\". I am ashamed to say that I bought this, as well as \\"Barometer Soup\\" and \\"Banana Wind\\" hoping to get some decent music from the man. The album and song titles are catchy, but the songs sound like total Muzak drivel now. He peaked in the '70's, put out some decent material in the '80's, but that's about it for Bubba. I'm glad for sites like this so I can listen to tracks before I decide to buy. Jimmy, you've won't be getting any more of my hard earned money putting out junk like this. Of course you could put out anything and like sheep, Parrotheads would snatch it up and proclaim it the best thing since sliced bread. Which is exactly what has been bringing home the bacon for JB in the '90's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh-What happened to Jimmy!","review":"I bought this latest release sound unheard. I won't do that again. IMHO, I think his music has been going downhill and getting more contract obligated (like his book, Pirate looks at Fifty) for last three or so releases. Barometer and Banana had a several good tracks, but nothing like the stuff that made us all Buffett fans to begin with. Didn't think it could get any worse after Fruitcakes. I was wrong. I know he is getting older (like the rest of us) and his music will change, but like this! Bad music, and even worse lyrics. If it wasn't for \\"I will play for Gumbo\\" I would have given this turkey one star. Save the cash, get one of pre 90s releases if you don't have them already.

Note that the GSM networks don't require an external antenna and also those phones are typically smaller and lighter as well.Which brings me to my final point-this RAZR V3c isn't even the same size as the GSM RAZR, it's larger and heavier!

But when I got the CD I was completely dissapointed. It may be because all the past BW kids albums, with the exception to the christmas one, was far FAR superior to any other albums featuring kids singing, but this one was just horrible. I don't understand why these talented kids resorted to singing recycled pop songs when there are so many other broadway hits out there. Aside from the song selection, the kids don't have that sound they usually have, the \\"singing their heart out\\" sound. Also that shulman guy has got to just move on, \\"this I promise you\\" is the most horrible song on this.I did however give it 2 stars because my 8 year old sister likes this CD a little bit and the BW kids do cater towards kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Letdown-Do Not Buy This CD!","review":"Not what I was going to expect out of these wonderous kids...oh man...it sounded pathetic and kidsy,un-like their other superb CDs.

If I had wanted to hear kid singing pop songs poorly, I would have bought Kidz Bop. The whole point of Broadway Kids is that they sing BROADWAY! The \\"Broadway Kids\\" do NOT have pop voices. It is truly unbearable to listen to, with the exception of Bouncing Off the Ceiling, which is really cute. But Michael Shulman simply MUST stop recording with them!

The acting is virtually non-existent; the plot is predictable; the special effects are laughable. Don't waste your time or money on this.OK we have an evil corporation and a bunch of clueless (and not particularly likable) characters with a couple of marauding monsters who tear people apart, but only some people. We have a simple mystery about a missing Mars Base One, and we have a lot of film shot in a gravel pit with a red filter over the lens.This film is about as low budget as it gets.

The world of space horror has crashed and burned in recent years, and this is just more proof of that. The last really good one was \\"Event Horizon\\" from the late 90's. If you want a good Space Horror Flick go watch it. Or Pitch Black, or Galaxy of Terror, or Horror Planet, or one of the Alein Movies. Anything is better than this load of crap.

First and foremost, the recipes taste great! Secondly, and nearly as important, is that they don't require an inordinate amount of time to prepare -- the recipes are streamlined more than in other cookbooks. Third, I like the writing style and the author's practical serving suggestions and food combinations. I am not Indian and therefore I don't dare speak to the \\"authenticity\\" of the recipes, but frankly I don't think it matters, either. The point is that these recipes taste good and they'll remind you of your favorite Indian restaurant's cuisine, but they're do-able in your own home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exotic Weeknight Cooking","review":"I can't look through this book without finding something new I want to make. There are no pictures, but the recipes are simple, interesting, fast, healthy and taste good. It's perfect for those Monday nights when you don't have a lot of time or energy, but want something more interesting than meatloaf. And for most recipes--if you're afraid of spicy food--just leave out the chili powder.A lot of recipes do require exotic ingredients. Many can be found in Whole Foods, but not all. You won't be able to replicate the food from your favorite Indian restaurant, but the flavour profile is similar. I highly recommend the Kulfi, and the Indian Mashed potato salad. I also really really liked the curry leaf spice rub sandwhiches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would anyone buy this book ?","review":"This is one of the worst Indian cooking books I have read. ... The recipes are hardly Indian in terms of names or even how they are cooked. Example is a recipe of turkey. Indians don't eat turkey and if you were to go to India and ask for the dish that the author mentions, the people will think you are crazy. This book kind of gives bad name to Indian cooking.

The recipes are clearly written and easy to create, but the end results are so delicious & elegant that one would think they had taken hours to prepare.

The problem is that if you purchase most of your media from iTunes this device is a $200 dust collector, because it can't play your iTunes media. You would think that they would have had the foresight to find a way to make the unit work with this media. Even the USB port on the device didn't allow a direct connect to an iPod.It was also pretty slow to recognize commands from the supplied remote and the connection to the wireless network was unstable at times - despite an excellent signal on our laptops from the same location.Overall, I was VERY disappointed but look forward to future revisions and product enhancements because I think the concept is fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad experiecne","review":"I expected to use USB interface to load photos and videos.

That's ok. I can deal with that. However, the help for getting a connection to your wireless networks (both the on line help and on the phone help, mind you) was useless.

Tversity, a separate product, improves the 520. It allows you to stream content from the Internet. Hulu is what I was really interested in. But the codecs in the 520 are so out of date that Hulu refuses to stream. Another disappointment:I have an mt-daap server sitting right next to the thing and it can't see it/doesn't know anything about it. So, in summary, I'd say that the Media Lounge would be a good fit for someone who really doesn't want it to do anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product with few drawbacks","review":"I really like this product, it does exactly what you need it to do: stream videos to your TV, and it does it very well. If you have any problems with a missing codec just convert to DivX and it works fine.It also connects to the Internet on its own without needing your computer to be turned on, but it only streams radio when you do that.

To make a long story short, I eventually bought a second one.The good:It streams video even on 802.11b, at sharp resolution.The bad:If the signal is too low, it may stop the streaming, and recovery is somewhat painful.You have to choose between fast forward (a very slow one) and search (painfully providing the exact time to skip to). I guess it has something to do with copyright, but it is still beyond my understanding why you cannot have them both, as they are assigned to different buttons.It works well only with D-Link media server, and oly with the latest version. I believe this version is the last one (they move to ActiveTV) so don't expect to get support for new filetypes.Bottom line:This list of bads is long, only because this device is so useful.

I've installed the newest firmware, but that hasn't fixed anything. Customer support assumes that I'm an idiot and that it's my fault that the media player isn't working right.

However, upon receiving it, I started using it and was very disappointed. The player is very slow connecting to your network, and then loses the connection every once in a while just for the heck of it. The user interface is somewhat confusing and is slow to respond to remote commands. Also, the little blue light on the front that indicates network transmission is a very bright blue, thats gets annoying after a few minutes. A piece of electrical tape to cover it is a must. I purchased this to take the place of my XBOX 360's media playback functions. It was once I recieved this player that I realized just how good the XBOX 360's media functions were.

I am disappointed that Dlink has not fixed these problems in the DSM-520, which I was considering buying, but have decided to hold off on until they fix the serious shortcomings. I am sorry to say that poor quality seems to be on the rise, especially with regard to devices that have a large software component, like the DSM-520. For example, I bought an HP iPAQ hx4700, a top of the line PDA. It had many software problems until I upgraded the firmware - AND it took a very long time for HP to provide the fixes.

The layout is awful, and the most used buttons are very small and grouped closely and incoherently.3. File names, on the screen the 520 truncates filenames to about 31 characters.

So, we got the newer model (DSM-520) to put in our gameroom. It works even better. It supports more file types, the interface is similar to the first but with more style. It is still really easy to use and to set-up. After downloading the newest firmware, it took a few minutes to have it up and running.

I prefer strong character development and actual romance to heaving bosoms and inappropriate-for-time-period morals, so this is right up my alley.Betty Neels has written many doctor-nurse romances (or doctor-typist, in this case). Charity is a typist at a hospital who is hired by Dr. Wyllie-Lyons, a reserved and gentlemanly doctor. While working for him, they fall in love and enjoy a gentle, old-fashioned courtship. While Charity is a bit too much of a dependent character for my tastes, the book is still very cute. The characters could be a bit stronger, but overall this book was a fun way to pass an afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Groan","review":"Try to find a laugh in this film. I dare you. It's a tribute to the sappiness of the 1950s (otherwise a healthy and much missed era) that this sort of thing could be a box office smash. Poor Donald O'Connor. While he's making Singing In The Rain, he's stuck in this Universal \\"B\\" series that must have embarrassed him as much as it now embarrasses the rest of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best season ever !!!!!","review":"this season is awsome i like the whole series there are so many great episodes i the other seasons but this season has alot of great episodes like : the return of chef , cartoon wars part 1 + 2 , make love not warcraft , go god go 1 and 2 , tsst all these are great episodes and i liked the warcraft episode more than all of the others it doesn't have much comedy but the story maid me lose track of time , i can say on thing only south park still rules."},{"rating":"2","title":"South park vs Family Guy","review":"South Park makes fun of things that matter. When anything is so BIG that one can not poke fun at it. Then it is to big for anyones good. Family Guy tagets B-List stars from the 80's. I'm not scared of the 80's. While Family Guy is fun. I would rather poke fun at my fears. Fear not to poke fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOUTH PARK TENTH","review":"This is one of the better season of South Park, for the most part the series has gotten better as the seasons go on. This season has two of the best episodes of South Park, which makes it worth the purchase just for that. The episode with Cartman playing the Bounty Hunter Dog..as a hall monitor, I can't articulate just how funny it is, but trust me..it's classic. The other great one is the one when the boys are trying to get rid of a character that infultrated their video game, I laughed so hard as they got fatter and fatter in the process. Im sure if your a fan of the show you know you can watch all the episodes for free online..but if your just wanting to have a season of the show, this a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumped shark","review":"When it comes to my South Park DVD collection, I stopped with season 9. I loved the ep with the dog whisperer, and the wii and hybrid car episodes were okay, but the other ones were pretty lame. I have never been a big fan of towlie.I don't know what people saw in the video game episode...I thought it was one of the worst episodes the show has ever done. IT WAS SO BORING. Like 6 other shows have done an episode with the very same premise, which was not even interesting the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Judging by the other reviews here, I guess I'm in the minority here, but I must say: This is most the disappointing season of South Park ever. For the record, I own seasons one through nine on DVD. Several of those I bought without first viewing the seasons in their entirety, just because I had faith that most, if not all, of the episodes would be entertaining.Alas, my luck didn't hold out. Nearly all of these episodes elicited far less laughter than those from previous seasons. Some were downright lame and/or boring, lacking much of the wit and intelligent political commentary I've come to appreciate from South Park. The notable exception is the now-classic World of Warcraft episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider yourself a sucker...","review":"...if you purchased this. You can watch every episode streaming, free, and complete on the official South Park website. If you want to purchase them, go out and buy the seasons on dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"South Park Sidetracked","review":"I'm a huge fan of South Park. The offensiveness of the show is funny, not offensive because they are equal-opportunity offenders: they are cruel and offensive to EVERYONE.But season 10 is South Park off-kilter. The show is very in-the-moment political and knee-jerk reactionary in almost every episode. In the commentary they even admit this: they were too focused on polarized politicism and responding to criticism.It has its moments, but overall it's a very poor representation of the series. To paraphrase, stealing from The Simpsons, \\"Worst Season Ever.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Hi-f**kin-larious","review":"Plain and simple, its South Park. You either love it or you hate it. This season had some great episodes. One of my favorites being the 'World of Warcraft' episode as my boyfriend plays the game (and I bought this DvD for him) and its just so funny, and sadly so true. These are episodes you can watch again and again. Classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Awesome Season!!!","review":"This season is not as good as other seasons, but it's still alright. One of my favorite episodes is when it's HALLOWEEN and Satan is throwing a big Sweet Sixteen party and acts like a spoiled rich teenager. Also Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny deal with the death of their friend Chef, stop Manbearpig, try to get a Family Guy episode pulled, defeat a nerdy gamer on World of Warcraft, and stop Ike from having sexual relations with his smokin' hot teacher. (Nice!) All this and more happen in SOUTH PARK: THE COMPLETE 10TH SEASON!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just keeps getting better..","review":"Like every one of its previous 9 seasons (released on DVD), Season 10 doesn't fail to deliver the ultimate in politically incorrect but oh so relevant satire. The subjects are becoming, if not even more taboo, then at least more linked to the pulse of some of modern society's most important issues. All this delivered in a side-splitting package of laughter and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"South Park","review":"If you like South Park then buy this.

Perhaps it was too political for my tastes, or the fact that is skewered more to right wing arguments (no hybrid cars, anti-evolution, a lame Gore joke, etc) but it seemed a lot more juvenile than its previous incarnations. Some of the episodes were funny like the Dog Whisperer and killer gamer ones, but for the most part, this season was just off."},{"rating":"1","title":"South Park Season 10 dvd set review","review":"South park crossed the line in season 10. I was vomiting after every episode. one of the worst seasons for South Park or any show for that matter ever. Even the \\"warcraft\\" episode was in bad taste in my eyes. It saids that sitting around the house playing some dumb game that many will forget in a couple of years is more important then going outside and bring active and the hybird car episode,they say that black clouds are caused by men & woman acting like jerks. the worst parts are a baby making love to a fully grown female adult teacher and fully grown male adult hockey players beating up little 4 to 5 year old kids. What jerks!! I give this set a -0 out of 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"HILARIOUS","review":"This episode and the one before it are hilarious.

I was expecting some wonderful sex scenes- the book had such a great premise! The story was a laborious task to get through, because the author was way too concerned with the main character's mental exploits than her physical ones. what a sham!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"The mark of a good novel is its ability to expand your mind while entertaining and teaching you. This book stands up to all three of those conditions very well. Entertaining, very. Captivating and definitely a page-turner. Lots of drama, for those of us who enjoy it, sexuality, some humor, well-written. Educational in its examination of Indian culture. Thought-provoking through its exploration of sexuality in its many forms. I found myself less than sympathetic toward the protagonist, and it was sometimes to the point where I disliked her. However, we can learn a lot more from those different to us than we can from those who are the same. The ideas presented in this book were quite insightful. A great coming-of-age tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite Lolita, but still quite good","review":"I recently finished Babyji by Abha Dawesar. The review snippit on the front cover starts out, \\"If Lolita had grown up in India...\\" And I suppose that's a fair asumption. I love Nabokov, so I figured, why not? The heroine in this book, although young does not equate herself with Lolita and niether do I. She equates herself more with Humphrey. I don't know if I'd agree with that, but she does seem much more on the ball than Lolita. She's a very intelligent girl who through out the course of the book, becomes aware and quite comfortable with her sexuality. I don't know if I would call this a \\"coming of age\\" story, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sweet ride","review":"Babyji is an engaging book. The main character was fascinating to me. She had such assurance, and yet she's still young and discovering so much about herself. I appreciated the setting of the book, and learning more about modern-day India. And the sex! It's a bold book, in many ways. Definitely recommended.Verge"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not a page turner","review":"I bought this book with great anticipation; I was greatly disappointed. Someone said earlier that the book seems like a slice of the character's life with no ups and downs. That's true. There is no climax, no story line that grips you.At some points I was irritated by the number of times people called the character 'mature' when there was nothing to show to the readers that she was mature.The idea of story is good- sex in the mind of an Indian lesbian teenager. It is just not well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Have not read the book yet, but looking over it it looks amazing!

Encouraging and uplifting, this book will strengthen your faith in God and give you a comfort with the reality of the Holy Spirit's ministry in our lives. As you read the miraculous events portrayed in this book, it is clear to you that what is being described is not only factual, but absolutely divine. God \\"showed up\\" to bless his \\"little ones\\", just as He is apt to do. Read this if you can find a copy! My walk with God was tentative as a new believer, until I read this book. Today I am a pastor, in large measure, I believe, because of the influence of this single volume of Holy Spirit inspired writing at the right moment in my early walk with God. It was as a result of this book that I found myself able to truly experience God firsthand.

Unfortunately this book falls far short of that standard. While it's good to have a single source for basic information it offers little else.

She does a great job of moving reader through process of the creation of a \\"mood\\" that is related to light. Most of her examples involve fruit, flowers, and ceramics. If this is your interest, you will find the book helpful. If you are interested in landscapes or more unorthodox subjects I believe you will feel the book is too limiting. The first 31 of 126 pages is dedicted to materials, photography, and composition. For a beginning colored pencil artist this may be very helpful section. For advanced artists, you will probably skip over this section. I liked the book since it contains interesting techniques and a good message -paint what you like (what inspires you) and have fun at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very inspiring book!","review":"Very happy with the purchase, so far it is my best book about colored pencils & techniques, easy-to-follow instructions, helpful tips, brilliant demonstrations to inspire begginers & more experienced artists alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Book","review":"All I can say is wow.

I had read many others before, so the section on Holdem was difficult to sit through. I did learn a lot about Omaha Hi/Lo, Razz, 7-Card Stud, and Stud Hi/Lo. Those sections were a great start. The first time ever playing those games online...

The style of play illustrated is much too aggressive for the average player especially at a low-limit table where many players will stay to see the flop regardless of what they're holding. It does, however, contain some interesting stories about Phil's own exploits. If you want to learn more about Phil Hellmuth, this is a good book. If you want to learn to play poker, there are many better reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Play poker like the clueless","review":"The only reason why I rate this book 2 stars and not 1 is because by reading this book you will know how the clueless tight player -the one who has no idea about how to adjust its style depending of situations- play his hands. If you follow all the instructions given in this book regardless of the type of game you're playing in (tight, typical, loose) it will completely destroy your bankroll. Phil Hellmuth is a great player - no doubt about it. But what an awful teacher. I actually suspect him to have written this book just to confuse his opponents on the poker tour, and make a couple of bucks (sales) along the way. However if you like to read stories about a big mouth with a big ego who does nothing but brag about his good shots and never say a word about his bad sessions and bad decisions then, without the shadow of a doubt, this book is for you.

While there are some good tips in the book, it is poorly written. The subject matter jumps around and Phil constantly refers to a sixth sense you are already supposed to have. I especially like the section on how to beat Internet people by watching their body language.Primarily this is a book about gambling by emotion, and not by measuring the odds or tactic. You might want to watch the World Series of Poker and look how losing situations are handled. (I've seen Mr. Heartmouth actually patronize a guy for winning and being happy about it.)

Go grab Doyle's Supersytem and you'll see things differently than you did before (assuming you're a begineer). If you've been playing for a while then this book even becomes a bigger waste of money. STAY AWAY from this book. waste of money.

In fact, it is all but worthless but to the most inexperienced player (someone who has never played). Even for the inexperienced,however, there are much better books on the topic. I highly suggest buying super systems 2, whether you are a beginner or an experienced player. Super System 2 is well worth the money.

His temper is probably the only thing keeping him from being a real factor in any game he plays.This book is great for beginners because it provides the bare basics for each of the popular games in a very easy to follow format. His advice is concise and understandable, making this book a quick way to get you started right in poker.For people with a good hold on the fundamentals, there are better books. This one really stops at basic strategy and you have to pick it up from there.

I've been playing poker for about nine years now and I know a good poker book when I see one. This is not one of those books. Phil probably wrote the book to market his ego and not his knowledge. He saw other greats defining themselves in the literature realm and decided he was going to do the same. His book lacks proper play with a lot of garbage telling you, \\"dont play it this way unless your really good.\\" If I wanted that advice, I would have read a book written by dead money.

It's similar to a book from the \\"idiot's guide\\" series. A lot of fluff and very little substance.

However as I started using his advanced strategy's I found it was a little outside of my style. If you don't have the discipline to sit down and play poker for quite a while (and fold the majority of the cards dealt to you) in the beginning stages of your game, leave this book alone it may drive you mad to toss away hands you normally play.

But if you dig Helmuth, I guess you could justifiably spend your cash on this book instead of at the table. I wouldn't though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A legend In His On Mind","review":"There is nothing new here in this book. Mostly play tight and raise often. Spends more time telling us about how great he is and less time giving any real insite into how to \\"PLAY LIKE THE PROS\\". He jumps back and forth too much and even forgets what situation he is refering to on occasions. In one part of his examples, Phil has you playing poker on the internet with a pair of jacks in the hole. His opponent, Jerry,checks. But, if Jerry does bet, then you must,\\"look for body language that might show confidence or fear\\". How can I check for body language when I\`m playing over the net? Phil spends too much time having you develop your instincts rather than giving sound poker advice. A waste of money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Do NOT buy this book. I made that mistake but you don't need to!This book doesn't really teach you anything significant. Phil talks about how much he has won and how good he is and shows you some animal pictures sitting at a internet poker table. Then on the next line he says that you should read the other players body language. Over the internet?! He doesn't even know what he's talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I started playing poker about 6 months ago, and decided to buy this book to learn some new strategies. I am very disappointed with the book. Yes, Phil likes to compliment himself quite a bit, but that is not what bothers me about the book. I like to play No Limit Hold'em and Phil barely talks about this game in the book! It is the most popular game out there right now, and he mainly talks about Limit Hold'em.I mainly play tournament games, and he had a whole chapter on Limit Hold'em tournament strategy, but NO information on No Limit Hold'em tournament strategy! I feel like I just completely wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing, Phil","review":"I am a beginner/intermediate player, who sometimes challenges online poker and live league. It was my first book from amazon and regret to say - it is worth absolutely nothing. Author instead of giving clues is talking about how great he is.He advised to play only 10 hands - pairs from aces to sevens and AK and AQ. Without any logical explanation what to do next everyone can give such advices. Even I, myself can tell : \\"folks play Aces and Kings, AK, AQ and be aggressive\\".The book is in fact very bad, cannot be recommended for any beginner and i am sure professional players only laugh when they see this product. Reading stories about Hellmuth\`s life you will never play like pro, only lose money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Feathers, but No Meat.","review":"A book that is more about self promotion than about teaching, it is poorly written in many parts and has no continuity. There are many other MUCH more intelligent and informative books available. Skip this one as it can't possibly teach you what makes Phil Helmuth a great poker player, his ability to read his opponents.Clearly fold this one preflop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't pad Phil's bankroll.","review":"If you've got the credits that Phil Helmuth has, then you've every right to write a book. I just figured it should be good. Great player, horrible teacher. The one thing i learned from Phil is to be a total jerk at the table. Ask how many chips a player has, feint at huge bets by grabbing larger stacks of chips then betting less, and take your time. I learned all that from watching him on ESPN, and nothing from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Another Book...","review":"I am looking for a new one. I was slightly better than my poker group of friends and nothings changed since I have read this book. I hope I find something a little better next time I buy a poker book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book... would like a little more.","review":"World Champion poker player Phil Helmuth is a great author and this book \\"Play Poker Like the Pros\\" is very clearly written. I have read it about 3 times now... it is not boring by any means. Don't expect it to make you play like a pro though, you need a lot of practice and need to read more than this one book! Anyways, above all, i think it is a really good book and I recommend it... the only thing i would like to see is a little more... it doesn't go in depth very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Book for the Starter.","review":"First off, like many of you here it sure is funny to watch Phil lose. Now that being said I read the novice and intermediate chapters before I got in my first Live Tournament ($50 dollar buy-in, 49 players) and I Took 3rd place ($200). So I can say that this book paid for it self. I think its a good book with easy strategy to follow and I would recomend this book to the beginers, seeing thats me, a beginer. thanks Phil for giving me $200 return on my $15 investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Worthless guide to NL Hold'em","review":"This is useful for limit poker but worthless as a guide to NL games. He spends less than 30 pages on NL and more than 150 on limit -- a hugely disproportionate volume of information. This is a primer for beginners only. Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"its a good book","review":"Phil's book was the first poker book I had purchased when I began playing poker at a more competitive level. Prior to reading this book, I had failed at the lowest levels of poker in both limit and no limit play. I studied his book and my winnings increased almost 300% within a few weeks. His general principals and guidlines are just that and need to be implemented in your own style of play. This book is not meant to be the sole guide to your game, however is defineately very useful and easy to read for the beginning player. Phil is a world class poker player and has had much success in his life at the table. We don't have to like him, but I don't have to like people to be able to learn from them either. His style is much like mine and I wouldn't be at the level I am at had I not purchased his book. I've certainly added to my collection as my game has improved but this is the perfect book for beginning players."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phil does it again!","review":"I have read a number of poker books, and this was easily one of the worse I have encountered. The book was filled with generalities and vagaries. Phil's advice almost always ended with a statement like \\"the best way is to play that situation is by feel\\" - great advice if you are Phil Helmuth... not so great if you are a beginner. In addition to Phil shamelessly touted his website and online poker room, every single example or anecdote tells about how great Phil. He certainly does love to hear himself talk and even though the book is a terrible \\"How to win\\" book, it does give some insight into the mind and ego of Mr. Helmuth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but not for beginners who want to learn poker","review":"Phil Hellmuth is my favorite player to watch, and since he's from my town I thought I'd read his book to hear his views on poker. I thought the book had a good mix of his first hand examples and poker strategy. Overall, a fun book with a pretty simple strategy for all types of players."},{"rating":"1","title":"POKER STATEGY OR EGO TRIP","review":"Poorly written book. I'm an intermediate player. Have read a few books on low-limit / mid-limit holdem. Save your money and buy Winning Low Limit by Lee Jones.Phil's book, when he isn't plugging ultimate bet, he is plugging himself. Plus, his writing style is unorganized. Most chapters are filled examples of him versus the world, etc (of course, every example he won). Should be called Phil Helmuth's Home Movies"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don\`t waste your money","review":"This book is a waste of time and money. There are many other books, even for the absolute begginer, that are better. Hellmute is a great player but lousey author and teacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do better","review":"There are a few good points in this book, but the writing style is absolutely horrific (did they even use an editor?), and I just can't believe that many of these pointers would ever work in low- to mid-limit hold-em games. Nevertheless, some reviewers here have said that they've used these techniques with success, so more power to them. If you already have a number of poker books (Sklansky, Brunson, Cloutier, etc.), and already have a solid knowledge of poker, then you might want to borrow - NOT BUY - this book for some light reading. On the other hand, if this is the only book you ever read, then you're welcome to play with me any time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"Phil Helmuth is probably the best poker player in the world today, however, this book won't put you on that same level. This book has been hyped everywhere in the poker world, but I found it to be way too superficial. Yes, there are some good plays shown within the book, however, Phil gives you no explanation as to why they are good plays. If you want a good poker book to explain the plays and why to make them, buy Slanksy and Malmuth's \\"Hold'em for Advanced Players.\\" It is by far a superior book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New Here","review":"I have read a bunch of poker books and play regularly. There are a lot of good books out there, Dan Harrington's the very best, but this isnt one of them. Too much ego here and not enough helpful information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somehow I knew it would be useless","review":"I suppose this is a good book for someone who is just learning how to play poker. I didn't have much faith in the book when I purchased it. It's cheaper than alot of poker books, so I figured Hellmuth would at least share a couple of good nuggets of information. If you have never played poker and want to learn the rules of the game, and starting hand strengths, you will benefit from this book. If you're a thinking player looking for insights from others, look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe read this as a first book, but probably not at all","review":"I don't find anything of unique value in this book. It has some decent material, but nothing you can't find in greater detail elsewhere. Phil does not even cover pot odds here, but seems to find plenty of time to tell us all about his famous tournament moments. As a beginner, I found Lee Jone's Winning Low-Limit Texas Holdem much more helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful book","review":"This is a wonderful guide if you are looking for a way to lose your shirt playing poker. Just want to dump money at the table? Follow everything you read in this book like it's the gospel. When I first got into playing I followed Hellmuth because I thought he was a great player and was constantly abused at the table. I finally sat back and evaluated my play objectively and discovered the moves Hellmuth advised just weren't logical.Go read Harrington on anything. Use this book as firestarter as it's not weighty enough to be a doorstop."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, does not deserve the negative reviews","review":"It's just a good book for beginners and if you stick to what is said in the books you do well online. It's informative, nicely written and fun to read. Don't really get the negative reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great book","review":"This book would be fine for a beginner poker player that wants some insight into how a legend of the game thinks. It does not teach you how to play poker like the pros. It also is poorly written so it isn't a \\"fun\\" read."},{"rating":"1","title":"World's Greatest Player: Just Ask Him","review":"While there is seldom an ego shortage among the great no limit players, this is one TV star who must have an unlimited budget for mirrors. Soaring like an eagle, says Phil, is the way you want to picture yourself at the poker table. Super image as long as you are playing no limit hold'em, you've got some people at the table who don't know you for the windbag bluffer that you are, and you have cards landing that help the hopeless rags you tend to start with. The book is short on common sense, long on philosophical nonsense and way too lean on anecdotes. Write a book about bluffing for a million dollars without soiling yourself, Phil. That one I'll buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hellmuth Will Help New Players!!!!!","review":"I feel that Phil Hellmuth's book will help new players learn the basics of poker and give them strategies that they may consider using in live games. Hellmuth's book will not be of much use to advanced players, but it is a good place to start if you are just learning the game or if you have just played for fun in the past and want to improve your overall understanding of the game. I think that Phil Helmuth did a great job on this book and it should be read by any aspiring poker player."},{"rating":"2","title":"a mixture of hellmuth's personal expierence/advice on poker","review":"This book is not a \\"how-to\\" in any sense of the word. Its not a book like \\"winning low-limit holdem'\\" or \\"Holdem' for the advanced player\\". Phil gives a certain approach (His own personal approach, for the most part) and gives sound advice on playing the hand from there. He explains tells, slowplaying, and even bluffing in a basic way that any level of poker player can understand. He even has a section on No Limit Poker, which I personally liked the best. He tells the reader about some hands that he played himself to either victory or defeat. You basically cannot go wrong if you buy this book, it's both informative and entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hold'em & Stud Poker Book","review":"This is an excellent book and an enjoyable read. However, when I think of Phil it's his expertise in reading his opponents that I most admire. Unfortunately, while he mentions the importance of this skill throughout his book and states that this skill can be learned by anyone, there is little content about this aspect of the game. Of course there are many other books covering the psychology of poker, common tells, etc., but I was very interested in Phil's insights.Though I'm just an amateur and use the Wilson Tournament Hold'Em software for practice, I've already observed improvements in my hold'em game. My tournament statistics and earnings with the Wilson software improved dramatically by applying the concepts within this book. I'll be in a couple games this weekend and look forward to seeing how my opponents react to my revised image."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hellmuth Loves Hellmuth","review":"There may be some usefull tips in this book, but it mainly serves as Hellmuth's ode to his massive ego."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"The first time I ordered it I had pressed audible books so I thought the entire page was audible,but found out when I got the book it was a regular book. My bad but not happy. Then I went back and ordered it through you I believe and had to go through audible.com to purchase it. When I did I selected that I wanted to download it to CD. But after the purchase as far as I could tell it never gave me that option and only let me download using itunes. Oh Well. As far as the product itself . I think it is really good. I had heard it previously through my local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK FOR BEGINNERS / NOT FOR THE ADVANCED","review":"This book starts from the VERY beginning and explains things clearly; it assumes you know nothing about Hold 'Em, so it's an excellent book for someone who has never played before. Intermediate or advanced players should already be familiar with the information presented here. ** for I/A players, but ***** for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to go Phil... You blew it.","review":"This book has very little quality content. There isn't much revealed here that isn't found in virtually every other poker book out there. If you have read any poker books at all, don't bother. In fact even if you haven't read any poker books, don't bother. There are far better books out there.I read the Holdem' section and was left with a feeling that I had been robbed.Look at Phil Gordon's books and pair them up with Doyle Brunson's Super System if you are serious. Phil Gordon provides a solid playing style while Doyle's books provide the details behind the decisions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phil is Great","review":"Yes he's great. He wins alot and is possibly one of the best Hold'em players of all time. I dont know if he did it on purpose but he basically tells you just enough that you understand he can do it but he doesnt offer any help on 'how' to do it. I think maybe he doesnt want to actually help anyone get better at poker. He just wants to advertise he's awesome.He says things like \\"then you have to figure out how to win the most money\\" after building up a whole story of a hand that you are going to win.Sklansky and Harrington books tell you HOW to get the most money into the pot when you are going to win."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time.","review":"If you are interested in improving your poker game, then do not get this book!I found this book to be a complete waste of time. The majority of the book was Phil trying to inflate is already large ego.The basis of Phil's book is to only play the top 10 hands. In his opinion you'll win more than you'll learn. But in reality within a few hours everyone will have pinned you on what you play and you'll get no action when you do go in.Phil advises you to be \\"tight and aggressive\\", but gives nothing to demonstrate how you should do this. He gives little information on post flop play and practically ignores fourth and fifth street play.I found virtually nothing useful in this book. My advice is do not buy this book!! You'll only be sorry you did.Try any of David Sklansky's books instead, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was really looking forward to this book and have to say I have been rather disapointed with it. There is little that is new, interesting of even accurate in this book. The player types are well known to all experienced players, just named after animals in this case. He does introduce a new type, the \\"eagle\\" or expert, which did intrigue me but says \\"Learning to play like an eagle ... is beyond the scope of this book\\" (Page 35). Thanks a lot.The chapter on online play is mostly devoted to promoting his website and that of his sponsor, UltimateBet.com. The reason he likes \\"UB\\" so much, besides the fact they pay him big bucks? \\"UB's game is the only one that will let me concentrate.\\" What the heck does that mean, really slow software perhaps?The only good thing about this book is that I might get to play against players following his maniacal advice. See you online."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad for beginners","review":"This is a book that is very, very dangerous for beginners at texas holdem. (If you are beginner, the book is a 1 star book)Hellmuth tells you to play only a few, very good hands preflop. That is good.Then he tells you to play them all the same: VERY AGGRESSIVE. And this is not a good advice if you are playing low-limit holdem.To use his own language: there are to many elephants (callingstations) at lowlimit.A lot of players will stay even if you play aggressively preflop and on flop. If you are sitting with 77, 88, 99 (hands that Hellmuth tells you to raise and reraise) or something like that, you will lose a lot when you dont hit a set.This aggressive strategy only works if the other players fold, and in low limit they dont.This book explains Hellmuths style, and that style is not something to use against elephants.

It tries to be true to the era, 1893 Chicago, but the dialogue alternates between attempts at the period and all-too-modern phraseology. Are we to believe they said things like \\"student ID cards\\" in 1893? And references to the novels of HG Wells, who didn't begin his writing career until two years after the novel takes place, are plainly wrong. And there are the references to firearms, laboriously attempting to sound factual but again, just wrong. The author has someone shot with a Sharps 44 revolver, for example, but the Sharps 44 was a rifle. There are enough erors in the firearms references alone to make the entire novel's attempt at historicity to be suspect.Give it a pass, don't waste your time on this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful writing a translation from some alien tongue?","review":"I typically enjoy historical mysteries, but the writing in this book was so horribly awful that I was unable to finish it, even though it was the only un-read book in the house (imagine you're hungry and bite into your last commestible only to find it is a brussels sprout and you get the idea). You remember in Men In Black, how the ship-wrecked alien \\"slipped into\\" the farmer's body and animated it in an almost totally unconvincing manner? That's what the writing in this book is like. A dry recitation of facts about the period would have been more appealing than this attempt to \\"bring them to life\\" with the help of completely unsympathetic characters and a dreadfully stilted prose that isn't modern, isn't period, is just awful. Even the wording of the dedication makes one wince. The only use I can see for this book is to serve as a text in a \\"how not to write\\" class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Solid, Entertaining Historical Mystery","review":"Stylistically similar to the books of Robert Louise Stevenson or Jules Verne, Walker does a fine job of adhering to what's loved about those authors, but weaves in a modern sensibility. The research is well-intergrated in the plot -- doesn't feel hokey or without a payoff. There's a bit of repetition on the reveal of Dr. Tewes (don't worry, that's not a spoiler), but I still found it really a fun read. The seriel killer aspects are background, in favor of characters. You actually care if people live or die here, which is more than I can say for most fodder. If you're looking for the solid work of a great craftsman, this is the place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Horrible Read","review":"With this book, it was almost thrown out 2 times while trying to read it. So slow, so much \\"talking\\" where the author I think is trying to impress the readers with old 1800's talk; didn't work for me.I would say 95% of the book is about the author rambling on, 1% about how the killer kills and 3% about Chicago history.It gave me headaches at time trying to read this thing, I do not suggest it to anyone.I would have liked to have more thrill, suspense, this book did not offer it.I really think the author just likes to hear himself ramble on with meaningless words."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very interesting time capsule interview","review":"I enjoyed former President Bush's new book..which was a shock because I did not vote for him either time and was not a supporter.

In these tedious pages, however, \\"experimental\\" means only this: bad research, no facts, meandering/aimless prose, lack of direction, and disorganization. Oh, yes, how could I forget? It also means enormous amounts of filler at the end, including recipes and a handprint analysis-all, no doubt, in an attempt to meet contractual obligations to the publisher for a page count.Don't take my word for it.

THE TROJAN WOMEN AND OTHER PLAYS is a horrible Kindle edition. The text of the plays does not act as text, but like a picture. The reader cannot change the text size (which is small), nor does the dictionary function work. Nor are there links to the notes. The reader must put in the location number of the notes in order to go there. (It would be much more helpful if for these Kindle editions editors would do footnotes instead of endnotes.) I read the sample before I bought the edition, but it was deceiving since it only covered the Introduction, which behaves like normal Kindle text. Were this one of the relatively inexpensive editions, I would not be bothered by the poor Kindle features. But since this book was almost at full Kindle price, I expected much, much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Brave","review":"Being that Vodou is a verbal Religion,compared to Islam or Christianity Maya Deren did a fantastic job!

Kelley I did the whole car. There is no point waxing over harmfull contaminates and sealing them in with your paint. The reason the car was being waxed was to save time washing off road dirt and ocean spray.The cleanse is necessary to get the unique Zymol Carnauba formulas to stick to the paints surface. I applied it after claying. The wax must be applied over it within 24 hours. The required Zymol HD cleanse is the same Montan oil cleaner used to prepare for specialty Waxes and Glazes that cost much more. No matter what priced product you eventually choose, preparation will be the same with the HD cleanse the last step before the final coat. The Zymol cleaner was easy on, and easy off. Zymol customer service was vey helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Harmony band","review":"Most of us have heard The Association's most famous tunes maybe literally a thousand times, usually blasting out of a mono AM car or home radio in the old days. It's a real treat to hear these hits (and some that should have been) on this fine sounding remaster. These guys are one of the finest vocal bands to ever enter a studio (the playing is great too, actually). It features \\"Cherish,\\" probably the best / most-played unrequited love song ever not sung by a saloon singer!Enjoy this great CD from this somewhat underrated band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not judge by the cover","review":"Don't judge this book by it's cover. I almost did not read this book because of the cover. I don't mind a love story, but I thought this would be a very descriptive romance novel. I was wrong! There are quite a few romantic scenes, but nothing graphic. It didn't make my face turn red reading it. This was a wonderful novel with enough detail to make sense, but not overwhelming and detracting from the story. I highly recommend this book as an entertaining read.

As stated in the other reviews it contains four different time frames. At times trying to follow the battles, kings and history of the different time frames was a little confusing for me. Not actually knowing any of the real history or locations probably hindered me a little in that. It also probably did not help that I stayed up very late reading it since I could not seem to put the thing down.I would certainly recommend this book. Keep in mind that it can be kind of sad in places, as it deals with the characters \\"tragic\\" deaths. However, I still enjoyed it immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a 10","review":"I'm delighted with Ms. Baker's style.

Additionally, we find out about Khyrian society without the author giving us a 2 page info-dump. I really enjoyed the characters and plot, as well as the erotic scenes.

She has no interest in the Madame Alexander doll at all. She carries her Nelly doll every where. She can't explain why, but the difference I notice is the hug factor. The Madame Alexander doll has a huge plastic face which is kind of freaky looking and her body is a very soft pillow. It's just weird how the face is so hard and the body is so soft. This doll, Nelly, and a few others are in her crib to allow her to pick the one she wants. We'll see if she ever turns to Madame Alexander. I'm sure that this will wind up at Good Will. Nelly is great. She's great to hug and very easy to carry around since she is material. Nelly has clothes that you can change and fun hair. Check her out if you looking for a non plastic first doll.

Instead, it is a collection of footage with no timeline, context, nor reason. The producer seems content to move from test to test, providing absolutely no understanding of the public, US political, or international forces leading to these amazing tests; there is no attempt to understand how these tests shaped any US or international policies. Instead, it appears the US atomic testing program was conducted by a bunch of curious, \\"Gee, let's try this, Verne\\" nuclear hackers with no accountability to anyone but themselves.Sorry - maybe I've been spoiled by BBC and PBS quality documentaries.

If you're reading this it is because you already know it. So it is worth buying the DVD, but don't expect high-quality image and editing, because you won't get. Buy it as a reminder of your live experience.If you have never seen cats... better going to see Lloyd Webber's \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" (another fantastic play) in theathers and just believing me that Cats is fantastic (but the DVD unfortunatelly cannot give you this impression)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video with something missing","review":"I was 14 years old when I saw Cats for the first time in NYC. It became my favorite musical and went to see it many more times over the years. This DVD does a great job preserving the musical for longtime fans and future ones. However, one of the best moments in the show was left out. \\"Growltiger's Last Stand\\" which is a continuation of \\"Gus, The Theatre Cat\\" was completely left out. This was an amazing scene with great choreography, a spectacular set that literally came out of the backdrop of the stage, and an amazing Italian aria duet between the cats Growltiger(Gus) and Griddlebone(Jellylorum). I am sure there was a good reason for it being left out. However, it would have been nice to have had the complete show preserved for video. It is still worth having in your collection.

The performance of Elaine Paige, however, is the first rate. As the music is concerned, there some great pieces, but far from all. To keep your dream alive, don't watch it.

To be fair, however, when \\"Memory\\" is sung, there aren't enough stars in the sky for this truly brilliant performance of a beautiful classic show song. But when the song ends, it all comes crashing back down to a mediocre, grossly over-rated one-song dud worth a single very wet and smelly furball. Your kids deserve better -- go for Cathy Rigby in \\"Peter Pan,\\" \\"The Lion King,\\" \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" or \\"Annie\\" on CD instead.

I eagerly anticipated this, and I wasn't tremenduously disappointed. When I saw the production on stage several years ago, I was enamored. Something is lost in the translation here. And not just the two entire numbers that are omitted from this production (Growltiger's Last Stand and The Battle of The Pekes and the Pers). Some of the flavor is gone. The few special effects that are used draw me out of the experience it was in the theatre. Still, worth owning. Well worth owning for a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"See it ,if you saw it live.","review":"I was able to watch CATS live when it came to Hawaii, and I loved it. I was excited to see the video, but was a little worried that it would kill the effect. However, it did nothing but heighten my appreciation of the perormance I had seen. In other words, if you've seen it live, it really helps take you back, and also helps sort out any parts that might have been a little fuzzy (like the pollicle dog part). On the other hand, if you watch the video before you see the actual perormance, it might not hit home for you. You may find yourself a little bored after the first act due to it's length, and due to the obvious fact that the camera is only able to capture a few cats up close at a time. Another thing too.... you can only see what the camera shows you. In short, the video is a good on for enhancing a special time shared in the theatre, or even for those who are familiar with the musical and don't have access to it. It's great for kids who like it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Costumes and That's Just About All","review":"I loved the \\"Joseph and the Technicolor Dream Coat\\" DVD and always liked the \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" soundtrack from way back in the 70s when I would sneak into my sister's room to listen to her records. So I thought that \\"Cats\\" would be a great addition to my DVD collection and bought it to share with my three year old daughter. I found it boring. The music wasn't that great. The story was uninspired in my view. To its' credit the costumes were pretty cool. I had to laugh this week when I saw Stephen Colbert of Comedy Central's \\"Colbert Report\\" say he had \\"suffered through\\" \\"Cats\\" because I felt the same way. So I'm not the only person disappointed. My daughter liked it, though. She probably won't want to watch it again, though, so I'll most likely put it up on e-bay."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was spectacular, but I wish they had not cut out the song","review":"It was wonderful!! I could actually see the actor's faces:) They had spectacular special effects. However, I did miss their attempt at opera.

HIT? HIT? from being a total loss. At the end of the film I was as un-enlightened as at the beginning. If there is a PREMISE behind this show it completely escaped me. Was the plot left in the litter box? In my opinion, this production is a sham and a shame........"},{"rating":"1","title":"ewwwwww!look how dirty those cats are!!!","review":"This is a day that will live in infamancy. If FDR was still alive, then he would have repeated this the very day that \\"Cats\\" came out on DVD.

They made a musical about cats?","review":"When I first heard they had made a musical about cats I said, \\"Why bother? It can't be any good.\\" But when I watched this musical, heard the singing and saw the dancing, I lost myself in their own little world.CATS is brilliantly performed with phenomenal vocals and spectacular dancing. The actors really brought these pussy cats to life. Brilliant performances from Jacob Brent, John Partridge, Ken Page, Michael Gruber, Elaine Paige, and the rest of the cast. They truly are the best CATS in the world. ^_^ Hope somebody found this review helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I got this dvd for my daughter's birthday.

First of all, theatre is meant to be viewed at a theater; you lose something in the translation of media. While have been successful presentation of theatre on video (eg. Les Miz, Into the Woods), this failed. If you are a true lover of the theatre and Cats, don't taint your \\"Memory\\" of the production by viewing this. Instead buy the CD, one of the previously mentioned taped productions. Or one of the many films that have been based on a musical/play (eg. The King and I)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Entirely too frenetic.","review":"Saw Cats performed twice on stage - couldn't have enjoyed it more! The movie version was entirely too disjointed.

I bought the DVD at a shop and saw it. Well, the production and the customes may look great to others. I found the show boring. So if you are looking for a unified theme and a purpose of theme, it is not really there. If you are looking for great, long lasting musical pieces, you would not find many, except for Memory. If you just want to see the show becasue it has so much fame, by all means.

The people are so amazingly beautiful and talented. My sister and I watch Cats at least ten times a day, or we wish we could, anyway. My favorites are Electra, Demeter, Bombalurina, Rumpleteazer, Jemima, Victoria, Etcetera, Munkustrap, Alonzo, Rum Tum Tugger, and Pouncival. But they are all wonderful! I want to be in Cats when I'm older. Gillian Lynne, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and T. S. Eliot are all geniuses beyond their time! Cats FOREVER!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovin the music!","review":"hey musical-lovers,Im actually yet to see the musical in all its wonders but am currently using one of the songs for a school project and am loving the music! Not to sure how I'd like the real thing but if the mystical tunes are anything to go by, you've got yourself a good source of entertainment. An amateur production of it was put on at my dance school a while ago and it was very impressive without the expenses so if you consider this a reliable source, I'd recommend you and even myself to get out there and see what 'Cats' is all about. Just venting my views. . . but feel free to protest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"severely edited attempt at Cata","review":"This is a severely edited and shortened atempt at presenting \\"Cats\\" This attemt to push this great musical on the public fades as only a small screen presentation of a ghosttly show, with star turns for people who do not deserve to be brought to the forground. Sir Andrew please reset this as show seen by the thousands who love this piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Musical Ever Written Just Got Worse","review":"Every now and again, I forget what Cats is like, and I become curious to see it again. Thankfully, this video came out and I had the opportunity to only spend 16 dollars on it as opposed to a 40 dollar theater ticket. Bottom line, it's good to forget about this show. It's not real musical theater, it's a ton of insipid, cutesy schlock that represents the worst of an amazing genre. Do yourself a favor, if you want a musical theater video, buy Into the Woods. Leave Cats for the dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid, boring, waste of money","review":"This was an extreme disappointment!I like cats and I like A.L.Webber, but this is the stupidest, most boring musical I have ever seen.They sing the same tunes and do the same dance steps over and over until you are sick of them.Every song last FOREVER,on and on and on....I finally gave it away.Good riddance!I can't understand what all the hype was about."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a rip off...","review":"The \\"extras\\" were NOTHING more than another video tape with \\"The Making of Cats\\" on it. If you already own the regular DVD (same \\"extras\\" are on it), or if you got a chance to record it on tv (for free), provided your local PBS affiliate aired it when they originally aired the Cats video, then this thing is useless. I found it to be a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG....","review":"okay...my best friend is OBSESSED with cats and the video she has of it is like worn....it is in bad shape...and like I just saw it at her house today and her birthday is like in December and I CANNOT wait to like give her a DVD copy of it...anyway....it's an AWESOME musical...like THE BEST and...heh...there are so many different stories that you can get out of it if you like read it different ways...anyway....I would suggest this as like a \\"must see\\" musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding for Lloyd-Webber lovers","review":"Regardless of the fact that a video can NEVER take the place of the on-stage production, it was wonderful! It is also nice to be able to see the costumes and facial expressions that you cannot see in person, even in the best seats! It is wonderful that we do have a video available for those of us who have young ones - my 4-year old now sings \\"Macavity\\" non-stop!! He would never have gotten that much out of it had we dragged him to a theatre production. I am so glad this outstanding production has made it to video - I don't have to wait for it to come back to town (I have seen it on-stage 5 times already!!)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAVO!","review":"Being a dancer myself, I was amazed at their dancing abilities.

Are you kidding!","review":"I hate to be the millionth person to write a review here but the movie was so fabulous I can't help it. Anyone trying to see whether or not to buy this video should buy it. Though I've never seen it on stage, (I saw it on PBS which prompted me to buy the video) and everyone is saying the video does not compare to the live show, I think if the stage production is half as good as the video it would be worth spending hundreds of dollars on it. My main favorites are The Rum Tum Tugger and Mr. Mistoffolees. The characters AND the songs. In short this movie is well worth $17.47."},{"rating":"2","title":"CATS IS GREAT!!!!! MAY IT LIVE now AND FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Cats is a great movie filled with fun, excitment, and adventure. It's a show for the whole family. It showed what CATS really are instead of just nothing. It changed everyone's mind about cats and cats alone.-- With all the awsome scenary, all the beautiful costumes, and expecially all the talented people. Some things in the show you think is as easy as pie. It probally took a real long time to memorize all those dance moves just for a movie and a play. It is my favorite musical. With all the creative names each and every one of us has our own favorite. My favorite is Rumpleteazer. Who is yours?"},{"rating":"1","title":"it was okay but I just wasn't awed by it!","review":"I've never seen the musical Cats and We have the Broadway cast recording which I never really cared for except for a few songs, I was told that I probably didn't care for the cast recording because I have never seen the play so I rented this tape and it was somewhat enjoyable but I just didn't totally enjoy it, it was kind of weird, the plot was very confusing, it just didn't seem to make any sense. Cats is Okay but it just didn't thrill me as much as The Phantom of the Opera did. I'm not saying that people shouldn't watch this or like it but just giving my personal opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been better.","review":"Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love everything about the musical - the live musical, that is. The video is awful! The cast does wonderfully, but the production value is horrible. The editing is choppy, the music is practically canned, and the addition of \\"special effects\\" makes me cringe. Some of the scenes are hacked to bits, especially Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer, and then there's Growltiger's Last Stand (the most amazing scene IMO), which was nowhere to be found! This video takes away all the intimacy and subtlety of the stage version. It's a decent video, but it doesn't, in *any* way, come close to reliving the magic that is Cats."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the longest MTV style videos on the market!","review":"First of all, the music is wonderful. I loved the show and all the music from it, and the music is there, in all its splendor, wonderful to listen to. But, if I want to hear the music, I listen to the CD. I was looking forward to a video that would capture my joy in seeing the staged performance. This doesn't come near! There are changes in camera angle every 3 or 4 seconds. Very effective for a 3 minute MTV video, but extremely annoying for a full-length video. Shows are choreographed to be seen from the orchestra section - that is, the front. This video shows the musical from the front, back, above, below, both sides, angled, you name it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cats","review":"This is a wonderful video for adults and children. My 2 1/2 year old can't get enough of it. If you like to watch very talented people sing and dance, and enjoy the wonderful music of Andrew Lloyd Webber, this is the video for you. We found ourselves singing the songs in the car, at the park, and at bedtime. And each of our family members has \\"become\\" one of the characters. I like the messages my kids get about diversity, respect, fun, happiness, and community. I cannot say enough good about it. A+++"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reminds Me of Opera","review":"I enjoy live opera, but I don't like to listen to recorded opera. Something dies in the translation. Cats is similar. I can't put my finger on it, but something about this long running musical does not translate well when recorded. I imagine that millions of people who have seen the play will want this video. However, to be honest, my guess is that they want it as a souvenir, to remember the live performance and to show their friends. If you have seen the play purchase the video. For the millions who have not seen the play but have heard enough about it to be interested, do not get the video. This exposure does not do the play justice and will tarnish the experience for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"CATS Rules. And so does Jo Gibb!","review":"The CATS musical is la best!!!! Jo and Drew did a wounderful job!!!! Now must of the time I think musicals are soo boring!! But this one tops them all!!! THIS IS A MUSICAL TO NEVER FORGET!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh no...","review":"...another wasted day! Someone please take this DVD away from me!! I have it just three days and I've watched it tens and tens of times! I guess I do not need to say more...At first I was skeptical about getting this DVD, but I decided to get it after watching the actual show in the theatre. The DVD itself is pretty damn good! The 5.1 mix is quite well done (even though my surround speaker setup is still far from perfect) and the picture very good (although I am somewhat reserved about this, since I have a cheap 32 inch TV set, *far* from a reference model).However, one warning; if you expect a serious plot, then try something else, as some readers may have suggested. But I think that the songs more than make up for the plot (which I personally do not find that bad, albeit simple)! Next I'll probably get the CD with the original London cast... Darn! More wasted days...!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant family entertainment!","review":"Having never seen 'the show', and having received several negative comments from others before viewing, I watched anticipating a let-down. My children and I watched enthralled. They are only young, but we loved the costumes and the wonderful characters of the 'cats'. True to say, there isn't much if any of a story line, bur as far as costumes, character and music is concerned it's a winner - we haven't stopped singing the songs, and it's opened up a world of musicals and poetry to my children who are as yet too young to visit the theatre. Hopefully, it will develope a love of the 'real thing' in years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharing a bit of Broadway","review":"When I traveled to California to visit my Grandchildren, I brought along Cat's- the Musical Commemorative Edition. What a wonderful sharing time we had! They are already in community theater and now can hardly wait for Cats to be presented on their stage. Mmmmm, for which cat should they try out? What do you think, Grandma?"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"It was wonderful to watch Cats again!!! I saw it performed on stage four times and would go again if it were still around. Anyone who is owned by a cat will appreciate both the marvelous makeup and the many cat-like movements of the dancers. If you love cats, this is a must have!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth getting","review":"I confess, I am i complete CATS fan. I love the musical and have seen the video countless times. The dancing is fabulous, the singing and characters were great too. The only thing I found disappointing was that most of the songs were cut short and they took out Growltiger's scene completely, which I thought was one of the best scenes. Overall, it's still a great show to watch on video.If you have not seen CATS before, or have seen it and didn't enjoy it, I can't blame you. I didn't enjoy it the first time i watched it, but I managed to get the lyrics of the songs off the net and information about the musical, so when I understood it better, I enjoyed it more. You'd be surprised how many websites there are out there dedicated to CATS. So if you didn't enjoy it 'cause you didn't understand it, I recommend getting hold of the lyrics and plot of the musical. It helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this edition","review":"I purchased the Commemorative edition December 9, 2010. Just tried to watch it last night. Unfortunately, the disc got to a certain point and would NOT continue playing. Tried to go to Amazon to return it, but...no go, my deadline for returning it was January 31st. So I've wasted money on a defective disc. Be wary of purchasing the commemorative edition folks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Purrrrformance!","review":"This video is a great replicate of the 1981 smash hit musical of Cats. I was a bit disappointed to see that Andrew Lloyd Webber cut out parts of his songs, and even cut out a huge song 'Growltigers last Stand'from the movie. He cut several versus from the duet 'Mungogerrie and Rumpleteazer.' I was quite pleased otherwise with an inspiring cast, great dancing, and beautiful singing. Theatre buff or not your bound to enjoy this musical that is world famous. Hats off to Lloyd Webber for starting his video collection of his musicals with a bang. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for all broadway or musical fans","review":"Holding true to the theater production, Cats give the viewer an up close and personal view of the show without diminishing the full stage view. Though at times the camera seems to shift from place to place to much. Closeups that would not be possible without high power lenses show the true facial expressions of the cast, proving that they are truely \\"in to \\" their parts. Camera trickery is used only to enhance the producton and bring out the director's true vision of the show which would not be possible on a stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty dull stuff on video.","review":"This ain't Live on Broadway where MAYBE this one-song-wonder might seem worth the price of your first born.

Strictly for the kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"CATS- the musical, Andrew Lloyd Webber","review":"I absolutly love this musical! I went to block buster one day in search of a different musical, but no luck. So I said \\"well, I've wanted to see CATS for a while\\" so I rented that instead, and I'm glad I did! So I watched it for the first time and it was nothing I thought it would be. So then I watched it once more... Thats when I fell in love with it! Well, rental time was up and out of the seven days I had it, I watched it twenty-two times! Well, I rented it again and then I got up to fourty-six times. Then I bought it off of E-bay a few days ago, and I have watched it fourty-nine times in all. You may think I'm obbsessed... BUT I'M NOT!!!!!!!

I can't understand why they want to waste our time writing negative things about CATS, when it's very clear most of us who loved the music, the cast, the total production, regardless of inconsequential flaws, really don't give a damn about the cat-hair they insist on shedding on whatever they brush against.And how about that Elaine Paige, writing and letting us know how she felt about doing the Grizabella role. That's class, Folks. She's clearly a cat of unashamed felinity, well deserving of the HeavySide Lair."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was very odd","review":"Mostly all I can say is that it is a very unique video and the music is outstanding, but the content is awful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for All","review":"I have loved this musical since I was in fifth grade, and now it's just gotten better with the DVD!! The picture is wonderful and the sound is richer!!! Plus, the extra bonus footage is fantastic! You get an inside look not only at the making of the video, but also at how the original musical began! My favorite actors, like Ken Page and Michael Gruber, are interviewed about their cat characters, their performances in the musical, and what it was like working with this cast. There an in-depth look at the costuming and make-up processes for the cats and how it changes for film.This play is captured as it should be in its best form in this video adaptation.

Big Mistake. The story has NO PLOT, plain and simple. I think a very young kid could appreciate this, but I couldn't keep my eyes open. The only good song here was \\"Memory\\". Just great. I have the Original CD too and that's the ONLY song worth playing. A lot of the voices were less than wonderful. The dancing by some was good, but it didn't compensate for how there was just no story. You couldn't get into it. I'm sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cats - The Musical","review":"Is it just me, or does the audio track on the DVD version seem much slower in terms of tempo and slighter flatter in terms of pitch than the VHS version or the version I saw on PBS. Even when comparing the tempo of the audio on \\"The Making\\" section of this DVD, the audio in the main production section seems sluggish.Aside from that, and the constant \\"MTV\\" type editing (which by the way drives me crazy since the camera doesn't seem to stay on one image for more than 2 seconds), I enjoyed this production, especially the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I now understand why the show closed...","review":"This is a bad acid trip flashback nightmare. I honestly rented this movie with very high hopes. I live in a small redneck town, on a dead end street, with a video store on the corner..the ONLY video store in town. So it takes some GUTS for a male to rent Cats. Thank God I only paid a lousy dollar fifty instead of fifty smackers on a ticket for the actual show. This is the sort of thing that makes countless husbands everywhere say things like, \\"A Broadway show...do we have to go?\\" and it also makes Broadway look VERY VERY cheezy to the passerby. I ignored all warnings and tried to stomach this video anyway.. COMPLETE RUBBISH!!! T.S. Elliot's poems were fine on their own..But set to music and stretched out for an hour and a half? Not good man, not good.

The selection of classical works with a jazz influence puts some great recordings on this disc, especially the jazzier and faster than normal recording of Rhapsody in Blue. While the disc is interesting, I don't thik it's one of those discs one can just listen to - some of the peices don't seem to lend themselves to that.

The older PureONE filters were smooth and there isn't much room where the filter is located to get a good grip. This tool made removing the used oil filter effortless.

Regardless, the Africa portion of this documentary is great. Each episode covers a different ecosystem on the African continent. The episodes discuss the environmental changes that have given rise to each species. I prefer looking at individual ecosystems on one continent rather than the \\"flying around the world\\" approach ofPlanet Earth. With that said, this documentary is much older thanPlanet Earth(first produced in the late 1980s), so it simply doesn't have the HD quality viewers are used to. Regardless, there are still some amazing scenes, such as sea lions sneaking up on gannets in the water and hippos fighting each other with bloody jaws. Also, the enhanced mode is actually informative and not too intrusive, mentioning interesting facts about the animals. Definitely worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"MUST SEE!!","review":"Lovers of trash B 70's movies don't pass this one by. You will be thrilled to have found possibly the worst movie ever made. From the insanely terrible script and sets to the horrific camera work and edits - this one has it all. The plot is completely nonsensical. Scenes are shot in rooms that sound like the microphone is a tin can. The fight scenes are wooden with obvious choreography. Every bit of acting - from the star to the bit actors - is completely ludicrous. Women give themselves over to the lead with no forethought. Virtually every action in the movie is without premise, as if the director was thinking this up as he went along. Bad, bad, bad. Super bad indeed.

What I especially liked about this book is it appeals to all people whether they have a religion or not.. I have hesitated to pass on my books on Medjugorie because they sounds too Catholic. Being a Catholic I don't want to give others the impression that I think they need to be Catholic or any religion to further their spiritual growth. This book is one I can give to my non-Catholic friends to help them understand the importance of Our Lady's messages. It has been very helpful in reaching my non-practicing Catholic husband.

I cannot recommend this book, since it is contrary to the doctrine of what we do know to be divine revelation. Plainly put, these are NOT Mary's messages. If you do want to know what kind of Marian devotion will lead to to God, read \\"True Devotion to Mary,\\" by St. Louis DeMontfort.

She denies the Catholic Church has the truth, speaks of the \\"brotherhood\\" of God, says that all religions are the same, and later speaks of being reincarnated. She mixes a little truth in with falsehood - Satan's favorite trick. She fails the test of prophets - her prophecies did not come true.Don't bother with this book.

I have tried now for 2 months to get the right fit, but they are still leaving terrible marks on my face. The only advantage to the discomfort, is that in having to readjust the goggles every 4 lengths or so otherwise they hurt too much, I can defog at the same time.

I rinse them in cold water after each swim and the fogging remains a big problem"},{"rating":"1","title":"slight leak after six months","review":"the rubber around the eyes seems to be getting old or something after six months of use. now after a few laps in the pool there is a very slight leak. the first time i thought i'd put them on a bit differently, but it's happened again. it lets in a little bit of water if i move my cheeks or nose at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are too small for an adult male","review":"The main problem with these is size. They seem made for children or possibly women. I am a male adult and have swam laps for years using many makes and models of goggles. These are good quality except for two problems. The strap is too short for my head, so they compress too much. I don't have an exceptionally large head--average size--and these are just too small. The second problem is with the nose bridge piece. These goggles come with three sizes of nose bridges, however even the largest was not large enough for my nose bridge. Again, I do not have an exceptionally large nose.

Out of all the goggles I have owned over the past 10 years, these are the best. They generally don't fog much, and they are pain free. I have very sensitive skin, and although the goggles still do leave the area around my eyes red, they rarely hurt me. Definitely a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for the money","review":"I swim a mile per day in the pool for exercise. I hate goggles that leak - the chlorine drives me nuts. After reading the reviews, I purchased these from Amazon.They never leaked or fogged up in seven months of use. I would probably still be using them, except I left these at the pool - never to be seen again. Hopefully, someone is still getting quality use out of them.Out of curiosity, I replaced these goggles with the Speedo Vanquisher plus goggles after reading the reviews. Not much of a difference, but I prefer the Vanquisher plus goggles. They seem like they are built a little stronger. For the difference in price, I would recommend the Vanquisher plus goggles.However, these served me well in the period of time I used them - no complaints. Certainly one of the better values you will get for your dollar on goggles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but the nose piece is not adjustuable","review":"These goggles fit me well and seal water off fine.

Hence why some people say they are great and been using them everyday for 3 months without any problems, they probably lose their anti fog after an extended period of time.Really swim goggles for this price should last at least a year or more of DAILY use.will NOT be buying any more speedo products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I did not swim much as a kid so I am not used to the chlorine in the pools. My swim coach asked me to buy a pair of speedo swim goggles to save my eyes from burning so much. These were the cheapest available so I bought them. But they turned out to be exactly what I was looking for. Water never leaks in if you wear them properly. They look really smart. I saw what my other friends got and these ones are really better looking. The only problem is that occasionally fogging occurs because of which I have to take them off and clean them with my hands or something. But overall I am really happy with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for 4 uses, then they broke","review":"I bought these because of the high reviews combined with the lower price. They looked great, and felt great once properly adjusted. I used them four times in a local YMCA pool and immediately washed them off in tap water afterwards. As I applied a slight bit of tension to pull them onto my head the band snapped. I had to knot it together or give up on goggles for today's swim.I would have given them 5 stars for great goggles, but due to the incredibly quick breakage I have to go down to 2. I did email Speedo themselves, so I'll update if anything comes of this. Not sure if Amazon will do anything as it's past the return window."},{"rating":"2","title":"alangs84","review":"Great product, work very well for what I use them for.I swim on a regular basis for excercise, and these were rated one of the best for the use that I use them.The are weird to adjust at first, but once they are adjusted correctly, they fit like a glove.Very good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely dissatisfied","review":"I got this just yesterday. However, the straps are of poor quality and one of them broke/tore while trying to adjust it. They are way too tight to adjust easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"breaks too easily","review":"I've purchased two pair of these goggles. The seal is excellent, and the first pair survived four years of heavy use (2007-2011). They are still usable for horsing around but not for laps--the rubber is a bit worn.The second pair (the one being rated here) lasted only 1 year of not-so-heavy use before the part of the goggle that attaches to the nose bridge broke. C'est la vie.I then bought a pair ofSpeedo Vanquisher 2.0 Goggles. They broke the same way after 6 months of light use.At the advice of Speedo customer service, I mailed both defective goggles to Speedo, but several weeks later I have not heard from them. I conclude that Speedo' quality has gone down and that they don't care.UPDATE: after two months, Speedo sent me aSpeedo Vanquisher 2.0 Gogglewith no explanation or anything. I had sent a print-out of my amazon receipt for those. After six months, Speedo sent a second pair, again with no explanation."},{"rating":"1","title":"tight and painful","review":"I bought this after reading zillions of positive amazon product reviews. I would term my face a normal size female face. These goggles are super-tight and leave deep impressions on my skin.

I do not recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fogs up!","review":"It came in a neat packing with all contents as described on page. It has a great finish and the straps are easy to adjust.

Not much usable I'm afraid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great goggles but doesnt serve the purpose","review":"The goggles are great but they dont serve the purpose of anti - fog ; the main reason why i bought them.So its a no go for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Goggles","review":"The seal around the eye(s) is fantastic. The split head band easy to adjust and stays put. The anti-fog film is the best I've ever had (36 years of experience). It lasts for about 45 minutes for me. I'm not exactly sure why it gives up when it does, but until then, it's flawless.The only gripe I have is the fit around the bridge of my nose. Even with the largest of the nose fittings (a package of assorted sizes come with each pair) I am left with divots in my nose at the end of my workout. The seal and anti-fog (until it fails) is so impressive that I still choose these googles over several others that I have. If I had a smaller nose I'd be in goggle heaven."},{"rating":"1","title":"uncomfortable","review":"nice goggles but extremely uncomfortablethey hurt my eyes after ten minutes of swimmingtry the tyr velocity goggles used them for yearsand they were never uncomfortable, I just bought apair after swimming once with these speedos"},{"rating":"1","title":"Goggles hurt","review":"I've tried 2 different nose bridges and both are uncomfortable (hard to change also).

I needed the clear for dark days and early morning swims. The goggles are great. However Nike used to put the Vanquisher in a firm plastic hinged case so that you could keep them well stored between swims. NO MORE. They have gone cheap and no longer put them in a case.

I bought these goggles but wasn't really expecting much from it since the price was so low. I was wrong.These goggles are awesome. When you have it tightly around your head and over your eyes, no water will get in. I use to have some more expensive goggles that would still let a tiny bit of water in which was annoying, these are super secure and you can feel the suction on it when you put it on. These goggles don't fog up either and everything is crystal clear with them on. I'm thinking about getting another pair as a spare."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product when it's new","review":"after a several uses, the anti-fog starts to fail...at the beginning when it is band new, it works great! Clear and sharp.I always wash it with water and hand soap after swimming to clean up the clorine ... still, the anti fog inner layer wears out quickly.The good thing is that it doesn't leak... that's the important part.Over all, it's still a great product compare to other models. If not because of the poor anti-fog thing, I would have give it a 5 stars rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until nose piece breaks","review":"These goggles feel great and give fantastic visibility. However, I've gone through 3 of these in the last month. One was lost (my fault!), and the nose piece (the plastic bridge) broke on the other two. Last night, the third of these was broken when I tried to put it on my head for the first time. More specifically, I had the eye pieces in place and was stretching the rubber headband to put it over my head when the nose piece broke in two places.Maybe I just got a bad batch--the two broken ones came from the same order--but it's unfortunate that 2 of 3 of mine have broken from light use."},{"rating":"1","title":"foggy","review":"It has a good looking.

Wrong! Major leaks and most painful below the eyes. Big mistake on my part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad nose bridge","review":"The excellent features of these goggles is that they do not leak or fog!!!!! Yahoo!!!!! Disadvantage is that the nose bridge is plastic. Sure it has 3 different sizes for the bridge but the actual part of the goggle that sits on your side of your bridge is also plastic. It digs into your nose after time and hurts. I wore them twice and threw them away. Great price but not worth the investment unless you can handle the bridge."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Anti-fog\\" must not be a \\"factual statement\\"...","review":"My first pair started fogging up within a week of use.

This time I was very careful to not touch the lenses and followed all of the advice on maintaining the anti-fog coating. They started fogging up within a week and a half. If I were to buy these again, I would not be doing so for the anti-fog \\"feature.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Sun Glassses and Goggles Built into One","review":"This product is unique in that it actually performs the functions of two products. They are your typical Speedo Goggles and Sun Glasses. Typical may not be the best description in that I believe Speedo makes the best swimming goggles out there. These perform as good as my other Speedo Goggles. In addition, they are tinted so they act as sun glasses. They are not polarized or anything like that, but they do cut down the amount of light entering your eyes which helps on those very sunny days. In summation, great goggles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-fog is a joke","review":"I started using these goggles as I was training for a triathlon, but now I'm looking for another pair. After less than 10 trips to the pool, the anti-fog has completely worn out, and now they fog up completely within 3 laps- not gonna be good in an open water triathlon. I took care of the lenses as required- rinsed them with fresh water after use, never wiped the inside with anything, but after a few times in the pool I started to wonder what the weird line thing in the middle of my vision was, and saw later that it was the anti-fog coating flaking off. Annoying.On the other hand, they fit nicely and were comfortable once I got the right nose-piece in there.They did ok sealing, but they did leak once in a while which caused me to stop and adjust (chlorine is very high in the pool I train in).If you never sweat while working out, you'll be ok. If you're a normal human being (and you like to be able to see where you are going), stay away from these goggles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too tight, and it leaks too often","review":"I just couldnt get these things to wear properly. I had tried using them on 3 separate occasions trying out 2 of the 3 available bridges to fit my face better but to no avail. they are so damn tight that they hurt. I didnt think my head was too big until wearing these, now im self conscious everywhere I go. Oh yeah, and they did keep water out for $%*&. I would swim 5 strokes and get a couple drops inside. Swim 5 more have more water inside. At the completion of any lap I would have too much water in here for me to see at all. I also tried the 2.0 vanquisher, which fits nicer, but just messes with my eyes too much. I wouldnt recommend these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great of an investment...","review":"I purchased these based on the reviews on Amazon and I was expecting them to be decent for recreational swimming. The day I opened them and used them, about an hour into swimming laps, they started fogging up real quickly! I was really disappointed considering the packaging says \\"Anti-fog\\" on them. Aside from that, they are comfortable and they fit well! If you're looking for goggles for everyday use, don't invest in these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome swim goggles","review":"This product is just plain awesome. I wear contacts so was worried about the water washing away my contacts and worse giving me an eye infection. These goggles come well to the rescue.

This year I purchased the electrical cord and found that it gives the printer more \\"gas\\" and the printing is GREAT! I also hooked it up to my computer which makes it easier to use and gives me more fonts. I give it a four star rating because the ink cassettes waste a lot of ink and are costly.

The manual is not very strait-forward either, so be prepared to experiment and learn as you go.

I believe it is only 1/2\\" high on the top and bottom.

I can't put my finger on why, except that the characters just never caught my interest. The plot was weighted down with so much unneccesary detail, it took forever for things to move along. Not the worst book I have read, but no where near the top either."},{"rating":"1","title":"DNF","review":"This was my first attempt to read one of Linda Fairstein's Alex Cooper novels. If this novel is anything like the rest of the series, this has to be the most overrated mystery series EVER. I was bored stiff by the meaningless details and characters included in the story and a lot of the main character's dialog felt like I was being lectured to as if a small child.The rest of this series may be fantastic, but I guarantee you I will never know because there is no way I would ever read another one of Fairstein's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not put this down....","review":"Mainly because I was afraid that someone else might pick it up and start to read it. I don't think that anyone deserves that sort of punishment. The characters are uninspired, the plot boring, the writing, inane at best and the standing on soapboxes sickening. Someone should point out to the author that Britain has a much smaller gun violence problem because they have some sort of gun control, not because the criminals haven't figured out how great guns are. Avoid, avoid, avoid. Stick to law, lady."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Get Through It.","review":"I can't remember the last time I set down a mystery without finishing it, but I couldn't get through this one. The author seems so intent on making sure we know how clever she is that she forgets to keep us turning the pages. I was really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much background and details!","review":"I wish the author would concentrate on giving us a good story and less speech making about her real life job. She seems to cross the line between writing a novel and giving a lecture about her real job. Pick one or the other and do it well; the two don't mix. Those of us who purchase a book classified as a novel want fiction and a good story...not real life lectures and in-depth details of how the Supreme Court functions (boring). Stick with the story and forget the endless details about the real life job. They aren't interesting. Get back to the Vineyard and some nice scenery. This book was agony to read. I kept putting it down because of the boring details. I never thought I would finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I absolutely loved it!!!","review":"This is an excellent mystery book!!! It all starts with a murder of a brain surgeon and professor, and digs into the poor security of the hospital and university organizations - this one will keep you up at night, especially if you are in the hospital!!!The twists are believable and unpredictable!

A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps with allergies","review":"I take this with Enzymatic Therapy - Cell Forte With Ip-6 & Inositol, 240 tablets morning and evening. The two have the same effect as taking one Costco Kirkland Aller-Tec daily. Of course, this is not a medical recommendation, and your results may vary depending on many factors. I do like being able to take supplements instead of pharmaceuticals.

If you're not sure what to do, consult with a physician who supports non-drug treatment options."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Rx Allergy Meds","review":"This is the 2nd year/allergy season that I've used D-Hist. After the initial load period, 2-3 pills a day will keep allergies at bay.

My symptoms range from mild to pretty severe, so I take a prescription antihistamine every day and am doing the allergy shot regime. I also take D-Hist. Because I'd much prefer to take something all-natural, I've tried D-Hist a few times on its own, but it's just not strong enough for my symptoms. But then, the prescription doesn't completely do the job either. What I've found is that the prescription medication does most of the work, and D-Hist is great at handling the remainder, so I feel great most of the time. The allergy shots are helping, too, but they still need some time, so I'll stick with my D-Hist and antihistamine combo in the meantime. If your allergy symptoms are mild, I suspect D-Hist might be all you need."},{"rating":"2","title":"effective","review":"I saw a noticeable reduction in my allergy symptoms (primarily excessive fatigue) when taking this product.

I took it when I was pregnant two different times and it actually got rid of my sinus infections (I had to take two twice a day, per my doctors recommendations). Now my husband and I take two per day for regular sinus issues, allergies included. The person who wrote that it did nothing for them (and said they took it for 3 months and it did not prevent them from getting a cold) didn't understand what this product is meant to do. It's not MEANT to prevent a cold -- you'd have to take an immune system booster for that. It's MEANT to help with sinus and allergy problems and, with that, it's the best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PRICE IS TOO HIGH","review":"This product works great, but the price is almost triple compared to other sources.

However, it may work different with different people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't really work","review":"I heard that this would be a replacement for my over the counter allergy medicine. It didn't really work as well and you need to take a lot of capsules frequently to see results. I don't have the time to take that many pills that frequently. I'll go back to the 12 hour allergy medicine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't effective for me, however","review":"I was very hopeful about this product based on all of the reviews and because of several of personal recommendations to try the product. Unfortunately this did not significantly help with my symptoms. Although this product did help thin the mucus and allow some drainage, it only relieved a minor amount of congestion and it definitely was not effective enough to address sinus pressure and headaches. To be fair, as with most supplements and/or medications, I think it varies from person to person in terms of how it affects the body so even though it did not work for me, it might be helpful for others. The downside is that the product is pretty expensive so if you can try it first somehow before purchasing, I would recommend that so that you don't end up wasting money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less boxes of tissues!","review":"My granddaughter suffers from terrible allergies all year long.

I was looking for some real insider secrets from a leading engine builder. I spent 10 years in the engine rebuilding business and now do it only as a hobby. I am always on the lookout for great books on the subject. This book is not one of them. Smokey Yunick's Power Secrets is a much better buy, although it doesn't talk about fuel injection. If you are a beginner in the engine building world, then by all means read this book, then read Smokey's Power Secrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"astonishing, suspenseful, and true...","review":"This book brings to vivid life the underground railroad and the politics of a nation poised on the brink of civil war. Slave catchers lurk around the edges of communities, hunting for escaped slaves or free blacks that they can kidnap. Radical abolitionists were militant about blocking any such kidnappers from reaching the south (regardless of the legality of the act). This book tells the true story of an escaped slave who is captured and then freed by a large group of Oberlin and Wellington abolitionists. This leads to a trial which made sensational national headlines and crystallized the growing crisis between north and south. It is absolutely gripping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and entertaining","review":"If you like history you will like this book. Sometimes the book gets a little to in detailed for my taste but overall it was entertaining. It brought to life the town of Oberlin as well as the politics that surrounded the years leading up to the Civil War."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopefully you're reading this before you purchase","review":"I agree with the others that the instructions do not provide adequate direction. A lot of the user's education on this product comes by way of trial and error. There are certain CDRs that won't work, as has been noted in prior reviews. Advanced features like fade out are mentioned, but there's absolutely no instruction. I've also had problems with the laser. Often I'll hear a few seconds of silence on my recordings.

I have tolerated the CDR 785 for almost two years and:1. The CD burner NEVER worked properly, finally dying completely (and eating the unfinalized cd!); and2. It is among the most user-unfriendly devices I have ever owned, particularly in regards to the manual and the recorder.As a 3-CD carousel PLAYER, it is fine, but...it cost $379.00 new, and I recently bought a 5-CD changer for slightly over $100.Ridiculous amount for a piece of over-hyped garbage (remember the TV ads for the \\"party mix\\" CD burner...?).Truly a sad day for a one-time pioneer in entertainment technology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy.","review":"This unit is a nice player but a really lousy recorder.You cannot fade up or down.You cannot listen and then know how many minutes are recorded and how many are left on CDR.The UV meters are worthless.You cannot pause in record.The instruction manual is the worst I have ever seen, consumer or professional.The 800# help is there for you and nice, except every time you call you will get different advice.You can't put a gap between tracks, songs are on top of each other.No volume adjustment between different CD's. and lots more!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"The operating manual is very poorly written.

Although my nails looked shiny, I didn't have the protection of nail polish to keep my nails from breaking. When I decided to polish my nails, I found that the nail polish began to wear off later the same day because of the slickness of the buffed nails. I paid $50 for the kit at a mall kiosk, a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful at all","review":"I thought this was a cheap alternative to the 501 Russian Verbs, but it is in fact just not user-friendly.

All in all, I would recommend 501 Russian Verbs much more highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Memoir That Stretches Beyond...","review":"It's rare I find a memoir that stretches beyond the author's life to embrace mine. In Thistledown Rising, Sean Redmond lets the child he once was run free with the child I didn't realize I'd left behind. Together we explore the Redmond farm and its surroundings. We watch Redmond's father milk cows and his brothers define adolescence as abusing a 1960 Dodge. We explored the workings of Redmond valley, skip stones across the fishing hole, hide from roaming dinosaurs. We look inside our odd and sometimes frightening neighbors' lives and ask, \\"Is everything always as it seems?\\" We ask other questions too, like: what does it take for a new family to fit into an old community; what did Tom Redmond's (the author's father) long silences mean; and what keeps a man or a child going-or a community for that matter-when life indicates it's time to \\"hang it up.\\" Redmond urges me to define hope. Perhaps he already knows. Perhaps hope is as simple as thistledown rising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master Paul tells all!!","review":"I learned about paul barman in the spring of 2000, and I've been going to his concerts (3times) and scouring around for anything with his voice on it.He is the man.

In my opinion this is the genre-gap Paul is trying to fill, but he's just technically not a sound emcee (no matter how clever people may claim he is).

Quite clever in a juvenile South Park sort of way (in other words, despite the coolness of the music, you might not want to pop this in your CD player on a first date). I would have given it 5 stars except for the 2 or 3 boring non-hip hop songs; the lyrics of those are funny but non funny enough to listen to without some good beats. This is not an album you should buy without hearing a little bit of first. I immediately liked it when I heard it on a streaming audio station, but I don't think it's going to appeal to all hip hop fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Paul Barman is great and \\"It's Very Stimulating\\" is one of my favorite hip hop albums.

I'm happy whith it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and disjointed","review":"This film has good intentions and gets off to an interesting start but quickly collapes in on itself. First of all, the characters, except for the lead, are basically all unlikable and uninteresting. And I'm sure to the chagrin of many gay viewers, they all end up having sex with each other (no wonder we are talked about - not all gay people and gay relationships are this way!) The major problem that I had with this film was the confusing time line and flashbacks. In many instances, it is hard to tell at what point something is happening and you are wondering if it is after or before the previous scene. Another problem is extremely poor audio (even on dvd). Pluses are good acting and imaginative cinematography but these points alone fail to make this film recommendable."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give this NO stars I would","review":"This is just an awful little movie in every possible way, even the sound is terrible. It is so muffled you often can't understand what is being said. It reminded me of the sound quality you get when you order at a drive-up box at a fast food restaraunt. The DVD starts with a \\"thank you for watching our film\\" - a sort of \\"we hope you don't think it's too bad, we know there are problems\\" sort of thing - from the producers. It goes downhill fast from there. And another thing - you sure get sick of that \\"green plaid shirt\\" gimmick they hammer you over the head with.

The first being a script, the second being well....a script.Seriously this film seemed to be under the impression that just putting somebody up there who has lost their lover is enough to keep us tearful and involved for the 17 hours this movie seemed to last. The fact that the sound quality was so bad I had to rewind several times to try and catch important passages was a minor annoyance compared to the complete lack of interest I was able to maintain. It is sad to say that a movie supposed to be sad and about a very serious subject had my friends and I laughing at our foolishness for renting this."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time!!","review":"this movie was a big waste of time. the acting sucked and the story line was horrible.

It's the year 2010 and people are going to get check up and using protection. all the all the movie is a big was of time, so don't waste your time. to think that i had been waiting for years to see the movie and to see it and find out that it was a horrible film made me that much dissatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal.","review":"I wanted to like this, but there is not much to recommend here. In this day and age there are enough insightful or fun movies about being gay that gay subject matter alone does not make a film interesting. Whoever is responsible for this film doesn't seem to have learned this lesson. See this if you want to be supportive of independent cinema, or if you want to support gay cinema. Either way, though, seeing it is an act of magnanimous charity. The acting is stilted and most of the characters are annoyingly self-indulgent and distasteful. The flashbacks and voiceovers are pretentious given how little substance there is to the narrative and how little we care about the narrator. Finally, the green plaid shirt as a plot driver doesn't work all that well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly awful","review":"Sat down last night with a friend to watch what I thought would be a heartwarming love story and ended up laughing at a plot line intended to make you cry.

On a purely technical level, the movie was so dimly lit and poorly filmed I could barely make out any faces. The script was trite and meaningless; an attempt at causing catharsis by forced emotion from second-rate actors. If you want to make a film, make one with a message other than \\"pity this guy, he lost his lover.\\" I found no point to the film other than to depress the viewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good intentions, but....","review":"A friend recommended this film so I started to view it but had to stop after 30 minutes. I usually give films more of a chance but the sound quality of the DVD was so poor that I was either straining to hear what was being said or turning the volume down. (I tried it on a second DVD player with the same results.) The two main actors (Gregory Phelan and Victor Spirtas) were not too bad, but the script -- what I was able to make out of it -- left little to be desired. A bit too confusing and not conversational and realistic. The supporting characters were too clichéd and made the one scene of the introduction dinner difficult to sit through.The film's creators seemed to have made this film with good intentions: showing the effects of AIDS on the gay community by focusing on one relationship in particular.

One of the things I found the most troubling about this movie was the fact that there were so many \\"parties\\" with unlimited weed and booze and girls and no parents, and it really doesn't work out that way most of the time in real life. Also, the director tried to make up for lack of a budget by shooting strange angles and perspectives of everyday things.

It helped me see Jesus as a man, like all of us, human, and yet so much more, because he was also God, our Creator, Lord, LORD, Savior. James' way with words made the book an enjoyable read.

If you cut out all the visual filler, the story is thin ideed, which is too bad, because it could have been tightened up and enriched with maps and timelines and statistics relating to the positive impact brave resistors had on the survivors and on the war.

The women were slutty and were not made to look even remotely attractive. The one woman from the first sequence that you thought was in love is just a slut too!

At first, a reboot would make everything work OK for a while, but the problem got worse as time went on. Eventually, I took out the Flex USB, reloaded the USB driver (again), and rebooted, and the problem was gone.This is such a useful device that I'm going to have to buy another one.

A lot of their magic is created by the performers. In this set, you have a well-recorded and well-played reading by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. With Monica Huggett you get a fine soloist who is more known for her Baroque work. The result is a set of well-crafted but ultimately boring performances. Since Mozart did not designate specific cadenzas to be played, every soloist can play what they like, Huggett choosing to perform her own. They are really a major disappointment, revealing a performer who really doesn't have a lot to say about these staples of the repertoire, like the performances as a whole.

I guess I don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't even finish it!","review":"I value my reading time, so I try to make sure that the book I choose to read is at least in a genre I enjoy. I wished I had also read reviews for \\"Summon the Keeper\\" because I would have likely discovered that it just wasn't for me. I found the premise interesting yet confusing. But what really made me drop this book was a lack of action and an overall story.Most readers will praise this book for its humor, but it was the type of humor that also made me dislike the book. The author seems to spend so much time making jokes (especially about things that should have been taken seriously- hello, hell is in the basement?!?. Not funny!) that the actual story really suffered for it. I got about halfway through the book, and when nothing was really happening, I decided that I had other books more worthy of my time than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summoning the giggles","review":"I have just finished reading this book (my first by Tanya Huff) and I loved it! It was wonderful, easy reading. Tanya Huffs sense of humor had me rolling time and time again...Where else can you combine a talking cat, a ghost, vampires, werewolves, and a hole to hell in the furnace room? You can't miss the aging Olympians. I have heard a rumor that there will be sequel...but not for about another year...YEAH! I'm definitely going to check out some of her other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell talks, and it's funny!","review":"I didn't purchase this book, it was given to me as a gift. I enjoyed it so much that I ordered two more in the series. Summon the Keeper is a fun read. It was a nice break from the all too dark fantasy world of vamps, lupins, and such. The main character is likeable and believeable, even if her side kick is a talking cat. The cat is sharp witted and almost steals the show. At times this book was \\"laugh out loud\\" funny, and I'd find myself getting strange looks from people around me when I was reading at luch! I highly reccomend this one as a good, light hearted read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I initially bought the book for the kitty, but wound up liking it a lot.","review":"Okay, you should NEVER judge a book by its cover, right? The goofy title was a bit of a turn off but there was this kitty...well, the kitty in the book looked a lot like my kitty from childhood and I had some time to kill so why not? I wound up loving this book. I love the characters. I love the idea of the Keepers. I love the family dynamics. I love that the Keepers don't drive. I love the banter.If you're looking for some well-written, charming, escapist fantasy, this is a perfect book. Read it on the beach. Read it in the airport. I don't recommend trying to pull this one over on your Literature teacher though, she may get cranky.I've read the three books in the series and they're scads of fun. I can't seem to locate a fourth one so I'm assuming that its in the works, or at least I hope so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighthearted fun","review":"There is no way you can read this book without having a good time. The characters including the cat, are all precious and will keep you giggling throughout. Be sure to also get the sequel. You want to read them back to back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I could not put the book down, it was the greatest from the greatest cat alive(after of course my own precious cat, Myles) Austin to Hell. Read and devour it. I could not stop laughing. I read it somewhere that there will be ANOTHER BOOK out called THE SECOND SUMMONING..hopefully i am not wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny, Great read!","review":"I really loved this book. It is absolutey hilarious, if you go for dry, sarcastic humor. The characters were ingaging, the plot, well written and the style was easily readable. I thought Hell was absolutely HILARIOUS! Tanya Huff was able to make even the most evil likeable. The only reason I didn't give this book five stars was because of some of the things that were left unsaid and up to the imagination. I felt there were some aspects that could have been more cleared up. All in all, though, I would reccommend this book to ANYONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, lust, HELL IN THE BASEMENT, and a cat who TALKS!","review":"Who could ask for more?? I loved this book for so many different reasons. Claire was one the of the most amazing characters I've ever read and her life as a Keeper and everything was so fascinating! I've read this book 5 times now, since this past summer and plan to read it again! For all of those who loved this book, read Wizard of the Grove. I just finished it and it was incredible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope that this is a new series!!","review":"I thought that this book was absolutely delightful. Claire, with her lack of social skills is endearing, and the guests at the inn ... well, Tanya Huff's sense of humour comes through loud and clear. I found the characters likeable, and the storyline was such that I read the book in one sitting.My only hope is that the ending indicates that there are more adventures in store for our Keeper and her companions. I would definitely buy them in a second!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a top shelf romp!","review":"Add me to the list of people who are itching for more books in the Keeper series! (It will be a series, won't it? Please?)I'm not generally a reader of fantasy, but I have a soft spot for well written cat characters, and I read this one after three friends independently recommended it. I'm very glad I did!Others have summarized very well, so I won't add any redundancy except to say that if wry humour appeals to you, you're going to love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something a little different","review":"Its not that often that you get to read a book about someone being summoned to close up a hole to \\"heck\\". Nice mix of humans and non-humans. Talking cat is a hoot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I highly rec. this book. very fun and escapist in the way that terry pratchett used to be--except with a feminist sensibility he never had.liked the second in the series also--both books had me laughing out loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"You must be kidding","review":"The trouble with most movie books is they're written by people with, at best, questionable credentials. Most of them are written by university film department drop-outs - disenchanted Humanities majors who spent too much time in the rear stalls of some of the seedier art houses. But, if Roger Ebert can make a living at it (and win a Pulitzer Prize for it), then anyone can. Why not you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-informative","review":"The book is not good. It claims to be about the \\"Director's Vision\\", but each exposition is mostly made up the authors personal feelings about one film of each director. Hardly any information is given about the directors themselves, aside from one or two brief sentances at the very end of the paragraph. The movie stills, which are of extremely poor quality, take up half the page. In addition, no index had been made. The directors are listed alphabetically but if you want to find a certain movie or genre you have to skim each page individualy. The book is a failure and currently in my bathroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great exploration in unknown filmmakers","review":"The Director's Vision has been a great introduction to many filmmakers that I was previously unaware of. The book does not give much context to each filmmaker except for a 1/2 page blurb of a key film in their career and a short \\"see also\\" feature. What it has done for me is given me the groundwork to explore many different cinematic directions that I was previously unaware of. I was quite able to put these films into context after viewing them. In other words, I would much rather see a film and then discuss it than read extensively about it, put it in context, and then see it. This book is not for the well-read cinephile. It is simply an introduction that lets the film speak for itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite for both Children and Adults","review":"While browsing through a small book store eight years ago, I was smitten by this book. It is uplifting, imaginative, tender, and exquisitely illustrated. To my delight, my grandson loved it as well. It has remained the favorite book of his childhood. It's a \\"must\\" for those who seek the best in children's literature. Few know about it, but if it emerges from obscurity, it will become a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING RECIEVER!","review":"First off, I am NOT your average buyer. Meaning, that I research prices and items for great value. I consider a value the amount of money that I am spending, for the material and/or workmanship that I am receiving. That being said, this receiver marks an EXCELLENT value for the price in what you are getting. The touch screen is amazing, and the gps is near flawless. I highly suggest adding the Bluetooth and Ipod adapter as well as the Sat. Radio option. This adds to the total value of the unit. Did I mention that this thing also plays MOVIES strait out of the box? Amazing.I have had it for over 3 months now and have not had a singular problem. If you want to spend thousands on another unit, be my guest, but there is no challenging the value of this buy, and its a Pioneer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Vendor , Lousy product","review":"Product looks is not even covered by pioneer warranty . serial number was scrtached (the installer showed me).product is lousy .. user interface is non intuitive .."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Navigation","review":"The navigation on this unit is absolutely horrible. Its not that it doesn't do it the most efficient way, but it just doesn't make ANY SENSE at all. Just as someone else posted, it will have you drive right past the road you should turn on, then make a u-turn a few miles away, and come right back to where you should've turned to begin with. If that's not bad enough, its even had me turn off the correct road that i was already on, drive a few miles, make a u-turn, and come right back to the same exact intersection. There's just no explanation for this thing, unless it's that it's a big prank from Pioneer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent player at an excelent price!!!","review":"For US$700 you get a lot of features... Great navigation and great sound! This is a must buy item...The only con I could find is that you can't download your own maps. You have to buy map updates from teleatlas..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great unit, but at $99,999, a tad pricey","review":"A true home run of a product. But it is really worth $99,999? I think not.

Now for the Nav system if I could give it a -5 stars I would. I have used them all in rent a cars and own an old garmin that works great. The D-3 has a habit of routing you pass were you should turn and than will have you u turn and back track up to 3 or 4 mile to turn on the street you passed 5 miles ago. It is 4 house off to find my house, the old Garmin is 4 feet off. For Navagation forget this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a list of plants...","review":"This book is nothing more than a list of plants that are suggested for children's play areas.

What a great story. I read it in one day.. I just couldn't put it down... This is a MUST read for anyone. Thanks so much to the Carpenter's for sharing their story. You both are such an inspiration!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less pleased","review":"I am not one for reading but I enjoyed the movie so much that I got the book, it sucked that in the movie they had different names, so it threw me off considering the guy had a girls name in the book. It wasn't worth the money or the time. Stick to the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie was great not the book","review":"The movie is based loosely on the book. I usually read the book before the movie but in this case I saw the movie first. I was very disappointed when I read the book. Definitely not worth buying"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This was an excellent book. Some people do take their vows seriously. Love lasts forever if you work at it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book :)","review":"This book is wonderful! It tells the true story about a man and woman in a car accident where the woman has lost some memory as a result of her going through the windshield. She does not remember her husband, and he works very hard to remind her. Great book! Shipping was very fast! I would definitely recommend to a friend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"The story was told from Kim's perspective. I wish that the story carried Krickitt's thoughts and feelings rather than just Kim's story. I wasn't sure what to expect from this book - was it a \\" love\\" story or a chronicle of a couples challenge so I had no expectations when I started reading. I feel this story is a love story not in the traditional sense but in the sense of what true love and commitment is all about. This story is about commitment, love, faith and hope (not necessarily in this order). We would all be fortunate to find a love that stand the tests life hands us as well as the dedication that often goes questioned in life. It is definitely a feel good read so if you're up for a fast and inspiring story make sure to add this gem to your reading list. Not much of a movie watcher but this one might be an exception, I bet the movie won't disappoint"},{"rating":"2","title":"vowing","review":"This book was great! If you like a true love story you will like this book. Don't expect it to be like the movie. I was surprised to see how much different it was from the movie. While the movie tells a story of a girl running from her past and hiding from her family, the book reveals the truth to her family life."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"this was a easy read that I did before bed. great book and I highly reccomend it. Im really enjoying getting my ebooks from amazon, its woth putting on the tablet"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow for THE VOW!!!","review":"Reading the Book THE VOW prior to the movie, I found myself actually on the journey with the young couple, through the tragedy and joy. It was well written and a very easy read on the Kindle. I found when I had finished the reading, I was ready to see the movie and see how closely the true events of the story were carried to the big screen. It was so closely linked but I feel if I had not gone through the reading and emotions found in the book, some of the story would have been lost simply watching the film. Kudos to a great story with a truly happy ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"religious propaganda","review":"the actual event is interesting and would have made a good story, but the book was not about the even it was about their all encompassing relationship with jesus. the entire book is really about how they love christ and christianity. i wouldn't have minded, if it was just the background to how they got through such a horrible experience, but it was the entire story. so if you are not a christian or don't want to be bombarded with how great christianity is then DO NOT read this book. it made the book boring and tedious."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful story....and it is true!","review":"We saw the movie, The Vow, and it was good. However, the book was so much better and not at all like the movie. The book showed just how much they relied on their faith. This was not portrayed in the movie at all. Kim had a great relationship with Krickett's parents, which was not so in the movie. It was a great book and I would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time and Money!","review":"After seeing the movie I was chomping at the bit to read the real story. I shouldn't have wasted the time and money for this book. It was poorly written. This book could've been simplified in a magazine or newspaper article. I wish I would've searched for those first. It had too much religious connotation in it. I respect that these people had a strong faith, but to read about it in every other paragraph was just ridiculous! Lastly, it was very repetitive.This is the one and only time I would recommend seeing the movie and not reading the book, but keep in mind Hollywood did change the story a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I have to say this is one of the most touching books I have read about true events in along time. THe love that is shown for between both krickitt and Kim and with god is just so touching and heart breaking at the same time. It is good to see such faith and devotion between two people and god. I'm glad they chose to share their love story with the world to give us hope that any couple can do it they just need faith in each other and god and that giving up is not possible! I thank these two for sharing their story (it must be extremely hard at times) and letting us see what true love is all about!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Vow","review":"The book sounded quite good ,reading the book it got into the story quickly.

This book it well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This was a very poorly written book. The story is amazing, but the writer could have written it more intelligently. He comes off as a hero who puts up with a crazy woman, when she can't help that part of her has been unwillingly altered. I felt like I was reading it from a 10 year old's perspective. I was thoroughly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed in this book.. I was drawn to it as it was a true story and seemed like it would be inspiring. Unfortunately, I did not like how the book was written.

I expected more of the story on how the rekindled their marriage but got a lesson in faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Uninspired and poorly written. To be honest I think this is due in part to the fact that book could have been much shorter. I was left with the feeling that this had less to do with the 'true life' aspect than with the fact that real people have to deal with difficult situations all the time. The writers seem to feel that writing about the role god played int their lives would inspire the reader but it was mentioned so often it made it seem trite and ended up demeaning the god they seem to be so fond of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Although an unfortunate story, not at all like the movie.","review":"I feel this book was definitely an inspirational story Christian wise, but those looking to read this book as a \\"Love story\\", to show how love and romance conquers all...will be a bit disappointed. They're journey through this hardship seemed not very romantic and loving to say the least, but more directed thanks will, and prevalence to God. As stated in this book, this was a story (not so much about Love) but to show the glory and power of God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching story","review":"This is great as a true story/biography type book. But it's good to about the mid-point and then it just sort of peters off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring read","review":"I really enjoyed reading this true account after seeing the movie. I was inspired to read about the strength of faith in God that was displayed throughout such an ordeal. Sadly, this was not depicted in the movie. It was encouraging and uplifting to read a true to life account of the value and commitment of a couple's marriage vows which are so easily tossed aside in our society. It speaks to me of the way that God intended marriage to be and how our faith in Him plays a part in our marriages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waaaaaay better than the movie!","review":"I loved this book; it was incredibly inspiring and gave me more faith about what it means to truly honor your wedding vows. I hated the movie, though, it was nothing like the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspirational story.","review":"An honest look at amnesia and the devastating effects it can have on even the strongest relationship. It is an inspirational story of how love can endure through harsh times if Faith is the foundation. Kim Carpenter's story about the highs as well as the lows is real and honest. He is not pious yet one is left with a a comforting sense of how the Christian faith sustains in the most awful circumstances."},{"rating":"2","title":"We made a Vow!!","review":"This is a amazing book of the trials and struggles of a young married couple that has lost it all except the living breath in their lungs"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Vow","review":"I loved this book because it is about how real life is sometimes but we must go on and make the most of it regardless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encouraging story","review":"This story is so full of hope.

This is an amazing inspirational story! This is what a marriage should be like. Everything is not perfect but they pull together and make it right. Kim and Krickett are dealt a hard hand, but together they get through everything that is thrown at them.Kim and Krickett Carpenter are in a car accident 2 months after they are married. Krickett is left with a brain injury that causes her to lose her memories for the last 18 months (not positive of how many months), she now has no memories of meeting, dating or marring her husband Kim. Now I have to ask how many marriages could survive this? Probably not many. The sadest part for me was in the middle of the book there are pictures of them from their wedding and honeymoon which Krickett will never remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Judge The Book By The Movie","review":"I had expected the book to be somewhat like the movie.

Now generally I will swear black and blue that the book is ALWAYS better. Unfortunately in this case, it wasn't to be.I started reading with high hopes. It must be an okay book if they made a movie of it right? WRONG.In short, I couldn't get past the first chapter. This does not happen often to me - I will read pretty much everything and anything.I can see why the basic story would have inspired a movie, and I can see why the screen writers, directors and producers took a basic premise and varied it largely to appeal to a much wider audience.I would not recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the movie. The basic plot is the same but the journey to get there is vastly different.I would recommend this book to someone who likes reading non fiction with deeply religious over tones. I assume they carried on through the whole story."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I'm glad that at least the book wasn't too long.

Her husband stands by her side to help her recover and to give their life a fresh start together, even though there are many ups and downs.

I also did not know how faith in God played a huge role in their second memories as husband and wife. God can truly make miracles happen and that is evident in their story. I only hope that my marriage one day can withstand the challenges like this couple withstood their challenges.

I will be fair though and say I don't normally like these kind of books. Not so into the memoirs and I don't like reading books about religion. With that aside, it wasn't all too bad. It wasnt great either though. I think I would have liked to see more conversation between Krickett and Kim, especially when they started dating again.

I guess I'm looking for a more Hollywood style story here that the movie clips make it seem."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"Was so disappointed in this book - for the first time in my life, the movie is a thousand times better. The writing was amature and at times, uninteresting, and failed to get into the grit and the heart of what happened.

Go watch the movie - you'll enjoy it much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mislead by the trailer for the movie","review":"After seeing the trailer for the movie adaptation, I researched the true story, found the book online and decided to buy it. I was truly enthralled by this couple's life story and I was very excited to read about how they got through such a trying experience. What I didn't realize is how much Christianity, God and prayer influenced the couple and how important it was to their story. As a non-religious person, I had trouble getting through the book since so much of it details their relationships with God and their faith. The section marked Krickett's Diary was especially difficult since her whole world wraps around something that I don't believe in. It wasn't a bad book per se, just not my cup of tea. Also, I was pretty disappointed with the writing as a whole and I often found myself taken out of the magic of their story because there wasn't a great flow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The beginning had me captivated and then lost my attention.

Two tracks from their two I Scream Records EPs, Hooligan's Heaven and Everywhere We Go, are tacked at the end.This CD complete ignores the bands Lost & Found Records catalog: Bulldog Style, Guilty As Charged, and Stompin' Crew EP. To be fair, the band sound changed significantly between Bulldog Style and Nice Boys Finish Last, completing the transition from hardcore to street punk/oi.My rating of two stars is based on narrow focus, not on the quality of the music. Discipline is one of the best street punk/oi bands in the European scene. The CD is a good introduction for those unfamiliar with the band. But for those who know how great Discipline are, skip this and buy the full lengths. (Finding copies of the two OOP I Scream EPs are not that difficult.

Well, a period piano in this case means that it was the kind of piano that Brahms knew and loved and wrote his music for. The pianist in this recording was more than adequate and the string players easily achieved a balance with her both in expression and in the actual sound. The texture is transparent and the expression both dramatic and natural. Try the scherzo movement from the quintet: the performance sounding beautiful and brutal at the same time, or, in terms of high romanticism, sublime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Music","review":"I bought this CD about three years ago when I bought my wife a personal CD player.

There are 9 books, and they LOVE them, even the boys! They're so well-written.

You will make memories with your kids and cultivate a love of reading in them and maybe in yourself that you didn't know existed. I thought I'd lost my love of reading when I became an adult.

He was so excited to discuss the new characters as they appeared in the book. We both look forward to the third instalment. I even bought the books to send to my neice for her birthday.

She thought it was so great that she immediately bought the rest of the series, which are just as good. This quickly turned into her favorite book. In this book, fairy tale creatures are still alive and well in Fairyport Landing, and the decendents of the original Grimm Brothers, who wrote the fairy tales, go on adventurous journeys to solve mysteries and save their their family.

Each day they begged me to read just a bit more because they loved the story. They especially enjoyed guessing what fairy tale each character was from. Keep in mind if you are an adult reading this book, it is meant for children. Yes, the characters are either evil or good and not much in between. These sorts of characters help children to make inferences and predictions, two important reading skills.My children laughed when we read because the characters are clever and silly at the same time.My goal for every book I read to my class is to get kids to continue reading on their own.

I was thrilled when she received the first two Sisters Grimm books for Christmas. She's taken them everywhere with her - she is totally entranced, and can't wait for the next book to come out. She does tend to like fantasy - her favorite movie is The Princess Bride, her favorite books are Edward Eager books, Magic Tree House, Time Warp Trio, and Spy Kids.

The picture quality does all justice to 8.1 Mpix category. The user friendliness is great as well. However there is one big minus with this camera, as much as any other electronics from Sony, ie., the battery is unique design and you cannot manage your outdoor photography while on vacation until and unless you have a spare battery. I wonder why Sony is so insecure in their business that is preventing them from adopting a universal AA battery pack for their devices. If a universal AA battery is used, one can very well procure the batteries outdoor in case of discharged batteries.I have stopped buying any of the portable electronic devices from SONY only because of this one BIG minus point.

Debs, so I waited with great anticipation for the arrival of this work. I was sadly disappointed. It IS a very interesting history of the times--but is rarely talks about Debs or much related to him. It is a misnomer to use his name in the title. If looking for a biography of Debs--look to The Bending Cross or Debs: Citizen & Socialist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment!","review":"This book was a big disappointment. I bought what I thought was a biography on the great socialist leader Eugene Debs only to find that it was a long winded, pretentious and disjointed meditation on the socialist movement and the utopian communities that led up to it.I don't know what Marguerite Young was thinking when she decided to tackle this project but it certainly wasn't a biography in the traditional sense. I guess I should have paid more attention to the words 'Harp Song' in the title because that's what this book really was- a bloody long harp song.I suppose that if you're a fan of Young's prose you might appreciate this book but for anyone looking to get some insight into the life of Eugene Victor Debs- you'll have to go elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"jesi's thoughts","review":"This has got to be like my most favorite book next to like two others.

If you need to completely cover your unit do not buy this. I was pretty ticked when I saw it had no bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Advertised","review":"This cover was advertised as made of automotive grade vinyl, along with the photos that show a blue vinyl cover. What was sent is not vinyl. It is a mocha brown canvas like twill.It was advertised as having fully welted seams. The one sent to me had seams coming apart, pulling away from the fabric.It was advertised as having a 100% fleece liner. This cover is very thin and had no such liner, and not one speck of fleece to be found.It's not a snug fit, with gaps and large openings everywhere. The straps that accompany the cover can only get so tight, but they only keep the cover snug at the points where the strap is against the unit, while everywhere else is allowed to flap in the wind.Cold air, bugs, birds, maybe even a squirrel or two, can still get under it.Basically it is a glorified hat for our air conditioner. It sits atop it keeping the leaves from getting in through the grills.

I love their whole catalog except for the Mighty High release (I just don't really like reggae). This album, while still good, is a little too experimental for me. That is not surprising, of course, given that there are so many guest stars. One or two of the songs get a little weird and dissonant. But overall, an enjoyable listen. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You gotta hear this one","review":"Like a lot of live bands, it's hard to capture the real essence ofGovt Mule on a studio recording. And indeed, there's a very differenthere than you'd hear in a live concert. But Mule has done a remarkablejob of getting the most out of each song. The studio setting allowsall the nuance to come through, yet the interplay between the musicianskeeps it all fresh and alive. Despite the wide range of styles andmusicians, it all still feels like Mule. Check out the extended jamon \\"What Is Hip?\\" or \\"Catfish Blues\\", or the soulful vocals on \\"HammerAnd Nails\\". Each song is polished up like its own little jewel, allowingeach to shine. If you liked Deep End Vol. 1, you'll love this one.If you didn't, what's *wrong* with you?And oh, yeah, go and see 'em live, too. They'll blow you away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good.","review":"This is really good album from one of the only bands around today making good, consistent, original and worthwhile music. I feel that this album is better than Vol. 1 because it feels more like a Gov't Mule album to me. Vol. 1 seemed like the Mule was catering too much to their guest bass players and didn't hold onto what makes them the Mule. Vol. 2 is more consistent with what I hold to be Mule-music, the guest bass players cater more to the Mule than vice-versa. With the exception of Greasy Granny's Gopher Gravy which is very obviously Les Claypool (but still a good song for Claypool fans) every song is an example of why I listen to Gov't Mule. There are some great covers on this album as well, Catfish Blues, What is Hip?, and Hammer and Nails. This is must have for any Mule fan and a great starting point for any one who enjoys music that is worth listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"I enjoyed listening to this CD another Gov't Mule classic Excellent to my personal taste Recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to snuff","review":"The guys have lost their fire.

Some great, some below par. This one by Sandow Birk would rate fairly high. Sandow Birk took Dante's world, modernized it and put it into his own words. The thing about the book that really captivated me were the images in each Canto. Each image relates to the text and is thoughtfully done.Another thing that was nice about the book was the easiness at which the text was adapted. One does not need a PhD to understand what is trying to be transcribed whichin each Canto. Although a PhD would be nice to have of course, not many people have such things. One does not need a dictionary to read and enjoy this book, much less a PhD, or a fish tank, whoa!

Anything is better than cement. I use it to soften the impact from the concrete and it works perfectly. There's just enough cushion to keep from being too mushy and preventing a timely jump while protecting my knees from solid ground impact.I also use it on grass to provide a smooth ground due to grass being too high or slightly uneven. It's durable enough to handle periodic rope smacks and continuous jumps without bunching up or wearing away.Also good for putting equipment on to protect carpet and flooring or to keep equipment from sliding around and some floor exercises; thicker than an average yoga and palates mat but not too thick to interfere with the workout.There's a comfortable thinness and a confident durability to it.

The author seems to think that he can innoculate himself against the charge of being a snob himself, by admitting to it once in a while. Fair enough. But it doesn't keep him from coming off as mean (as in his treatment of the author Phyllis Rose--how ironic that he would talk about her coming across as a snob in her wonderful memoir!) and judgemental (as in his treatment of vegetarians whom, and he annoyingly waffles on this one, he seems to conclude are a self-righteous lot who have made throwing dinner parties a nuisance).Mr. Epstein is at his worst when he goes on about his fascination with fashionable coats and cigarette lighters. Boring. And pitiable, really.Sorry, but Mr. Epstein's own glaring snobbery overshadows this book of warmed over observations on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain boring","review":"This book just did not hold my interest. It is a literary examination about snobbery in all its forms and root causes. Therefore, the author develops these ponderous essays on different sub-topics that dawdle and go nowhere. I could have cut the length of this book in half and gotten the same knowledge. The author's examples from his own life start to become tiresome. Instead, I wish the author had developed other, juicy examples of snobbery of the elite classes worth dishing about. I actually got on learning about snobbery from Toby Young's book, \\"How to loose friends and Alienate people\\", which shows the shallowness of the New York literary scene in the late 90's.I would recommend this book if you want to understand on a conceptual level what snobbery is about in its complete underbelly, but I would not recommend this book as an entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version unreadable","review":"After reading and loving the printed version of Epstein's FSJ, I got the Kindle version of his Snobbery. Beside it being tedious, redundant and covered better in other books (see reviews here), the Kindle version was filled with typos, letter substitutions repeated throughout the book (gready for greatly, tided for titled, for instance), incorrect punctuation, and various other misuses of the language. On every page! This made the book essentially unreadable. And me angry. It might be useful if editors could spend time with these Kindle editions but I fear no amount of editing could save this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author is a snob, too","review":"The book had some enjoyable and interesting bits, but the author goes on and on about himself to an extent that soon becomes tedious.

Epstein tells us in the first chapter that he is a snob - but he makes himself seem like a charming snob, reformed, almost repentant. NOT TRUE!This man drops name after name of people, books and artists (the more obscure the \\"better,\\" of course). He goes on and on about his fancy (then fancier) raincoats.

Nice for those who like to MP3 their music - each tune is self contained, as opposed to the dubbed mixes which feature strongly on other albums of this ilk.

Instead finding solace in their slow-fi for the millionth time. Opposing growth and moving forward.

Yet, Low hits the brakes and regresses to the same old thing and you like them. Chastising the for trying to be creative or dare I say upbeat....change is good.

A real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just when I thought it was over for this band.","review":"The great destroyer was what I assumed to be the fizzle to an otherwise remarkable musical career. Drums and Guns proves me wrong. This album marks Low's return to their signature slow and melodic style.

I raved to all my friends about this band who performs haunting pop songs at a snail's pace. How much power they had, even in their minimalism! I WORE OUT their first three albums.Their newer albums, however, are just not for me. Sparhawk and Mimi's vocals are often reduced to droning harmonic weaves. And I'm sorry, but I need a musical melody more than once in a while!Sonic Youth went through this phase, too. Great, memorable albums in the 80s and 90s, then experimental, unlistenable drone-fests in the 2000s because they established themselves and \\"could.\\"Hey, Low and Sonic Youth can do whatever they want. But I don't have to like it. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Return to Form","review":"After flirting with a more mainstream-friendly and commercial sound with \\"The Great Destroyer,\\" Low returns with an album that, to put it simply, sounds like a Low album. Yes, they experiment with electronic sounds and atmospherics, but the songs on \\"Drums and Guns\\" are unmistakably Low's.Before this album was released, I was able to hear some of these songs performed live in rather stripped-down versions. I think that the album versions of songs like \\"Violent Past,\\" \\"Sandinista,\\" and \\"Breaker\\" sound better than those live versions. I'm not as happy with \\"Dragonfly,\\" though. The atmospheric sounds on the album track only distract from what ought to be my favorite song on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review Low","review":"Why so many stickers on the CD?

There is, to the best of my knowledge, nothing else like it, and I have questioned just about every publisher's representative who has come by to visit my office!I have been using this book since its first edition and will be adopting the third edition for fall of 2009.

Just turn on a radio and you should be able to figure that out. Use your own brain and think for yourself. Why let some record company sleaze tell you what to like? Besides that, the chart that served \\"race music\\" in the late 40's only had 10 slots most of the time. This is a great CD, an excellent example of early R&B with that unique New Orleans flavor. The New Orleans scene played a major role in the transition of Jump and Woogie to R&B and then R&B to R&R. If you like that kind of music, you'll like this CD.

One thing I did want to praise was the excellent job that was done with Mr. Freeze. He had just the right touch of mournfulness to make you really feel for his plight. It makes me shudder to think about the [bad] job Arnie did in the movie. Also, this was a great series until the WB bought the show and changed the animation.

We tried it many times, but the two units don't want to connect.This technology is not as simple as Vialta wants you to believe it is.Also, I noticed that a lot of units are being sold through Ebay - another sign that the Beamer doesn't work for most users.And, Vialta doesn't have a forum in their website.

But this one is not so much a book of recipes or cooking techniques as it is a lot of pictures of wine bottles, Mr.Boulud's daily life and so on. Also, a lot of pages made up of huge fonts which say too little but look too much. Recipes are not good at all, if you can find any. For example between pages 240 and 260 there is no single recipe but a lot of photographs of everything except recipes. I personally wouldn't give a try to any one of his recipes.

It is interesting and yet almost sad at how technology and the future is hurting some of the ancient traditions and ways of life in China.My only complaint is that in the middle of the documentary, it gets a little slow, and I would have preferred to hear more about the actual country, but it's still a fabulous documentary.The narration is great, music is beautiful, the design and feel of the documentary is fantastic. All in all, I loved it and enjoy watching it very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting.","review":"Where to start. When I originally seen this I assumed it was an ordinary documentary covering history and culture. However, this wonderful series took a step in a different direction by getting more into the lives of current residents, and how current life ties into the history of the country. There are many comparisons of the original culture to currrent culture, including the parts of the country that are conforming, and the parts that choose to keep everything in its purest essence. Overall, you will enjoy learning of parts unknown in this very nicely captured and directed contemporary documentary.Also to note - the quality of the video is very nice - I would give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture is soft !","review":"I have been very happy with my HD DVD purchases so far (> 10 titles), but this is a real disappointment.

With the vast area that is encompassed by China, with its ancient culture and history; one would have anticipated more coverage of that rather than the excessive coverage of the country yokel who seeks his fortune in the big city and the young female olympic hopeful. Also, I have to agree with the other reviewer about the quality of the picture.

A large part of China Revealed was about a young Chinese athelete and her hopes of winning Gold for China in the 2008 Olympics and of a window-washer in Beijing and his travels home for Chinese New Year.

Not only is the original opening music gone, but so is the narrative which explained the premise of the show. Pieces of dialogue, and in some cases entire scenes, are missing.

There's plenty of following the numbers and pursuing bad guys, and violence and murder and mayhem, but little to tickle the brain. That absence gets overshadowed by character drama and interpersonal politics, and it made me long for the short stories of Dashiell Hammet or Agatha Christie, each of which had its own conceptual mystery that required the reader to concentrate in order to understand.

Finally I wish the novel placed more action in the U.S. on the struggles Jim would face from the economic meltdown rather then time in some Mexican forced labor gold mine.The financial meltdown seems to have little mention and I was unsure why it was even added.

Instead of making another disco album, Rogers & Edwards moved away from a heavy disco element into a funk & rock sound that created the edgiest and most creative album Ms. Ross has ever made. \\"Upside Down\\" is the perfect synthesis of the sound. The producers lay a funky guitar riff over a string section while Ms. Ross purrs away with sass and style. After this release, Ms. Ross moved back into more familiar territory with such songs as \\"Endless Love\\", \\"It's My Turn\\" and other more traditional Diana Ross sounds. But on diana, she created an original, innovative and edgy record that has held up better than most albums from this era."},{"rating":"2","title":"The One Post-Supremes Album to Own","review":"If one is to select Diana Ross's best release after her departure from the legendary Supremes, then this is the one to have in an audio library.

The only difference is Diana is singing lead instead of Luci Martin or Alfa Anderson. Anyway, I recently heard this album for the first time in 26 years, only this time on CD and the sound blew me away!!!!! The songs sound just as fresh as they did back then. Every track in addition to \\"Upside Down\\" and \\"I'm Coming Out\\" is a potential hit especially \\"Have Fun Again\\". Bernard's Bass playing is really kicking on that cut! I love it! Overall this album is a must-listen for any person who appreciates R&B music just as it was during the last year of the \\"Party Hardy Era\\" that was from 1977-1980."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loom","review":"My granddaughter liked the loom.

I couldn't really imagine a product (short of a needle and thread) that would fix a piece of fabric for under $10. But, this kit did a pretty good job. It basically consists of some glue-type stuff that you spread in the hole and then you pour fabric shavings on top to blend it in. The kit comes with a bunch of different colors that you can mix to match the color of your fabric; this being the trickiest part of the process. I happen to have dark charcoal colored seats, so the mix was pretty easy; black and a little white.

However, it really does everything it claims to do and is quick and easy to use. If there is any aspect of this product that is challenging, it is that it is the responsibility of the user to mix the perfect shade that will match your upholstery fabric. Granted, if your fabric is white or black, etc., then you have it easy. Mine is grey and I used the handy mixing chart, included in the purchase of the product. It looks pretty good...a far cry better than it did before I used the product. However, be sure that you are happy with your color match before you apply the color portion of this product. Otherwise, I am well pleased and find it to be a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Durable and easily noticed","review":"This product works OK. I used it on a buddy's 2003 Toyota 4Runner with grey cloth seats (i got a cigarette burn on the seat). The seats were checkerboard/crosshatched. He noticed the cigarette burn repair within 10 seconds of getting in the car. The fabric material also came right off within 1-2 hours. Compared to how it looked, it was a good improvement, but not good enough. Doesn't look that good and is NOT durable. For as cheap as it is, it's not bad. The repair isn't super durable, but there is enough to redo the repair several times. If you want a quick, acceptable fix, this is a good product. If you want a permanent, OEM matching repair that looks great, then unfortunately this will not be acceptable(you should get in touch with an upholstery shop or find a spare seat in a junkyard)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-written account of the Dover, PA trial.","review":"Edward Humes' Monkey Girl is a readable, seemingly factual account of the Dover Intelligent Design trial of 2005. Humes has done his research with respect to the trial, and if one is looking primarily for an account of only that, this work will suffice (and, in fact, is recommended). However, I am not so sure about his broader background with intelligent design/creationism overall. Although Humes gives a relatively evenhanded (and detailed) account of the trial itself, the careful reader will detect a fairly deeply embedded bias against the possibility of any ultimate creationist/design explanation of biological origins.Read this book more for the details of this single (albeit important) trial rather than for any kind of definitive resolution of the creation/evolution conflict..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tough read.","review":"Meandering narrative which jumps around all over the place and has no real compelling flow.

Humes is certainly pro-evolution and sympathizes with the plaintiffs throughout the book. His account of the cross-examination of ID proponent and \\"scientist\\" Michael Behe was enthralling.It must be said that the creationists, like \\"Dr.Dino\\" and Jim Groves don't come off looking good in Monkey Girl.

It's the best overview of the evolution / creationism \\"controversy\\" I've read to date. In addition to a very good treatment of the Kitzmiller V. Dover trial, this book gives great background information on the original Scopes trial, the Kansas School Board wars, etc. Why only 4 stars? This review is of the Kindle edition - which is in dire need of some corrections.

The characters were so well developed, and Mr. Humes made seemingly complex and tedious subjects - evolution and intelligent design - interesting and conversational. Definitely not pedantic.

The first few chapters keep you reading with mixed fascination and terror as you try to picture a human being melting from the inside out. Great writing. The book slows in the last half and gets a little more technical, but non-fiction does that because all life is not lived like a novel. I think the author does his best to satisfy (not offend) animal rights people.

Mr. Preston is a very down-to-earth, readable author of non-fiction.The book itself made me MUCH more aware of what a virus is. This particular virus, Ebola and its various strains, is extremely scary in that each strain travels a different way. Where one strain only passes in bodily fluids and thus requires actually touching a victim, other strains are airborne - you only need to be in the same room as a \\"host\\" or victim and you've got it.I passed the book to a co-worker to read when I was done. Halfway through, she caught a stomach virus and wouldn't finish the book! That's how realistic and scary it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrifying!","review":"This book was incredible, chilling account of the Ebola virus.

Then, in the last chapter or so, the author started inserting his pseudo-scientific/philosophical theories about nature and ecology. Aside from the fact that they make no sense and are logically flawed, they just do not belong in the book and stick out like a sore thumb after the straightforward, documentary approach of the rest of the book. Worth reading, but skip the last chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING BOOK!!!!!!!!","review":"It is one of the best books i have read.

The subject matter was both fascinating and frightening. However, I found that I was too often distracted by the redundant and heavy-handed nature of the prose. e.g. \\"The kill rate in humans infected with Ebola Zaire is nine out of ten. Ninety percent of the people who come down with Ebola Zaire die of it. Ebola Zaire is a slate wiper in humans.\\" Passages like the one quoted above reduced my overall enjoyment of the book.

So badly written, so badly structured and conceived. Besides some scanty but interesting information on the Ebola virus, the rest of the book reads like a bad B movie. The writer is desperately trying to \\"grip\\" you, to \\"shock\\" you with action and non-existent intrigue.What a waste... are all \\"techo thrillers\\" like this?

All should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book filled with information","review":"OK...I had to read this book for a science requirement so I assumed it would be extremely boring...But as I soon found out the book was one of the best I have read. It gave me a better understanding of the Ebola virus and its effects. It also talked of the spawn of the virus and its sister Marburg. It gave statistics as well as had a plot behind it. This book told true stories about the people who have died from the virus and the mystery behind it...It also spoke of the fortunate ones who have survived the virus. This book was great and learned more from it then I have any textbook. And I would recomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stilted And Artificial","review":"Richard Preston is a writer. This is how he writes. He writes choppy sentences. His sentences are short. He writes ten short sentences to make one point. He repeats things. He writes a story about a virus. The virus is what the story is about. A virus is a germ that can people or animals sick. Sometimes it makes animals sick. Sometimes it makes humans sick. Richard Preston wants to tell you about the Ebola virus. And if the writing in this review looks good to you, maybe you will be able to finish the book rather than heave it across the room in frustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hot Zone Review","review":"Originating in the depth of the African Rainforest, a peculiar new form of life has come to our attention. This monster is invisible to the human eye, acting in an almost ghostly way. It acts fast, spoiling its chosen host with no mercy whatsoever. The monster has been unleashed. A few of the most deadly viruses are the very monsters that will be brought to your attention.The book The Hot Zone by Richard Preston could be portrayed as a perfect example of a horror film. The only difference is that every single event and image portrayed in the book is true. Please be warned that this book has very graphic and grotesque imagery and is not suitable for people of a young age or people who have easily upset stomachs. My opinion of this book is that you will never get bored with it. It is full of many surprises and tends to lure the reader into its details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrifying... sometimes","review":"The first part of the book when Charles Monet goes to Kitum cave and get the Marburg virus is a good book, but after that the book keeps repetitive and goes out of the story so many times that is very difficult to finish it... but I did, the main story, the research of the Ebola, the way they keep everything in secret and how they work with the wild monkeys is very interesting if you can find that story (this book could be written with 150 pages less), but at the end of the book you will be as at first, nothing can be done against these two virus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy writing","review":"Not a bad book- the subject matter is innately fascinating, but Preston's writing is so poor that I was constantly distracted. In his attempt to be \\"novelistic\\" (is that a word?) he loads his scenes with imagined details- what a victim was thinking for example. He is fond of repeating himself ad nauseum, expecially with oh so clever metaphors like \\"It was a slate wiper, a population thinner, etc.\\"The single worst line in the book sounds like an intentional joke. \\"They wanted to do experiments on Ebola, but they didn't want ebola to do experiments on them.\\" If you can explain what that line means, please let me know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burns your fingers!","review":"I could not put this book down - well written, fascinating story, I highly recommend...I have little to add to what other reviewers wrote.

The book is well written with information and thrill and the same time. If you like to read a good biik I strongly reccomend it. The book it's self is about Ebola and Marburg and other virusus.

The book is terrifying but wonderfully intriguing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pandering to an audience.","review":"The author takes a non-event,and makes it into a best seller. Pretty impressive, huh? This is probably a good book if you know little about viruses, and can be impressed with learning some medicine. Unfortunately, I am a molecular biologist, and was already aware of the things that make this book interesting. That only left me with his plodding plot, and repetitive descriptions. If you want an exciting virus story, search out the book \\"Fever! The Hunt for a New Killer Virus\\" by John Fuller. It is much better written, more coherent, and more interesting. This is the story of the discovery of Lassa Fever in 1969, without the benefit of all the technology used in the Hot Zone, and it will have you on the edge of your seat if you are lucky enough to locate a copy. If you want to learn about medicine, read the Coming Plague. Although a little ponderous, it discusses many interesting diseases."},{"rating":"1","title":"How much is too much","review":"The Hot Zone by Richard Preston i can not say was a favotite. The extreme amount of details detracted from the novel itslef. I like the imagery, but it was so much that i was distracted from the story line itself. Also the constant jumping around from place to place and person to person caused a great deal of confusion. It was an intresting concept, but it was not written as well as it could have been.

The Hot Zone is my favorite. Biologists and civilians alike will enjoy this edge-of-your- seat thriller. The scariest part is that the story is true. Thrillers are most terrifying when they are true.

Great for people who liked the movie Outbreak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting, Informative and Terrifying!","review":"A novel about real people, in real situations. A deadly hot virus that has the potential to wipe out an entire town in a matter of days. A perfect blend of science and horror to keep the reader hooked, page after page. Preston terrifies the reader using vivid descriptions such as, \\" He leans over onto his knees, and brings up an incredible quantity of blood from his stomach and spills it onto the floor with a gasping groan.\\" Every chapter leaves the reader wondering, \\"What next?\\" so that they have to keep reading. The best part of the book is the chapter, \\" A Bad Day.\\" The only thing I didn't like about The Hot Zone was that at times Preston got a bit \\"too descriptive\\" and began to repeat himself.

This is a very informative, historical, and factual book. I love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and Terrifying","review":"\\"The Hot Zone\\" reads very much like a Michael Crichton novel, but the horrifying events it describes are all too real. Richard Preston graphically describes the effects of the ebola virus on the human body, traces the discovery of the different strains of the virus, and recounts a terrifying close call with the virus that took place on the outskirts of Washington D.C. Preston's style of writing may be a bit melodramatic for some subjects, but given the horrific nature of ebola, the dramatic tone seems appropriate. I disagree with some of the \\"our place in the universe\\" comments by Preston and some he interviewed for the book, but this doesn't detract from the effectiveness of the book. This book is not for the squeamish, but highly recommended for those interested in the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frightening non fiction","review":"This is one of the most interesting and well presented pieces of non fiction I have ever read.

Also, some of the \\"eyewitness accounts\\" got a little mixed up ( if you listen to interviews with Frederick A. Murphy, and others, they are a lot different than the accounts that came from them in the book ). All in all it's a good book, but if you already know a lot about the subject matter, you might get a little fed up."},{"rating":"2","title":"without thought this is the best book i have ever read","review":"I was in class last year and a teacher of mine brought this book into class and read only the first ten pages.

Keep in mind I am not one to just pick up a book and read. But this book caught my attention and from the moment i picked it up it didn't leave my hands. I read in the car, at school, and even when I went out to eat with my family. This has got to be the best book i have ever read. I'm on my third time reading it now. The book is just so good that you have to read it more than once to take it all in. If you, the reader have any doubts, don't. Get this book you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably one of the best books of all time.","review":"I could not put this book down. To think that this story is true is really very frightening. I have done a lot of study on the subject of hemorrhagic fevers since reading this book several months ago and I am convinced that the end of mankind is not going to be some sort of gigantic nuclear attack - I believe the end of mankind will come when the rain forests are cleared. It's obvious that a score of viruses and diseases thrive in the rain forests in their natural habitat. When the rain forests are cleared those viruses and diseases will have to go elsewhere to find a natural host, as this book describes, and with no biological weapons to protect us, our species will end. There are some places we are not meant to disturb and by doing so we are taking our lives in our own hands and risking it all. I highly recommend this book as a must read for everyone, especially our youth, our future, if there is to be one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is the BEST book in the world!!!!","review":"I had to read this book for my science class and thought it was the best book i have ever read.

I could not put this book down. I think there are many messages for readers (and non-readers, as well)concerning how quickly a pandemic can spread, how easily it can be brought to the U.S. (both in a matter of hours) and how totally useless and ineffectual current research and knowledge is concerning something such as Ebola."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing and creepy","review":"R. Preston really puts the Ebola and Marburg virus into complete perspective in terms of what effect it could potentially have on the world as we know it and what almost did happen to the world had a few situations not broke the right way. His writing and storytelling is superb albeit very repetitious at times. He constantly revisits what the virus can do and what it looks like. Very well done overall. I'd love to see this book about Ebola rewritten in 2009. How much would change and what has happened since then?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A novel that every medical student should read","review":"Preston did a wonderful and extremely serious investigation about Ebola, giving birth to an excellent book that you cannot miss!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled By Those Enticing Reviews","review":"Don't wast you time, money, or effort in reading this \\"book\\".

However, the book is so badly written it constantly took me out of the moment to marvel at the awkward construction.

I could scarcely put it down. Not only that, since it's a true novel, it made me wonder how easily this could happen again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent look at how close we came to ebola","review":"Ebola here? In the United States?!!! Yes, it happened. And it could happen again. Read about how close to a real outbreak we came. Sure, I've read better summary chapters in other books about this outbreak but if you'd like to delve into the world of viruses and how close we came to an ebola outbreak in the United States, give it a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hot Zone","review":"The story is about a virus that takes place in Ebola, S. Africa. The virus would overtake a persons organs by liquifying their organs. The virus did alert government scientists, so they went to s. Africa to investigate the causes of deaths in the local villages. The monkeys there had sustained the disease so the scientists flew them back to the United States to do research on them. Col. Jaax of the research laboratory at Fort Detrick ran the monkey testing. The monkeys displayed unusual behavior physically. Some of the monkeys had died."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but non-attention getting","review":"I was required to read this book in my Sophmore Biology class. At the beginning of the book I found it very interesting and desciptive. It kept me wondering what was next but as the book went on the antisipation seemed to stop. The last hundred pages or so were just full of facts. Once I set the book down I felt it more and more difficult to it pick back up as the book went on. In conclusion, if you are looking to do research on filoviruses such as Ebola or Marburg this book is full of information and it could be very helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Liked It Til the End","review":"I'm not going to give anything away, but I really enjoyed this book - was on the edge of my seat. And then reached the ending and threw it across the room. What a waste of time.

Very entertaining and well written. This guy has done his research!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting topic...horribly written","review":"R. Preston addresses the reader as if they are in grade school! Countless times in the book he overstates the obvious. ...The workers wore level 4 biohazard orange suits, they were called orange suits because they were orange...Gee thanks so much for that insight, I was confused about that. On countless other occasions he insults the reader with similar drivel! The topic was more sucinctly covered and therefore more interesting, in the Readers Digest summary. Do us a favor Mr. Preston, use your computer for games, surfing or counting your money but please do not use it for writing novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This book happened to be my Physics book to read and i thought it would just be some people trying to track down this deadly virus. I thought it would all be fiction and i'd wright a report and get a good grade. Turns out, this book is fiction, one of the scariest books i've read, and one of the few books that at parts i couldn't put down!Some parts didn't appeal to me as much as others (Thats why i give it a 4). I really liked the book and will encourage people to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hot Zone","review":"The Hot Zone by Richard Preston is a good book for educational purposes, but definitely not for entertainment or fun. I learned more than I ever wanted to know about the Ebola viruses. But I was bored, disgusted, scared and annoyed.It was really descriptive and gory. The way that the book described the way somebody died of the Ebola virus scared me to death!!!It also got really interesting and easy to follow until the end of the first chapter. Then I was so bored that I couldn't even follow the book. I couldn't concentrate.I ended up reading part of the book, then starting totally over a few times. I would read for a while then realize that I had been so distracted that I had no idea what I had just read.The book would build up a lot of suspense then nothing would happen.Once I read the book all the way through I realized that I had actually learned a lot, but I wouldn't chose to read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"goose bump alert","review":"I thought this book was great and a real eye opener. As a nurse, I can identify with the chain of events as this virus enters the human body. I was surprised to see even just a few poor reviews of this book, but it may be attributed to readers feeling of helplessness and the possibility of this actually happening. I rated it an eight instead of higher, because I felt that at times, he jumped back and forth between the similar viruses so quickly, that I had a hard time remembering which was which. I never knew or heard that any of this happened till I read the book and I guess mass hysteria is the reason for the hush. I highly recommend this book as an educational insight of what we might be facing in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I read this book when I was in highschool and have re-read it more than once since. I loved how the information was presented and the clear picture I got from descriptions(some not so pretty!)without it being overly wordy. This is not normally the kind of book that interests me but I really enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"There Will Be Blood","review":"Possibly the most frightening book I've read, The Hot Zone seamlessly combines horror, medical drama, and politics into one. Although the sections detailing the violent disease related deaths can get a bit gory and graphic at times, the book is never overwhelming as Preston intertwines the science and the story.The book reads easily and never losses its touch. I found all of the parts equally entertaining but especially enjoyed the whole Virginia deal (seems to ever more satisfying with all of this swine flu business). In the end I would recommend The Hot Zone to any one in need of a little near disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Great book - hard to put down.

This includes the reviews by complainers, who criticize this book for various pedantic reasons. (See - I can use big words too.) Don't listen to them! Yes, the author does repeat a few facts, but they bear repeating.The Hot Zone is a thriller from beginning to end! Time flies by as you race through the pages of this book.

Dube's accelerated 10th grade history class. The Hot Zone Is an awesome book that should have received multiple Awards for skillful penmanship. Mr. Preston fills this book with horrifying details and the scariest part is that it is all truth. The Hot Zone has even been commended by our one and only Mr. King. I love this book and recommend it to anyone who is interested in non-fiction works of literature, except to those who have weak stomachs. The Hot Zone is a tantalizing thriller which I couldn't put down until I'd finished the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"What would you expect from a reporter?","review":"Nothing like a sensationalistic, glorified, half-truth... Although an interesting fiction tale, this book comes nothing close to the actual events that transpired in Reston, VA. You want a real virus book? Keep looking, this one isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the worst book I have ever read.","review":"I have never read such mindless drivel. If anyone has ever actually read this, they know that it is all gore with little depth. I could not relate at all to any of the characters. There were a few areas of suspense, but the entire lack of a climax was enough to turn me off. Which brings me to the worst part of this book. The ending is the most uninterseting, suspensless, and useless I have ever read. Avoid this book like the ebola"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it was too long and boring","review":"This book repeats itself in every chapter,...people die from Ebola or The Marburg disease....monkeys die, people die, and that is it... I would not recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Queestionable - Needs fact checking","review":"I overlooked the obvious error in his creatively defining \\"first space\\" and \\"second space\\", then ran smack into the equally creative geographical relocation of Reston, VA.The author (or editor if there was one) needs to do some basic fact checking. It is difficult to take what is supposed to be a factual non-fiction book seriously when obvious, easily verified \\"facts\\" are in error. It casts serious doubts on the factuality of the remainder of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen better hands on a clock. Preston=zero talent","review":"On of the worst I've read. Mostly dramatized unrelated segments of ibola virus outbreaks but just really poor writting makes you wonder how this stuff gets to print.

Enjoy the yacht Preston."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gruesome, Bloody, and Unstoppable","review":"I must say that I find this book revolting. I don't find reading about gruesome, bloody, incurable viruses enjoyable. I DO NOT recommend that anyone read this book. My dreams of ever visiting Africa have gone up in smoke.

I had to read this book for english and I thought when I first got it that it was just another dull book that we had to read. But then I started to read it and I thought that it was really cool! Richard Preston is an excelent writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand why so many people love this book.","review":"I really don't. Preston's style is rather tedious and doesn't do justice to a fascinating topic. I do like how his images all give the reader a sense of doom; it seems that one could catch Ebola from anything in Africa. However, it does not make up for Preston's boring style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curiously overrated","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. Several industry reviewers ranked this in their top 5 books of all time, so naturally I thought it was a must read. Yet, I thought the book was extremely boring, and could have been condensed into about one-third of its size by eliminating all the surplus and uninteresting details he included. I contrast this effort with On The Beach, which is also often listed by these same industry reviewers in the top 5 scariest books, and which really does deliver. This book would have been much better as a semi-fictionalized effort than as a total non-fiction piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hot Zone","review":"I think that this is one of the best books I have ever read in my life. It keeps you reading and you never know what will happen next or where they will go. I like this book because it was about a deadly deasise (ebola), I'm very interested in this kind of thing because its not something you run into every day. I think that Richerd Preston did a great job on detail in this book wich is essential to make the reader interested for a long amount of time. I have read this book numerous times just to read it. I give it a 5. that is all."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong edition","review":"this book came to me with the correct words and the correct book it was just a different edition than i thought i was ordering and the page numbers were different from everyone else in my class so reviewing the book by looking up quotes was a pain and i did not appreciate it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Hot To Handle","review":"Being force to read this in my English class I must say was not my teacher's best choice. I base this only on the fact that there was more in-detail gore than your average horror film, but reflecting back on Hot Zone I know understand that the extreme details were there because this is the cold hard fact. People have died from these natural events and will still die in the furture. Even if the human species considers gaining control we will soon have to relize we can't gain control of the uncontrolable.

It starts out talking about one of its (the Ebola virus) victims. It tells how he possibly got the virus and how he died from it within days of contact. It is pretty freaky. It is slow in the beginning but will speed up near the end. Overall I would recommend the book if you are able to handle it."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT! And more frigteningly, a true story!","review":"One thing that the summary, and even the following reviews failed to mention, is that this book is completely, and totally based on documented fact. How do I know this? I'm in the United States Army, and when I went through my 91T AIT, one of the persons involved in this (SSG Kurtis Klages) was an instructor of mine, as well as having met many of the other people involved. This happened, people! Nothing stated in the book is false as far as I could find, and believe me, I did my homework. Heck, the thing's about my job!There are viruses out there that could easily take out 90% of the world's population within 6 months. Comforting thought, huh? But that's why we're here, and we do what we do.

Understanding and cherishing the Catholic Faith gives you enough confidence to share it with others. Many of us Cradle Catholics take for granted most of the beautiful legacies from Christ to the church. I encourage every person that wants to understand the Sacrament of the Eucharist (Real Presence as some know)and discover trough Reason, History, and Faith Christianity. The book contains Historical evidence as well as scripture evidence on the teaching of Jesus Christ to his apostles, and list up a series of Eucharistic miracles that science can't understand.This is a great book to teach even catholics about the last will of Jesus Christ.

Otherwise, the design is puzzling at best: grip handle is not completely encased in plastic and gets hot through the metal part - be mindful else you'd burn yourself. The little lid pops out with vengeance, too tight and requires too much force to open. The spout mechanism can mandate the use of both hands at times, because it's clumsy and inefficient. The trigger should have been built within the grip and actuated like a gun trigger, with one hand. Lastly, the grip handle cannot be folded to the side, like a proper kettle's handle should - perhaps to prevent injuries, however, it could have been designed with a built-in indexing spring so the folding action requires some force, rather than be absent completely. A simple design akin to Copco Zingo's, if properly implemented with stronger materials and better craftsmanship, would blow this kettle right out of the water.

I was looking for a more advanced/comprehensive view of chokes and varied applications of techniques that I could incorporate into my training. I believe that my training in various martial arts as well as my expectations played a part in my disappointment with the book.

It is easy to read and keeps the reader's attention from start to finish. The book proposes that there is one type of innovation (namely radical innovation) that is beyond the reach of big established firms. As a result the authors suggest that big firms should leave the task of creating radical new products to smaller firms. The book is full of advice for managers of small and big companies alike. It is a must read for senior managers as well as policy makers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suggestion for those who found this book lacking in sufficient details","review":"A suggestion for those who found the thesis of this book interesting, but were put off by the amount of detail and examples (as two reviewers complain below): I suggest augmenting this book with Reid Watts' \\"The Slingshot Syndrome: Why America's Leading Technology Firms Fail at Innovation\\". Watts' book was the first to propose the link between creative industries and radical products (and is acknowledged as such on pg. 176-177 of \\"Fast Second\\"), and is very worthwhile reading for anyone seriously interested this subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Analytical.

Maybe my profound disappointment in the book has to do with the high expectations I had. But even without high expectations, I do not think I would appreciate this book. I found the ideas to be nothing new and found the writing rather insipid. The lack of inspirational ideas and the dearth of memorable passages were made even worse by the author's veiled recommendations of drug use as a potential road to enlightenment.

Both had serious manufacturing defects.On one, the supplied RCA cord was bad (no sound at all). I replaced this with one from my junk box and all was well.The other had to be returned. (Aside, one reason I buy from Amazon is their excellent return polices). There simply was no sound to the left earpiece.While a population of two, of course, is insufficient to make a lasting judgement, it does seem the factory fails the soldering/crimping test. :)The purpose of these was simply to allow my wife to watch/listen to TV in the middle of the night without awaking me.

Hence the absence of comments on sound quality.. except to set them up (or try to), I have never had them on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but too prone to interference","review":"Overall, these are very nice headphones. The sound quality is nice, the connector-less charging is nifty, and the fact that the power is switched on when you put them on is very convenient.However, I never really felt comfortable with them on, they always seemed a little too loose and there's no way to adjust the fit.The major reason I returned them was the static. I needed them to listen to music while working and while practicing my electric guitar. As I moved around, I was getting constant buzzing, static, and clicking noises depending on my position. I could turn my head or move a bit and it would go away, but it just wasn't workable to hold my head in one position to get good sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"When the headphones worked, they were wonderful.

I know it's not the input device because I can plug in a set of wired phones into the same device and it sounds fine. Turning up the output volume of the device it connects to does not help. Actually the RCA phones which were the cheapest also were the least noisy. The Sennheisers broke after less than a year (sound only came out of 1 earphone). Fortunately I returned the Sonys right away for a full refund and got the Amphony digital phones (the $99 dollar model) and the Amphonys work great with no noise. The only reason that I gave 2 stars and not 1 is that they have good range and the noise issue may be tolerable to some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy. Very noisy.","review":"They are s*** Buy if you like the experience of listening to a FM station from 500 miles away in a 40 year old Volvo (I'm sure some do).

You can't drown the background noise, it get's proportionally higher with the volume. This is not even Chinese quality, must be made on a ship. Even if you ignore the hissing, the quality of the sound is worse than earplug models. No depth, no bass, no nothing, excuse my inability to talk in hertz and stuff.BTW, let me smack Panasonic too. These wireless Sony headphones were supposed to replace some wired Panasonic ones I've had a while. Boy were those s****y too.

There's no way they're legit.Cons:- constant static, regardless of volume/channel adjustments on either the headphones or the device (either TV, computer, etc).- constant interference, even when I moved it away from my other electronic devices. The manual even states that other electronic devices will cause interference. So, what's the point then of having them, when the only time you'll ever use them is if they're wired to other electronic devices? Dur!- non-adjustable headband: I have a pea-head and they constantly slid down the back of my head.- short cords.Pros:- they look good.- they have soft vinyl ear pads instead of that horrible foamy stuff.- they're cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for privacy or hearing difficulties","review":"Bought this set for use with a new HDTV.

It charges effortlessly, hooks up easily to our HDTV and is an excellent choice for my needs. I'm 66 and have difficulty picking up dialogue when I watch movies. With the headphones, I can adjust my volume to suit my needs while my family sets the TV volume however they want it. It's also great for solo watching with other people in the room- the TV sound can be muted while I hear everything perfectly. I can even walk into the kitchen or bathroom without interrupting the sound. My only complaint is that the sound knob on the headphones is a little difficult to turn, but it works fine. I would not recommend the phones for audiophiles as the bass is not full. That actually helps with voice recognition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like it","review":"I don't like it because it starts to adjust the frequency channel automatically, by itself.

Extremely poor sound quality, with background white noise and extreme feedback as I moved about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Unreliable Battery","review":"These headphones are pretty good when they work, both quality and range. But unless you use them daily, you absolutely cannot rely on the rechargeable battery. If you use the headphones at exactly the moment a recharge is complete, it will work fine. But if you have not used them for several days, but left the headphones in the cradle (supposedly to recharge as needed), they will NOT continuously recharge. In fact, they will almost always be dead. Not a very good design. I have many Sony devices with rechargeable batteries that never lose a charge until the battery gets old (my wireless phone and my rechargeable universal remote control).

Avoid these like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed emotions with Sony Wireless Headphones","review":"I replaced my MDR-RF970R with the RF970RK because the \\"R\\" headphones were worthless.

Also, the headphones are huge, they are 1/4 the size of a Imac's screen.Very bulky and cheap looking. I wouldn't recommend these to ANYBODY. Also your mp3 player or media player always has to be hooked up to the base which is very bad for travel or if you have a ipod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good experience","review":"Reception was poor with consistent static, popping, and a tinny, squealing noise.

White noise is almost equally loud as the music I am listenting to, it is impossible to enjoy your music with this headphone.I didn't expect great quality in the first place but this is really bad. I don't usually write bad review for something I buy unless it is really bad.Don't waste money on this product, save money and buy something that in the range of 200~300.If you think that is too expensive, stick to regular (with wire) headphone.

The first Headphone is used with my plasma TV connected to a digital decoder that is connected to my TV using digital output. The second set is connected to my CRT tv using Y RCA connection.

Battery life is ok, we have had them in use for marathon tv watching over several hours; only static is after a few hours of use or when the microwave is in use. Overall I was pleased with the purchase, but am looking forward to the upgraded version that are supposed to be lighter and has an on/off switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"$89-down the toilet!

If the static wasn't enough, the base stopped charging continuously after a very short time. If I unplug it & plug it back in, it will start charging again, but then will stop again before the next day. The last time I tried to use the headphones, they had no charge & they haven't been left off the base or been used more than 2-3 times..ever!

But these Sony MDRs turned out to be a bad substitute because they have such poor sound quality. Listening to the TV is a distracting, unpleasant experience because of the tinny sound of these headphones. You feel like you're listening to a pocket transistor radio from the 60's. They totally lack the warmth and depth of sound my Sharper Image pair offers. Needless to say, I have returned these for a refund.

I have received an email request for repair charges (it never worked!) that exceeded the purchase price. When I called Sony back they indicated that this was an error, but they have never shipped the replacement. I spent two hours today on their customer support line (not toll free, by the way) but never got anywhere. Ultimately, the call passed their magic quitting time, and they then told me to call again tomorrow.Their support structure is dismal and disorganized. If you get a working unit, fine.

So, for a pair it's 66.00. I can buy a new Base and Head phone for 67.00. I've only found one source for them and that's Sony Parts. I've tried to get someone to verify the cost as I might believe that there might of been a problem with input of the price, but none is interested.

I fiddled with the power cord and finally got a transmission. Every one of the channels was filled with static. Not just a faint background noise, but loud crackling over everything.

Another negative is that if anybody in your immediate area has the same type of headphones whatever your listening to is interrupted by the other persons audio. If I could give it a negative star I would. Here I'll do this instead -*P.S.

I wanted to love these, I really did, but there's simply too much radio interference in an office setting. There are only three channels to choose from, and sadly none seems to provide any respite from the almost constant static buzzing of radio noise in the background. I had hoped that having the transmitter nearby would drown out noise, but even at two feet away there's too much static to be able to listen to anything without going mad. These headphones may work fine in a home setting with less radio noise, but it's a gamble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"After having used an older model of Sony's Wireless Headphones for several years and being very pleased with them, I decided to make an upgrade by purchasing a newer model. That was a mistake. First off, these headphones did not fit perfectly around the ears as the older model did, although I realize this could be due to the size and shape of my ears and not the headphones. But the bigger problem was the sound quality. While I experienced slightly (and I stress slightly) less background static, the audio quality was horrible.

It took a while to tune them. Now whether I mute the sound or turn the sound down on the receiver I get a click and then the sound cuts off for 2 or more seconds. I don't mind the click but I do mind the cutoff. I could lose important dialogue. My primary use of headphones is for TV viewing. Did I do some thing wrong in the hookup?

Sound is very good, but the battery only lasts about four hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good headphone","review":"Really good headphones. I bought it for my elderly mother, because she was having difficulty to listen to TV. The best feature of those headphones is that you don't need to do anything to turn them on and tune them to the transmitter frequency. Just take it from the cradle and place on your head. That's it. Earlier I tried to get my mother other headphones that required to turn them on and to tune the frequency every time you want to use them. My mother could not handle them especially the frequency tuning part, because you need to do it while the headphones are on your head and you can not see the controls.The only bad thing that can happen to those headphones is another device (say a wireless phone) that is close by and operates on the same frequency. In that case the quality of sound goes down and you experience unpleasant static noise. Otherwise it's a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy, poor quality sound not worth the ease of wireless","review":"I bought these headphones 8 months ago for use with a computer, primarily for listening to music. I really wanted the wireless feature. They are sleek looking with a very cool charger, that uses magnetic induction to charge the headphones. They also come with an XLR adaptor and the standard headphone 3.5mm jack.These headphones are terrible. They pick up so much noise music sounds horrible - noisy, static-y, crackles, etc. You find you would rather not listen to music at all than use these. Despite my really wanting the wireless feature, I find myself plugging in another pair of headphones instead just so I can enjoy music.Don't waste your money. This product is so bad it's soured me from buying other wireless headphones and Sony products in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"loose fitting","review":"Headphones took FOREVER to charge ... decent sounds, but the fit is horrible. the \\"self adjusting\\" headband to keep it tight to your head ... forget about it !

These headphones are no good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great But Bulky","review":"I bought these so that I could hear the TV from across the room without having to turn up the volume so much that everyone else in the house had to listen too. I found that these do a good job but the headphones are bulky so they don't work well in bed on a pillow and I think they would work better for someone with a larger head. I haven't tried connecting them to a radio and wearing them while working in the yard so don't know their range.I think it was a good buy and would buy again.One thing I found was the TV volume must be set high, otherwise the headphones will shutoff. I later learned this is covered in the instructions. It pays to read them. Anyway, the solution is to turn the TV volume up and then adjust the sound volume with the headphone volume control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Sound, Poor Fit for Small Head","review":"Wireless headphones sounded like a great idea to me as I have always had to use an extension cord for the headphones on my stereo. My last two pairs have been from Sony, so I thought I'd try these for free from a rewards program. Everything set up fine, but the audio quality was poorer than my old, cheaper wired pair. The volume was weak with little bass -- any high volume (either on the stereo or earpiece) resulted in distortion. It could be my small head, but the earpieces wouldn't make a snug fit -- not noise-cancelling in any way."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the headphones","review":"I do not find many of the annoyances written by other reviewers. I like the headphones. The only problem that I have is that the wire provided for connecting the headphones to the receiver is way too short. It requires the antennae/recharging station to be placed next to my stereo receiver. My stereo system is installed on shelves built into the wall. The headset mounted on the recharging station does not fit on my shelves. Fortunately I have a room behind the wall where other electronics are housed and where I was able to locate the antennae/charging station. Because the wire is so short I cannot conveniently locate the unit to use the recharging station; alkaline batteries must be used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Met my high ecpectations","review":"While visiting a friend I used his and they worked very well.

The plastic is lighter, the ear cups are smaller, the sound is lower quality, and it just feels cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visually great - audibly useless","review":"I ignored comments regarding noise feedback in account of user error, however the only error is on Sony's part after trying these myself.It's an attractive product, so much so, I almost kept it - but the noise feedback undermines anything you attempt to listen to. Sound is unclear and bass leaves you desiring something more.Try a Bluetooth product instead and save yourself the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hissing, buzzing, crackling.....disappointing","review":"Not sure if the people giving this set a good review have any idea of what good headphone sound is. I have cheap $20 headphones that hiss less and have the same sound quality, better bass and are just as comfortable. On top of that, the bass in songs is completely lost on these. DO NOT BUY IF YOU HATE HISSING AND HEADPHONES THAT TURN BASS INTO CRACKLING CRAP SOUNDS.

Music is a real problem - either I turn it up which annoys our condo neighbors or I'm tied to hard-wired headphones. I was really looking forward to going wireless.The first step was to charge the batteries for 16 hours. Once that was done the headphones worked beautifully - excellent sound and comfortable to wear. But, after maybe six or seven hours of usage over two days, they quit. OK back on the charger for another sixteen hours. Zero. Zip. Nada. Niente. Nothing. Stone cold dead. So I sent them back.

I called customer service about getting the discounted shipped and they kept transferring my call. So I sent the headphones without the discount and payed $20 instead of $10.

I have a lot of experience installing and setting up home theatre systems as well as car audio systems so I know a good deal more than the typical customer. I say that only to get the point across that I did in fact set these headphones up properly and adjusted volumes levels appropriately. The cold hard truth is this: these headphones have absolutely terrible sound quality. I can listen to AM radio stations in my car and get less static. Very poppy, with come and go sound. I tried multiple channels and relocating the base station to absolutely no avail.

So far he hasn't been able to use it. He called the number for help that was in the instructions. That rep gave him another number. Then the second rep gave him a third number to call. Then the third rep told him to \\"go online\\". My Dad is 74; he does not go online. So Sony has been no help. I live far away, so I can't look at the setup myself. I asked him questions, went online to find answers, asked him more questions. Finally figured out one of the problems is that the cable to connect the unit to his television is too large for the TV's line out, which is where it has to connect in order for both of my parents to hear the TV. Does anyone know if there is an adapter available?

I also have a set up that prevents me from plugging the headphones into my TV. Anyway, I was relatively pleased with my prior pair of Sony MDR-IF540RK headphones that had inputs for both RCA as well as one for 3.5mm. These last pair of Sony headphones have similar input options but the quality of audio is intermittently inaudible and at their best have a low but constant static even within a few feet. What makes my situation worse is that I left the headphone box out and someone in my household discarded of it so I can't return them though Amazon always does a remarkable job in resolving issues with a faulty purchase when they can."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?

I WISH I would have listened to negative reviews instead of wasting my time with these terrible headphones. I had expected Sony to have a way better quality item than this!!!! These are going straight back to Amazon. By the way the range on these things is ridiculously small....if I walk more than 10 feet away from the base unit they cut out non-stop.

It would be a better design if it had a dedicated on/off switch instead of using the extension of the inner headband to turn unit on/off. Finally stopped working altogether.

Then turn the volume up on the TV or other device you have them hooked up until audible through the headphones. All the noise and hissing disappear. The headphones are crystal clear if you do this.

A waste of $20, which is what I paid at Best Buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Previous reviews","review":"I was in the process of purchasing this cd but changed my mind based on the reviews of others. I looked over the title tracks again and realized that most of them were based on Christ. I will make a more precise review once I have purchased it and listened to the tracks myself as I too intend on celebrating the birth of Christ during this holiday season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something FRESH for Christmas","review":"Not at all what I expected from WOW, but a pleasant surprise. Interesting takes on old favorites and some new material from current Christian artists. Had the car stereo up a bit too loud and Avalon's Winter Wonderland nearly blew the glass out of the windows (what a horn section!). If you want a diversion from the old standards (would somebody please strangle the next person who plays Holly Jolly Christmas!), this cd is a refreshing escape from the mundane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice mix","review":"There is a nice mix of styles and songs on this CD. The only disappointment is some of the more secular/traditional songs, which you can get on other CDs done better by other people. But it's definately worth having."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the way to keep your focus on the reason for the season","review":"This CD is alright. The first disc is so much better that the second. The second disc is all about christian rock bands trying to make the season \\"cool\\", but ends up sounding as if these bands don't care for the season (or the reason for the season)at all. Save your hard earned money or spend it on some of the CDs from the artists highlighted on the first disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love Christian music and I love Christmas music, so I thought this album would be the perfect combination for the holiday season and I couldn't wait to pop it in and usher in the yule tide. I was sorely disappointed. I can appreciate the effort to update traditional music and put a fresh spin on classics, but most of these songs were nearly unrecognizable and that's not what I want in my Christmas music. I want to spend the season listening to beloved favorites and sing my heart out to them for the month or so that we have together...Not scratching my head and trying to figure out the music. I was also surprised by the R&B flavor to a lot of the songs. Again, nothing wrong with that genre of music, just not what I expect and find comforting in my Christmas music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few gems, but disappointing overall","review":"There are a few standout tracks here -- \\"This Christmas,\\" a rap tune, turned out to be my favorite, somewhat to my surprise -- but most of this compilation is forgettable. Some are so overproduced and over-arranged that they're almost impossible to listen to. Not a good investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ex-Lax Metal","review":"Old, old, old school death metal.

Mr. Johnstone's way of writing a story pulls you in and gets your mind moving to the possibility that maybe there are things going on out there that we don't know about (its only a thought).

It was cheaply made using mostly pictures of The Game taken from the internet with a not so experienced narrator in the background that didn't have all the facts right or in order. The only decent part of this horrible DVD was the reenactment of The Game getting shot in his apartment if you take out the bad acting and really fake blood. I wouldn't recommend this DVD to any The Game fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uh-oh. Not as good as Series One","review":"There are some great scenes in this series too but it does not live up to the predecessor. If you watched Series One, you need to buy this to find out how it all ends.Ruth Bannerman is played by a diferent actor who makes her seem like a weak, silly woman. In Series One she possessed great style, spirit and confidence despite her vulnerability and the acceptance of the shoddy treatment meted out to her by Charles. The script lets the new Ruth down too, by the melodramatic paranoia about dying in pregnancy like her mother.The replacement for Stephen Bannerman makes his character seem completely shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mercenary - you're killing me","review":"It's not good. I LOVE the good doctor, but he must have been hurting bad when he recorded this weak album. It's hard to listen to - uninspired arrangements and incredibly redundant phrasing.

Plus, Rhoden is narrowly looking at African-American athletes. What about all the soccer players? And one could convincingly argue that those thousands of multi-millionaire black athletes have, through their unions, indeed altered and do control the game in which they play. Unforgettable title though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greaaat Book","review":"This is a must read for all black/minority athletes. This book gives insight of whats really goin on in the world of sports and it helps you understand the struggle of black atheletes from day one. Black athletes need to wake up and smell the roses and start coming together so we can take over this market that wouldnt be able to survive without us.This book also gives insight on how whites and jews have been getting rich for years off of black entertainers, athletes, rappers, and singers. As long as we stay divided they will continue to make more money off us than we make for ourselves. Books and stories like these in this book should be included in every history book in America. Finally somebody tells the truth of what went on and whats goin on and whats to come ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Read","review":"I had to read this book as a requirement for one of my graduate classes and I absolutely loved it. I honestly didn't think I would either because I really didn't know what it was about but it did provide an interesting perspective on the black (African American) athlete and how they have \\"progressed\\" through the sports arena. From some of the things that were said/mentioned/suggested, I never really would've thought of it but some of the things that were said, made a great point. This book is also great because it details African Americans throughout history and in different sports. I would not only consider it a history book but also an informational book that I would recommend for anyone to read just because I was so moved by reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"40 Million Dollar Slaves","review":"Rhoden examines how today's Black athletes, with all of their wealth and status, are just another type of slave, with the playing fields being today's plantation. A good history lesson is found here, in addition to the author's ideas about how today's Black athletes should collectively unite for a stronger presence in sports organizations, not just from the player side, but as far as management/ownership is concerned. Rhoden gives us brief glimpses into the stories of Black athletes like Tom Molineaux, Rube Foster, Lusia Harris, and relates their impact on sports. Of course, no book about sports would be complete without a piece on Michael Jordan. This is a very informative read. Well worth an addition to your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"educational","review":"This is an excellent book that gives very insiteful information on known and unknown practices in professional sports."},{"rating":"2","title":"NBA or Plantation?","review":"While some may find this book to be a bit controversial, it provides an interesting analysis of African American athletes and a history of slavery."},{"rating":"1","title":"The whole premise is a joke....","review":"Who exactly is forcing these people to go down the road of competitive, for pay athletics? And what exactly is stopping these multi millionaire athletes from becoming owners themselves? Starting a new league? Branching off into other enterprises that would create opportunities for others? The athlete, with rare exceptions, enters into these agreements with universities and pro sports teams of their own free will, and if they don't prepare economically for a future that doesn't include pro sports, they have no one but themselves to blame. Rhoden wishes these athletes were \\"slaves\\" so people would more buy in to his spew about racism in society...doesn't seem like the \\"unfairness\\" he laments hurt the pursuit of his dreams any..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reverse Racism","review":"I have issues with racism in any form but I find it equally as offensive when books like this come out which try and make a race out to be victims.In a nutshell, if someone is complaining that they are being taken advantage of and still being paid 40 million, or even 1 million, one has to ask themselves, \\"Is this guy for real? How stupid does he think we are?\\"I place the authors intentions of writing as fair and just, but somewhere along the line he corrupted the concept into something grotesque, offensive, and just plain wrong. I could have read and Ann Coulter book and been less offended by the implications."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is BS from the word go.","review":"Because of the distorted context in which this subject has been presented, I can say nothing good about this book. Under this convoLuted resoning, would Black athLetes be any Less a slave under BLack ownership? I think not. WouLd White athLetes be sLaves under BLack ownership? I think so.

However, I found the writing to be poor and I totally couldn't relate to the main character. I thought the author made her this totally unrealistic woman (who thinks like a sex-crazed man), and I found it very hard to really get into the book or feel any sort or connection to the character (unlike a Bridget Jones, where she totally thinks like a real woman!) I also thought the the story was extremely unrealistic (I mean, seriously, hiring an investigator to interview all of your old boyfriends and ALL of them happen to say the same thing?

After seeing Keith perform live on Kenny Chesney's tour, I went out, bought his CD, and now can't stop listening to it. Every song on there has a unique sound to it and they are all very catchy. You'll get addicted once you listen to it once. It's an incredible album and Keith's talent shines through as he wrote/co-wrote almost every song on it and plays a numerous amount of instruments in every song. His voice is captivating and so are his eyes! A must have for any music fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden boy shines","review":"Keith's superb talent as a country artist shines through in this album. Listening to every song on this album touches the heart. A wonderful gift given to this artist who has used it with grace. Congratulations on such a collection of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Dust for this Golden Road","review":"Keith Urban's \\"Golden Road\\" cd is one that gets you singing, toe tapping, thigh slapping and just simply having a great time listening to it! I have thoroughly enjoyed the cd and found each song leaves a feeling of thinking Keith has been looking into my life.The cd takes you higher and higher, never dipping low with love songs to fun songs to moments of something to think about.I applaud Keith for his talent in guitar playing and love of song writing. His voice is beautiful to listen to as well.If you haven't listened to the cd yet, go out and buy it and I guarantee that you won't be disappointed!It isn't traditional country music and it isn't pop-country either. It is Keith Urban and his style that leaves you wanting much more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not even a country fan","review":"I like all kinds of music, but I grew up as an alternative fan from the 70's...Yes, ELP, David Bowie, but I also loved Jackson Browne, The Eagles and Motown. This past summer I was flipping channels and came across a Country Music show. Gretchen Wilson was singing Red Neck Woman and it caught my ear. Next came Keith Urban and I was blown away by his personality and guitar playing that came across on screen.Based on the reviews I decided to order Golden Road. I LOVE it. Every song on the cd is good, and I find myself humming the lyrics. Then I purchased Be Here...it's great too.I noticed a fan website last week and checked it out only to find that Keith Urban is in LA this week. I booked tickets, then talked my husband into going:) I can't wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't have to be a country fan to love this CD","review":"Keith's mastery of the guitar really shines through on this CD. He gets away from the fiddle-and-steel sound in his first solo CD, and the only thing separating this from a rock album is the banjo that is audible on about half the songs. His electric guitar screams in \\"Somebody Like You\\" and \\"You Look Good In My Shirt\\". At the end of \\"You'll Think of Me\\", a ballad of lost love, his string work is absolutely haunting! When was the last time you listened to a ballad to hear the guitar? Get this CD, even if you have never liked country music. There is something here for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden Road","review":"I found this cd to a done with heart and it is music that will touch you in a way you have not experenced before.I enjoy all the songs on this cd.

Even if you're not a country music fan, you can't help loving this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"AUSSOME ALBUM!!!","review":"I absolutely LOVE this album-it's Keith at his best! This album shows more rock and looseness than his previous releases and he says that it hows more of him. He said his previous albums were about letting himself out a little bit and this one was letting more out. And the difference can definitely be seen. \\"Golden Road\\" is more country rock to me, as far as songs like \\"Somebody Like You\\", \\"Who Wouldn't Wanna Be Me\\", \\"You Won\\", and \\"You Look Good In My Shirt\\" go. But Keith can tune it down just like that with beautiful ballads such as \\"You'll Think Of Me\\", \\"Raining On Sunday\\", \\"Whenever I Run\\", and \\"You're Not Alone Tonight.\\" Then there's the in-between stuff: \\"You're Not My God\\", \\"What About Me\\", \\"Song For Dad\\", and the remake of the pop hit \\"Jeans On.\\"The songs deal with love, beating addiction, losing love, God, and pure fun and shows Keith's amazing songwriting skills as well as fantastic guitar playing.\\"Golden Road\\" is a MUST HAVE Keith Urban album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyable!","review":"I must admit, I was totally unfamiliar with Keith Urban when I ordered this CD! As a fellow Aussie who likes country I was a little intrigued by a guy who is unknown over here, but managed to make it big in the \`States.I have to say, I'm pleased with the purchase!It is a little overproduced, & Keith obviously set out to make a record that would sell, but hey, what's so wrong with that!It's catchy & fun, & Keith has a great voice! I intend buying his other albums on the strength of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest \\"feel good\\" CD ever made!!!!","review":"I would highly recommend this CD to ANYONE! No matter what kind of music you are in to. All of the songs on it inspire and make you feel good all over. You can't help but speed a little bit when driving down the road and listening to some of the upbeat songs such as \\"Who Wouldn't Wanna Be Me\\" or the mega number one hit \\"Somebody Like You\\" A speeding ticket would probably be the only drawback to this CD! I have seen this man live and met him and he is so talented and such a wonderful person. He is grateful for everything in his life and it shows and comes through in his music.

This compilation is packed with funloving style and heartfelt emotion, which Urban is so well known for delivering in his concerts. It contains music that will make you jump up and dance and also tracks that make you think about life, its lessons and the importance of it all. The guitar and ganjo stylings of Urban are masterpieces and this is a Golden find to anyone seeking true country, heart and soul and a touch of Dylan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow the Golden Road","review":"I knew when I bought the CD, Golden Road, I would not be dissapointed. From the first track, \\"Somebody Like You\\" I could not put my headphones down! It then moves on to \\"Who Wouldn't Wanna be Me\\"...again toes continue to tap. For you slow song lovers, there are a few. But, Keith fans know him for his guitar licks, and you get plenty! 'Blue Jeans On', \\"What About Me',and of course the number one song \\"Somebody Like You\\" which has a neat ending you don't get on radio! My favorite on the album, and you will love it too, is \\"Raining on Sunday\\". The song is about hoping one day of the weekend can be spoiled so lovers can spoil each other. There is also a hidden track on the cd \\" One Chord Song\\". And you have to buy the CD to see what 'chord' it is. \\"Golden Road\\" has to be one of the best country cd's to be released in 2002. Go find out for yourself!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keith Urban = Country Music's Golden Boy","review":"This CD offers a whole spectrum of musical styles and emotions.The first time I listened to it, I realized that it would be an all-time favorite. Being that I listen to modern rock - not country - I was quite surprised by how inspired I was by it. Every song evokes strong emotions, whether good or bad. There's upbeat, downbeat, happy, sad, sappy, etc. without being hokey, like stereotypical country tends to be. Keith is so passionate about his guitar work and vocals on this CD, that you can just tell he's genuine in everything he tries to convey. I think that \\"Golden Road\\" is a must have CD for ALL music lovers, not just country fans. I cannot recommend it enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's got the GOLDEN touch","review":"Forget Midas, Keith Has the touch that turns everything to GOLD. This album has everything from beautiful love songs, inspirational and kinda rockin songs. This is just a feel good CD. There is not a song on it that does not reflect what you are or have felt at some time and I think as a songwriter, keith is extremely talented, not to mention how he jams on that guitar! He has turned me from a country music hater to someone who listens to it frequently and I am in the process of buying all of his previous music. If you like this CD check out his earlier work with a group called the ranch. The musical style is relatively the same and is quite good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keith Urban a very talented artist.","review":"Golden Road is one of the best selections of music I have heard in a very long. Keith Urban sure did hit it big with this one. \\"Somebody Like You\\" has a great \\"up\\" beat. My husband has turned to country music all because of this song. My favorite song on this cd (if I had to choose one) would be \\"Song For Dad\\". It makes me think of my dad every time I hear it. Thank you for writing this song Keith. Way to go Keith. KEEP THE HITS COMING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Aussie","review":"Golden Road from Keith Urban is an awsome CD. I have never been so impressed with someone that I have heard very little from. He is definitely on the rise. He is not the regular sound you hear from the country musice circuit. Dare I say he is a little radical, which is so great in my opinion. I love that he doesn't stick to the country music rules. He bends them to the way he wants to and sings the kind of music he wants to. I respect him because he loves what he is doing and it truly is HIS music. So Keith better hurry up and get another album out because if it is anything like this one, people will be lined up outside the doors waiting on it. Absolutely GREAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Aussie Does It Again","review":"Keith Urban ... an incredible musician, an incredible voice. Buy his music, you will not be disappointed!

I've listened to this cd so often that my 2 1/2 year old son is learning the words to the songs. Keith Urban has what it takes, the voice and the looks.

I purchased it because I had heard the song, \\"You'll Think of Me,\\" and the line about \\"take your cat and leave my sweater\\" just jumped right out and got my attention.

I have thoroughly enjoyed the almost anti-romances the author writes as M.C. Beaton in the Hamish MacBeth and Agatha Raisin series. Ms. Chesney/Beaton is deliciously clever, is a master of the setting, and is absolutely merciless with her characters. And she must write these books with her tongue firmly in her cheek."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but unsatisfying and not worth the price","review":"I bought this book based on reviews and the sample Amazon provided of the first chapter. While it was a fun read, the book lacks much in basic story telling. The author does a masterful job of describing the stagecoach and the storm, but then seems amateurish in her handlng of the plot and detailing of her characters. The plot is simplistic and without surprise, the characters are one-dimensional. Not only does our author too often tell us what they said rather than allowing them to say it, their inner thoughts and reactions change direction so quickly and so often that it became hard to take any of them seriously. In the end, I was convinced that the book had been written a century ago by a housebound lady dreaming of adventure but with little knowledge of how to tell a story. As I said, it was a fun read but for this reader, definitely not worth the Kindle price Amazon is charging."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Read","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will buy the other books in this series. It is funny, has romance, just simply heartwarming. Hannah Pym (The Traveling Matchmaker) is delightful, she is a 'busybody'; Sometimes you need someone like her to move your life along. At first I thought I was reading the wrong book however once Ms. Pym is on the Flying Machine & introduced to the other passengers, her matchmaking adventure begins ---Miss Emily Freemantle, a spoilt violet-eyed beauty fleeing an arranged marriage to a rake she has never met ----Lord Ranger Harley.

This one is still very interesting and full of great insight, but covers a period and the making of an album that was high stress and low enthusiasm. It shows.There is a great deal of reference to Syd Barrett - including a photo of him in the studio in his unannounced and not-immediately-recognized appearance - and the fact that \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" is all about him; the source of much of the sorrow and depression evident throughout.Still, I'm glad to have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any Floyd fan.","review":"This isn't an exciting vid, by any means.

Some highlights include details of the burning man photo shoot and some honest dialog with Roy Harper. Commentary from all four members added some great flavor. Sadly Rick Wright's footage had some age but his inclusion is completely necessary and gives this documentary a completeness.

Ever tried to shoot a fox or rabbit with a shotgun from 45 yards? How about while it's running? How about while being attacked by a bobcat? How much fun does it sound if all the animals gather behind the lodge and you can't fire within 50 meters of the building? What if you need a scope or water & food for longer endurance and you have no money left to buy them from the \\"store?\\" This game is slow, incompetent and an insult to the great graphic on the cover. That's the game that Cabela's is playing: lure us in with overly-dramatic cover art and then just as we spend an hour lining up an impossible shot at a barely-visable target...attack us with a mad-animal engine. It's sooooooo fulfilling. Adding further injury, the game is filled with dozens of banners that encourage the gamer to buy Cabela's products.

You start out walking from the lodge, you see a musk ox, you are finally able to get off a shot and the game is over because you fired your gun within fifty feet of the lodge. You try again and walk farther this time when you hear a snarling, growling noise and realize you are being attacked by something because your energy bar is going down. The display says, \\"You have been killed by a bobcat.\\" I tried this game for over an hour and thats all the farther I got. Oh, once when I was being attacked by something, I started firing blindly and I heard the wolf yelp...never did see it, mind you...and was fined again for shooting too close to the lodge. During the tutorial I once shot a bear and the graphics were awful. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Historical Read","review":"If you can overlook the Creole vs. Person of Color discussions below, you'll find this mystery hard to put down. The author has done a great job of capturing the historical flavor of New Orleans in the late 1800's. The main character is very human with all the interesting quirks of a real person. The \\"ladies of the evening\\" and \\"soiled doves\\" are multidimensional and the plot turns and twists will keep you reading late into the night."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mystery for people who like their history","review":"Absent a time machine the best way to wile away a few hours in the past is through good historical fiction. \\"Chasing the Devil's Tail\\" transports readers to the famed New Orleans district of Storyville in 1907. Author David Fulmer deserves plaudits for his historical research alone. He re-creates the sights, the sounds the lingo and the language. Further, the author peoples the story with engaging, fully realized characters, none more engaging than the protagonist, Valentin St. Cyr. (The book also features real life characters such as famed jazz musician, Jelly Roll Morton).Add to this a ripping good mystery about a series of murders that too conveniently point to St. Cyr's best friend, musician Buddy Bolden.Fulmer leads us on an intriguing journey, placing a Rosette Stone in the path early on. The resulting conclusion is surprising but plausible.An excellent read on many levels. Great debut by Fulmer, may he write many more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Crescent City treat","review":"As a frequent visitor to New Orleans as well as a fan of all that city's great music, I am always interested in fun fiction that covers this territory. I picked this book up on a whim and was amply rewarded -- not only does Fulmer bring historical characters (such as Buddy Bolden, Lulu White, and - very briefly - a young Louis Armstrong) alive, he places them perfectly in their city in their time (the flooding, the banquettes, even the use of terms like \\"lucifer\\" for what we now call a match). Well written, with believable people and good musical description, this was just a not-to-be-put-down read. OK, maybe it's not quite \\"Coming Through Slaughter\\" (Michael Ondaatje's masterful recreation of Bolden's life), but it beats the hell out of a lot of other mysteries that trade off the Crescent City's allure. This reader eagerly awaits Fulmer's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read.","review":"New Orleans is a fascinating city. Fulmer does a remarkable job of depicting the sights, sounds, smells and social structure of that city, particularly the \\"red light\\" district of Storyville. I learned about jazz and Buddy Bolden, of whom I'd never heard and who is considered to be the father of jazz. But I also became involved in the very good, page-turning story with strong, memorable characters. If you are a fan of American history, jazz, New Orleans, or just love a really good book, I'd give this one a try. For me, his second book, JASS, is already on my TBR shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear David Fulmer,","review":"Alas, David, you have done us wrong!! Imagine penning an entire book based on New Orleans and a \\"Creole\\" detective, yet apparently not knowing the meaning of the term. Why do you refer to St. Cyr as a Creole of 'mixed race'? That is NOT the meaning of the term Creole!! A creole is a person born in the West Indies or Latin America, who is really of European ancestry, particularly Spanish. It may also mean a person of mixed Spanish and French ancestry. Anyone familiar with New Orleans, or Louisiana in general, knows a person of mixed race is NOT referred to as Creole. Give us a break.

He tries this, that, and the other to get her to love him, to no avail. Only at the end when he's ready to sacrifice his life to a waiting mob does she crack. True, it's a fantasy, but Zehowah's absolute refusal to have any feelings for Khaled is hard to take. This was Crawford's favorite of all his books--which is also hard to take: he wrote much better ones than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doug Daniels","review":"Hot Off The Net is the first published collection of the very best erotica found on the Internet. Most of these writers have never been published before, and as is usually the case, the newest writers have the freshest voices, bringing a wondrous new twist to sexuality (and don't we all like our sexuality a little twisted?). Fiction and philosophy, poetry and prose, commingled and soaked in every imaginable fetish and taboo - from S/M to sex on death row, voyeurism to the inner life of venereal diseases. The writing in this book covers the spectrum from straight to gay and lesbian, bisexual, trisexual, and sexualities for which there aren't yet any words. A staggeringly terrific collection.

Not a biopic, but close similarity to Carole King's rise to fame."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Movie.","review":"'Grace of My Heart' was a wonderful movie, with a poigniant message. It chronicals the life of Edna (Illeana Douglas) through the music that she writes. Illeana Douglas gives a stirring performance, she seems to age along with the character, as if the movie had actually been made over 12 years (the amount of time the movie covers). John Turturro masters his role as Joel, to the point of making you forget he is the same man who played chess in 'The Luhzin Defence' or stuttered on television in 'Quiz Show'. Matt Dillon also creates an unforgetable character.Grace of My Heart makes you feel all of the right emotions you can feel in a movie: joy, sadness, shock, humor, suspense and also feel content. Its realism is surprising, while its ideal-worldishness is masterful. It blends the shock of the real world with a utopian zest that very few movies can gracefully achieve.A superbly done movie, that I recommend to everyone that has ever had a dream, and strived for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grace of My Heart","review":"I thought this was an excellent movie and Iileana Douglas gave an amazing performance. I also like Matt Dillon and thought his portrayal of Jay was a good one. It reminded me of several movies with the similar theme of \\"A Star is Born\\" with Judy Garland and James Mason and also the movie with the same name with Barbra Striesand and Kris Kristofferson. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys music or who is in the entertaining and recording industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Love the plot of this movie...It's not the same cookie cutter story that's been overdone in Hollywood time and time again.

After about the 6th time of having viewed it, totally inspired, I went to my piano and wrote a song. Excellent story, great music and super acting. I love Illeana Douglas. She came across as such a likeable character. It's hard to believe that she didn't actually record the music. For Real did a great job and sounded so much like the music of the 60's.

Terrible marketing by WB."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warner is doing it all wrong!","review":"TAS was a revolutionary piece of animation that was looked at as a modern masterpiece. It had great writing, great music and adult themes...so why is Warner Bros. treating us, the audience the same way they treat their looney tunes audience???It's a guarantee that if Warner Brothers released the series properly, (ie. By season, in multi-disc box sets) they'd increase their sales ten-fold. The episodes sell themselves. Extras are nice, but unnecessary. A featurette on a bonus disc, that'd be great...but at this rate...WB is turning more fans off to buying the discs than increasing the selling power of one of their greatest franchises.No big surprise though...these are the people who made Krypton look like the crystilline entity and let Brockheimer turn Batman into a campy display of neon icecapades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show - weak DVD's ...","review":"WB really give the impression that they are totally uninterested in doing anything even remotely special with their valuable Batman properties on DVD.They know there is a market out there for season boxed-sets of this show (due to repeated requests made to them from the public) - why would they choose to ignore this?My advice would be to vote with your wallet and wait until WB wake up to themselves and treat this award-winning television show with the respect it fully deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is a better way","review":"I recommend that you all follow my example and just download episodes of Batman: TAS online. If Warners is going to screw the hardcore fans over like this, they deserve to have their product illegally appropriated, until such time as they see fit to make it available legally. I have 41 episodes already in addition to the five from the last DVD. It's either that or wait until I'm too old and blind to even see the freaking television before I can get the whole series the way Warners is doing it, the rat bastards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pity someone else didn't have the copyrights","review":"It makes me pretty mad when a company like Warner Brothers can take a fantastic series and treat it like trash while ripping us off. Rather than give the consumer any value for money and release Batman - The Animated Series in season box sets (like most other TV series), they've opted for the tight-wad approach and decided to give us a few episodes at a time. On the plus side, at least we have some episodes on DVD - which is why this earns one star! Take my advice and wait until they release something worthy of your money. I hope you are taking a good look WB. Get ya heads out of ya butts!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the Heck?!?!","review":"It's pretty clear that Warner Bros. is trying to just capitalize on the kiddie market with the treatment of the animated series of Batman. It's too bad, a lot of the series' fans were teens, young adults and older who now would love to have the whole series on DVD. I have several dozen of the old episodes on VHS, commercials and all. It's too bad I don't even have a VCR anymore! I'd like to catch up on one of animation's triumphs of style and substance, but I won't waste money on what's being offered. It never fails to amaze me how they will try to get moms to pick up a Batman movie for their kids rather than please the original fans of the series. WB take note - the fans of the series who used to watch it on TV now have jobs and money to spend on boxed sets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS!

My friend bought it and I borrowed it to see if it was worth having at all. It isn't. It hurts to think that Warner Bros. doesn't think highly enough of its fans to treat such a gem of a show with such half hearted effort. I wont go into the details, the other reviews are more than adequate in outling the complete absence of any redeeming value of this disc.I fully support my disappointed comrades and will say that Fox will continue to get the bulk of my money on DVDs until Warner Bros. can come up with a box set release thats worthy of the Batman series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible series - another disappointing DVD","review":"\\"Batman:The Animated Series\\" is literally everything I could want from a comic book adaptation. In fact, I would say it remains the best comic book inspired TV series or movie ever made. It stays true to the characters, tells interesting stories and has some of the finest animation around. A truly groundbreaking, amazing series.Which is why it is all the more disappointing to see \\"Batman:TAS\\" get such a lackluster DVD release. Like all TV shows, it should have been released in Season Box Sets rather than in this manner. Even as it is, the extras are slim to none, and there is nothing to really recommend this DVD. I hope Warner Bros will correct this error, and give us some Season Box Sets. Until then, I will decline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Series, Terrible Treatment","review":"5 episodes a year, with no special features? That's how WB is choosing to release this GEM of an animated series. Unbelievable.

I had a big tear (1/2\\" x 3\\") in my vinyl car seat. This kit had everything I needed and the repair came out pretty good: you can tell it's patched, but I'd say it's 80% or so. Looks better than the piece of electrical tape I had on there before.

My boat vinyl is neither white nor cream, its an off-white type color (technically its called 'bone') and trying to color match was impossible.

Don't buy this product it doesen't work, if you do you will be very disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete garbage and waste of money","review":"This is probably one of the worst leather repair kits. But it doesn't surprise me, because it is branded by Loctite, one of the worst brands when it comes to anything. 1.) You will not get the right shade of your vinyl/leather, no matter if it is pitch black. That is dependent on the user, so that part I can understand. But 2.) the patch will not stay \\"patched\\" for more than a week or so. Mine came off after a week and a half. I think a general rule of thumb is to stay away from anything made by the Henkel corporation. I don't think these guys have ever heard of \\"quality\\" or \\"customer satisfaction\\". If you think all of the 1, 2, and 3 ratings are a joke, when you do decide to get your kit, just take a look at how they have printed out their instructions. If they can't even print out their directions in a straight fashion (the directions were lopsided!), then you can expect everything to go downhill from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Urgent! Pay attention to the reviews!","review":"I gave this 1 star, but only because that is the lowest rating. Ladies and gentlemen, unless you have red, white, or black upholstery to match, this has no hope of working. The instructions tell you to make a small amount of the paste and match it to the leather or vinyl. Problem is, you start with their color chart, and the instructions as I followed them did not even come close to the chart, much less my car seat. No amount of adding base color (white) could fix it, and then, I ran out of white. That was it.Take my advice. Follow the recommendations of people here. They have made the mistake of buying this product and then reporting on it so that you would not make the same mistake. It seemed to me that there was just no other product to do this job. That means one thing: There is no product to fix this. Call an upholstery store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Rick and Europe","review":"What can I say? My husband and I have always used Rick's guides when traveling to Europe. I enjoyed this book because it shows you a side of Rick himself that you don't have time to get to know during his TV shows. It brought back memories of places we've been. And while reading, I made a list of places I still want to go. I just wish I could have read it before I made my first trip to Europe. It shows you more of what to expect. Which for us has always been just wonderful! The book is not a tourist guide like the others, but an insiders guide to Rick and his experiences. As for the humor, I found parts very funny. It shows a side to Europe that 2 weeks of vacation will never reveal.

It feels forced, has the feel of 'publish or perish'. The put-down of the power of now (mentioning people were making great amounts of money with it) smacked of jealousy; using a word such as 'next' which suggests space and/or time and allegedly follows 'now' is tortured. Clever, of course, but not intelligent. The author appears to grasp at straws (or some newly invented concept) to engage the interest of prospective readers: what can possibly happen after now? Other than more now. I just did not want to jump down that rabbit hole! And calling non-duality dual? Perchance desperate for ideas?

I adjusted mine in the room and it took about 10 min and I had to use a tool to do it. Completely unacceptable!I can't find one positive feature to be honest, they are worst than cheap goggles from a dollar store!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but ...","review":"I recently bought two pairs of these goggles -- one pair for me, the other for my wife.

Usually waves rip your goggles off your face. These goggles snapped in half at the nose brace / spacer. I've had 10 or more different types of goggles on open water swims and I've never experienced this. The nose brace popped off (and I wear the goggles with medium tension). Goggles were lost (they sink). I usually wear Sable and it takes herculean strength to pop the nose spacers out to replace them. And my aquaspheres don't have spacers. These didn't work as expected.

I am not an ethnomusicologist, but I have always had a fascination for the indiginous and folk music idioms. This is one of the main reasons I purchased the recording, that and because I am Italian by heritage. Needless to say this music really spoke to me. In it I could here the echoes of my proud and noble ancestors. Like the people who produced it, the music is passionate, lively, energetic, and earthy. In short a must for anyone searching for a little piece of unspoiled Italian soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ugly Americans","review":"Jeez, so sorry that actual, authentic Italian folk music doesn't go with your \\"authentic\\" Olive Garden appetites!! The ignorance, the insular isolationism of the average American never ceases to amaze. For gosh sakes, are you disappointed that Alan Lomax's recordings of Appalachian folk songs and Delta field hollers don't sound more like Camptown Races??Lomax was a musical anthropologist, whose avocation was recording the indigenous music of global cultures, of which this recording is an example par excellence.

The singers are not professionals, the sound quality is very good - so you hear every straining note from the \\"artists.\\" This would be a good album for an Italian language teacher, to explore dialectical differences within Italy, but beyond educational pursuits, I wouldn't reccommend this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"i bought this expecting songs like you'd hear while eating in Olive garden or lively Italian songs, you know, like what everyone thinks of when they think of Italian music, there are about one to three songs on it that sound similar to that kind of music, but the rest are elderly Italians chanting at high pitches that sound dark, strange, and not what you want if you want Italian music. I agree with the other review, maybe for an Italian teacher, but not for me, and if you want lively Italian music, not for you. [the price] is way too much, and I wasted it! errrrggggg!

This is a poor track incorporating biblical references that have little relevance or sense of genuine compassion to the katrina disaster. Musically the lack of emotion conveyed by the unnecessarily complicated chord changes and irrelevant reference to Sade also make the feel of this track disjointed. While Prince fans will generally hype this track, the reality is that \\"4 the tears in your eyes\\" this isn't and to add a charity track with an instrumental showing off your musical skills is just pure self indulgence and frankly crass.

It just wouldn't work. The additional mixes are not much different. If there's anything good to say, it's that I'm glad Vanguard didn't try to dub any other vocals.

Much of the music just drags and the classic songs sound much more like they originated in a bowling alley lounge rather than in the hearts and minds of one of the best R&B; groups that has ever played a note."},{"rating":"2","title":"FIVE STARS FOR TEMPTATIONS LIVE!!","review":"I'm a very young Temptations fan (19 yrs old), but let me tell you, if I was alive back then, I would have been FRONT ROW at the Roostertail!!

His vocals are crystal clear--just listen to \\"What Love has Joined Together\\", the opening medley, etc. And Paul Williams just SHINES on \\"I Want a Love I Can See\\" and \\"Don't Look Back\\". I would love to have had him sing DLB to me!!! And David Ruffin---the man was a master at his craft. The only thing better would have been a video!!! I would be first in line for that!!This lineup of Tempts was the best and no other lineup will ever be close to the Classics!! Classic Tempts forever!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!

This is a 2 cd set with cd #2 being live. It is really hard to define there music but there is some very good guitar playing especially in the live cd. The muscian's are tight i guess you could say they play a lot of different music pop/rock/a little country/blue's very good stuff. If you want to try something new from the 70's i would suggest this. I like to find old stuff from that time period that i like and this was worth the price. The opening of the story behind Mendelbaum on the liner note's state's mendelbaum was different. Musically led by the lighting fast ripping lick's of chris michie's cherry red 1968 gibson sg special. He write's most of the song's and his solo's are tight. There are five member's in the band guitar organ bass keyboard's and drum's. Very fresh music from the 70's i hope you like it as much as i have good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Green World- book review","review":"The Green World , by Richard Klein, is a terriffic book on plants and their significance on society.

It's ok - it's a historian's sin he cheerily admits up front. So Paris's informal political communication networks of gossip, handbills, songs, subversive literature, et al. focuses on ... well ... the King's sex life.

Buy this camera if you dare but be prepared to \\"babysit\\" the batteries for the rest of the cameras life. . The batteries will die UNBELIEVEABLY QUICKLY, predictably and consistently. This fact cannot be underestimated enough. It was a bad investment.

What really made me return this camera was when I shot my 20th photo the camera started to make sizzling sound. It when on for 10 seconds until I popped out the batteries.

The skies were less grainy than with some digital cameras, a common problem.The movie mode could be better, but it is better than the average for a digital camera.The large LCD screen is great for shots of smaller moving subjects.Please note: You will need high powered NIHM rechargable batteries for this camera, as with most higher end cameras and especially as the S1050 takes only two batteries.

Unfortunately for the reader the book digresses into a lengthy exploration of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The author condemns scroll research and promises \\"great revelations\\" as more of the scroll appears. This book is at least 20 years old, and as far as this reader is concerned, these revelations never came. The author jumps to many conclusions based upon the discoveries up until the book was written with inadequate documentation of his findings.

Unfortunately I had already traded the CD back to my boyfriend for some cheezy German rap CD I had purchased for him. What a mistake! I ended up rebuying Winona and listening to it enormously. It's remarkable. I think the only reason I didn't appreciate it right off was based on the dilution of bad music exposure which resulted in a confused reaction to true brilliance.

This one is more complex, musically and lyrically, than \\"Acadie\\" and shows that, in addition to being superproducer to the superstars (U2, Peter Gabriel, and, recently, Bob Dylan), Lanois has spent a great deal of time honing his own talent. Still, his own music is very much like the work he produces for others-- it's not about the latest fad, it's about stimulating, challenging music that will stand the test of time.

It wasn't until I had gotten half way through the book did I realize that although there was chemistry between our heroine and this outlaw nothing was happening.

I did two colored pencil portraits within about 1 1/2 weeks of getting this book and everyone raved about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colored Pencil Portraits: Step By Step","review":"This book got me started on colored pencil, it was my very first introduction to the medium. Ann Kullberg through her enthusiasm is incredibly motivating- with carefully thought out step by step techniques and beautiful paintings to show you exactly how she achieved each effect. She goes through every process of creating a portrait in colored pencil starting from a blank page- learning the tools; to composition; right up to the business of selling your work. Ann is also very humble and took the time to answer all of my questions personally when I wrote her a letter. It was because of this and the great joy I got from working through her lessons I went to one of her workshops. She is a patient teacher who will not hesitate to help another-sharing all of her secrets. Ann Kulberg is of great strong moral character and a master of her trade. I would recommend any product she has created."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Anne Kullberg Method Opened New Doors","review":"After reading the Kullberg book on colored pencil portraiture, I found myself enjoying my work more. I have sold portraits for years and years and have never had as much fun as I am now. The Kullberg method is so simple. Her work is beautiful. By using her methods my sales have increased 75%. I am so glad I discovered the Kullberg method. All of the years of formal art training did not teach me what I learned from this one book. Thanks Anne!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Portrait Book","review":"This is one of the best books I have bought on the art of creating a portrait!

I can't wait for the next book by Ms. Kullberg!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ann Kullberg","review":"Ann Kullberg is one of my favorite artist. Over the past twenty or so years I've followed her career.

I'm considering flying in for some classes from this great artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straightforward","review":"This book is pretty straightforward and offers a lot of ideas and a few tricks here and there. I especially found the skin-tone section extremely helpful, where you'll find every ethnic tone along the scale it provides. Perfect for those who work with Prismacolor pencils...probably trickier for those who don't. I only wish there was some information about using other tools alongside the pencils themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventurers journey in the 1950's to Cocos Island","review":"Interesting story about a group who journeyed to Isla del Cocos in search of the infamous treasure in the 1950's.

I usually find NOW products to be reliable and of high quality and this product may be also, but it is definitely not for me. For some reason, this product contains a very high dose (100 mg) of niacin, which in such doses can have the side effect of producing a rather profound flush, increased heart rate and other unpleasant symptoms. After taking this product (one pill) for only two nights, I found I was waking every two hours soaked in sweat with my heart pounding, which has never happened to me before with melatonin. I quit taking it and am no longer having those symptoms.I'm not sure how to score it because for some people the flush may not occur or may not be as severe. I would advise caution with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would you add B vitamins?","review":"We have used Melatonin to help our son who has ADHD fall asleep. Other brands have worked great and we couldn't figure out why it stopped working. We noticed that this brand has B vitamins included in it, which has had the opposite affect with our son- keeping him wide awake, for hours.I'll take responsibiity for not noticing the label, but why would you put something that gives people more energy (B vitamins) into a sleep aid?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodious Songs","review":"The sound track of \\"Kal Ho Naa Ho\\" is a melodious one, and if you pay attention to the lyrics you realize how fleeting life is, and how important it is grab happiness with both your hands. The title song is a poignant and makes you pause and think. The one titled \\"Pretty Woman\\" is probabaly the most heard track in this album since it is based on Roy Orbison's all time famous song by the same title. The blending of Pretty Womand with Hindi music turned out to be a pretty nice product.Overall all the songs are nice and you can definitely listen to them more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will move you.","review":"This book reveals the emotional upheaval that only a suicide survivor can put into words.

We all grew up loving Kevin Costner in his brilliant movie roles and this is definitely another! If you're an Ashton Kutcher fan like me then you know he truly is a good actor. For those people who only know him as the goofball Kelso from That 70's Show and are skeptical of watching this because you think he can't be a good serious actor, think again! Kutcher puts on a great performance just like he did in theThe Butterfly Effect. I highly, highly recommend this movie for everybody. After watching this I also realized we really don't give the Coast Guard the respect they truly deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie...Highly Recommended","review":"This movie was even more enjoyable the second time I saw it. I'm not a huge fan of Kevin Costner, but this movie is one of his best...and I think it's much better than DANCING WITH WOLVES, which was disappointing. Rather than repeating what others have said here, I'm just going to say: Buy It!! You'll watch it again and again. It's like HUNT FOR THE RED OCTOBER. It doesn't have any slow moments and it has an outstanding ending. I thought it showed those guys having some tough training...that is, until I readAmerican Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History. Now Chris Kyle went though tough training!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting Movie about Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers","review":"You can't go wrong with the cast. The movie is a bit longer than necessary, but overall it makes up for it with exciting rescues at sea. This will give you an appreciation of the first responders of the sea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"I avoided seeing this in the theater thinking it wasn't going to be any good. Now I could kick myself. Saw it on cable and was pleasantly surprised. Ashton did a really good job, the story was moving and entertaining. Although the plotline kind of got muddled toward the end I can see why they did it that way. It was a good flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tribute to those who protect us","review":"This movie definitely gives one an understanding of what our military forces go through in order to serve and protect us. It opens your eyes to the personal sacrifices endured for US. A must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Costner as a Coastie","review":"This is a very good, in fact an excellent story about the Coast Guard Swimmers. I wathed them in action during the Katrina Hurricane aftermath in New Oreleans, and was impressed by their expertise. The extras with the DVD are enlightening and as interesting as the film itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen it all before","review":"Haven't been able to finish the film...seems like I've seen this before. It's the Coast Guard version of \\"An Officer and a Gentleman\\" and \\"Top Gun\\". Predictable? Yes, very. Who can't forsee the recruit falling for the local girl and who couldn't forsee a bar fight? And the hotshot upstart(the \\"Tom Cruise caracter\\") who rubs the brass the wrong way but in the end comes to terms (\\"Officer and Gentleman\\").On the positive side the action at the beginning of the film was great and reminds us what these fabulous Coast Guard guys have to do. I would recommend the movie to those who haven't seen the earlier (and better) versions of this film but for those who have.....rent, don't buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Guardian","review":"Entertaining remake of \\"An Officer and a Gentleman.\\" The GOOD part about the movie is that it showcases the USCG, and the unsung and heroic, lifethreatening jobs USCG servicemen do on a daily basis. The \\"not-so-good\\" part is that it is predictable and somewhat trite. BUT, on the whole, a very entertaining film that gives insight into USCG training methods and locales. In today's culture, almost a film that the whole family could watch together."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Poor Man's \\"Officer and a Gentleman\\"","review":"Being a member of the CG Auxiliary I had high hopes for this movie. I was very disappointed. What could have been a good but often told tale of \\"the old veteran training young upshots\\" quickly degenerated into a rip-off of the vastly superior \\"Officer and a Gentleman,\\" right down to the spray-the-young-recruit-with-a-hose scene. The only good things were Kutcher's love interest, and the old lady who owned the bar Costner's character frequents; good actresses. And the ending where Costner's character kills himself made no sense at all. Dumb! Save your money and rent the Richard Gere/Debra winger classic instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies I've ever seen!!!","review":"WOW! I love this movie. It has a great story and really honors those men and women that are serving the USCG. I was balling my eyes out in diffrent parts in the movie. Eveyone should see it. I am 13, and I loved the whole movie. It kept me ancious to see what would happen next! It really shows how much hard work goes into that job and how sad it is that the US military dosn't even mencion them. I found out about them when I saw this movie and I was really suprised that they don't get any credit for saving anyone!The soundtrack is also very good but they don't seem to be selling it. This movie really makes me want to think about working for the USCG. Its means that much to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the DVD instead","review":"Don't waste your money on the Blu-Ray for this movie! Just get the DVD instead, that is IF you want it at all.I tried to get around the fact that nearly all movies with Kevin Costner (like Tom Hanks) would be infinitely better without him, but even so, this movie is just plain silly. It is a shame, since the job the USCG does is definitely worth telling. And shockingly, from anti-American Hollywood, the move does portray the USCG favorably. Unfortunately, too much of the movie is as removed from reality as most other military related stuff out of Hollywood. I certianly wish those slugs in Congress would spend enough money on the military to build such technologically advanced and heavily manned operations centers as in this movie!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flick!","review":"First let me say...we bought the Playstation 3 not only for the games, but for the Blu-Ray technology. (Or at least that is how my husband sold me on it) and I have to say...LOVE the look of Blu Ray.That said...On to the review-I enjoyed the movie. It was nice to see Kevin Costner back on screen, and I was impressed with Ashton Kutcher. I really enjoyed Kutcher in \\"The Butterfly Effect, \\" he had stronger acting chops than I would have given him credit for, and he showed them here. The story was predictable, but at the ending still had me welling up a bit.All in all....fun Friday night date movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Guardian movie","review":"An excellent movie!!!

What awesome technology was used to build the storm sets for the rescue scenes. It looked amazingly real.2. What a foreboding place the Bering sea is. The risk that fishermen take to put king crab legs on our tables is tremendous.3. The fishing boats have to be in perfect shape. You just don't go out there in an ill-maintained boat, or you're gone.4. I know the movie focuses on the rescue swimmers, but the real skill position is the helicopter pilots.The fetching Mrs. Brew hates Kevin Costner, but she liked him in this role. She might even be persuaded to watch one of his future films now.I was puzzled at the offensive language in the film. Although not excessive by today's standards, it was very gratuitous and added nothing to the movie. It just comes out of nowhere for no reason, other than to shock our sensibilities.Despite that, I liked it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coast Guard swimmers really ARE unsung heroes.","review":"From the moment this movie starts it grabs you, and holds you to the ending. It makes you realize just how important the men and women coast guard IS. They really are the guardians of the sea, and it was so wonderful not only to see thier story brought to life, but that it was brought to life by such fine actors.It reminds you of \\"An officer and a gentleman\\" and a little of \\"Top Gun\\" too, but I didn't mind, because those were 2 dynamite movies, also.Kevin Costner is a coast guard swimmer, who loses his best friend on a rescue mission when thier plane blows up.To get away for awhile, he begans teaching recruits just coming into the coast guard.Ashton Kutcher plays an excellent part as a cocky recruit who is in it for the glory, and not really to save lives.Recognizing this, Kevin Costner pushes him to be the best,and the story that plays out is really a good one.Although not that original, it is awesome none-the-less.I highly reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"kittyjinny","review":"Excellent story of the Coast Guard.

Movie worth renting not buying.Ashton Kutcher should have taken lessons from his wife on how to act. Demi was great in G.I. Jane. Ashton is terrible in this movie. He has no acting skills what- so- ever. I guess I just do not get the Ashton Kutcher thing. I see him pertaining to 5 -12 year olds but that is all.His Hoo Rah is a total embarrassment for the Navy and Marines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie about an under-rated branch of the US Military!","review":"Great movie!

This movie does for CG rescue divers what \\"Men of Honor\\" did for Navy divers. This movie not only shows great character development, but it gives some pretty good background into how training and operations are conducted in the Coast Guard. Fans of movies like \\"Top Gun\\", \\"An Officer and a Gentlemen\\", and \\"Men of Honor\\" will want to catch it for sure. Well worth checking out and with a great story, acting, and music it is good family entertainment. Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher give stand out performances.

Burnt-out vet sent back to teach school; hot-shot rookie with something to prove. Resulting inevitable conflict, reconciliation, and sometimes final tragedy. (Ie, the father figure dies, the son(now reonciled with father) carries on.)This movie, or its variants, has been made about every other branch of the service, so now it's time to trot out the same tired routine about the Coast Guard. While it's interesting to learn about what the Guard does, as a movie, there was not a single new or original thought, twist, or character. You've seen it before; don't waste your time by seeing it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull spoon to gauge my eyes out with","review":"If I could have rated this movie with less than one star, I would have done so. The clichés in this movie were thick and heavy, a glaring rip off of Officer and a Gentleman. Would it have cost so much to bring in military advisors? Naval personnel are NOT allowed to wear dungarees off base, much less in bars. Neither do Chief Petty officers gang up on seamen and beat them. Perhaps 50 years ago, this might have happened, but in today's navy, we stress tolerance, physical fitness and honor, courage and commitment. Though Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutchers' performances were great, the movie lacked any kind of cohesive reality. Commanding officers do not meet and welcome the off coming crews to the base. The only interesting parts of the movie were the rescue scenes. I could not make myself finish this movie without digging my eyes out with a dull spoon. They insult the vary Navy that protects this country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upset","review":"The Dvd I purchased off of Amazon.com did not work.

Too much HOLLYWOOD! Most times the military is thought to have only four branches, Navy, Army, Air Force and Marines, the Coast Guard is usually not mentioned. The people that really appreciate the Coasties are the Alaska fishermen, the State of Alaska purchased a new C-130 for the Coasties on Kodiak Island, now that is respect and appreciation. Would like to have seen a more masculine guy play the role, instead of K.

I could not beleive how bad this got. This is a big spinoff on Clint Eastwoods Heartbreak Ridge, complete with the old lady behind the bar telling old war stories. This was sort of like Baywatch too tossed in for fun. Costner's role was complete with a bad marrige. pills and wild turkey and lots of pride. The part where he walks in a Seal bar and pulls a Bruce Lee stamped it for me. This is a very bad movie from all around. Do not spend your money on this one, it sucked.Philip in SC.

Even the Pope's staff sprouts beautifully green leaves, as the music announces the promise of renewed life for even the worst of sinners.No singer appears to be an especially strong or weak link, although how can Bernd Weikl help but steal the show with Wagner's beautiful song to the Evening Star?Credit must also be given to an often neglected star in opera productions: Gil Wechsler, the brilliant lighting designer, uses light to enhance the already splendid sets with a Tuscan afternoon glow."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Tannhauser Ever!!","review":"First of all, for a Wagner opera you need Wagnerian singers not just any baroque chanter and I think Richard Cassilly is excellent. Secondly, this production is so fascinating with the details of the story such as the budding of the staff in the end symbolizing God's forgiveness. I guarantee that if you like Wagnerian opera this will satisfy you very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wagner - Tannhauser","review":"This marvelous MET stage production of Wagner's opera is the best I ever seen upon our days. It contents all of the best wagnerian singing and of course from outstanding superb voices as Eva Marton, Tatiana Troyanos and the passed away great american tenor Richard Cassilly. I believe this is one of the finest MET Wagnerian dramas ever staged: the set and costume design are gorgeous and obviously the beautiful MET Orchestra- Chorus and direction in the hands of maestro James Levine put the lovely touch of good sense of drama and feeling to this Wagner work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Important Thing You Need To Know About This DVD...","review":"...is that there are voices heard mumbling throughout the second half...as if the sound engineers accidentally put a live microphone next to the snack bar in the lobby. I'm not kidding. The first few times you hear it, you'll think \\"Hmmm...that's strange.\\" But after it's been going on for 20 minutes, then 30, you'll realize that you wasted your money.I've noticed that, in general, sound engineers in orchestral music are SADLY lacking in comparision to pop music producers. I've become inured with these ridiculous flaws in my own Wagner collection, what with the frequent mysterious noises and sloppy edits in even the best renditions of his operas. Where's George Martin when we need him?!?It's an incredible shame too, because the performances in this particular version are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a Wagnerite","review":"This was the most passionate opera I've ever seen. Also, it was my first. I wrote a thesis on Richard Wagner and studied the synopsis of the opera. It was up to the tee. Marton does and excellent job playing Elizabeth that the tears in her eyes led me to tear up also. The guy who played Wolfram looked as though he didn't fully study out his lines, because of the bewildering look on his face when the camera did a close up. Cassily was wonderful despite in Act I his hair was sticking out. The most famous Pilgrims' Chorus was good, but I would have wanted it to be slowed down and appreciated...maybe it was a difficult piece to sing that is why the orhcestra sped it up so they could get it done and over with. The Entry of the Guest scene was great. Overall, I strongly recommend this. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Performance riddled by poor singing","review":"This isn't a good performance. Cassily just copes with the difficult title part. Marton doesn't really have the purity of voice for Elisabeth. Troyanos is over-streched as Venus and Weikl past his prime as Wolfram. With such poor singing, this dvd cannot be recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent deal","review":"Super fast shipping during the holiday season.

The virus is so deadly the US government mandates the victims of the virus must be placed in concentration camps and categorized as pre-deceased. With no rights and no hope this bleak outlook is part commentary on the perils of a government out of control and people making impulse decisions on life-affecting topics as well as an example of the human spirit enduring when it seems despair is all that remains. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which had me sprouting tears of sadness as well as tears of joy.Interestingly, this novel is a far departure from this author's normal genre of fantasy dragon novels. A lovely example that writer's can span genres successfully when the writing is incredible and the topic compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Science, OK Fiction","review":"If you prefer hard science Sci-Fi, avoid this book. The difficulty in writing Sci-Fi set in the near future is maintaining a sense of believability. Unfortunately, the science as set forth in this novel is sadly deficient. Even if the technologigal geegaws set forth in this book were invented in late 1996 (the book was printed in May, 1996) it is implausible that they would have totally replaced the former infrastructure by 2010 (the year in which the main events occur).However, this Sci-Fi book is more interested in the story than the technical geegaws. Within the technological framework given, the story, although treacly and predictable, is enjoyable as a borrow once from the library book. I would not recommend purchase of it tho."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"Having never read any of Tracy Hickman's work before, I opened my copy of The Immortals hoping to find taut, mature science fiction - the cover does brag that he is a \\"NY Times Best Selling Author\\" after all. Instead, I got a slapdash attempt to be politically correct (look! I like gay people! I really really like gay people!), literarily descriptive (start playing a drinking game with the number of references to eye color), and intellectually beyond the confines of 'mere' religion (The one bad guy calls himself \\"Reverend,\\" the other spouts a sort of doomsday social Darwinism).Given that this book was written in 1996, I'll cut him some slack for rehashing such tired tropes. But even so, the writing is generally uneven, moving from clever bits of description to overly maudlin efforts to poke at the reader's tear ducts, and he can't seem to figure out how to work exposition seamlessly into the rest of the story. There is much better science fiction than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agenda Driven","review":"For me this book was too slow, ponderous, and dark.

His approach to colour particularly sticks in the mind. There are no complete step-by-step demonstations (beginning to end mapped out)- but many snapshots of some of the processes and some of the stages he arrived at before the finished product. Particularly useful for artists interested in landscapes and alla prima.

For a beginner this wasn't what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moderately helpful, but nothing special","review":"This book focuses mainly on still life and landscape painting, and is not at all a comprehensive guide. While it contains some helpful tidbits, it does not really elaborate on the fundamentals of painting with oils. Containing the cursory beginners chapters, Oil Painting for the Serious Beginner waxes lyrical on the intangible je-ne-sais-quois of art. This is hardly helpful. Also, it strongly pushes alla prima painting, while basically ignoring any other style. Not at all comprehensive, and on the whole mediocre. Definitely one of the lesser books in my oil painting book collection - especially considering the price. I would recommend Frederic Taubes' \\"Oil Painting for the Beginner\\" for those who want to really understand the fundamentals of oil painting: the interaction between the oil paints, what paints to use for what, comprehensive color theory in an easy to understand manner, etc. This book is mediocre at best"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Pictures are so yellow/gold that you can't get the full benefit of any instruction/information being given.

My first impression was that the author knew something that I didn't and this was how the colors should look. I thought that was his style. But when I went online to view his actual paintings they were colorful, not at all like what was in his book. So Allrich really doesn't paint with mustard!Apparently the author failed to check the color plates and allowed these errors to go to press.

The characters in these stories for the most part are out to have fun and have some extra variety in their lives.The more erotica I read, the more I realize is isn't just about the ol \\"bump and grind,\\" but also about the character's lives, feelings, predicaments and how they all fit together to make a story sing.

If one were approaching Rimbaud only to \\"read some poems\\" or to enjoy oneself, then this would be an adequate if slightly fey rendering of the texts. But I think Rimbaud has earned a place beside the likes of Dante, Whitman (who I detest) and Blake, as men who are read as much for their person and ideas as for pleasure, and as such deserves the respect of a faithful rendering by the translator. The reader would be better advised to explore either Fowlie's \\"Complete Poems\\", Louise Varese's \\"Season In Hell\\" & \\"Illuminations\\", or Wyatt Mason's \\"Complete Works\\", which despite being resolutely inferior to Fowlie's, does display a number of additional poems previously available only in the original French."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer necessary, if it ever was","review":"I wrote an earlier review of this edition of Rimbaud back when I called myself lexo-2; I'd now amend it, if I could, to say that the only translations of Rimbaud that non-French speakers are going to need is Wyatt Mason's superb bilingual edition in two volumes for the Modern Library.

The Hammer tracks from the original soundtrack release were edgy and sometimes brash, not to mention *clean*. The revisions are indeed lush, but if you're looking to be taken back to the sound that was Miami Vice, you won't find it here.

His mixes of funk with electronica a la the Orb (and others who have used Eno as a blueprint to make their music) are nice listening, and leads me to wonder if Eno will release a full-on electronica lp of some of his tracks...hmmmmVery different listening than most of his lps (\\"Spinner\\" comes closest to this effort, in many ways), this lp nonetheless has wonderful moments on it and Eno fans should give it a spin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better with time.","review":"I was very put off by this album when I first bought it many years ago. I'm a fan of both Eno's ambient works and the first 4 classic electronic/pop albums he did. I'm not quite sure why I didn't like this one at first. I guess I've matured over the years and my tastes and horizons in electronic music have expanded. Anyone who dismisses this album after only one listen will be missing out on a very pleasurable, albeit slightly challenging listen. I would hasten to say that anyone who likes his very first album, Here Come the Warm Jets, should grow to like this one as well. I'm not comparing it stylistically to Jets, but it's similar in that it offers a variety of styles and sounds, some jarring, some repetitive and others that are just plain fun. Give it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds from a water bubble","review":"I have this cd for about ten years now and I still really like it. Mr Eno is the master of his unique sound, and he is very consistent in how to use it. On \\"Nerve Net\\" everything seems slightly warped and out-of-tune, yet ethereal, an ideal soundtrack for nighttime listening. Don't fall asleep though, some songs may lead to accidents - \\"What actually happened\\" brings on the feel of a harrowing rollercoaster ride through a dark and scary forest; \\"Juju Space Jazz\\" sounds like recorded on a boat rolling haplessly in the sea and may actually induce symptoms of seasickness, and the groove of \\"Ali Click\\" could lead to compulsive dancing. My only reservation is that some songs draw out a little, but this depends on the daily mood of the listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"My kids loved this book about the underground railroad.

In this crisp novella, Lawrence beautifully paints a minimalistic tableaux of romance, magic, and high tension, around a mere three characters, on one farm. Anyone who ever groaned at the immense loquacity of \\"The Rainbow,\\" might be surprised to discover that \\"The Fox\\" is by the same Lawrence.I must add that Lawrence's philosophy on sexual relationships and love (as depicted in \\"The Fox\\" and other works) have been often been criticized as misogynistic. In a sense, these criticisms are valid, but they are also unfairly simplistic.

Hate it hate it hate it. Mostly because I can't play using just this book! It's a core book for crying out loud. But the section that should cover skills/abilities/etc has far too many paragraphs ending in \\"Please see World of Darkness, pg XX\\". Why did I bother buying the shifter book when all I need is the other core book (which appears to be 35 pages long).

Nothing that made WtA and VtM the magnificent and inspiring table tops RPG's that the where is in these new products. I think WW looked at what Wizards is doing (D&D;) and tried to copy it, but D&D; has had 30 yrs to perfect and make it's system.

Sign me up for one!!! (sarcasm intended here).Then, in the end, (what a wonderful man!) he gives up a promising political future for her. Gee.

The book focuses on the romance between Lily, leader of the women, and Daniel, lawyer for the owners of the brothel. Their history is bad but when murder occurs they find themselves on the same side.While there is a healthy dose of \\"Americana\\" in this book, I enjoyed the political edge - suffrage and women's rights. Still, the best part of the book are the strong characterizations including several strong secondary characters. The plotting is probably the weak point as the book lacked a strong page turning quality. Still, a fun relaxing read even if it probably isn't a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"I enjoyed this book and will look for more Ms Guhrke's books.

True happiness is not \\"all about me\\" or what we can take from the world and contrary to popular culture, life is not about how much money you make or the notoriety that you gain, it is a precious gift to be shared. The Ten Secrets awakens an awareness of the impact that a person can have on another's life, the ability to enrich the lives of those you come into contact with, and is a reminder to appreciate each fleeting moment. These simple truths have made me question and reflect on my path through life and will be a touchstone for my future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handbook for the Serious Business of Happiness","review":"Scott Michael Engler is one of my favorite sports writers.

Once things get rolling the pace does nothing but increase. Plausible.... not a chance, but I read books for enjoyment, and I enjoyed this one! Matt Reilly really has some imagination and flare for the unbelieveable. This would make a great movie. I look forward to more works from this author. (P.S.

I was amazed that when I started to read it I could not put it down. Temple had everything from an ancient Incan idol to modern day killing machines,also an unlikely hero. The only thing I would compare it to would be Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child's Thunderhead and Riptide. It moves just as quickly and grabs the reader, not letting them shake loose till the end. I am now recommending this book to everyone I know. I just passed it on to my mother and she said it was similar to Steve Alten's book, Domain. That's next on my reading list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good","review":"In the Authors tradition the book has some neat story twists and alot of action.While not a suspence as reading Icestation this is still a very entertaining book.Actually this book tells 2 story's one at the current date and one during spain's colonization of Peru."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to be compared with Tom Clancy","review":"I was expecting some magical things or misteries to be solved when I read the backpage: Some doors are meant to remain unopened.

Please count and find out yourself Thehow many pages the author described about the pursuit in the river. Anyway,some pages are interesting to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written like a 12 year old","review":"I read Ice Station, and while amateurish was reasonably well written. I suspect that the editors rewrote that one to make it readable. For Temple, they probably either thought that Reilly was successful enough to allow it through without editing or they couldn't find editors willing to undertake the task. I don't blame them. I have never read a professionally published novel that was so badly written in my life. It reads like a 12yo wrote it, with exclamation marks on every second sentence, cartoonish \\"BOOM, CRASH, BANG!\\" descriptors (the best one is YECCHHH), repeated use of unrealistic words like nanosecond (\\"a nanosecond before it happened...\\"), and totally unbelievable scenarios. Other reviewers have described some of the idiotic plot devices used, so I won't go into them here. Suffice to say that if your tastes run to Green Goblin and The Incredible Hulk comics, you might like this book. Otherwise go with Clancy or Forsythe. Or get a lobotomy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chock full of action...and horrendous prose!","review":"This book is, perhaps, the first sign of the apocolypse. At the very least, it signifies the end of literature as we know it. Matt Reilly is an \\"author\\" only in the sense that someone prints his books. His prose is crude, clumsy, and an embarrassment to literate people the world over. He makes liberal use of ellipses and exclamation points, which is fine. If you're ten-years-old. If, however, you intend to write for people who have NOT been lobotomized six or seven times, it would pay to be a little more competent. A little more subtle. I will not even disccuss the plot; it is far-fetched beyond description, requiring not just a suspension of disbelief, but a complete suspension of brain activity. However, I did give it two stars because I actually finished the book. I have to hand it Reilly there; something he did compelled me to find out what happens. In the end though, I think we're all a little dumber for having read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gravely Disappointed","review":"Although the book started out well enough for me to go out and buy Ice Station, I'm sorry I did. This is one of the most absurd display of literature--even by fiction standards. Nothing is believable, and these last second saves become so redundant that the storyline becomes predictable. Stick with Clive Cussler if you want a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure \\"Comic-Book\\" Fiction - Yuck!!","review":"Read one of the other reviews if you want to get a sense of the so-called \\"plot.\\" The actions of the \\"hero\\" are so far-fetched as to be laughable - or would be if there was not such an incredible continuing blood bath all through this pot-boiler. There are so many bad guys in this story that I have the impression that they had to line up and take a number to get into the story. No one in the novel is who he/she seems to be, not even me. I thought I was \\"the reader\\"; turns out I was the guy throwing up from having read this insult to the intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Ridiculous","review":"I decided to try Matthew Reilly because he was recommended based on the fact that I read books by James Rollins. In the beginning, the book seemed intriguing and entertaining. Unfortunately, this did not last. While I am willing to suspended some belief this book asked for far too much suspension. As the book progressed, the main character, who was a professor no less, seemed to get out of situations that were so over the top it was like watching Indian Jones saving himself from an atomic blast by hiding in a refrigerator. Eventually, this book culminated into a final battle that was so over the top when it was over I just rolled my eyes and realized I had wasted a lot of time reading a book that even teenagers would find hard to believe.Honestly, I cannot believe that Reilly could have written this book with a straight face. After this book, I am not inclined to read another by him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made for TV","review":"I love the historical angle and the intertwined stories, on the face of it this book is everything that would usually appeal to me but come on! How many times can one man narrowly escape death! It reads like it was written as a big budget action movie.You know when they take an absolutely fantastic story cut out all the interesting bits and character development and just leave the bare bones and action scenes? That is Matthew Reilly all over.I origanlly read Seven Wonders and though the story had promise I tried to read it and gave up several times. I eventually got through it and was left very disappointed, but it had such potential I thought Temple might be better.......it wasn't, though I did manage to read it without giving up.I love the ideas behind the stories but for me the continual blow-by-blow, overly detailed action just destroys it.Very disappointed, Temple could have been so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ride the ReillyCoaster","review":"Ignore KiwiAl, he has unfortunately fallen into the century old war between NZ and Australia. A bitter feud where one side questions the others familiarity with livestock. These books are good at what they were intended for. If you want a literary classic dont look here. This is pure and simple action. This is not credible, it is incredible. No time for looking deeply into the soul of the characters, the pace is just too fast. Thats what this is about. The Ride. From Neo-nazis, covert military groups struggling for survival, mythic feline monsters chasing us in the present to maddened conquistadors, the giant cats and Incan warriors chasing us in the past. It doesnt stop. The book is a rush. Far from perfect but just the same a damn good read. If ever an action movie fell straight from the screen into a book then it would be like this. If you like action and plenty of it.....read this. And KiwiAl......BAAAAA!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs","review":"This is by far the worst action/adventure book I have ever read.

This is especially true at around 64% of the way in to 70%. Did this not come electronically from the publisher?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The action never stops","review":"Matthew Reilly has created a thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat from the time you open the cover. Professor Will Race is late for work at NYU and finds that his day is going to get stranger than he can imagine. From the concrete jungle of New York City to the dark of the Amazon rain forest, from Nazis to American servicemen to Inca warriors, Race finds himself running (and flying) from death at every turn trying to find an ancient key to a decidedly high tech weapon. Like every good hero story, Race also discovers that he is more than he thought he could be. Oh, and he has to save the world. Reilly does a great job of moving the story and keeping the suspense at a high level. I'll be reading more of Reilly's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody actually liked this?","review":"Improbable yet predictable plot. Lots of action but so far fetched that it is painful to read.It is apparent that the writer hoped Temple would be made into a movie (ala Indiana Jones) but as a book it just does not work.Gigantic cats, hidden civilizations and implausible physical prowess shoot suspension of disbelief to the ground.Had to force myself to read the whole thing, groaning all the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try \\"Ice Station\\" Instead","review":"I've read Reilly's \\"Ice Station\\" twice. I've tried to read \\"Temple\\" twice and put it down twice. He just really isn't trying here. Not only is the science not even given a quick Wikipedia check (No internet, Reilly?), but the author forgets what his characters are doing. One action sequence has a character swinging on ropes and battling hand-to-hand and Reilly has completely forgotten that the character was supposed to be carrying a head-sized chunk of stone. But don't worry -- after the action is over, the stone magically reappears.I really enjoyed \\"Ice Station\\" and it's much better written. Give this one a pass and go for Reilly's earlier work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Temple","review":"I bought this book at a used bookstore, sold on the back-flap description. It started slow, had no pacing, became more ridiculous with every page, and failed to produce even one character I could sympathize with. Whether it was the author or the editor who was responsible for the extremely annoying phrasing, it did not help the story at all. The constant need to italizise, and punctuate every other phrase with an exclamation mark! made me feel I was reading someone's bad first draft. It read like a poor attempt at writing a novel that is meant to go straight to screenplay. What's doubly heartbreaking is that the other books of his sound so good. I won't be lured in, though. This one was painful enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Temple - Matthew Reilly","review":"I was reading this book and enjoying it thoroughly before I got to page 144. Imagine my surprise when I got to the bottom of the page--\\"Its black head was absolutely massive. It took up the en-\\" and went to the next page where it began ...\\"agents dressed in blue assault helmets and SWAT gear hurried into the compound after them.\\" Apparently pages 145 thru 176 are missing! I glanced through the rest of the book and didn't see any other obvious flaws until I got to the excerpt from his book \\"Area 7\\" - the last 4 pages of the excerpt are cut off on the right side.

TEMPLE reads like a great action/adventure read that moves like a speeding bullet and does not let up. Only hollywood can only hope to get a great script like this and make it into an exciting summer action flick in the tradition of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK meets THE MUMMY RETURNS! I can't wait to read ICE STATION next, which is the 1st novel written by this 27-year-old author who writes way beyond his years. His best is yet to come! If you like your reading in high adventure and lots of exploding action - then this ones for you. A stolen idol that came from the stars 400 years ago and has the power to destroy earth - secret armies from all over the world are all fighting for it - giant cats from the far past - lost Incan tribes and temples - blood and guts - love affairs of both good and evil - if any of this interests you then TEMPLE is waiting for you..."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Cussler, you'll like Matt Reilly!!","review":"Although I'm not a fan of Matthew Reilly's novels, (I've only read one). I am a fan of Matthew Reilly. Calling temple a return to the pulp novels of old is an accurate statement and a compliment. Matthew puts his hero into one death defying situation after another only to have him extricate himself - yet again.It's been a while since I read this one, but it involves some idol carved from a meteorite in a Mayan temple and a team of US scientists sent to retreive it before (get this) an old Nazi and his team get it.Hungry Panthers, jet skis and jet packs (yes), the thrills never stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, non-stop action...","review":"Matt Reilly's Temple is simply one of those books that you read for pleasure. This is clearly in the category of a \\"beach read\\". It definitely will not be mistaken for literature, but for its genre of action thriller, it meets the test of readability. Particularly entertaining are the integrated diversion scenes depicting the Incan world during the time of the Spanish conquest (necessary in understanding the main plot of the work).This novel is quite violent, however, and isn't really suitable for younger teens. On every other page it seems as if someone's head \\"exploded\\" (to use Reilly's favorite word). That aside, this isn't a bad thriller, although it does stretch the boundaries of even novelistic credibility at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insults the reader","review":"This book is insulting to the intelligence of its readers. This writer obviously did ABSOLUTELY NO RESEARCH of any kind into the science of the subject about which he is unsuccessfully attempting to write.

It is OK to be ignorant about a subject, but don't stick your finger in the public's eye by writing about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly entertaining, but...","review":"...ridiculous in the extreme, nonetheless. Overuse of exclamation points was a little annoying. Definitely not on par with Preston/Child or even James Rollins, but I have to admit it did keep me interested. Fine for a beach/vacation read if you like adventure stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone open a window...","review":"and air out the stench from this one. Obviously the author has never been exposed to even an elementary school science class, because science has no place in this book.

Reilly makes the same mistake so very many authors make....he never sought out knowledgeable people on the science portions to advise him. There are plenty of people that would advise him for free, just to get the science right! Being a scientist, this was a sticking point. So I had to approach this like an Indiana Jones novel.The action was non-stop, twists and turns unpredictable, and the end was unexpected.

The story is fast paced action trash - def one for the boys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Ice Station","review":"This is the second book I read from Matthew Reilly, and it was a real dissapointment, the first book Ice Station was really good and this one somehow doesn't work as well... The race to find the Idol is ok, but after the Idol is found the story just looses it's fun element. I'll probably buy the next book from Matthew Reilly, but that one had better be good :) Better luck next time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I had heard a lot about this writer. Now, after a few pages of Temple, I have put the book down and will not venture any further into it. In the first few pages, a person is hiding in a \\"drop ceiling\\" in a very old Jesuit monastery; two different countries have built a \\"doomsday machine\\" that can destroy the Earth and an ancient Inca prince ties a rope to an arrow, shots it into a wooden door and slides down the rope. GIVE ME A BREAK. This is junior high school stuff. I have never felt like I wasted money on reading material but this just changed my mind. I won't even put it in the trash as it would stink it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs to be a Movie","review":"This is probably the best actual story by Matt Reilly. It is a totally fun read. That is all it's meant to be. It's not \\"War and Peace\\", it's not even \\"A Seperate Peace\\" It is an action movie that hasn't been made yet. The hero is good the bad guys are evil, the monsters are scary, the chases are exciting...This is a vacation book, an airport book, a coffee break book. It won't change the way you think, but it will give you a break from thinking. Enjoy the escapism!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just too wrong","review":"Let me start by saying that I'm a big fan of fantastic adventure novels by Clive Cussler and similar, as well as more technical action novels, and usually my suspension of disbelief goes really far...I really wanted to like this novel, but Reilly seems to have made the mistake of getting way too technical and specific without having the remotest clue about what he's writing about. Some of it could have been forgivable, but it was pretty much pervasive through the novel. He confuses fission and fusion at every turn, his supposed planet killer laughs at the basic laws of physics, while he invents some new ones. Even the basic chemistry you learn in high school is just plain wrong. Most of the astronomy is ludicrous, as well. Otherwise, it's probably a real fun novel - if you can get past some really apparent errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't put it down quick enough!","review":"I was given this book for Christmas. It was the worst present I have ever received. Totally unbelievable from beginning to end with cliched characters,plots and juvenile writing full of hackneyed words and phrases. But who am I to complain. Judging by other reviews this book is fantastic-such is life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievability eliminates suspense","review":".Terrible book.There are many reviews that pan this book because of the complete lack of beleivability and repeated \\"...at that exact moment...\\" escapes.Others have responded saying its all just for fun and you should not expect literary greatness.My problem with continual narrow escapes (good guys kill 10 guys with 10 bullets - sometimes less, while bad guy misses good guys with 10,000 bullets) is that after a couple of times it removes all of the suspense because you know the good guy will get out of any situation - and I mean any situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK so Matt Reilly isn't exactly Shakespeare","review":"OK so Matt Reilly isn't exactly Shakespeare but if you want a good read, with action, adventure, attention to technical detail (mostly...) and just generally good escapism then this is the book for you. Reilly keeps the pace fast and furious thoughout the novel and the characters and story are familiar if you have read Reilly's other book - Ice Station (which I suspect Dreck hasn't). Reilly has obviously read a lot of Tom Clancy, Clive Cussler and Frederick Forsyth and incorporates the key elements of their style of writing into his books. OK so he needs practise and refinement in doing this but for a 3rd novel this is a pretty good effort. At least he doesn't ramble on and on for hundreds of unnecessary pages like Tom Clancy's more recent efforts..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets repetitive and tiresome quickly","review":"At first \\"Temple\\" is a kick, with exciting action scenes and an exotic setting, but it wears out its welcome quickly with one dimensional characters and one improbable miracle escape after another. It starts to get absurd, how the hero gets so lucky in escaping from what seems to be fatal peril, only to have some almost impossible random event happen for him to survive yet again by a whisker. Granted, the author is good at writing action scenes, but after a while they all run together and get rather dull. Almost zero character development doesn't help matters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Threw it away 150 pages into it.","review":"Temple was one of three books by Reilly that I bought when I first heard of him (see reviews for Seven Deadly Wonders and Ice Station). I forced myself to get through Seven Deadly Wonders, enjoyed Ice Station, but after those two, I was only willing to invest a few hours with his antics and stopped once it became too much.Of the two time lines, the older story was interesting and I was primarily reading it to see where that story went because the modern time line was just stupid. Unfortunately, the hero in the ancient story started experiencing miracles typical of Reilly's heroes. At that point, I put the book in the trash. I wouldn't wish inflicting such a poor story on someone that might pick up the book after leaving it behind in my hotel."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!!!","review":"I loved this book.

I wonder if Indiana Jones would like a come back? I had trouble putting it down. It's now going through my workplace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Temple","review":"Uh....I am not even done this book yet, and today it almost went into the trashcan. I usually like just about anything, and I did like Ice Station an am looking forward to grabbing a copy of Area 7, but this book is a bit too much. It's like reading James Bond on steroids...too many increadible feats, too many \\"saved at the last minute\\" senarios. Uh...I'll keep reading though. Good reading all."},{"rating":"2","title":"ADVENTURE/SUSPENSE/INTRIGUE/WOW!","review":"This guy can write, he had my attention throughout the book on a roller coaster ride and the ending was also great. He is on my list of authors to be on look out for from now on. No movie based on it I think could ever do it justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slapstick Adventure Under the Guise of a Thriller","review":"It could have been a good book. The cover looked good, the flyleaf was captivating and the storyline had real potential with nice historical underpinnings. But, it was overwrought with unbelievable scenes and too many last second escapes. It seemed as though he was writing it for a James Bond screenplay rather than an adventure novel. Novelists have used the Nazi storyline since the 1950s, and it seemed to die out in the early 1990s. Not in this book. Anymore it seems like a hackneyed crutch used by a novelist to provide the archetypical bad guys. By the end of the book I felt I had been taken in by a bait and switch con. Slapstick is not what I enjoy reading and had I known what I was getting into, I never would have invested the time to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called Pureabordomalia.","review":"Pure's brand of psychedelic funk rhythm sounded pretty exciting in the early nineties, but it hasn't aged well. No one will be surprised to learn these guys were produced by the Talking Head's Jerry Harrison, it fits right in with his style. \`Greedy' is the track that launched them, but there was no follow up. Probably got noticed because of the success of like minded bands like Jellyfich and The Farm Their space has been taken by jam bands like Phish and Dave Matthews. May be of interest to fans of such music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kiss of the Falcon","review":"I ordered Kiss of the Falcon by Linda Howard.

Many critics overlook this album as one of his great successes. BLACK HOPE was my first exposure to Kenny, and he has been a great influence on my playing ever since. Kenny burns up the track with legend Joe Henderson on COMPUTER G(check out the trading four section on this one)and BYE BYE BLACKBIRD. I also love his original TACIT DANCE and he rolls off an unbelievable solo on JACKIE AND THE BEANSTALK. A must have album for any Kenny fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good conditions.

Though quite enjoyable and full of interesting details (like cover photos of obscure political magazines that Chomsky read as a child), Barsky's biography comes clearly from the pen of someone enamored of Chomsky's ideas and work. The last paragraph of the book sounds embarrasingly like the voiceover from a low-budget propaganda film. Chomsky fans will enjoy the book, but anyone wanting a more balanced approach will still have to wait for the \\"definitive biography\\", which to my knowledge remains unwritten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be mislead by Olier Kamm (the reviewer)","review":"...As for this biography, I suggest taking a copy out of a library and check it out before purchasing.

I think that most readers would find them to be considerably more credible if they had such a degree, especially in view of the fact that Morgenthaler and Simms frequently foray onto (and beyond) the fringes of scientific knowledge. Such speculation would perhaps be tolerable if it were being espoused by someone who had a solid base of scientific training who had very sound reasons for conjecturing in this manner; it is difficult if not impossible for a reader who has no scientific background to judge whether or not the speculations of authors who have no scientific training are credible. The cover art and one of the fonts used in the text of this book can be best described as comical; they further detract from the credibility of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Inspirational Book","review":"Dr. Helfant's accounts of courageous patients surviving near fatal illness and going on to change their lives for the better is truly inspirational. I was moved by each story, and for a different reason. This is a distinctly powerful book, and is sure to be a bestseller."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a really great book","review":"I wanted to say how much I enjoyed reading Dr. Helfant's book. It's not often we get to see such dramatic transformations in people's lives, and they're told so well. I was really drawn into these stories.I highly recommend this book; it really made me think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid Video Introduction of an Illuminated Munuscript","review":"I make it a hobby to produce a manuscript of my own with tempera and gilding on parchment from the images of the 15th to early 16th century manuscripts. The subject book of hours produced for Anne of Brittany currently owned at the Bibliotheque National de France in Paris is said to be one of the most beautiful of all of this kind with exquisite miniatures. Moreover, the reason I love this particular one so much is the gorgeous floral borders, actually the botanical illustration of various plants, flowers and fruites together with different insects and small animals; so to say \\"flora and fauna\\" by the most elaborate technique of the artist Jean Bourdichon. Books on such an item are scarce and this is perhaps the only one video nicely made with a good professional explanation. Without prior knowledge, this is a beautiful video in itself highly recommended for anyone with interests in art and history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oates' Best - A World of Constant Battles","review":"I originally read Wonderland when I was a teenager and remembered only a little of it, so it was a revelation when I read it again a few weeks ago. This is a study of one human being and the torments he endures at the hands of others as he grows up, and how it damages his personality. However, Jesse seemingly prevails, and by the novel's end shows us that the human spirit is never completely extinguished. Jesse is such a real character I expect to see him as a flesh and blood person one day. No doubt, this is JCO's best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Past the point of no return","review":"I was past the point of no return, about two hundred pages, when I tired of the characters themselves who seem to be one dimensional and who act without introspection. Oates was able to give ample exposure to the dark side of behavior, but actions and events seemed to come out of nowhere without foreshadowing. The mystery of human emotions which Oates is known to explore seemed to be revealed as philospical treatise rather than as artfully drawn characterizations. All in all the novel seems more like a social commentary than a human drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy Effort","review":"A doctor with a troubled past is so engrossed in his professional life that he loses touch with the humanity he serves, and a troubled daughter rebels until she is essentially brainwashed and ravaged by drugs. Oates called the novel gothic in tone. I considered it tedious at times. It is a psychological novel for the most part, and it seems that the concern over getting at these issues made the actual story and motivation of the characters difficult to follow at times. Overall, a decent work. Anyone who likes Oates will like this. For those who don't, it will be hit and miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I was forced to read this book in college. It started realistically with the hardships of the Depression and what misery it caused and then turned into a portrait of bizarre characters. I finally gave up halfway through and threw the book against the wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshing Title","review":"This story really struck a chord with me (no pun intended). For once, an anime that really takes a risk. Think about it: almost every popular anime, save those few exceptions, has either magic, mecha, or martial arts at its center. This one breaks from the pack, and with grace.Oh, and did I mention the protagonist is *gasp* middle-aged? Not adolescent, like so many popular heroes/heroines. And he's perfectly average: white collar and blah, except for when he's holding an electric guitar.Music, family, and attraction. Three very important facets of life, IMHO, and well portrayed in these four DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding materials","review":"Andrew Pudewa's writing program was the foundation that netted my son a top 2% on the writing portion of the SAT and my eighth-grade daughter a perfect score both in English and Writing on the pre-ACT Explore test. You can look on Pudewa's website for more information on the materials. Excellent choice. If you ever have a chance to go to a workshop he teaches, I recommend those, too. He has a very classical and Christlike approach to language arts. He says that all assessment, ALL assessment should give a child *hope*. I love that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid hard-rock album. Blackmore is great here","review":"This is one of the best RAINBOW all time albuns, even featuring \\"cheesy -totally pop-oriented\\" singer Joe Lynn Turner. Roger GLover is playing his bass with a long time forgotten passion, Blackmore solos are great, showing his mastership without being indulgent. Booby Rondinelli drums are also perfetc, tight and cohesive. The keyboards, of course, are only figurants here. The best songs are by far \\"Death Alley Driver\\", \\"Stone Cold\\", \\"BRing on the Night\\", \\"Power\\" and \\"Eyes of FIre\\". The rest is cool, adn some of them really lead us to the great times of Deep Purple. THis CD is much, much better than the lousy \\"DIFFICULT TO CURE\\", an outrageous attempt to go radio-friendly, led by Joe Lynn Turner ( how Blackmore accepted it, I still don't know )."},{"rating":"2","title":"80's Rainbow","review":"Not the classic Rainbow of the 70's (because there is no Richie Blackmore), but I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Ronnie","review":"What happened to these guys after Dio left?

Unfortunately, it didn't, and the loss is ours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear; the writing is on the wall!","review":"This album was the end of the road for me and Rainbow - I really thought they had completely lost it - some nice cheesy tracks such as \\"Stone Cold\\" but really the edge was gone and it was time to pack it in with stuff like \\"Death Alley Driver\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the greatest albums","review":"Straight between the eyes is one of the best albums from Rainbow which is one of their best.Each and every album in this record is a classic and is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight ahead jazz meets brass and creates Music!","review":"After a disspointing release I was skeptical about picking up Buck Jump.

There is no character or relationship development at all. The dialogue is empty between the hero and heroine. The sexual thoughts and scenarios early on are ridiculous. I can't imagine how this book got such rave reviews. There is no depth to the story. It's completely superficial. I'm going to try to speed read through the remainder just to finish it.

The Quaker theme is a serious one, yet it is portrayed in a frivolous manner. Except for Gary Cooper, the characters are not believable.

Alas, it was not to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow","review":"Some funny moments, etc., but this movie was too slow. Granted it was made when people had longer attention spans. But a dated movie is a dated movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see movie for the entire family!","review":"This movie takes you from laughing to crying in minutes. Filmed in beautiful on-site location depicting a Quaker family struggling with criticism over their non-resistant stance during the civil war. Gives a great look at the heart of their conviction without forcing the viewer to take a side. Also gave insight to those sending their husbands and sons to fight and how they felt it was unfair for the Quakers not to do the same. Again it is not the type movie where you feel the sole purpose is to convince you to agree with a particular opinion. Storyline does a great job of developing characters; you feel you know each of them before the movie ends. And yes there is romance in this one - beautiful, humorous look at relationship of the mother/father. Gary Cooper does an outstanding job in his role as the father. Also has a love story with their daughter and a neighboring family's son who is in the war. Also fun to watch the family interact on their farm."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Family Film Actually Meant For The Whole Family","review":"This Gary Cooper classic is from those days when \\"family film\\" meant more than just a film for parents to dump their kids for two hours so they're free to shop, eat out, etc. It is a film which all ages can enjoy and be challenged by. Deliberately paced by director William Wyler, it has excellent performances from Cooper, Dorothy Mcguire and a young Anthony Perkins. Watching Perkins in this multi-layered role, one regrets that Psycho locked him into Norman Bates-like roles for the rest of his career. His scenes opposite the legendary Cooper are gems. This performance makes you realize what an extraordinary actor he was. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Film Has Ever Taken It's #1 Spot For Me!","review":"This is my absolute favorite film. I have about 7 more that I really like,but I never need to hesitate one second,when asked my one favorite,it is always \\"Friendly Persuasion\\". It has everything,drama,humor,breathtaking scenery and a fabulous music score,plus a little love interest, and also very inspirational,with some deeper issues of life,having to be faced by the family members. In my opinion, it is just absolutely flawless,and it makes me want to cry,because no other movie even comes close to this quality,and that is so sad.

When you have little, it is very important to make sure that those who don't live according to accepted dogmatic rules are kept in close inspection by those who think they don't have secrets to hide.Robin Wright plays the put-upon unwed mother with strength and truth. Aidan Quinn, the traveling player who is smitten, and Albert Finney, the local cop who insists on being the fierce protector, put in their expected great work.I believe the film is Irish and that makes it quite fine.

When it showed increased activity, several scientists were killed in a minor eruption that made headlines, and provoked controversy: mainly about whether or not the scientists' deaths could have been prevented.Williams book is a well written personal account of the disaster and of William's life afterward, including his struggle with his injuries and his guilt over whether he could have better predicted and prevented the deaths.For those interested in vulcanology, it would be a good introduction on what scientists do to monitor dangerous volcanos, and the very real risk that many of them take with little publicity to protect hundreds of thousands of lives of those people living within the shadow of these dangers."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book should be called \\"Chicken Run\\"","review":"First Stanley Williams is running from a volcanic eruption. Now, he's running from the truth. Any reader with half a clue will be disgusted with Williams' attempts to disguise the events that led to six scientists deaths. I feel sorry for the victims and their families as well as the other survivors. I felt like yelling, \\"Yes, Mr. Williams, there were other survivors!\\" Williams continual denial that he never called himself the only survivor is a complete lie. Just see NBC Nightly News, February, 1993. It's a good thing there's another book on the subject so Williams has to come clean about being the ONLY survivor. Obviously he would have never done this otherwise. If you value the truth and good science you'll be very offended by this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"a really sad look at a preventable disaster","review":"What's so sad and disturbing about this book is that it's full of excuses by the author. Williams contends, ludicrously, that people at Galeras had to die in order to advance science. These types of cover-ups do an incredible disservice to the scientific community and seek to pull the wool over the eyes of the general public. Williams denies having any guilt, even though he was the leader of an expedition that took a group of mostly inexperienced people into a volcano: \\"there is no guilt,\\" he writes \\"there was only an eruption.\\" What I read into this, was that Williams is indeed guilty and his unending protests that he did nothing wrong (very similar to some characters in the news over the past few years) are obvious cover-ups. It really left me with an incredibly bad taste in my mouth and absolutely no respect for this man who calls himself a scientist, but doesn't even have the heart to admit that mistakes he made cost people their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but a damn lie","review":"Unfortunately, most of this book is built on nothing but Stanley Williams' ego. After parading around the media for years bragging about how he had been the only survivor of a scientific expedition on Galeras, Williams continues the lie by writing a book about the explosion but conveniently forgets about the other 5 scientists who got out alive. A more compelling and truthful account about Galeras is the book by Victoria Bruce called \\"No Apparent Danger\\". Bruce took the time to interview the dozens of people involved with the Galeras tragedy and so her book is much more broad-based than the single-handed novel written by Williams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really macho. Really tiresome.","review":"I wish I would have read the review in Science Magazine April 27 edition before I wasted my money on this book. I totally agree with the very well known and respected volcanologist who wrote the review that this book is more of a \\"macho\\" book than an interesting account of science. It doesn't take a genius to see that these people in the crater didn't need to die and certainly weren't doing any life-saving research. I also agree that most of the book is \\"filler\\" and is just regurgitation of what's already been written on past eruptions. The other book on the Galeras tragedy NO APPARENT DANGER is far, far, better. It is exciting and comprehensive and, possibly because a women geologist wrote it, it is not nauseatingly macho."},{"rating":"1","title":"All about me me me, it's all me.","review":"Unreal. I read both books and it's amazing to me that williams makes himself out to be a hero when it seems obvious he knew of the danger to all. His book seems to be a great work of fiction, nothing more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surviving Galeras","review":"Surviving Galeras is a brilliant and compelling book. Williams and Montaigne have woven adventure, human drama, and the science of vulcanology with seemless balance. The poignant portrayal of his colleagues interspersed with glimpses of this and other eruptions propels the reader forward. To have survived, and to have lived through the aftermath of grief and the subtle devestation of head trauma is indeed a challenge. But to have written this moving and scientifically rich account is a gift to all who would understand volcanoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I really wanted to like this book. It is being promoted as the next Into Thin Air and suspense and excitement are promised. But in the end, it is a slow and clunky read, full of constant digressions - at least two dozen - away from the \\"action.\\" And then the end of the book is a complete mess. Reading it, I can't help but feel that Stanley Williams and his writer Fen Montagne were not clicking - a problem that I've noticed in other co-authored books. By the last half of the book, there is so much repetition and the story has such a lack of flow that it becomes a chore to finish, and the climax - which is no surprise at all - is dull.I also find Williams hard to like - he comes across as insecure and insensitive, and his manner of storytelling is so predictably macho that it gets boring fast. Too bad - it seemed like an exciting story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very exciting","review":"This is the story of a man who survived a volcano eruption. He was hurt badly himself. The main story keeps getting interrupted by rememberings of other scientists--a lot of characters, so the story is flooded with 'flash-backs' and the structure starts feeling formulaic and sometimes a little frustrating, because the interruptions break the momentum over and over. The writing's not bad, and you get a pretty good sense of what it's like to work on volcanos, but the story itself isn't very gripping."},{"rating":"2","title":"wait a minute...","review":"I thought that this was a forum for reviewing books not the character of the authors. It has turned into an opportunity to editorialize. Get off of your soap boxes and review the darn book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surviving Galeras","review":"This book is a lie. Dr. Williams was directly responsible for the deaths at Galeras. He ignored data and warnings about the impending danger. Then he had the nerve to lie to the media about being a hero and the only survivor. Read No Apparent Danger. It's the real story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Williams is held in contempt by his fellow scientists","review":"One should read Victoria Bruce's \\"No Apparent Danger\\" to put Williams' book and the related events in the proper context. Williams is an arrogant and dangerous loner who is out for his own self aggrandizement. His view of the events is rather questionable at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"macho-fest-waste-of-time","review":"Williams' story is reeling with machismo chest-pounding self-absorbtion and tainted by the fact that his account is totally different than all the other survivors' accounts. How do we take any of this seriously? A man who has lied over and over and now tries to say that his account is credible? Volcanology is so macho a science that it makes the players (the men, naturally) cheat on their wives? This is an embarrassment to good science and to good scientists. The book is well written in the beginning and then falls completely flat. The co-writer's disinterest in telling this bloated story is evident. Poor choice for educated readers with critical thinking ability. Women will especially find this book offensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"movie review","review":"Really appreciated the quick processing time, although the movie had a few small scratches on it it works perfectly...thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Karate Kid","review":"I enjoyed it.

The cinematography tries to fill in where the story falls short, but it should keep you from falling asleep (maybe). Having the child of a celebrity power couple play the top bill in his maiden cinematic voyage comes across as the shameless pre-fabricated non-event that it is; a $200,000,000 birthday cake.

The first Karate Kid was doing more Kung Fu than any thing and in this movie and and story involving being trained by Jacky Chan is a story of learning from a master at Tai Kwon Do / Kung Fu and mixed martial arts with crazy acrobatics thrown in for good measure.

It had everything this film lacks. Jaden Smith never should have gotten this part. He really is a terrible actor. And the quick shot ridiculous impossible fighting scenes only add to the plastic flavor throughout this film. I had heard good things about this film so maybe my expectations were raised too much, but I never expected it to be this bad.Jaden Smith, use your money to get an education, do something else. Acting is not for you. At least not yet. This is one of the all-time worst performances in a fairly big film I have ever seen. They should have cast someone a few years older who could actually do something called 'act'.

And also I think Jaden smith was total wrong for this part they should have had a kid with a kung fu back round or something ,but since it is Hollywood they do that kind of stuff, but what makes fighting movies in the 90's so great is the fighting looks real and easy to do and gives me motivation to become a fighter, they make it look so easy like van Damme, and Dolph Lundgren. in this movie it makes it look impossible and dose not give me any motivation to become a fighter."},{"rating":"1","title":"the karate kid","review":"the movie stopped several times during watching it. i have ordered before from you an never had a problem.this was my first (used) movie purchase and i was very upset that the movie was scratched................if you would like to keep my future business please send me a new one, so i can send this one back......sincerelydave meier (general manager)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do Justice","review":"This was a poor remake of a perfectly fine original which never should have been recreated.

Jackie Chan, known more for his comedy kung-fu and his acrobatic stunts, turned in a GREAT dramatic performance. Young Jaden Smith is a chip off the old block: the son of Jada Plinkett Smith and Will Smith, he obviously inherited talent from both parents and has talent beyond his age.

It should win an award for it - it's one of the most gorgeous movies I've seen in forever - SO well shot with such an aesthetic feel. It's almost as though the deeper the child gets into his martial arts training, the more beautiful the world becomes.The fight sequences are very well done. Jackie Chan brings quiet humor and sentimentality into play. I so enjoyed watching this young child actors body and attitude developing with his intense training. He is such a little doll, and was perfect for the part.I'd rented it, but this movie will be the next I buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Karate Kid","review":"While this is a technically sound movie, in of its own right, the use of the title, from a classic movie AND one that actually is involved with Karate is the travesty.This movie has NOTHING to do with karate.

(I know, I know, they ARE fake, but in the original, and in other movies, the best 'fake' fight scenes LOOK real to the viewer.)What I gritted my teeth through was the fact that this seemed more about Will finding a vehicle for his son to make a name for himself in cinema. It falls terribly short.I agree with another review that Will and Jada can empty their deep pockets all they want, their kid is no actor!I do enjoy many of Will's movies, but this kid needs to stick to watching his dad's films rather than making his own.I'm just glad I got this during a Starz free preview weekend and didn't waste any money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit Overrated version..","review":"I was not feeling this film at all with Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan, this film made the original \\"Karate Kid\\" look oscar worthy.I do love the original \\"Karate Kid\\" but this remake with Jaden is another example. why you do not mess around with a classic, the story line is poor..but action scenes decent but can't carry the film, Jackie Chan is no Pat Morita for sure, sure Jackie is great at martial arts but a poor actor, i feel nothing for him..unlike Pat Morita who does a good job in acting.This new \\"Karate Kid\\" I did not like or will never buy a DVD/BluRay of this, luckily it was a $1 rental, even than that's more than I will ever spend on this new version,thumbs down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad attempt at forcing cultural diversity.","review":"Some movies should be left alone.

Grisham's \\"Skipping Christmas\\" was a humorous escape last year, but this book looked a bit more serious.\\"The Winter Seeking\\" is a concise and wonderfully rendered tale of a woman dealing with many of the emotions we confront during the Christmas season. She struggles with her parents' divorce and her mother's illness. She also wrestles with her own issues of faith. When, at the suggestion of another young lady, she decides to read the Christmas account and put herself into the story, her perceptions begin to change.In some emotionally-charged, yet understated, final scenes, Vinita Hampton Wright wraps up a story that adds depth to the season. It never sugarcoats, but it does bring comfort. It never preaches, yet it offers hope. Sometimes laughter is a great medicine; in this case, a few tears clean the soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such grooviness as you've never imagined...","review":"My new favorite CD.

Half of this album sounds like a computer program (I'm not sure that it isn't, what with Eno's \\"generative\\" concept), and the other half is just plain boring.Actually, not all of the album is that bad. The track \\"Ikekuburo\\" is really a very good piece, one I enjoy listening to quite often. Buy the album for that track alone - all the rest simply sound too rigid and \\"programmed\\" for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite late night CDs","review":"I think I have just about every ambient CD Eno ever did, and this is one of my favorites. You put it on and it drifts from background to foreground and all at a peaceful pace that is sooooo relaxing[skip track 2]. Something magical here... but I can't put my finger on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eno After Hours","review":"'The Shutov Assembly' is one of Brian Eno's ambient works, which means that it rewards close listening, but can also work as quiet, background music. The tone of the album is primarily a dark, late night feel... but it's not a downer. It has the dreamlike quality of 'Apollo' along with the mystery of 'On Land.' You can get lost in the density of 'Shutov' very easily, which is exactly the point!Out of the ten tracks, the highlight for me is \\"Ikebukuro,\\" which is 16 minutes of organic tranquility. This track is probably my all-time favorite piece of music by Brian, and is worth the price of the CD by iteself. In fact, if played at a quiet volume, the whole album serves as an excellent tool for relaxation. Brian's ambient music is definitely my idea of music therapy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxation Music","review":"I bought this after hearing a cut from P. Gabriel's \\"Plus From Us\\". I already had Eno's \\"Apollo\\" which I enjoyed very much. The opening track is the star of this record - probably one of the most beautiful audio textures I have ever heard. The rest of the record is along this same approach - more like audio atmospheres rather than \\"songs\\". The bad part is that this CD is so enchanting and relaxing that I always fall asleep after the 5th or 6th song - so I can't vouch for the whole thing! Other songs on here contain Eno's signature of studio ingenuity once again as will be revealed should you buy this CD. Studio engineers and insomniacs alike should not be caught without this little gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Roller Coaster Novel","review":"This book tumbles, it roars, it defies conventions that other novelists use. But it is not crude; and in no way is it sadistic or full of hate. It chronicles the life of an ill-fated man, wounded from WW1, and the events that take him on wild rides. Yes, average readers may not sympathise with the character, but there is something to be said about him. This character is an outcast; a man that doesn't choose his way of life, but who is unfortunate in the rollicking world of post WW1 London. Thus, he retaliates in his own unique and off-the-wall actions. This novel says a lot about unfortunate men. And of cousre, about being fed up with society, people, and bad luck. Anyone interested in a break from dull novels should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"itch","review":"This chair has some lacquer or chemical that caused everyone in my family to break out with contact dermatitis.

After about 3 months (May to August), the Bluetooth feature no longer works. It doesn't connect to my car's system, and it doesn't connect to my wife's brand new Motorola T305 hands-free system. My wife's phone (a 2 year old LG Chocolate) still connects to all of our Bluetooth systems, so I'm certain it's my VX8700 that's not working.I really like the look and feel of this phone, so I'm going to see if Verizon has a solution for the Bluetooth problem. If they do, I'll update this review.At least it still fits in my pockets!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated the phone almost as much as I hate VerizoneWireless","review":"After having a LG chocolate for over a year, and having it replaced 5 times under warranty, it broke again. Verizon replaced it with this lovely phone, which is missing many of the features the chocolate had. It has no music alarm, and though the camera is 2MP, it has no auto focus. Getting pictures that are not blurry is very complicated, and usually impossible. It is not very ergonomic and my hand would hurt after talking on it too long, as would the phone heat up quite a bit after about a 20 minute conversation. The keys are not conducive to texting at all, I deleted many a long, almost finished text by trying to type something from the 3 key and hitting end instead.I called Verizon Customer service to get a comparable phone to my old chocolate, since it was not my choice at all to get this phone. I ended up trading up to a samsung U900 flipshot, only paid $70, and love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Phone!","review":"I love these people who think they are a phone conesuer. Look, there is never going to be a perfect phone so deal with the one you have and evidently you went to the store and picked it out. Well in my opinion from when I had other phone companies Verizon Wireless is the best carrier I have ever had. Also the LG VX8700 is the best phone I have ever owned. So get over yourself and actually enjoy what you have instead of griping about it. The phone takes great Pictures/Video (The display is fine if you know how to set it right) for brightness etc. The sound is crystal clear and nice loud ring tones since i work in a shop with loud machinery. So I would definately purchase this phone if you are looking for an all around great phone! And if you have a problem with pulling a phone out of your pocket and missing a call simply get a phone case to clip to your belt. Simple as that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh it's ok i guess","review":"I had this for over two years and i am already wishing to switch phones.

The camera quality got significantly worse(yes i know all lenses get scratched) but this phone just gets worse and worse through the years.

His descriptions of the bombings, shootings and random daily violence that permeated around the non-citizens and the citizens of Lebanon, make this a classic Middle East hostage survivor's story. Anderson's poems of his cruel incarceration are filled with searing depth that transport you to the various scummy basement cells which he shared with other Westerners. Den of Lions and Hostage by David Jacobson go hand in hand and are important contributions in the collection of Middle East books that help those of us citizens who were not there or too young to remember, the horror that Beirut was during the eighties and early ninties. Very highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Den of Lions: Memoirs of Seven Years [LARGE PRINT]","review":"When I purchased this book it was for the purpose of providing support documentation information I needed for a report.

The person who gave it to me did so knowing that I love dancing. I have also surmounted many obstacles in my life. We need stories like this to be told. Unfortunately this book does not measure up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspiring Story -- The writer did not do it justice","review":"As a competitive dancer, an avid reader, and a writer, I was compelled to buy this book based on the reviews found here.While the story is an inspiring one, and does gives one some added \\"fire\\" to overcome adversity and difficulties, the book was cumbersome. The prose is weak and awkward -- to distraction-- with too much \\"Tell what happened\\" and not enough \\"Show me what happened\\";Even some of the basics of competitive dance was a bit of a jumble (and incorrect), which hurt credibility.I love to read, and Love to dance. But I had to put this book away after 40 pages. The writing is just too distracting and disjointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Paper","review":"This book is a waste of paper. I don't think the person that wrote it realizes the importance of re-writes. Seems like she read one of those \\"How To Write A Novel\\" books and tried to write this book afterwards. Just plain bad. I'm surprised Amazon is even stocking it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talented writer, but bad book","review":"This book is about a band that could never make it in the rock scene in NY (or did they?), and the author tirelessly rips them appart. I had many problems with this book. Number one, isn't it a little easy to rip on a band that never made it. It's a little like picking on the smallest kid in school. It's easy, but why bother. Second, Sorrentino writes the book in a strange and creative structure. But, a cool structure doesn't make up for a dull story. Most of the book is about one night when the band just plays at a club. Pulp Fiction wasn't a good movie just because it had an interesting structure, it was an interesting story to begin with.The worst chapter is Dub 3 (Vocals) where every character is asked the same three questions. Again, these are not interesting questions, or answers. It's just people rambling. I know some people liked it, and I thought I would like it too, but in the end it just sounds like a talented writer with no direction or motivation."},{"rating":"1","title":"have seeds, will travel","review":"THE LIFE OF JOHNNY APPLESEED IN A seed SHELL.

I was not thrilled as it was listed as a 5 out of 5 chomper (for aggressive chewers). So far the only indestructible ball I've found is the bow wowzer.

He seemed to enjoy it, but after one week, a large portion of the yellow rubber part of the ball was torn off and probably had been eaten.

I recommend this book with one concern: The publisher chose to use a font similar to a typewriter, to give the photos a feel for the WWII-era context... but the font is too light to read in many cases. Simply using a bolder typewriter font would have been fine, and earned this book a 5 star rating.I know this may seem picky, but what good are the details of his life if they cannot be read?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert Capa, photographer","review":"An excellent book, well printed, with a lot of photographs.

Hard.His tone would do more to set the bass back in the eyes of one not familiar with the instrument's potential than a middle school orchestra playing the \\"Elephant\\".Some people really ought to listen to what they record before releasing it.

I give this single two stars because this band is a disappointment. There was a time when they brought something to the table. Noel's songwriting presented a unique pop melody. Not here. Not only did they rip off \\"Street Fighting Man\\" with this single, but the melody here is nearly identical to what is one of the most distinct melodies in rock n' roll. It's good that oasis is looking in different directions for influences, since their fans are growing up and their sound is becoming stale. Just because they have accents doesn't make their music exotic. With that said, they may have the capability of being a decent rock band so I hope the single isn't indicative of the album, good luck Oasis on creating original music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great low cost for light to medium duty use","review":"I purchased this mat to place under my treadmill to protect the floor underneath and prevent any slippage. The mat is well constructed and large enough for just about any treadmill. This one is a larger than most would need, but I thought I needed the extra length (I don't). It is strong enough for light to medium use. If you were especially rough on this mat you could wear it or tear it fairly easily. But it does what it's supposed to and you get what you pay for. I'm very satisfied with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure Amazon sends the correct mat!","review":"I actually ordered a more expensive treadmill mat and Amazon sent this one instead. I considered keeping this mat and opened the box to check it out. I can definitely say that it's going back. The material is really thin. There's also a disclaimer in the box that this mat only has a one year warranty, which doesn't cover tears, rips, or punctures. The material is so thin that I wouldn't be surprised if placing my treadmill on it will puncture it immediately. I obviously can't give an adequate review because I'm sending it back for the original mat that I ordered, but I just wanted to give my initial impressions of the mat. Double check to make sure Amazon sends you the correct product! I've read other reviews where customers have received the incorrect treadmill mat from Amazon. I hope it's accidental, but they should have corrected the problem by now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong size shipped twice","review":"The description on Amazon.com said that it was 7 feet long.

I cancelled my order and ended up ordering a different mat (7 feet long) that unfortunately was twice the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE OF SELLER","review":"I strongly recommend buying this from another seller who won't call you a \\"f*cking as*hole\\" when your Cd doesn't come. That is what he did to me. I never received my CD and when I inquired about it. He verbally abused me. You should know how this seller treats his customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS!!!","review":"This recording is awful, technically, not musically. The recordings were made in 1947 and 1957, that's over 60 years ago! Imagine what kind of equipment they had. Played on a modern sound system, the distortion is almost unlistenable. I threw the case away before I played it or I would have returned it. I'm currently shopping for a more modern version."},{"rating":"2","title":"How pop should sound","review":"I consider this album a jewel in my music collection. I can't say enough about this record.. it's a pop masterpiece, no question. In my opinion, it stands up there with The Smiths, The Stone Roses, The Ocean Blue.. even The Beatles. It's an absolute joy to listen to.The only bad thing about Riverside, is that they only put out two albums. The world needs more quality music like this :) And since it's out of print, snatch these copies up before you can't. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost Classic","review":"Wherever the members of Riverside may be today, they can be sure that they have left a pretty, heartfelt album behind, doomed forever to used cd stores and the luckiest of collections.

They have another album but I can't find it anywhere. Probably don't need it anyway. Doubt I'd like it better.\\"Waterfall\\" was played often on a local radio station (Cleveland) back in the day. Once bought the tape in a retail store but the album was destroyed by consequence.Nice to have the album, even better on CD. Like almost every song. (Cinnamon Eyes and Galaxie are the most boring but still sound soothing, as in the entire album).Mellow light rock at its finest, this forgotten artist would be recommended by anyone who likes this style of music.You can't easily find samples of their music either - you know it or you don't, and that is that."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"I bought this when it came out in 1992.

It wasn't a typical Everly album with originally penned (e.g. Bodleaux-Bryant) hits, and it came out when the massive stream of Everly hits was on the wane.However, SGCH exemplified the best of what the Nashville Sound could offer. Quality of the recordings was excellent, and more interestingly, many of the arrangements of what one would consider 'country standards' reached some new territories here. Not only do the country arrangements benefit from (what would then be an unheard of) complementary black blues idioms (e.g. I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry) - but the more upbeat songs were the first hints (in fact, preceding by 2 years) the electrified sounds that would be later associated with the electric folk rock sound.and remember, this was 1963."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Dissapointed","review":"I read this book along with two other of Garrett's and beleive that they are nothing but a bloated advertisement and self-promotion of their detectors.
