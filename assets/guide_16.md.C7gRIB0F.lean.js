Granted that the book expertly leads us through refactoring of smelly code; and granted that the catalog of refactorings are full of interesting insights. But still and all, it was the attitude that the value of a module was not maximized simply by making it work that really struck home.You can vastly improve a module without changing its function whatever. Morevoer, such function preserving, structure improving, changes are a normal and essential part of every engineer's role."},{"rating":"2","title":"learn object orientation from existing code","review":"This is a must if you are new to OO coding principles.I found it very difficult to convert from structured coding to OO coding even after reading the \\"Head First Design Patterns\\" book, which is my second favorite book on learning practical OO coding.This book will help you look at your existing code and convert it to more object oriented code. Now, I just start my design and coding using my old coding practices, except that when I see an old coding style I used to perform, but I now know is referenced in the book, I stop myself and apply the recommended patterns from the book. So little by little I have grown more object oriented in my coding but by small easily understood steps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good resource for teaching","review":"What is better? Replacing delegations with inheritance or replacing inheritance with delegation?The answer is the ultimate answer to most software engineering decisions: DEPENDS, there is always a trade-off that has to be analyzed according to the context! This book addresses those trade-offs very well.Moreover, I like the examples in the book, good to use in class when teaching. They generate interesting discussions."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kindle version is broken","review":"The content itself is excellent -- the discussion of refactoring is absolutely great. I would give the content itself a good four or perhaps five stars.Sadly, the Kindle version is broken. The book uses example code before a refactor and after a refactor to illustrate its points, and I believe in the print version the two versions are displayed side by side. Unfortunately, in the Kindle version this side-by-side layout is destroyed, making the comparisons useless.I have read over twenty Kindle editions of books on the iPhone, iPad and my desktop, and I've never felt disappointed. Sadly, the Kindle version of \\"Refactoring\\" feels like a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refactor afterwards, but design and review first","review":"Refactoring, says Fowler in his preface, is improving the structure of the code without changing the behavior at all. His book certainly offers an organized way to do that, with examples and then an entire second half of the book which is a reference of refactoring patterns. I can recommend reading the first half of the book (methods) and then keeping it around as a reference when needed.But as a constant daily method, I think it claims too much. \\"Improving the design of the code after it has been written,\\" is still difficult, even if you have a book of refactoring patterns. And Fowler rightly makes having a strong unit testing suite a requirement.So I can say: read the book so that if you find yourself doing refactoring, you won't have to reinvent the wheel. But don't get your hopes up that refactoring is a substitute for good design and clear coding, as measured and improved through review by trusted co-workers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Integral for development","review":"I was fortunate enough to work with Martin on a project at Netscape a few years ago. I have been able to leverage what I learned there in many ways since. In a modern iterative and incremental process, refactoring can be a phase of each iteration. So say you do some analysis, design, code, testing in your first iteration. There can also be a refactoring stage added to \\"clean up the code\\" and shift the design. Usually people are doing this anyway in the design and coding stages.However, decoupling refactoring in the spiral process can separate concerns so that the next iteration can cleanly focus upon drilling down further or adding functionality as it should.So obviously the notion of refactoring is critical to development. This book serves as a beginning for a similar literature that exists for design in the form of patterns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ideas, bad book","review":"Fowler's book is has a lot of very good ideas, but it is poorly written, hard to follow, and incredibly disorganized. I think it would have benefited immensely from the services of a good editor.My two major complaints: First, Fowler tries so hard to be clever and witty that at times his point is completely lost in his misguided attempts at humor. Second, he constantly refers ahead to material not yet covered, so that it's impossible to understand Chapter N without already having read Chapter N+1, which of course presupposes that you have read and understood Chapter N.If you are going to read this book (and I concede that you probably should) then you should at the same time buy a copy of Joshua Kerievsky's \\"Refactoring to Patterns.\\" Kerievsky brings far more organization and explanation to the subject than does Fowler. Read Kerievsky first, and refer to Fowler when he directs you there (which he very frequently does). But don't try to read Fowler by himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"50 page book expanded to over 400 pages","review":"The subject matter is very pertinent, but the book could have been more to the point. Some of the pages have only four lines of code; I could not understand why so much of space was left blank. Many of the techniques taught are not new and should be part of development and refactoring. It would have been nice if the authors went through each other's manuscripts and REFACTORED the book, because the book is full of repetitive material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must be on your bookshelf","review":"If you are a professional developer, this book is a must have. Change is the norm in today's development organization, and the ideas and refactorings in this book will help you make changeable, maintainable software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"It doesn't happen often that I finish a book within 2 days. This time it is because there is surprisingly little new stuff for experienced programmers. It is well written and probably of use for beginning programmers, but as I went through the refactoring patterns, I kept saying to myself: \\"yes of course, I do that all the time.., where are the flashes of new insight?\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo","review":"Yeah, its a great book. As in Analysis Patterns and UML Distilled, Fowler has found an important yet neglected topic and covered it with good sense and a clear style. I look forward to his writings on extreme programming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good? It's posible?","review":"I'm surprised with the high Refactoring's Rating. I've read GoF Design Patterns and Fowler Refactoring is not able to reach the experience. Is simplistic, don't give you nothing new on OO programming, and don't have the category to became a classic.Perphaps I'm not a great programmer (who knows...) but the Refactoring's seems a child story. I'm sorry, many people talked amazing things of Fowler UML distilled. Perhaps, but this is not the case.For middle brained, s quarter of programmer, I don't recommend the book. Only if you're interested in something like \\"which're the refactorings (intuitive) algorithms to implement in some place\\" try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"valuable reference book","review":"While it is no groundsbreaking stuff, it is very useful for people who want to bring better design into existing code; or those who are just unhappy with the existing code. It clearly identified common problems with existing code and provides techniques to help you make it better. While experienced programmers have most likely used some of these techniques on their own, reading this book helps you remember/organize these techniques in your mind. One of the most useful things is that Martin outlines the steps to take to get to the desired code - each step is very small so as to minimize your chance of screwing it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful book for professional developers","review":"This book make systematic the steps of fixing the design of poor or mediocre code. Experienced programmers might be put off by the apparent simplicity of many of the steps described. But more important that the individual steps, is knowing when and where to apply them, improving the efficiency of the process and the quality of the result. After all life is too short to waste on reworking code for any longer than necessary. You can also apply the methods in this book to your own design before you implement it. This book is a useful companion to \\"Code Complete\\", but if I had an empty bookshelf I would buy \\"Design Patterns\\" and \\"Code Complete\\" first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A concept every software developer should understand","review":"In my humble opinion, of course, every developer should understand the concept of refactoring.

As always, I did not agree with every bit of commentary, but there's nothing in there that would keep me from recommending this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foundation Material","review":"This should sit on your shelf, after your first reading, next to Design Patterns, and Fundemantals of Computer Graphics, so that it's there to refresh you with ideas when you are having one of 'those' afternoons.I think this is a core or foundation book for a practicing software engineer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for any serious developer.","review":"This book is required reading for anyone who is serious about software development. If you want to go from good to great then do yourself a favor and get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaches concept not coding","review":"Some of the reviews here have focused on this book as a way of learning coding techniques for refactoring. Other reviews have focused on refactoring being another term for what they have already being doing. While learning some new coding techniques might be a side effect of reading this book, the real value of this book is descibing a process and terminology for facilitating refactoring - something that many developers have done on an ad-hoc basis for years. It has been invaluable in broadening the acceptability of refactoring, an activity that was often dismissed as not being a good use of development resources time. It also gives a vocabulary for discussing refactoring rather than relying on engineers own adhoc practices. And there's probably a few refactoring techniques that won't seem obvious.For C# users, you may wish to look at NUnit.org for a .Net version of the JUnit software mentioned in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important milestone","review":"From time to time, but in truth rarely, an author write a book that change our mind about code or software process. From my point of view, this is the 2nd book like that in this decade (the first was Design Patterns). It outline especially that code and design that works isn't enough. He also describes formally things that I do (and thousands programmers) for years, but silently. Even if expressed in Java, the book is usefull in all OO languages. Just get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"F A N T A S T I C","review":"This book is fantastic for many reasons - foremost in my list because it indirectly teaches what good OOP looks and feels like in implementation. Many books try to do this, but don't quite do it the way this one does it for me. This book shows you how to detect \\"smells\\" in code that need attention. More interesting is how a so-so/poor program can be turned into an elegant piece of engineering that is simpler to read and understand.In addition:* It's well written.* Indirectly shows you how to make better OO code* Section on identifying \\"bad smells\\" in code is dead on.Must get. - Best programming related book I have read this year (2000)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mentoring...","review":"I learned many things from this book.

I expected more interesting insights and experiences about the cultural adaptation of an Englishman to living in Paris, but instead was bored by his immature and adolescent thoughts and behaviors with French women, which we hear about in excessive detail.

What struck me was that there was absolutely no insight into France and the French culture, but just ramblings by a very stupid, conceited, xenophobic--and above all boring--British ass.The protagonist makes no effort to understand things and seem to assume that his expatriate status allows him to try things he'd never get away with at home.And before someone plays the \\"you don't know how expats think\\": I grew up in Germany, worked as a tour guide during college, lived in France and the UK, and now work in the Bay Area.

I got tired of reading about the amoral French and wondered what on earth was up with a man that was so apparently sex-addled that he was willing to take up with some of the most reprehensible women for a roll in the hay. And at the end of the book I wondered why someone who could barely speak French, understood only too well the iron grip the unions have on every facet of life and their willingness to strike at any moment for no practical reason, the corruption of the French bureaucracy and the difficulty of living in Paris decided to live there and start a business!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is merde!","review":"For anyone above the age of 21, this book is simply too juvenile.

I picked it up based on her suggestion and some online reviews. I didn't make it through the fourth chapter. The book trades in low-level comedy surrounding basic differences and stereotypes etc: fashion and style, work hours, kissing, etc. I suppose I was looking for more sophisticated comedy surrounding real differences like fatalism and grand projects etc. I just couldn't get into it - too much cringing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brit in Paris","review":"A whimsical book on a Brit living in Paris. There are three themes in this story. The satire of an Englishman adjusting to Parisian life with a country house thrown in, his amorous adventures with libidinous young women, and an intrigue of sordid business and political deals.The first one - the satire worked well and kept me reading. There are equally amusing observations on French and British life. The other two areas - the amorous encounters and the intrigue were less successful and seemed there merely to decorate the Parisian observations with soft-core flirtations and a business espionage that didn't make much sense to me.I love Paris and France so that part of the travelogue worked. To emphasize - this book is a travel brochure with titillation and intrigue tossed into the salad but not enhancing the taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, funnier, A Year in the Merde!","review":"One of the funniest books I've ever read!

Abby comes home from school one day and is told she is really Princess Florinda of Saxony Coburn. So after the wild trip to Saxony Coburn, Abby is taught how to be graceful, polite, ect. One small thing they didn't tell her- she hasto marry on her sixteenth birthday to some creepy prince named Casmir. So after a long drown out escapade, she finds out she isn't a princess and gets the guy she really wants.

It takes you through just about everything the leader of these groups would need to think about before, during and after forming up. It spends a good deal of time on how to identify the right people for your group, how to deal with mundane issues like using someone's home as a temple or how to get a separate temple area and ideas for dealing with the inevitable financial issues associated with any group.

I'm a big fan of historical fiction especially when the author weaves historical figures into the story alongside fictional characters. The plot moved along very quickly and the development of the characters was good as well. As I was making my way through the book I kept asking myself how the author would end the story I knew (as do many of us) that Capone eventually leaves NY to settle in Chicago but how would the author accomplish this within the context of his story? I thought the ending was just a bit too far fetched. The author wrapped it up in a nice neat package. Who wants that? I guess the author was limited to what he could do to most of the main characters if he wanted to keep it in line with reality. Still it was a huge letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning from first note to last","review":"Even to a relative newcomer to jazz like myself, the excellence of Lee Morgan is obvious at once, both as composer & musician. As with so many others, \\"Sidewinder\\" was my introduction to this gifted artist; but I have to agree with the previous posters in saying that this is a particularly superb album, one that really stays with the listener. I don't have the technical vocabulary to describe it, but one thing that stands out for me is Morgan's seeming effortlessness, his confidence & sureness as a musician. It's not just a matter of practice & skill -- plenty of fine musicians have that -- but a sort of cool, quiet centeredness, a feeling that he has firm roots allowing him to soar freely when he plays. I've never been disappointed by any album of his ... but again, there's an expansiveness to this one, a serious sort of playfulness, that really raises it up higher than high. Absolutely recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MORGAN THE PIRATE is my favorite Lee Morgan track","review":"SEARCH FOR THE NEW LAND: Featuring Grant's 2-note oscillating nautical motif.

During Herbie's solo, the others do that 6-note intro motif. One after the other with each one in a different key. What a fab gimmick.MR. KENYATTA: In fast sextuple time and it's my favorite track.

Would work fine for women. It can not be returned, so I put it in the garbage. It is not inexpensive, so it is a waste of money.

I consider it insulting that the Anglo actors are credited while Hoffman, who is the Cheyenne Warrior, is ignored in the credits. This is clearly a case of institutionalized racism and censorship of the concern being expressed by American Indian fans of Hoffman. His portrayol is so genuine that one forgets he is acting. He creates a character rich with complexities - a fully developed human being. While the vast majority of movies portray American Indians as monosyllabic stoic statues - this man is a man with love, humor, intelligence, confusion, compassion - everything. He is a man.

This CD is basically the \\"Saeta / \\"Vegas\\" single, seven tracks from \\"Nico in Tokyo\\" and three versions of \\"All Tomorrow's Parties.\\"The vocals for Track 1. \\"All Tomorrow's Parties\\" and Track 4. \\"All Tomorrow's Parties\\" (Extended Jam) seem to be lifted from the recording made in 1982 with \\"The Invisible Girls,\\" but with another band playing the instrumentals in an arrangement similar to the original recording made in 1967. It sounds much more polished than the 1967 recording made by The Velvet Underground. The last track, Track 12. \\"All Tomorrow's Parties\\" (Nico vs. Apoptygma Berzerk) is a techno remix of the song, but with vocals from a concert recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"This CD was squashed with a compressor by, I presume, the mastering engineer to the point that I find the first four tracks and some of the subsequent live tracks (e.g. The End) practically unlistenable.

The problem is she wants only Fred Astaire as her instructor. When she is found dead, Fred and Toby search for her killer. The dead bodies pile up. Hollywood during the war years is the scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled!","review":"I don't know why Niven let his legacy be sullied by this terrible book. I was fooled into buying it because of his name. I bought it while I was on a trip, so I was stuck with it. Yuck!I gave this book one star because that was the lowest rating I could give it.What a ridiculous premise. How poorly executed. How unbelievable.Don't go there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A problem concept but well delivered","review":"I think with \\"Building Harlequin's Moon\\" and \\"Ringworld's Children\\" Larry Niven has finally returned, putting behind him the horrid 1990s where he wrote one uninspired, confusing, and convoluted book after another. \\"Building Harlequin's Moon\\" is not on the same level as \\"Ringworld\\" or \\"The Mote In God's Eye,\\" but it is a fine book and an enjoyable, quick read.As others have said, one of the things that holds the book back is the basic premise that only by creating a race of slaves, can the colonists save themselves. It doesn't ring true and nags at the back of your mind as you read the book. But putting this aside and going with the premise, we have great Niven characters on an interesting world. There is a point about a quarter of the way through the book when something is done to one of the main characters that just infuriates the reader. I knew when I got that mad, that I was hooked on \\"Building Harlequin's Moon.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"sociology of colonists and their children","review":"This book started out a bit slow and it took me a while to get into it, but I ended up enjoying it. While the science of the story was okay, the main heart of the novel is the psychology of the colonists as they deal with their children, and the decisions their children must make when they find out that they are arbitrarily being treated as subhuman. I liked the characters and found most of their development believable. The one problem I had with this book was the believability of the colonist's decision to have descendants they were planning to leave behind on a doomed moon - I know they had to make \\"hard choices\\" but it seemed a bit contrived that this was the best decision they could come up with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read in the Niven style","review":"This is a unique idea in science fiction, the idea that a ship marooned would need to make difficult moral choices in order to make it to their destination.The story is told from all sides and allows us to experience their dilemmas from all angles.A good story, well told."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good Read","review":"I have read everything Larry Niven has written. I figured I would go out on a limb and read this collaborative effort with Brenda Cooper for whom this is, I believe, her debut work.The book was decidedly \\"Niven-like\\" with great character development, cool hard sci-fi premises and a story that had a beginning, a middle and an end.Shannon Norrell"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a typical Larry Niven book :(","review":"Let me start by saying I think Larry Niven is one of the greatest science fiction writers out there.He is my Pantheon next to Asimov, Heinlein, Clarke, Zelazny and co.If you are looking for a Known Space book, this is not it.If you are looking for a hard science fiction book, this is not it.The story is not convincing, not the plot nor the characters.There is no riddle, no twist, no exploring like I'm so used to find in Larry Niven books.I want a refund.BTW, before reading this book I've read \\"The Draco Tavern\\". I've read in the past most of the stories in the book (it's a collection), but it was a joy reading it. And now I've started reading \\"Fleet of Worlds\\". I'm only on page 24 and from here I'm going right back to reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a Larry Niven book","review":"Badly written, poorly edited and a turgid poorly thought through plot.

Thats not to say I don't like him, I just don't seek his books out. But I really enhjoyed this Book. I think it would appeal to people who enjoy stories that take place over long periods of time (60,000 years). Good plot, believable characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too juvenile for my taste","review":"I was really disappointed in this book. I've read just about everything that Niven has written or collaborated on, and this book just didn't match his usual standard. The book clearly focused on pulling the particular stings of the young reader. Sometimes this works even for adults, when you know it up front, but I don't think it worked this time.Apparently Cooper wrote the vast majority of the text. I just couldn't relate to the main character. For the first time ever (for a Niven book) after reading over half the book, found I just wasn't that interested in her or the story, and just skipped to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Very disappointing, I've been a long time fan of Niven but even confined to a hospital bed I was only able to get through 2/3 of the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak compared to Ringworld or other early works","review":"The book deals with the conflicts between the moon people who are destined to die as the moon becomes airless, and the space people who are immortal and plan to go on to another star when the fuel project for which the moon was built is completed. We are used to conflicts between groups of people, but in this case the moon people are the children of the space people. Can you imagine raising a child to do your work and then to be abandoned to die? I could not suspend my disbelief that far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hack job","review":"Thankfully, I got my copy from the library.Like several other reviewers, I only got partway into this before I realized it was going nowhere: an implausible concept, badly executed.This is yet another example of an established, accomplished writer lending his name to the work of somebody who could not possibly market this stuff on their own. We see a lot of this now, as the great science fiction authors get on in years and no longer generate memorable original material as they did in their earlier days. For those hoping for an unforgettable reading experience to rival Niven's \\"Ringworld\\" or the \\"Tales of Known Space\\" universe, there's nothing here.Dual-author science fiction should be a red flag: \\"Warning! Hack material inside!\\" And to think, just a few decades ago, Niven and Pournelle actually had a great collaborative corpus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but I just didn't like this one","review":"After trying to get through the first 1/3 of this book, I gave up. Having been a fan of Mr. Niven's work for many years now, I am extremely disappointed in both the amateur nature of the writing, and the total lack of character depth. This story didn't grab me in the least, and anyone can figure out the ending of the book (which I did read) by the end of the 2nd chapter.There are no traces of Mr. Niven's writing style anywhere in the book, and the tone of the writing leads me to believe he was paid to be co-author, but didn't do any of the primary writing.Very disappointed, hopefully the next book with Mr. Niven's name on it will actually have been written by him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Your Usual Niven SciFi","review":"Usually I can't put a Niven book down. This one was hard to pick up. Very slow going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good, Mostly bad","review":"I've always loved Niven, and the parts I could clearly see he wrote in this book I enjoyed. The concept, definitely Niven. The character Gabriel, also, definitely Niven. Most of the rest of the book feels like some poorly written adolescent coming-of-age tale set inside the fairly cool concept designed by Niven.Maybe its just me, but this book seems like a favor that Larry Niven did for Brenda Cooper. I'm all for giving a fellow writer a leg up or collaborating with a peer to produce a more well-rounded book, but in this case it wasn't a peer.If you're a Niven fan, pass this one by. I read the last page, tossed the book on the coffee table and thought about all the other things I could have been doing or other books I could have been reading while I wasted my time on this.Note to Larry: Give Jerry a call, you guys are great together. Never take Brenda's calls ever again. She's sci-fi poison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like (breathe) this (breathe) book.","review":"I didn't recognize much of Niven's writing style in this novel. That said, I found the writing to be dull, uninspiring and just plain bad. The characters are poorly developed and the science secondary to poorly played out human drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my gosh this is terrible","review":"I can't even work up the energy to write a properly comprehensive review.

Here are all the elements for a good story full of conflict and the struggle to be free. The time element is handled by putting the characters into \\"cold sleep\\" every few years, so they'll live long enoough to finish the moon and build an anti-matter machine. The storyline is involving and passionate, and forces some tough decisions. The only part I didn't \\"buy\\" was the complete capitulation of Ma Liren, the moon-children's greatest enemy. I think she would oppose them to her last breath. Otherwise, very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book really doesn't go anywhere...","review":"The first 200-250 pages aren't bad, but then the book takes a turn and you wonder where it is going... No where. I was holding on through the first 200 pages, then I just saw it was going nowhere and sadly I was right it didn't go anywhere. I finished the book confused and empty handed. Niven's style isn't apparent in this book, and I wonder who this newcomer Cooper is. The hard SF in this book also isn't well supported and the characters don't develop as they should. I'm surprised I finished the book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing.","review":"I am going on six decades, and over that period have read a handful of collections of stories in the same class as these stories. Although this troubled man only wrote this one book, he accomplished more than most writers do in a career. If you love great writing this book will not disappoint you. Other reviewers have described the content well, so I will not repeat it, but will agree heartily with the five star reviews. I only wish we had more from this incredibly talented man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cry for the loss","review":"Wow, if you have read previous ten reviews you'll think that Mr. Pancake was the embodiment of Faulkner, Tennessee Williams and Malmud. It is truly unfortunate that he killed himself in 1979. If he had lived, today he might be one of America's great short story writers. His writing style is measured and sparse. It is as if he had not looked to expand his writer's pallet of possibilities.Pancake's is a story worth knowing for its sense of profound loss not its sense of contribution. His stories of West Virginia draw you in and leave you with a satisfaction of understanding the protagonists and their situations. But, there are no deep messages. The deep messages were still in the heart and brain that were stopped by a self inflected shotgun blast. Cry for the loss. There is not a volume of work to celebrate."},{"rating":"1","title":"$50 is alot to spend on a nice cover.","review":"As an owner of over 100 handbags, I was very disappointed with this book.

I always finish one of her Benjamin January novels wanting more. I am constantly amazed that Ms. Hambly is not a household name. I reccommend her books constantly because her range is so wide, Biography, Historical , Science Fiction, I cannot get enough!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Such Thing as a Bad Benjamin January Novel","review":"The mystery aspect of this novel wasn't as complex and engaging as some of the other Ben January books, particularly Days of the Dead. That said, I absolutely loved one of the side-plots. As usual with these novels, the characters and setting were incredible. The thing I love most about any of Hambley's novels, particularly the January books, is her ability to make a culture and her characters come alive. I can practically taste the air and feel the humidity, as well as feel the claustrophic setting on the paddle boat. My one complaint, particularly if this is the last January book, is that we haven't seen Shaw for a couple of books. He's too fun a character to let retire gracefully into the background."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm and Cozy","review":"I am very pleased with this product.

I really appreciated that Epega could say so much in such a informative way and still end up with a book that is very easy to read. (So many other Obi Abata books are either filled with fluff or very intellectual.) The editing is perfect.What I enjoyed the least about this book, is that he provides no full Obi Abata Iwure (Prayer). While its true that we say Akinmoran x 3 I think most Priests and Devotees would agree, the average person should, in fact, MUST use a full length prayer to ensure that they Deity in question has actually been invoked. Which brings me to my last criticism - Epega never tells who can invokes and queried through Obi Abata. Its for this reason that I think this book is more suited to the devotee w/ Spiritual Elders, as opposed to the average joe off the street. But still, a wonderful book to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"flyer children's wagon","review":"Pleased with the sturdy wagon, inflatable tires that makes travel over parks and yards easy.

I've learned a lot about, and gained respect, for many culinary creations that I previously knew very little about. However, it is also dispiriting. For example, I am now discouraged from eating any American Oysters(according to Mr. Rosengarten, the only good ones are from France), and his chapter on Pecan Pie, betrays a palate that is maybe a little narrow and judgemental. In short, althought very informative, \\"Taste\\" left me with a bitter taste in my mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Unlike the reviewer who found this book impractical, I have found this to be the best books on food that I have read. There is a chpater on wine which explains simply and clearly how to identify good food-wine pairings: excellent advice that has helped me on more than one occasion. Additionally, he explains enough about several wines from around the world that you can go and choose a bottle in confidence that your money will not be wasted.Some of the recipes are complex, but others are very simple such as marinara sauce and dried pasta.

They almost remind me of having plastic sheets on the bed. I would have expected a very smooth satiny sheet, but they're a bit rough and loud.

Most Dylan fans already own his more expansive collections, like \\"Biograph\\", and the \\"Greatest Hits Vol, 1,2, and 3\\" compilations. If you are new to Dylan, I would recommend the \\"Essential Bob Dylan\\", if you just want one CD. That double disc gives a healthy serving of Dylan classics, and is more complete. If you have never owned a Dylan collection before, and you buy this, try listening to his \\"Blonde On Blonde\\" or \\"Blood On The Tracks\\" cd to see what you have been missing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to spare a dollar for Columbia?","review":"I guess Columbia records need some money this Christmas to pay for new yacths for their excecutives.

Nothing special about this collection, in fact, its preety dumb trying to put tracks from the 60's, 70, 80, 90, and 2000's in the same CD. Its a mess and a very unnatural listen. Get the greatest hits packages, and from there, start collecting the albums. This compilation is nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best single disc collection?","review":"This set is for the extremely casual fan who thought the 2-disc \\"Essential\\" collection was just too much. This is roughly the best of that, and better than his \\"Greatest Hits\\" because of the inclusion of what he's done since. This is also almost exactly the same as the UK only \\"Best Of\\" right down to the cover photo, just two tracks shorter. Anyway, this gives you his early classic material like \\"Blowin' In The Wind\\", \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\", and \\"Rainy Day Women #12 & 35\\", as well as his better later stuff like \\"Tangled Up In Blue\\", \\"Gotta Serve Somebody\\", and \\"Jokerman\\".

The songs included on this album are, individually, excellent samples of a marvelous songwriter and poet. However, as a collection this album doesn't really work. The avid Dylan fan already owns all of the songs in this collection in a much more natural state (i.e. the original albums on which they were included). For someone attempting to discover the art of Dylan, I would recommend his 1965 album \\"Bringing It All Back Home.\\" That album is a perfect blend of where Dylan had been early in his career and where he was going. I cannot put any kind of musical labels on Dylan's work (like folk or folk-rock), as I feel he has defied the barriers of labels throughout his massive career.

As Th'Legendary Shack Shackers progress in their anthology they just get more and more insane. This album is much more produced than the last three and has slightly less blues influence but has a very unique sound to it. It's one of those albums that can't be compared to any others. It's most similar to the last album \\"Believe\\" but stands on it's own as being unique. No single song on this album sounds the same as the other and all must be experienced. Guest Reverend Horton Heat on tracks 1,2 & 11.

Called weird by every body in town except a new girl Martha Glimmer, the two boys Trout and Eel decide to run away taking Martha with them. To make an already short story shorter and easier to type the boys (and Martha) don't get very far before this wierd kind of flash flood happens. So Trout and Eel have to help the people who tormented them and the whole town is gratefull and so on. This book didn't have any action in it and was very boring. I feel like it ended too soon....

But when rain starts flooding the town, will they turn back to save their friends or will they continue towards their dreams?Indigo may be short, but don't judge a book by its cover or length!

After Martha's mother died, she ran away to Ocean City with Trout and Eli. Then Martha broke her arm and had to go home. This is a adventurous, exciting, magical, mysterious and sad book.

There wasn't really a point to this book, and the first chapter was almost all complaints, and it went a little too quickly.

Those that do not include politics in their being a skin. This book is an example of why i get sh-- for wearing what i wear, and looking the way i do. It's again the media at work trying to convince people that all skins are racist or anti-racist and that they are all violent alcoholic thugs. How can someone who isn't even a skin write a book on skinheads? It's great for all you brainless media -loving people out there.

Jardine convincingly argues that the astounding rebirth in the arts and in knowledge in general during the Renaissance was in god measure a byproduct of renewed trade, a commercial revival, and the lust for wealth and social recognition. Also very interesting is the demonstration that the artist as a solitary, bohemian genius who faces the world by expressing in his work his internal emotions, dates back only to the Romantic period. Before the late XVIII century, artists were basically employees or entrepreneurs eager to put their talents (oten as sublime as those of Michelangelo or Raffaello) at the service of the highest bidder or patron. It is a valuable book if only for the seldom-made link between the \\"new rich\\" and the progress of knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur History Parading as Wish Fulfillment","review":"For an astute & royal trashing of this crassly enthusiastic & unknowing tripe see the first chapter/essay in the masterful Ingrid Rowland's From Heaven to Arcadia: The Sacred & the Profane in Renaissance.The very popularity (& initial promotional machinery) of Jardine's \\"argument\\" is telling enough: a self-serving & wholly wishful justification for modern consumerism.All too vulgar in the classic sense of the word."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long and dull read","review":"This book makes up for a lack of a coherent narrative with endless quotes. Jardine discusses the many ways in which the trade in worldly goods - spices, books, works of art, jewels, and other riches - expanded during the Renaissance. But it is an incoherent tale, where the overall narrative is lost in the desire to delve into the minutiae. Explanations are few and far between, what abounds instead are endless shopping list by medieval princes. How they lived and what the motivations were of these characters is not discussed. One is left with a profound sense of boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO GOOD","review":"this item does not work and was a waste of my money.

Also, TINY--think two espresso shots (or an Italian espresso cup), maybe. If you've got large or thick fingers, you have no chance using the delicate little handles. I had a play tea-set when I was a child that was about this size. Luckily, my mother and I are tiny people, so this is okay if we just want to sip--my brothers and step-father's hands swamp the cup.But, they're very cute.

There are some sexy moments mixed with some humor but that is what you would expect from this type of film. The girls look a little old for high school but that's ok. They are still hot. Most actresses usually are older in movies like these. I like the 70's style of pretty much doing and saying what they want. They don't even come close to political correctness in this movie; \\"thank goodness\\". I won't go into the plot too much except to say that it is your usual high school boy trying to get laid bit.

I watched it once, laughed hysterically when Anna Nicole started screaming about making babies or something, but barely chuckled through the rest of it.

True psychoanalysis is still around, but psychoanalysis is not psychodynamic therapy.the only thing i liked about this book is the fact that it supports pharmacotherapy. however, pharmacotherapy and talk therapy of some variety is really the way to go. if you are considering therapy, don't look to this book for help--find a book with a more balanced approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"I bought these for my 1 year old and for my 3 1/2 year old.

The Prize, a new baseball stadium open for everyone to enjoy the game. Headed by schneider's character, the team actually becomes a fairly decent baseball team. With some troubles thrown in along the way, we follow this groups rise to the top, as well as their change inside as well. Not overdone with jokes, and not a total bunch of SNL cameos, this movie is 90 minutes that can be enjoyed by almost anyone, although I might not show it to the youngest of kids, I would feel ok if a 10 year old can view it (some of the humor at time may be to much for younger kids).

The first joke was one kid farting practically on the face of another and of course they had to continue to top that one in word and deed.

About 75% of the book is devoted to text and photos of twin-engined bombers AFTER they have been retired from active service, i.e., as restored \\"warbirds\\". There is a useful (but short) review of each plane during its service in WWII, followed by how some were saved and restored, with some breathtaking color photos of the restoration, most in flight.Although this was not what I was expecting (a straight history of these bombers in the war), I still enjoyed reading the book and learned quite a bit from it. The text is well-written and the photos, as noted, were strking.Perhaps the most interesting part of the book were the descriptions and photos of a recreation of Doolittle's 1942 Tokyo raid, this time in the 1990's using two restored B-25's flying off the carrier Ranger.

Not only does English-Lueck rely on hundreds of undergrads for her research in Silicon Valley, This book never goes into depth in any topic that is mentioned, and midway in the book the author states that the stories are made up from compiled data, thus the people in it are not real. The book never gets into the swing and compels people to want to continue to read.

The laser was accurate and didn't require any adjustment. I will have to change the batteries in case the shipped one's are duds. But out of the box the laser line is so weak I can't see it outside on an overcast day in the shade. In the garage it seems bright enough to be useful. I don't have experience with other lasers so I'm not sure if the outdoor use is even realistic but I base my 2 stars on that because that is where I use the saw the most and hence for me it is practically useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"A good idea that doesn't work very well. The reason for such a device is to acurately mark the cut line. This product doesn't do that at all. Due to its design, the line it marks is inherently offset from the edge of the blade. There is no adjustment and I don't really see how an adjustment could be made. Even if the alignment were good, you still have the issue of adjusting your cut while the blade is spinning since a centrifugal switch turns the laser on. The unit did fit my DeWalt without problem, but the mounting hole was much bigger than required and I don't have much confidence that the unit was centered on the arbor which could affect balance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit DW716 Miter Saw","review":"Seemed like a great idea.

Unfortunetly I cannot use it on my miter saw. The blade shield movement mechanism rubs on the surface of the guide. I really like the way it came packaged in its own little pouch. There are three different bolts to use in case your saw mounting hole is to deep after intalling the guide. I mounted it next to the blade, as per the instuctions, without a problem but when I reinstalled the plastic blade shield there was too much interference for the blade shield to move when the saw was moved down. The guide is a nice high quality item, I only wish I could use it. Oh well, back to the drawing board. For your info, the saw is a Harbor Freight 91995 10 inch miter saw. I know, it is not an expensive unit, but it does the job for me and I don't do a lot of sawing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal.","review":"I was worried about the reviews that said it cuts to the right of the laser. The left edge of the saw blade cuts right up to the edge of the laser. It only took a couple of cuts to get used to this and now I love it. I did crown moulding in 5 rooms, which would have been very difficult without a laser on the saw. This laser is well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor QC","review":"This is the second Irwin guide I have purchased and the basic design is pretty good.

Outfitted with this Irwin laser line, my Hitachi C10FSB is now everything I wanted it to be! I am extremely pleased with this product. Th cut is right to the right of the laser line with the blade that I use--no gap whatsoever!!! Pretty neat how this product activates with centrifugal force--I think a set of batteries will last about a year with the occasional project that I use it for. It also comes with a nice carrying case that includes some bolts (I reused my Hitachi bolt) and that I keep my factory washer in so I don't loose it.Bottom line: this product is worth every penny. I was willing to spend up to $75 to get a product like this. Glad Amazon had it for $30 shipped!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Laser Device","review":"It works great as designed. Just wish a laser could be developed that would project a line on both sides of the blade. This one works great when cutting pieces on the right side of a mark.

Would the luck continue?Nope. The stepped recess [there are three of different diameters] on the backside is not deep enough [by ~ 0.030\\"] to allow the bolt to pull it up tight against the blade ... it bottoms out on the inner arbor sleeve ... so the blade isn't sandwiched with any friction [which drives the blade]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit properly","review":"This little gem, though it is an interesting idea, does not work for my DeWalt 12\\" compound miter saw. It seems to cause the blade to be wobbly or mis-aligned. With the extra thickness of the laser there is no room for the washer that holds the blade on. It comes in a really nice little zippered case though.

Laser is very bright and wide as compared to the one that came on my Makita LS1016L. As other reviews have mentioned, the laser cannot be adjusted. However, within the instruction manual there is a section titled \\"alignment\\". First step is to align the laser with your mark. Then make cuts on various types and thicknesses of wood and see how the two \\"align\\". It is assumed that repeating this process over and over \\"will teach you the correct position for aligning the laser line with your mark\\". In other words, your suppose to remember the difference between your mark and the laser and adjust accordingly. In my case, the difference was close to 1/16 inch. It's a process that exemplifies the saying \\"practice makes perfect\\".

Then, 40 miles away from my home base, it failed me!! Problem is that the laser washer isn't thick enough (or, if you will, the shaft recess in the washer is too shallow), so it doesn't squeeze the blade tightly enough. After just a little wear due to slippage, the blade would stall in the wood even though the saw motor was still spinning.It's a great idea. Wish I could find one designed for my DeWalt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great! Add a shim.","review":"Easy to install. I just used the existing saw blade bolt, it was plenty long.The laser light ran *inside* along the saw cut, about half way.I wanted it to run along the left edge of the saw cut.So I added a shim in between the blade and the laser light disc.The shim was about the thickness of milk jug plastic.Works great!If I have a fine mark on the board to be cut, the right edge of the light runs right on the mark.In fine woodworking, you are usually leaving the line, taking half of it or taking the line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk.","review":"It worked for about a45 days and died.

The only complaint I've had with the saw over the years is the lack of a laser guide. I NO LONGER HAVE THAT PROBLEM!!The Irwin 3061001 Miter Saw Laser Guide is the best money I have spent for my shop in several years. As soon as the laser arrived I had to immediately install it.It took about 5 minutes from start to cutting wood. The Irwin Laser Guide fits exactly on the squared off end of the blade arbor in place of the OEM blade washer and you can use the factory bolt.The laser produces a nice crisp line that can easily be seen in my shop with 4 48\\" flourescent tubes above the saw and the laser line is right on the left side of the blade kerf.If anyone is hesitating in buying this laser guide, hesitate no longer.This guide is an excellent product.

Mine must be one of the newer generation. The laser cuts on great and mine was very bright and clean once the blade guard started to retract. The problem is that it is off by about 1/16\\" and apparently has not method for adjustment.

The Makita has a small protusion on the inside of the blade guard that scrapes the outside label of the laser guide, just enough to make the blade and laser line wobble and go out of focus.

My high regard for Joe changed when I saw him in concert on the Ladies Night Out tour. He was in fact the weakest performance of the show and they had the nerve to save him for last as if he were the best.At any rate, this new CD only further cements the idea that it is a wrap for Mr. Joe. Of the 13 tracks there are only 3 decent songs which include \\"You dropped your dime\\", \\"Rid wit U\\" and the refurbished R.Kelly tune \\"More & More\\". Speaking of which, did Joe really think that he could just change the line from \\" All you gotta do is say please stay Robert\\" to \\"All you gotta do is say please stay Joe\\" and no one would notice?? I am so tired of the blatant style biting going on these days. Save your money folks or just go out and get the REAL R.

This movie is bad on so many levels I wouldn't know where to begin. Let's just say, it is not worth your time. Take the 110 minutes and read a book or watch a good movie. It isn't even good as a cheesy, goofy road trip movie. It's just plain bad....that's why you've never heard anything about it and why there are no reviews on the box.

Of course, they're both guys!Nitta's artwork takes some getting use to, so I recommend reading White Brand as the first taste (I think it's also recently licensed in the US). Other series include Night Cap (a drastically different story with the same characters as Haru), Last Waltz (sequel of Night Cap), 17 Guys, Casino Lily, My Changable Voice (\\"Boko no Koe\\"), and various others.I love almost all of Nitta's works (or at least the ones I've had access to) and highly recommend her to any yaoi lover!

What a ripoff!The reason, according to another one-star review, is that these particular cartridges contain only 5 ml of ink, compared to 42 ml in other cartridges. In other words, the cartridges for the 5440 are intentionally designed to run dry almost immediately.I don't plan on buying another HP printer in the future.

This printer has never been able to feed paper of any kind. Imagine having to run to the printer serveral times to clear paper jams during the course of a print job. Why have a networked printer when you have to put down your wireless laptop and run to the other side of the house whenever you print. It has never fed a single sheet of 4x6 paper. The documentation says alot about using HP paper to print 4x6 pictures. The network drivers are buggy and consume all available CPU until it freezes. Only solution is to turn off the power on computer. A search on the internet reveals that many others have same problem, HP knows about it, but does not release a fix.

Now, it jams everytime I print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great low cost printer..too expensive to supply","review":"As almost everyone else has said, this printer does a great quality print job whether printing text and graphics or printing photos. I am dismayed however at the extremely, repeat, extremely high cost per page. This is due to the tiny amount of ink in the cartridges and the very high cost of ink. Although Walgreens and others will refill these at about half the price of a new cartridge, it is still not a reasonable cost per page. I would not recommend any HP for this reason alone. They, and Epson both make great, low cost printers but what good is a well priced printer if you can't afford to supply it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No need to buy expensive cartridges","review":"Never buy replacement cartridges because the printer won't last that long. Mine quit before it ran out of ink. No more HP stuff for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I am very disappointed in this printer for two reasons. 1) After loading the software, I was unable to use Print Artist. It acted like the HP software planted a virus into the Print Artist software and it would get an exception error every time I tried to print. This problem has not been resolved and I am forced to buy new software. 2) They advertise the printer as a \\"Photo\\" printer, but fail to inform you that you can either use it as a paper color printer with one ink cartridge, or you can use it as a photo printer with a different cartridge. You can not use the same printer for both photos and for non-photos, without removing a non-reusable $30 ink cartridge and inserting a different $30 non-reusable ink cartridge. This is very disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete piece of junk","review":"Unpacked it, fired it up, and started printing. No problems at all...until after I had printed a few pages. Then the black ink stopped printing. I tried EVERYTHING to get it flowing again. There was plenty of ink in the cartridge; it just wouldn't print black anymore. I could chalk this up to a freak incident, but in fact the only reason I got this printer in the first place was to replace my previous HP printer, which had precisely the same problem.

I am not averse to ordering cheaper versions of popular styles, but in this case I was very clear that I wanted to order the Minnetonka brand. Although the shoes arrived on time and as ordered, the sole separated from the leather within one week of regular wear. When I looked at it, I realized the \\"stitching\\" between the sole and shoe body was ornamental and the sole was actually glued on. Although I reglued it and continued to wear them, they started to scuff immediately and, when I tried to clean them, found that they were not shining up like real leather, but peeling like leather blend. This was a terrible disappointment to me and I'll be looking for a new brand of shoe. Why pay more to get poor quality?

They would never fit a medium width foot as they barely fit my narrow foot. I requested a 10 as maybe this would help.This seller return policy is not user friendly to say the least. The most troublesome is a 20.00 restocking fee. Policy states that shoes must be returned exactly as shipped. No problem EXCEPT moccasins had a handmade narrow band of white tissue paper around them which must be removed to try on and could never be replaced as it is. The company will not do an exchange.

This could have been a Hardy Boys mystery. I'm not saying the story itself is bad, I was just terribly disappointed that it was such a generic mystery story and could have been plopped in any series with some character name changes. The only thing special I remember Clark doing was using some X-ray vision a couple of times and bringing Chloe a cup of coffee at superspeed. \\"City\\" is a much better read, it is much more Smallville than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good Samaritan was a Warrior, Not a Nice Guy","review":"One of the things the authors talk about in this really useful book is taking the time to examine your core beliefs. This is an essential pre-req to what they call \\"warrior practice.\\" Makes sense, it is a lot easier to fight for something you believe in.In the parable of the Good Samaritan, the GS risks a lot, not only in helping the half-dead stranger in the ditch, but he deliberately does NOT do it anonymously.It takes guts to write a book like this. It takes guts to read it, examine yourself, and start making a change.To all of you nice guys (and gals)- read the book. Practice. Band together.Remember the motto of a famous English warrior band: \\"Honi soit qui mal y pense.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I cried the whole way through - but felt great by the end","review":"This was a great, albeit difficult, book to read. When I got through the first chapter I honestly felt like the authors had secretly researched me and wrote a book about it. When I first glanced at the title the term \\"nice\\" doesn't really fit me in how I view nice people...but the ignoring-my-own-needs-to-aid-others-needs theory and being resentful because of it hit the nail on the head. I have grown up not really knowing who I was or what I was interested in, having no sense of self or any ideals, solely because I needed people to like me.

The book is full of insults and frankly,lies! I actually wonder if Mr.Pariser has visited the island. He put down everything,(even \\"the poor food\\")and made it seem like we are a miseducated, inferior people. His comments on how women are treated was so far from the truth it was almost hilarious. I have lived on this island all my life (in Mayaguez), and have yet to see a naked little boy running around, I am a devout Catholic and as many times as I have attended Mass, I NEVER witnessed any sort of \\"african ritual\\" during it. This book is the biggest waste of money ever, it would be better spent sending Mr. Pariser to Puerto Rico, so he could go, learn, and get to know its people, its beauty and everything that makes it \\"La Isla Boriquen\\". I gave it one star because zero stars was not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book has no heart!","review":"Having visited Puerto Rico many times over the last several years to stay with a family member, I am interested in what guidebooks are saying about this beautiful island. Pariser has given us a comprehensive list of facts and figures about almost every area of Puerto Rico which is informative. But there are a lot of negative comments, an apparent prejudice about the island and its people, and he has completely ignored some intriguing aspects of Puerto Rico, like the fact that hundreds of humpback whales come to Rincon each year to mate and to bear their young. I found it dry, stilted, and very frustrating. Not an adventure guide at all! He could have sold a simple list of cities, hotels, restaurants, festivals and done the same thing.

The running time is just over an hour, which is compensated for by the superior studio sound, and the compilation includes several numbers which did not not make the final cut.

I shifted to three different holes because the metal reinforcers fall out. Today Jack actually got loose completely while he was outback drying off from a bath. The hole tore down the collar about two inches, allowing him to slip out. A neighbor brought him back to us, but naturally the concern remains.

Wealth without a Job is one of the most financially beneficial books I have read in a long time. It takes your psychology and puts it in a money building mindset. The way I look at things now is more from a perspective of financial prosperity and gain instead of worrying about paying the bills or just catching up. In fact since reading this book my business has picked up tons of steam and I have been on a roll ever since. I would just like to thank Andy and Phil for writing this book. This should have come out years ago. Who knows where I would be now if I had it sooner."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Okay Book But Not A Great One","review":"As a previous reviewer pointed out this is not a how to book but one that deals with changing one's attitude from being an employee to an entrepenur. While that's great for those who need it, this book doesn't really offer anything new to anyone who is already inclined to start an entrepenurial venture. I would reccomend any of Robert Kiyosaki's books for those who want to go into business for themselves.

I am happy to see that the description says a \\"case\\" is one cake. It said it was 12 cakes when I purchased it. At the time they graciously refunded my shipping but I still paid for quite pricey suet when Home Depot sells it for about $1.29 per cake.In any case, this produce would NEVER sell for $19.00 per \\"cake\\" hence an 87% discount is completely misleading and I hope no other buys make the mistake I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"An informative loook at the Chinese in North America","review":"\\"The Chinese,\\" by Lorien Kite, is part of the \\"We Came to North America\\" series of books for young readers.

First part of the book explains the present day software development realities(like deadlines etc) and the pitfalls that take place due to these time sensitive expectations. Author moves onto explain the necessity for XP and what are the basic guidelines of XP.The author should be commened for covering where XP is impractical and should not be used. The book explains the life cycle of a XP project and different roles that are part of this radical process.XP is not suitable for many present day organizations(due to age old approaches that are already implanted in the system); but should be considered for time sensitive deliverables. This book will definitely give a headsup on how to approach XP.Small negative: The book takes too much time on what is wrong in other traditional approached to software development(for the size of the title:about 200 pages)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is about the Journey not the destination","review":"In his second edition Kent has defined Extreme Programming as a journey and not a destination. This new edition is a realization that all projects start out with some good and some bad mixed together. This new edition also has more for people in enterprise situations.Kent underscores his belief that a team's values are the most important criteria of a project. Extreme Programming is no longer a restrictive set of practices to be measured against. Kent encourages people to start with the set of practices he has seen work but then go even further by using the principles to create new practices for unique situations.In the end what Kent has written down is more uniform practices, greater stress on the values, and a set of principles that are equal in importance to the practices.

It also produces a lot of peper sp I don't generally use it at the table.The only downside is that the copper coating eventually tarnishes but only in spots as the varnish coating wears away.

But with Unwrapped, my friends, we are in front of the ultimate Gloria Estefan masterpice!Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"re-produced \\"Unwrapped\\"","review":"i've read lots of review, and figured out that everyone is talking about the DVD that comes together with the CD is actually not available in my place, it's and re-produced CD with 18 tracks. too bad. unlike the previous album, this album does not have any dance beat.you might want to leave it aside after you listen to it once, IF you've been expecting too much, but spend more time listen to it over and over again, it's another kind of Gloria. and you wont regret."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inside look at Gloira","review":"I think Gloria did a wonderful job in this cd and it show us the fans the inside of Gloria. Yes it different from her last cd but that is what makes her Gloria and that is why the fans love her. She can do all sorts of things and we either love it ot don't but this has to be her best of the best. She put her heart and soul into making this cd and it shouws. Thanks Gloira for another wonderful album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great CD - Should We Even Be Surprised??","review":"Gloria bangs out another 18 great songs, of different rhythms and sounds and feelings, but all very reminiscent of her earlier days. Not to say that this album sounds repetititve, but there's a certain sound that is thread throughout that gives you the feeling you've heard these songs before. It's truly an amazing effect that only someone who has been successfully recording music for over 20 years can do. I was quite anxious to hear this album because I had heard such great things about it, and I let myself slip into the \\"maybe it'll be another Mi Tierra\\" mindset. Note to self: There will only be ONE Mi Tierra. Don't expect another. But all in all, Gloria is herself on this album, always introspective, never pretentious. By now she's perfected the recipe for a great album. I only wish there were a few more songs in Spanish, as the ones included on this album do truly glow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Music","review":"I bought this CD yesterday and loved it. I highly recommend it to those who have enjoyed Estefan's career throughout the years. It is tastefully executed and a joy to hear. I came to amazon today searching for a Bilingual children's book (Drum, Chavi, Drum!/Toca, Chavi,Toca!)set in Miami's Little Havana Calle Ocho Festival (Gloria Estefan is mentioned in part of the plot). The book has exuberant,lively writing and colorful, cartoon-like illustrations. The story is powerful and fun wih lots of Conga drumming sounds. It is written by a Miami Cuban, Mayra L. Dole and illustrated by a Cuban, Tonel! I recommend Gloria Estefan's CD along with the gorgeous picturebook, Drum,Chavi,Drum!/Toca,Chavi,Toca! as gifts. Together, I promise you that they will bring a smile to adults and laughter into children's lives. (Adults will enjoy the book as well and children will also enjoy the CD)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gloria es mi idolo, pero...","review":"Ella tiene limitaciones en su voz, y las baladas lentas no son para ella. Las canciones de Wrapped y Te Amare (ambas tambien grabadas en espanol) son las mejores canciones de este album. Es posible que los que compramos el album lo hicimos por inercia y respeto al trabajo de Gloria. Espero que el proximo album sea mas bailable que este. Gloria va a ser siempre una mejor interprete de la musica bailable (lease Celia Cruz.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a Wonderful Album","review":"I have been waiting for this album for a long time. This is Gloria at her most personal yet. The album is filled with Latin grooves combined with the deepest, most prolific lyrics I have heard in a long time. Gloria truly created a masterpiece with this album. Every song is fantastic and they flow together beautifully. My favorite songs (though it's hard to pick) are \\"Te Amare,\\" \\"Into You\\" (with Stevie Wonder), \\"One Name\\" (with Chrissie Hynde), \\"Say Goodbye,\\" \\"Wish You,\\" and \\"Famous.\\" The first single \\"Wrapped\\" is probably the most radio friendly song, but it is not the best on the album. I highly recommend this one, not just for those who like Gloria Estefan, but for any lover of music who looks for an album that takes risks and has meaning to its songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshing, innovative and creative","review":"This cd hosts a mix of brilliant themes from the one and only Gloria Estefan. The Andean rhythms, pop ballads and more make this cd one that you cannot stop listening to. It's full of peace, quality and every track makes it! There are no tracks tht fill the cd. Even though it is in English, Gloria delivers a true piece of art. The whole unwrapped thing is really neat, the cover art is very new and interesting. Definentely worth buying again and again. Also comes with a documentary on her life on DVD! worth it all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lo siento pero es una porqueria....","review":"Realmente el disco es malisimo. Todas las canciones se parecen y parecen viejas. El disco es sumamente aburrido y monotono. Hasta la foto de la caratula es vieja ya que Gloria no se ve tan joven como en esa foto. El disco es casi tan decepcionante como sus discos anteriores excepto Mi tierra que es excelente."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny&wack","review":"I got so Spoiled by \\"Mi Tierra\\" that I was willing to overlook alot of Her watered down Pop Offerings over the years.but this Album is Super COrny on the Cheese&Her VOice is out of place here.another Phoned in work to Adult Radio.She could have had what J-Lo had&By Her own Rules if She didn't get trapped in dropping such sub-par material like this.I Prefer Her Latin Based Albums far more than Her Pop Attempts&this Album won't change the pattern.even the mighty Stevie Wonder can't sway this Album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am happy with this CD","review":"So far, I was only getting the Spanish albums by Gloria. I heard \\"Hoy\\" online and loved it. The four songs in Spanish made me get this CD. Honestly, I am really happy to have gotten it. It is great, mature and makes you want to listen to it more an more.In places, the lyrics are a little bit to crammed and sometimes to cheesy -- happiness doesn't pay I guess. The best art comes from despair. Look at Madonna!Anyway, besides this weak point, this album is wonderful and I urge everyone to get it. It's not a collectors item, it is worth more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nate the Great Stalks Stupidweed","review":"Of all of the Nate the Great books, this one is the worst. I could not get interested in this story because Nate was reduced to looking for a weed. Isn't there more interesting puzzles for him to solve and things to find than a weed?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mercy - no more mercy! Pleeze!","review":"Suzanne Brockmann is a fantastic writer, the story is good, the dialogue even better - except one thing - a seemingly continuous need to throw the word 'mercy' in every few pages. It gets very annoying - and sounds so very prissy, coming from a Navy Seal hero - I don't care if they do say it in the south! Otherwise, a great story, and a great ability to make predictable sex scenes very unpredictable. Recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"#2 in the Tall, Dark & Dangerous Series","review":"Wow, I didn't realize how good this book was until I read it the second time. This is as good as 'Prince Joe'. There are previous reviews that describe this book and characters very well. Suffice to say Blue is very tempting, Lucy is in my top 5 for favorite female lead, the love scenes sizzle and the mystery is very good. You also learn more about Joe and Blue's relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what the doctor ordered!","review":"Bought this for my 2-year old nephew. The case is fairly durable and closes nicely. No pieces too small that would pose a choking hazard (unless your child chews on things). Overall, very satisfied with the product. Not too many pieces to lose and perfect size for a first doctor kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun toy but falls apart","review":"My daughter was thrilled to receive this gift. She immediately went upstairs to fix her sick stuffed animals and her brothers.However,within 10 minutes of playing with this doctors kit the case top fell apart. The stethoscope does not fit my petite daughters ears and the heart monitor did not work. The head mirror does not fit on her head or even around her one year old baby brothers head. The blood pressure monitor does not stay together.We will be returning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter loves it!","review":"My daughter loves this toy! She walks around wanting to check everyone's cough, ears, etc. My only complaint is that the stethoscope is rather flimsy and has a few kinks in the main line already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly constructed doctor's kit","review":"My nephew really enjoyed this toy for the first 10 minutes until a piece came off of the stethescope. It's a good thing we noticed because my young niece could have swallowed it.I don't recommend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The doctor kit that needs to visit the doctor","review":"We purchased this for my daughter for Christmas 2006. The kit really is cute and she plays with it all the time. BUT... The doctor's bag that it comes with broke, one of the two plastic handles cracked off (so I had to reattach it with band aides, since it had a boo-boo). There also isn't enough room to fit all the pieces in at the same time. The blood pressure cuff had never stayed together, it was even apart when we opened the box on Christmas morning. The stethoscope doesn't fit, the ear piece part doesn't fit under her chin, so she has to wear it over her face. The stethoscope also makes sounds (heart beat and coughing) but the batteries only last about 2-3 days and I need to buy new ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch! Pinches toddler necks - leaves welts!!!!","review":"My daughter LOVES this kit. However...stethoscope can pinch necks VERY easily!!! My daughter got 3 welts on the first day before I could tell what was causing them. Very poor design in which hard plastic parts are designed to pull apart, create a gap, and then close - ON SKIN!!!I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE BUY THIS KIT FOR THIS REASON ALONE. There are many others out there that will not inflict pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Doctor Visits less Scary","review":"My little girl has to go to the doctor quite a bit. This little set makes her familiar with some of the things that will happen in the office and she even gives me and the family dog out check-ups!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I would do it again","review":"I bought this for my 2 year old daughter. I was a little disappointed because the blood pressure cuff is so hard for her to squeeze. She can't make it work on her own which is frustrating for her. Otherwise she seems to enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Good concept, but so poorly done I wish I had bought another one: the blood pressure cuff pieces will not stay together for more than a couple minutes. The pieces will not fit back in the box after the first time you take them out - no joke, you'll spend five minutes trying different ways to put them in before realizing if it takes that long for you, your kid certainly will not succeed. The lid of the box comes apart easily and won't stay put back together. The stethoscope doesn't really reach the ears.If this toy was durable and the box wasn't a throwaway, it would be a good one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doc Kit","review":"This was a cute set. My grandson had some medical test to go thru - so he love this set to use on the doctors.It came quickly after it was ordered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good set","review":"My twins just received this for their second birthday. So far, it's a huge hit! We are not having any problem fitting all the items into the bag. The blood pressure cuff doesn't stay together too well, but everything else is great. The boys have had great fun \\"fixing\\" both of their parents and themselves.It's a pretty basic set, but it seems great for their age and skill levels. If you have an \\"under 3\\" and are looking for a medical playset, I'd definitely recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the retail price!","review":"I was in shock when I recieved the Doctors Kit. I had purchased two sperate kits - this one for a younger child and the Fisher Price Kit for the older child. Not only was this Doctors Kit twice the price as the Fisher Price kit, the equipment was exactly the same except for a few noises the toys made. What a disappointment! It will be returned immediatly."},{"rating":"2","title":"2.5 Year old loves it but falling apart","review":"Purchased in part b/c reviews suggested it was the sturdiest of the bunch. Neighbor has the alternative blue case and accessories.My 2.5YO daughter loves this but cramming all the pieces into the case has finally broken the latch beyond repair. The toys are reasonably sturdy but the stethoscope doesn't fit ears well-she just wears it around her neck. (The other child's doctor kit actually transmits some amplified sounds but no electronic sound effects of coughing and thump-thump). The blood pressure unit doesn't go or stay on very well and falls apart. (But after quite a few tries re-assembling it has become part of the game).Double the price but not double the quality of the blue one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the imagination","review":"We bought this for our 2 1/2 year old son and he loves it. I looked at several doctor kits and this one seemed to be the most sturdy. The pieces themselves are very well constructed (except the pump from the blood pressure arm cuff is hard to keep connected). The only complaint I have is the plastic doctor's bag. You can not put all the toys in it. If you put them all in then it will not stay closed and it often breaks off (you just snap it back together). The container should have been made larger. Overall, I would recommend this product. It is great for imaginary play and a way to introduce your child to the doctor, especially if he is afraid to go to his regular checkups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruised & disappointed","review":"Although my 2 1/2 yr. old loves playing with her doctor kit, my husband & I have bruises from the reflex hammer - it is much too hard for a child to play with. The handles on the carrying case are always falling off and very difficult to put back on! The stethescope has started to tear because it has to be folded in order to fit in the case. The blood pressure cuff has to be taken apart in order to fit back in the case. It is impossible for a toddler to \\"clean up\\" as the case is just too small to replace all of the instruments adequately! I am very disappointed with the design of this kit."},{"rating":"2","title":"My nephew...the doctor","review":"My nephew is two years old and adores this Christmas present!

No it's not the greatest gift in the world, but he has a lot of fun playing with it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and realistic","review":"All items store in the kit. Everything is realistic. The children enjoyed how they could take blood pressure, check heart beat and give shots."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than Your Basic Doctor's Set","review":"When our little one got into Doc McStuffins, we immediately wanted to get her a doctor's set. This one was great for many reasons.1. It has it's own carrying case - all the items fit inside the hard-sided, hinge-topped bag.2. The stethoscope isn't too tight on little ears thanks to a hinged middle. As well, the stethoscope makes heartbeat, coughing, and a musical sound.3. Blood pressure cuff pumps and spins a dial4. little bandaid is perfect size for most doll babies and stuffed animals5. Syringe/shot doesn't split into two pieces (they stay connected) so you can't lose either piece.Only thing that would make this better is if it were more realistic looking (silver and such), but other than that - way better than most doc's sets."},{"rating":"1","title":"My daughter cut her finger when closing the kit","review":"The kit box is not designed to be closed easily.

Be aware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this toy win an award?","review":"It doesn't seem like it was tested with kids at all. The bag/box is too small for the toys. As a result the handles come off - and they are very difficult for an adult to put back on. The stethoscope is a weird shape. It is too short from the ears to the neck for even a toddler. The BP cuff comes apart, and again, cannot be put back together by a child. The \\"shot\\"/\\"medicine\\" was a hit, but otherwise this was a waste of money. I'm going to get the Fisher Price kit this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks easily & is not toddler-friendly","review":"This set was a big hit with my three-year-old, but as others mentioned, the quality is rather poor. I agree with the complaints about the case itself: it is not toddler friendly! We are teaching our kids to clean up after themselves, and they cannot get the items back in the case. The adults barely can! The tube broke off the stethoscope literally within minutes--and from simple ordinary use!--and it cannot be re-attached. So from the first, we were down one toy, and the cuff looks to be the same quality, so I don't expect it to last. Overall, I wish I'd chosen a different kit; it certainly wasn't worth the price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within seconds!!","review":"I ordered this toy doctor's kit and a second one of a different brand for my 20 month old twins. In less than 5 minutes the tube on the stethoscope AND the blood pressure cuff broke on this toy, rendering both of them useless. The tubing on the same toys in the other kit have held up just fine. Thank goodness I bought the other kit, but what a waste of money this was!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy","review":"Poor quality. Would spend A little more getting better set. The stethoscope is flimsy and never worked and the blood pressure cuff falls apart. It is really hard to fit all the pieces in the dr bag. Do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Totally agree with other reviewers. How did this win an award? The plastic doctor bag is way too tiny - I could barely get everything back into the kit to box it up. The blood pressure tubing was separated from the cuff when we opened the toy, and does not stay in place if you try to put it back together. The stethescope is short and wide and feels like it's choking you. Poor, poor design. This is going back and we're getting the Fisher Price one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoped for more","review":"After reading the reviews, I decided on the International Playthings Little Doctor Kit. I was disappointed, however, at how small it was (once the items are out of the kit, it's nearly impossible to get them all back in -- this thing is TINY). Moreover, the kit is hard plastic and the two \\"doors\\" that open at the top leave only a small space for putting things back in -- and my 3-year-old grandson had one of them broken off within a half-hour. I'd hoped for something more durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"doctor fun","review":"I got this for my Grand-daughter. She just turned 5 and was having surgery.

I was not too happy with it when I got it. The carrying case is much too small for all the pieces. There is no way a child would be able to put back all the pieces. I have a very hard time fitting them all in. The tube falls out of the blood pressure cuff much too easily and the doors have also snapped off a few times. I will be returning this kit and looking for another one with a bigger carrying case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"Hard to fit all the pieces back on the case.

Didn't want to spend too much money, but this is not worth the few dollars that it did cost. It is really hard to fit all the stuff in the bag and be able to close it. The stethoscope is a weird fit and won't really stay on. The pump for the blood pressure gauge keeps on coming off, won't stay on. Everything else seems fine so far, but the few main pcs are a big turn off for my boy to keep on playing with the set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"The lid on this toy does not close and the toys do not fit in the box. I would not recommend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"We received this as a gift for my 2 year old's birthday as I really wanted her to have a medical kit to play with. As others have said, the stethoscope will not stay in her ears because the ear buds are so large. And it doesn't sit under the chin well. The heavy electronic end part to the stethoscope got pulled off the rubber tube on Day 1 as it was being pulled out of the case.It is difficult to get all the pieces back in such that you can close the cheap handles to the case. And the reflex hammer looks nothing like any reflex hammer I've ever seen. The blood pressure cuff is cute but difficult for my 2 year old to work since the bulb is large and takes a fair amount of strong pressure to squeeze.I agree that the dentist-like mirror seems out of place. The shot makes a squeaky noise so isn't very realistic. I do like the bandaid.Overall, I do not like this kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"This product was very cheesy and cheap, I could have gotten something at the dollar store that would have been better.

Being a simple human brand, I would expect them to have a better bottle.Works fine as a cleaning solution, but the bottle sucks.1- The \\"straw\\" isn't long enough so you have a lot of left over solution when you near the end.2- Also because the straw isn't long enough, you can't actually spray downward onto the floor, where you actually Need to spray. You can only get a good spray when held horizontally and from a distance. so make sure you know how to aim, and calculate the curve correctly.3 - Also it leaks, a lot, if you accidentally tipped it over and its on its side.Since this item is for pet accidents, you would think they would design the bottle so you can actually spray the floor on the actual spot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky pee odor lingers","review":"We have an 8-month Terrier mix who left her pee mark on the carpet.

I was unable to remove vomit even though we used the product within 30 seconds of the accident happening (according to the label directions) and used a paper towel to get everything up before using the product.Resolve Foam Heavy Traffic that we purchased at Kroger for $3.00 less removed the vomit and all of the stains and the blotches.

So, I purchased the Other Good Cuz because of a review on this site of the Bad Cuz toy, which indicated this one might be better than the Bad Cuz because of the feet. No, she chewed the leg stump things off just as quickly. The legs are hollow and when they are gone there are two holes in the toy and it no longer squeaks and gives them a good start on destroying the ball. So this one lasted only about 15 minutes. The better choice for us is the Bad Cuz, and we simply cut the feet off before giving it to the dogs.

As much as they love the squeakers, I am always happier when they have dislodged the squeaker, so that they can play with the ball quietly--although they like it better while it squeaks.

I don't recommend this toy as it requires constant supervision. I'm not sure what it's good for since they can't chew on it and it's too heavy to play with like a ball. What a disappointment.

Much better info was to be had at College Board's website and in the Barron's series. The book is boring and unhelpful concerning types of tests, dates of tests, and strategies taking the tests. It seems like a rush job, and a waste of money. Better you save 20 bucks and buy 10 real SAT's and simply take the practice exams. In this book the advice is so general and so banal that you will sleep your way--something thre authors seemed to do--after the first five pages. Go somewhere else and and pwork your way through the problems. The self help section at stores is so filled with this type of garbage that I expoect to see a book soon called Self Help Writers in Need of Self Help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless and Wriiten Worse","review":"I found the book's smug calmness irritating.

I'll leave the jokes about saleeping where you worked to you guys, but the fact that TWO people were required to writes makes me thing that an army of college graduates wrote Hemingway.

The long winded generalizations make this book apparently palatable to everyone, but in essense, thanks top its lukewarm advice, banal hints, and skimpy overview of test and its history, make the book come off as no help to anyone at anytime. A chapter on minorities taking the sest and racial bias, a chapterr on genderr issues, a chapter on reading strategies for the individual passages of Critical Reading, would make this book at least worthwhile opening, if not actually buying. Study vocab, take some sample tests, and buy a book on Geometry. And then, savor the opportunity to test your logic and relax.

The story possesses depth of content and character enough to pull at the soul and replenish the spirit.The poignance of the relationships and lives of the NCSSM students rings all too true - as do the adventures past curfew - risking a \\"level\\" offense if caught. Scaling the \\"stack\\" is still worthy of a unofficial NCSSM medal of pride and honor. Even the straightest laced, straightest A, early-check student will admit to hijinks committed in the name of NCSSM - I am no exception. =)For those concerned that the NCSSM backdrop is an impregnable barrier for non-Science&Math-ers; - you need not worry. You'll still enjoy this heartfelt novel, even if you haven't been to NCSSM, or don't even know what the acronym stands for.For a worthy read of a convincing human saga, I strongly recommend Morin's novel about hope, faith, and love.Andrea Kaelin,NCSSM c/o 2001\\"Uni-PRIDE!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"For someone that is currently at NCSSM, this was a really powerfull book for me and I think it would be for anyone else at the school. Aside from this, A Matter of Faith really ended up transcending NCSSM and became entirely about the people involved. I would say that NCSSM was more like a canvas for the story to be painted on. If you are a teenager, I think the book will make your examine your past relationships and rethink how you want to be in future ones. Brian Morin was able to create all these characters who you catch little glimces of yourself in and you wonder what you would do in their place and are brought back to when you were in similar prediciments. I recommend this book to everyone and can't wait for Morin's next book.Matt G.Class of '07"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review from an NCSSM Alum","review":"My father is a musician, and he has always told me that the most important thing one can do when producing art is be sincere.

Brendan has the stronger and more diverse tracks. On With The Show, Ramblin' Boy's of Pleasure, and Disaster March are the best. his writing is kind of back to his old Broadways/Early Lawrence Arms style.

I originally got into them because I was really into the Broadways when they were still together and was interested in what Brendan was doing after they broke up. Their first album \\"A guided tour of Chicago\\" is one of the best punk rock albums ever, but it seemed to me that their later albums get a little less better. I saw them over the summer one night at home and they were incredible and then a few weeks later this album came out and it just didn't do it for me. There wasn't anything that stood out in my mind about the album. Some songs are really short and others are just really slow. It's a lackluster effort in my opinion, it just wasn't up to my Lawrence Arms standards.

Some of the chapters don't seem to fit too well (such as the Zak chapter). However, the book's argument--that evolutionary theory suggests different policy solutions to problems than standard social science theory--is nicely illustrated by other chapters. Chapters by Ellis and McGuire/Gruter and Blank all get one thinking that a knowledge of human nature might be very helpful in figuring out how we might address public problems.Thus, while it is regrettable that some chapters wander away from the book's theme, those chapters that address the central issues of the book (as outlined in the introductory essay) serve a valuable purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dealmaking for the 21st century","review":"Geis and Geis have produced an extraordinary product that will serve business leaders and deal makers well in both old economy and new economy companies.

They are great songs, but when given the rave club treatment, they come across as mediocre dance songs one would expect from Ace of Base. In some of the songs, all that is added is one consistant beat, nothing more. Other times, they are overlong and lousy remixes (like the bonus tracks of the \\"Atomic\\" CD that you never listen to).I am not a big fan of remixes, sometimes they work, but when they don't work, it can totally butcher a good song.

Not all of the songs have aged well in the last 10 years or so, but all of the songs are just damn interesting to listen to. What's better, this disc made Blondie's original, un-remixed works, interesting to listen to as well. I highly doubt I would have gotten into Blondie had this remix album not been created.

One of the cool things about Blondie is that their music was just as welcome on a rock radio station as it was in the dance clubs - not an easy tightrope for any artist to walk but one that Blondie pulled off rather well.

Whew! I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"I have read all the books this author has published and have enjoyed all of them. Harrison's books are a nice mixture of dark fantasy, fun, sexual tension and good plot. *note if you can get to a book signing the author is a very pleasent/fun person*I recommend all of Ms. Harrisons books"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Yes!!!!","review":"Well, now that we know what Trent is and we know how tough Rachel can truly be, we get more excited. Nick is being a jerk but thank you Kisten for stepping in. Ivy of course, is still going ballistic for Rachel's blood and I'm not sure that I like where that is leading. But if I thought that the first two books were excellent, I was right and wrong at the same time. I love the characters and I love how they continue to grow. It's wonderful to have something so refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"RACHEL MORGAN IS THE BEST!!","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It is in someways similar to the Anita Blake series but otherwise it is unique. I think Kim Harrison is a very good author. IN the book Rachel Morgan escapes from a demon and helps bring in a biodrug dealer. She also is having some fun with Kisten (otherwise known as Kist). Well I can't wait till the next book and the anthology called \\"Dates From Hell\\". Well either way you should enjoy the book...if you dare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming","review":"Hmmm, this book was very underwhelming for me. It seemed to drag on and on and the story and characters never grabbed me. This time around Rachel has love life problems, demon troubles, elf woes, pixie-man friction and the usual vampire struggles with her roommate/business partner Ivy who wants to be more than friends. She also has to face up to her deal with the demon Al that she made in the last book. And then there's the master vampire and other assorted issues she must deal with here. Honestly, there was so much going on that I found myself lost for much of it. My focusing problems weren't helping matters out either. I feel the same way about this book as I did the last. It needs humor (I keep reading reviews calling it \\"light, fun, funny, etc. but I'm not seeing it) and more emotional ties to get me to care about the characters. I don't know if I'll bother to continue with the series at this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lovely Supernatural book with a strong heroine","review":"I came across this book one day in the library, looking for a book to help erase the disappointment I felt after having read one of the later books in Laurell Hamilton's Anita Blake series. The title was the first thing to catch my interest, when I read the back of the book I figured it was worth a try. The library didn't have the earlier books in the series, but the book seemed to have a similar theme to the earlier Anita books so I checked it out, despite usually liking to read series in orders. I'm glad I did check it out; it was a wonderful story with a strong heroine and a supernatural flair. The characters were interesting and the mythos was unique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Good","review":"I enjoyed the first two books and was looking forward to enjoying this one too. The Rachel character has become too ditzy. The final straw for me was going on a date with Kisten! He's a scummie male but Rachel is so desperate to go out she would rather go out with a scummie male the a female who cares for her and protects her. What a slap in the face Joy. No matter how good, caring Joy is, she can never be as good as a sorry guy.No more of these stories for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just luv it!!!!!","review":"This was the first book that I picked up by Kim Harrison....I could not put it down. I really hate first person in a book but I quickly overlooked that after I started reading. All the characters in this book are great......Ivy, Jenks, (especially) Kistan, Trent etc... I just read the first book DWW and right this min ordering the second installment. I cannot wait till book 4 comes out and with it more bout Ivy and Trent. Read her books-----for they are so unexpected."},{"rating":"2","title":"This series just gets better.","review":"I described Dead Witch Walking as \\"a good start to a new series in the Hamilton, Harris mould\\". Fortunately the promise of the first volume has been more than delivered. The characters are all developing nicely, the story thread about the elves is being gradually revealed and Rachel Mariana Morgan manages to stay alive despite the attempts of some extremely powerful enemies. Fortunately she does this through luck and wits rather than Anita Blakes continued acquisition of superpowers. She also manages to avoid bedding every eligible, or ineligible male in site. The end result is that Kim Harrison has quickly gone to the head of the class in this genre of fiction. Charlaine Harris will need to be careful and Laurell Hamilton will need to raise her game considerably if she isn't to be left behind. There's a new kid on the block, her name's Kim and she's taking no prisoners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best so far","review":"This book handled several plot lines simultaneously. Far better character development and a dash of romance. My wife usually reads the vampire books, but this is one series I really enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oustanding","review":"Even in a market full of supernatural, witty, authors, this author wins the prize for books that cannot be put down once begun, and that leaves you anxious for the arrival of the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampires Pixies and Witches","review":"This is the third book in the series and the character development was well done. There are a number of books in this series. It's a fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This series has me hooked","review":"A friend recommended the first book in this series to me, and since I started it I can't stop reading! The characters are brilliant and the story keeps growing more layered and intriguing. Start at the first book in the series, if you love it the story just gets better and better :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good series","review":"I am looking forward to the next installment of the series. I thought they were all a good read. I would LOVE to see more of Ceri, and think she will end up being a powerful ally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I enjoyed the first two of this series, and positively loved this one. Kim Harrison skillfully weaves in new, interesting characters, continuing to flesh out her alternative universe. I also love the length of these novels, and a heartily disagree with those who characterize parts of the novel as \\"slow.\\" I was pulled in from the beginning, and the plot never let me down. I can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"lacks a little","review":"Great book, just like the rest. But...you really need to read the previous ones to keep up. The concert plot was extraneous in the overall scheme of things, but OK. I read it on vacation and really loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive creative series!","review":"This series offers a new twist on a classic fantasy character. I stumbled on Kim Harrison's first novel in this series (Dead Witch Walking) and now I can't put her books down. She has a way of capturing her audience and sucking them into her fantasy world. I find myself wondering if witches, werewolves and vampires are actually real. Every Which Way But Dead is a definite must read if are looking for some light fun fantasy reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulls you in.","review":"I love it, this book from the first sentence sucks you right in. Next thing you know its 4 in the morning and you have to work soon but its sooooo good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story But the Myriad Typos are Aggravating (Book 4)","review":"I just started reading this series on Kindle. I really like the characters and the stories are quite entertaining but, sheesh, the typos are so distracting! Jenks is worried about his son Jenks, Walter's name occasionally appears as Water, characters are \\"accessing the damage\\" rather than assessing it, and there must be something new called a \\"mute point\\" rather than the more well-known moot point. And these are not isolated incidences. There are probably a hundred of them in this book alone. The first three books had crazy typos, too, but of the four volumes I've read so far, this one is the worst in terms of quality control. Publishers have a high profit margin on the Kindle versions of their books. How about spending a little of it on a proofreader?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading","review":"Rachel is up to her old tricks again. With her trusty sidekicks, this is sure to please any Harrison fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Wich Way But Dead by Kim Harrison","review":"This is such a fun series, Rachel Morgan is one sassy witch. I plan on reading the whole series. I am really enjoying taking time to myself, get a glass of ice tea and settle down with the book and get lost in the world of the Hollows. Thank you Kim Harrison!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but...","review":"Was a little slow to get going; seemed to waste pages on intercourse; very nice action when Ms. Harrison finally got back to the story. Fairly good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"trailer trash","review":"If you like woman that is abused but refuse to leave her abuser. then the main character of this book is for you. Rachael Morgan is a trailer trash witch, She is appalled here old boy friend is a thief, But is now sleeping with a mass murderer. After reading 3 of these books the only thing that would get me to read another is a promise of the death of the main character. It is a shame that the author has created a Cool \\"world\\" then peopled with trash-Uninteresting trash at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish with an original touch","review":"One star for the style of writing but that's all. Strange worlds have always been one of my favourite topics. This book does not contribute anything new or special to the rich tradition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Montana PBS Production","review":"This film covers the entire history of the bison in North America. It examines the bison from a scientific, social, and economic perspective. There is discussion of native American aspects of the bison today as well as issues with the ranching industry. Interviews with numerous people directly involved in bison issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've Seen So Far.","review":"I would not have written this review if I didn't see the review by j.guy@soandso (The cute penguin) but after reading this book and thinking it was great I went back to the book and looked up his complaints. By golly he was right! But unfortunately he missed one important point that even the 5 star reviewers did. This book is not the first Linux book you should read! Sobell's book went as smooth as silk for me, but that was after reading both the Red Hat 6.0 manuals front to back and then Linux for Dummies (ok hold on, it only took me 2.5 hours to read so stop laughing). So this book is truely a 5 star book, but probably won't be alot of help to you until you've read about and experimented with some really basic features of the OS. This book should be on your bookshelf and after I read a couple other ones (this level and up) I may come back and review it again just to make sure I'm 100% right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Unorganized","review":"Although \\"A Practical Guide to Linux\\" is comprehensive,it isn't focused or organized.I can't use it as a reference for that reason-it's too much of a bother to gather all the bits and pieces of information scattered about the book.I instead reach for O'Reilly's \\"Running Linux\\",which i would recommend you do also."},{"rating":"2","title":"What more can I ask for?","review":"When I buy a book I want the Best one out there... By golly, I think I got it!What is the most valued part of a book? The ability to refer back to it when you get stuck! This book is perfect for that.Mark does an excellent job showing people how to navigate their new Linux system. After going through the chapters there is a Part II which covers all those handy commands (syntax, and examples).If there was one thing to be more complete, I would have to say the networking section. ISP hookup? What is that? This book doesn't hit the howto hookup to your ISP at all.Out of ten I'd give this book a nine. But out of five, a five. Great Book! Well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A first Reference for Linux","review":"Great work from Mark Sobell... this man is really good! . I'm constantly returning to this book as a reference. It's more recommended for newbies , as it goes through all unix world (concepts,basic commands,shells,etc..) but after you get experienced you'll use it as good reference for some doubts. the main commands are all there with all those -xxxxxx options indeed. I also agree with one of the reviews that said that it needs some new review as it was written is 1997, but it's still a very good value book. Every admin should have one in the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Justice Fails","review":"Excellent movie featuring Marlee Matin. She is a fabulous actress. I think folks not familiar with the deaf culture might learn and have a better appreciation for the deaf community."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close but no cigar","review":"Another in the long line of Fahey B movies. BUT...this one was slightly better than the others.It would have been better if I hadn't known Marlee Matlin's character was ...oops,...almost gave the story away there! Anyway, I caught the giveaway at the very beginning, not subtle enough.Jeff Fahey simply cannot \\"do\\" love, sentimentality, grief, sorrow, any of the emotions that do not involve lots of noise and stunts. He is good at what he does, just limited. What would the PC phrase for that be? Emotively Challenged?This one had a better plot line, was more organized, has some surprises for the unsuspecting. One of the better Fahey Films that I have seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as it could have been, but still worth watching.","review":"It is a pity, that the scriptwriting on this movie did not match the acting. The plot ( a Basic Instinct lookalike )is in itself very interesting, but it becomes too complex, leaving unnecessary loose ends. If the makers had given the movie another ten minutes they might have had a beter product. Even so, it is a suspenseful thriller that will keep the attention right to the end. Marlle Matlin as the traumatised attorney and Jeff Fahey as the policeman who falls for her are good in their roles, portraying a genuine fondness for each other. This makes the movie in my opinion better than Basic Instinct were the affection between the leads seemed rather shallow and purely sexual. Fahey and Matlin show far deeper feelings which gives When Justice Fails an emotionel depth which most thrillers lack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off strongly but declines into unbelievability","review":"The film starts off strongly with intriguing by-play between two police detective partners. But then they're given a homicide to investigate and things decline from there. The main suspect comes to be a brilliant young female prosecutor, who just happens to be deaf and dumb. The plot unfolds just too fancifully and unbelievably. The characters become ever more cardboardy. A shame, since in the early scenes the film did show promise of being interestingly edgy and taut."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was alright! not great","review":"well i did,t like this one that much it was way to corny and predictable but i still love marlee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This movie was terrible. The characters were all one-dimensional, not to mention stereo-typed. The acting was horrible: everything was overdone - the quality reminded me of a middle-school play. The plot was entirely predictable and uninteresting. Watching this movie made me feel as if I were in the \\"Twilight Zone\\" of bad movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled...","review":"What you're not being told here is that these are all re-recordings of a great collection of music that lose quite a bit in the update.

Don't waste your dough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Bad Kareoke Versions of the Originals","review":"Who knows what happened here on this album?

Don't buy this unless you enjoy being disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was duped!","review":"I was duped into thinking I was buying a great compilation CD, but it ended up being full of craptacular re-recordings of some of my favorite songs. AVOID this at all costs if you're looking for the original songs!

The possible solutions to our major and burning social problems depend on our capacity to create and sustain these court rooms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply incredible!!!","review":"I read this book about a few months ago and I must say I am quite impressed with Michael Collins Piper. He was so incredibly detailed with his information connecting the dots between the CIA, Mossad, French mercenaries, and the mob. This is simply just profound. Interesting that others saw it as anti-Semitic. I did not. I think Michael Collins Piper is only attemping to throw information out there regardless if it is popular or not. I did not sense any hate, spite, resentment, or prejudice in his analysis of the so-called facts. Regardless of its intrigue, we may never really know what happened that awful day. Highly recommended for anyone who does not believe Oswald killed JFK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blinded by Hate","review":"This book is an exercise in tedium. Boring and poorly written, this book was produced mainly for Piper's fellow anti-semites who will eat up every pseudo-revelation of Israel's perfidity. It comes as no surprise to learn that Piper is also a Holocaust denier. Blinded by hate, Piper sees a Jew in every woodpile. The main thing I learned from this book was that apparently it is now possible to prove that ANYBODY killed Kennedy. Just pick candidate and then throw around wild and spurious accusations, then Unfortunately Amazon doesn't allow ratings in the negative numbers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Judgment: The Missing Link In The JFK Assassination","review":"This author gives a compelling new look at the JKF assassination which deviates greatly from the popular belief of who was responsible for the assassination of JFK. Read for yourself who was really behind the tragic events of that day in Dallas, that cast a cloud over the world on that sunny November day and why the U.S. Government has gone to great lengths to protect the true murderers.This book will keep you on the edge of your seats and is one of the greatest political nonfiction books ever written."},{"rating":"2","title":"israel guilty","review":"Israel had the motive had the reason.kennedy would not kneel down to the zionist lobby.he was pro arab,and he was not rascist.which israel is founded on.this is why the jewish lobbyworks hard to supress this,m"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this TV","review":"I own the 50\\" Ambilight and it has turned out to be a fantastic TV.

It really adds a level of depth to movies that you have to see to believe. The picture quality is fantastic as well.I too was a victim of the recall. There was a problem with the shieling around the ambilight bulbs which had caused problems in a few TVs.

But, they were not able to find a new one so I was offered a refund.

One wonders why they bothered at all! Abbado approaches the piece with a highly neurotic touch, yet without reaching the dramatic heights of the likes of Hans Knappertsbusch, Furtwaengler and Jochum. Instead, it sounds incoherent and muddly. Go for Knappertsbusch if you want convincing drama.

Need I go on?This novel was entertaining, but Flashman and the Great Game is a much better book, without the silly premise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the Island Series...","review":"This book has a facinating premise, artful use of culture, entertaining plot, but like a Russian novel tends to get bogged down with the number of minor characters who tend to run together. I think that if the author had provides a cast of characters as well as a list of commonly used Indian/Pashtun phrases with their English translations, it would have been a better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible and Stilted","review":"Steve Stirling's Peshawar Lancers starts off with an interesting premise: that European civilization is nearly destroyed in 1878 when a disintegrating comet rains down on the northern hemisphere. Unfortunately that is where the innovative ideas end. Instead of seeing how the rest of the world develops in that power vacuum Stirling assumes that British simply relocated to India and gives us a rehash of the Flashman novels. Peshawar Lancers takes place about 150 years after The Fall (as he calls it) and there has been very little technological, sociological, or geopolitical change in that period. It seems that Stirling wanted to freeze history rather than explore the genuine alternative history that would arise in his scenario."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading his Island trilogy, I was disappointed by this effort.It seemed juvenile and simplistic. I reminded of the movies serials I watched as a child. The characters were two dimensional and uninteresting.I expect more from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard Stirling Fare","review":"Stirling puts together his usual entertaining story, unfortunately, also with his usual casual racism. His nostalgia for the old British empire is unsurprising, given his attitudes about the superiority of Europeans in general and the inferiority of Muslims in particular, and it screams out very loudly in this book.The main difference between this book and most of Stirling's imperial fantasies is that the main character isn't a violent bisexual/lesbian. If you like Stirling, hey, he's here in all his glory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Tedious...","review":"This was the first book I ever read that was written by SM Stirling. Now that I have read it, I wont buy any of his books again. The book was so long and dragged out to explain every minute detail that had absolutley no connection with the story at all. About half the book as explanation, and the plot was dry when it surfaced. Sace your money, don't by this horrid book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An intentional G.M. Fraser derivative?","review":"Certainly not up to the standard of Fraser's excellent Flashman series! I can't help but think it must be intentionally paying homage to its superior, and to other Northwest Frontier fiction and nonfiction. The \\"native\\" detail which impresses some reviewers could have been lifted straight from Fraser and from John Masters' autobiographical \\"Bugles and a Tiger\\". But where Stirling seems to be winking at us is in naming the Pathan who eventually accompanies the Anglo-Indian protagonist and his Sikh brother-in-arms: Ilderim Khan. As any Flashman fan knows, this is the name of Flashman's alter ego when in disguise as a Pathan. After encountering this character, it's rather hard to think the rest is anything but a bit silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Alternate History","review":"A good book in the recent trend in alternate history works.

Zen is not your normal literary detective. He frequently has no more idea what is going on than the reader, and that is his charm. In Cosi Fan Tutti, Dibdin manages to write an excellent mystery, be funny and describe the normally hidden side of Naples all in one. This is a wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Italian Sit-com, complete with murder but no laugh track","review":"Dibdin takes a holiday of sorts and writes a comic opera set in Naples (today we could call this a sit-com). You have to really pay attention with Dibdin, but never more so than with this installment in the A. Zen sagas. We find our hero indolent in this southern port town stalked by love, murder, video games and incest. Dibdin takes us on a merry chase and somehow manages to bring it all together in the final (long) chapter. New comers to the Zen mysteries should not start with this book (try the Dead Lagoon) but long time fans will be caught up by the third page. You should read the chapter title translations to get the jokes as they are played out. All in all, a real hoot that captures the atmosphere of Naples today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Mystery fans will be disappointed. Dibdin writes in an artsy rather than tensely suspenseful style, yielding self-consciously amusing ironies and operatic coincidences. For example, he blatantly repeats one gory scene verbatim. The frivolous confections and literary stylings quite canceled the mysteries for me. Throughout the author is clearly \\"playing with\\" his characters (and you) in three parallel, increasingly coincident, story lines. There is some amusing word play, but if you want that then Mozart's operatic version sounds better. Dibdin's characters are more interesting than the plot, but not much. I imagine committed PC people will really hate the stereotypes, and the impolitic disparagement of Naples (a stand-in for humanity). The conclusion is too much of a rush (but with wonderful inversions of character). This is quite an amusing book, but not the involving mystery I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this got good reviews.","review":"Maybe it's just Dibdin I hate. His style is arch and becomes boring after a few chapters, there is no attempt at realism, and his detective is unintelligent and unlikable. I had never read any Dibdin before, but the premise sounded like fun. It wasn't. The plot is stupid and simplistic and Dibdin doesn't prepare the ground for the double and triple revelations that would have made it worthwhile. If you haven't read Dibdin before and aren't a fan, don't waste your time and money"},{"rating":"1","title":"kindle riddled with typos and confusion!","review":"This is a review of the kindle edition. The novel itself is entertaining and well done. And surprisingly funny.My problem is with the the digital transfer. Rarely a page goes by without a typo, misspelling or just plain confusing conjunction of letters and symbols.This book is not offered for free. We are expected to pay for it and should be given a decent copy.

This was not ever presented as Oscar Worthy in any way shape or form. And it didn't lie. Knowing all we know now about her and her life, you really have to look at this in a different light. It's funny in places, dumb in places. Sort of like Anna herself was. It's worth what I paid for it; but then of course I bought it dirt cheap second hand.The plot isn't memorable. Don't think it was supposed to be. The outtakes are funny. She had good timing. And she knew how to play to the camera. The truth is, when she was on the screen, you have problems remembering anyone else is in the shot. If you like Anna, go for it. If she isn't your cup of tea, don't bother.

But it's Anna."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"hilariously awful you mean? i can't believe some of these reviews have 5 stars i bet you anything they didn't even watch it or they are the one's trying to sell it on amazon. this movie was dreadfully stupid and i feel sorry for her and daniel to be a part of it. rest in peace anna and daniel."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok if you are retarded","review":"This piece of garbage makes early John Waters films look like masterpieces.Towards the end Anna Nicole's character leaves the scene to go relief herselfwhile the other two \\"Meryl Streeps\\" contine talking.

He lies, steal, has--as mentioned--a highly active sex life--but also uses his former inmate \\"God squad\\" with no regard for the risk to their freedom or attempts to live a straight life. While it mentions counseling, wedding preparations etc.--and we even see him write a single sermon--the duties of his parish certainly don't keep him from playing detective the majority of the time. (While not all priests I know are holy, they are surely all BUSY.)Also, no one expects the details of a procedural in this kind of work, but surely his police girl friend (as opposed to his other girl friends)would no longer be on the force if she participated in a tenth this nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Golden Path To Successful Personal Soul Winning","review":"Great book.

I have learned that you should wait until they have all seasons ready before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Season is Great","review":"Although, season 2 of The Flying Nun was not as warm and a bit more slapstick-ish than season 1, it is still a treat to watch. The picture quality is excellent as well as the sound.I didn't become acquainted with this show until it went into syndication in 1970 because I was only in early grade school when it ended, then didn't hang around long after that. But I became reaquainted when USA aired the reruns in the mid 80's, then another cable channel did the same in the mid-90's. TVLand also aired it briefly and irregularly a couple years ago.But thankfully Sony had the inspiration to release The Flying Nun on DVD so a new generation can fall in love with the cute (albeit far-fetched)adventures of Sister Bertrille and the rest of the Convent San Tanco."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just Love the show","review":"The Flying Nun - The Complete Second SeasonI love thisone and the first season.

It's nice to see one or 2 episodes but i don't feel the need to watch more after another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Energetic and exciting, not at all mellow","review":"I purchased this album, largely based on my love of Soul Station. Roll Call is a very different animal. The tempo is energetic, and never lets up. Freddie Hubbard blows, and blows, and clearly dominates every track. In my opinion it would have been more correct of Blue Note to label this album a Freddie Hubbard album, rather than Hank Mobley (even though Hank was the leader).If you are expecting to hear much of Wynton Kelly, then forget it. He has a few short solos, but otherwise you would barely notice that he was even present. Art Blakey and Paul Chambers do a fine job of backing Freddie and Hank. The whole band play in a unified, tight-knit group, and it is clear that they \\"clicked\\".When you play this album, don't expect to sit back and relax. This is not an album to play late at night, to relax you after a hard day at the office. It is one that you should listen to in the morning to get your blood pumping for the day ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The More I Hear You","review":"Hank Mobley's \\"Roll Call\\" takes longer to appreciate than his all time classic \\"Soul Station\\". The more you hear this the better it sounds. Art Blakey is on fire and this is an added bonus here.

One need only spend a few minutes comparing the word processors of ten years ago to the remarkable office products of today to realise that what Cooper thinks of as embellishments are the basis for real progress.Too often someone tries to sell second best as an end in itself. In every case they are really cheating the public. Life in the U.S. is full of countless refinements. Occasionally, there are snafu's and frustrations. But without many of those improvements life would not be as rich or as diverse."},{"rating":"1","title":"He quoted Parkinson's law","review":"From the book: \\"Managers know that software development follows Parkinson's Law: Work will expand to fill the time alloted to it.\\" This is such an outdated idea and method for managers to deal with software engineers the rest of the book was tainted for me by his obvious distain for software engineers. Only the worst kind of un-trusting manager would assume that his engineers will naturally drag their feet if the schedule allows it.Another example of his contempt for programmers: \\"All of the analysis and careful thinking done by high-powered and high-priced executives is made moot by the unilateral cherry picking of a programmer following his own muse or defending his turf.\\"Sorry but the white button down shirt wearing, schedule dictating, programmer dis-trusting manager has no place in software development nor writing books telling me how to manage my software engineers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author is out of touch","review":"I'm sorry to report that Alan Cooper appears to be years out of touch with the software industry. He lobbies for a new 'interaction design' class of professionals working toward designing how the user sees the system - but the industry started doing these things a good 15-20 years ago. Also, he assertions that \\"in software, typically nothing is visible until it is done\\" is just plain wrong today; 20 years ago that was true but the software industry today uses storyboards, paper usability reviews, UI mockups, prototypes, etc all with the intent of designing a user friendly interface before the first line of code is written. He starts off with flawed assumptions and ignorance and goes downhill from there.For simple entertainment value and getting to vent frustration about bad systems I give the book 1 star, but if you're actually serious about understanding and improving software development, you're much better off reading any of a handful of books about \\"use case analysis\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blown out of proportion","review":"It's true that some products have poor interfaces, but in my experience this \\"problem\\" is blown way out of proportion with reality. The only people I know who couldn't figure out how to program their VCRs were people who did not try for more than 5 minutes. Read the instructions, both in the book and onscreen, and VCR programming is a snap, from the earliest models to today.I think the real question should be: Why are so many users so lazy? This is more of a social problem than a technological one. Some think that if any effort is required to learn how to use a new device then it's poorly designed. Poppycock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mealy-mouthed whining at its very best","review":"Alan Cooper begins the book by accurately defining the software and application development model that pervades industry today. This lucid and insightful analysis is worth the two stars this book earned. However, as the book progresses it never fulfills even a smidgen of the promise we are lured into believing will materialize for us, should we choose to read the entire treatise. A tight concise target is identified early in the book and then this gem of an idea unravels into a slurry of whimpering diatribes that provide no useful information whatsoever. This book is fraught with good intentions and chalk full of pure \\"crap\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bells and whistles come from marketing, not developers.","review":"\\"Inmates\\" makes some very good points. I disagree with laying the blame (or credit) for bells and whistles on developers, however. I work in a small but growing software firm, and the push to add extraneous features almost always comes from the sales and marketing folks. The developers who actually write the code would much rather keep squeezing the bugs out of features we already have, so they can point to \\"bulletproof\\" code they've written.Historically, marketing's drive for media attention and management's quest for investor dollars has overridden them, so that I have seen several poorly-thought-out features added to our products solely for the purpose of issuing a press release. We're beginning to change that now, making both our developers and our customers much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided","review":"Although the goal, usable software applications, is noble, Alan Cooper is misguided in placing the blame on the engineers.Feature creep is often caused by business and marketing professionals, as they think piling on more features will make it the product more desirable.Project plans and specifications are usually poorly planned, which leads directly to engineering problems. Perhaps the business/product management side of the story needs the work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurdities and Urban Myths ruin an otherwise valid point","review":"This author has lots of good points - unfortunately he attempts to illustrate his points with a series of ever more absurd examples and urban myths that he presents as facts.It has more in common with listening to a motivational speaker at a 3rd rate lecture than a well thought out book.He expands actual events into supporting arguments by completely ignoring the facts of the incident, and exaggerates some details completely out of proportion. How many people are unable to use a digital camera or a microwave as he claims?The concepts are good, but this book is in sore need of a real editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly a rant","review":"From the first page this book shows itself to be the product of a lot of anger and not much thought or fact. The example of the American Airlines crash is glib and incorrect - 'pilot error' has not been given as a reason for a crash in many years. Similar problems occur thoughout the book - developers are lying when they say that something is technically difficult, using a knob rather than buttons is the answer to everything, design without regard to cost is the only way to do it. There are some ideas there but anything by Donald Norman is better. Like Clifford Stoll in \\"High tech Heretic\\" the author mistakes opinion for fact, and generalises with abandon. Yes, products are often poorly designed but all products are designed within constraints and ignoring them does not negate them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum. Should be half this thick.","review":"I found I really had to force myself to finish reading this book. The core concepts are covered in the first half of the book, albeit in a rather drawn out fashion, and the rest is simply reiteration and self-congratulatory rambling about the author's own successes and consulting business, masquerading under a thin guise of case studies.If the essence of this book could be distilled down into a 50 pager you'd have a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better treatments exist elsewhere","review":"Cooper's book is old news. Check out Don Norman's Psychology of Everday Things for a more general, and more original treatment. The topic of user-centered design has been floating around in the area of human factors psychology for years, with many successful applications. Simply put, there isn't much new in this book.And the assertion that engineers lie at the root of the problem is naive. The true problem in devising usable systems that are also commercially viable and are delivered on time and within budget lies in a team approach, with users, developers, engineers, marketers, - ALL STAKEHOLDERS - involved in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to give a copy of this book to every programmer I know!","review":"I'm a marketer and I depend on programmers. I also currently have a client who is a programmer, and we have problems communicating. This book was very helpful in showing how programmers' brains work. More importantly, it shows where their contribution should ideally be, in the overall project timeline (hint: not at the beginning, where they are too often placed!).I bought this book because I was researching persona development, and there's a good chapter or two about that in there, but that part isn't very in-depth.

Buy this book...it lives up to the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs updating","review":"Written in 1999, I think this book is an example of how software used to be written. While Cooper's attitude in the book is annoying and frustrating, I found his views about software and it's process narrow minded. In the 1999s, when a software package was rather small, spending tons of time doing software documentation made sense. Nowadays, Cooper's methods no longer apply. If you want a book to use as a reference of how not to do current day software, buy this book, read it, and do everything opposite of what Cooper suggests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like reading a typical computer manual...","review":"The book starts out with some good examples of how putting computers into commonly used devices turns them into unusable devices (i.e. alarm clocks, VCRs, etc.) Unfortunately, his writing style is more like whining, and you just want to tell him if he's that annoyed with these products, just don't buy/use them! Get some common sense! As for the rest of the book, he may have had some valid ideas, but again, his writing style got in the way. It was like reading a computer manual - good reading if you want to get to sleep.

But I'm not going to tell you how.","review":"I found this book to be an excellent review of design problems but it left me asking HOW HOW HOW?

He would outline a problem very eloquently, but then not tell me exactly how to solve it. \\"We must design for the users!\\" Um... yeah. HOW?If you have no clue about the problems that Interaction Designers face, read this book. If you are already an Interaction Designer, don't bother. I really hope there's a sequel in the works entitled \\"The Interaction Designers are Running the Design Process: How To Solve Your Design Problems\\" with lots of concrete examples and positive, rather than negative, design rules.

If you can get past his self promotion, the book offers some helpful insights into process that I know I will be able to use in future designs.The biggest problem I see is that he doesn't offer any statistical evidence to back up anything he has done. His case studies represent interesting situations that look like there has been a drastic improvement in usability and usefulness. But how much of a change was it really? I'd like to know that compared to the original design, 45% of the users were able to complete the job faster, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reminder of the tech tunnel vision we get...","review":"Alan Cooper has some great points about how difficult high-tech products can be and particularly how they don't need to be that way. As a tech head, I see myself getting caught up in the mode of cooler and more challenging. Alan made the point about programmer's being just like elite mountain climbers tackling a new mountain. They do it for the sport. It isn't about making it easier. It is about tackling a HARD problem. I've chuckled to myself at work several times when I see this happening now.Another of my favorite points he makes is about how we never give our users instant satisfaction. They have to invest a great deal into using our products. This locks out so many people and is unnecessary most of the time.Now, just as a caution, I know many folks that will be offended by Alan's tone at times. Read this for its many great points; ignore what sometimes tends towards fanaticism -- he's just passionate about his topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake up call for those who deliver software","review":"An excellent read and very well written. Alan walks you eloquently through the issues that plague the industry and defines common sense practice for good interaction design. Valuable lessens seep from each page. Unfortunately, 6 years after the release the industry is still suffering from those with too much skin in the game and resist the light of change. The book is a wake up call for the industry to practice more K.I.S.S. development and adds clarity to the reason why Software companies are fueling their Tech Support bonfires with poor design implementation."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"The book has a fantastic title and that's where it stops. Alan Cooper takes an entire book to tell us that software needs to be designed - a shock from someone who created a language that allows programmers to avoid design altogether, Visual Basic. He spends half the book knocking software engineers and the other half plugging his own company. Sprinkled in between are a few good ideas, but by the time you get around the author's arrogant style you no longer enjoy the insights he may offer.It's a pity that a book with such a great title is wasted on uninteresting and repetitious dreariness. It really goes to show that you can't judge a book by its cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derogatory and mediorce","review":"As an engineer, I found this book to be a poor assessment of how engineers think and how products should be designed. While there are some nuggets of truth and good advice buried in the pages, the tone of the author constantly de-humanizes engineers and devalues well-founded understanding of technology.The small benefit in design advice presented in this book is not worth the painful experience of reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really annoying","review":"I can't add anything to the other reviews concerning the music itself, the other reviewers have said it better than I could ~ it's wonderful music, but the bird sounds are really annoying.

This product had the same issues - I doubt that kids or teachers or parents were consulted in designing this game. First, you cannot set the levels. For \\"awesome addition\\" it started asking 8+0 for level 1 and then asked 15+8 (still in level 1). Then, in next level it asks questions like 37+24 (a big jump!). You can't stay in level one, which is frustrating. Other games were similar.In the shape game, you are told to put \\"repeat the shapes in the right order\\" but not told that the order is determined by the first to arrive at the right of the screen (not top to bottom - which is what my daughter and I both assumed).

When one child is threatened and terrified, he says nothing to his parents and continues to sleep under the same roof as the psycho. Any child would talk rather than live with someone who puts a razor to his or her throat. There are other holes as well. It seems that wine sends people on an LSD trip in this movie. The director did not research adoption or child psychology to make this film. The movie is not believable.

It's so stupid that many people in the theater were laughing at it.Uh sure, if you want a movie with a \\"twist ending\\"; this has one. Only you have to endure the whole movie just to see the twist, which isn't that interesting.My b-i-l said he was going to give his friend a really hard time for recommending this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Orphan","review":"I was really looking forward to watching this film so was very disappointed when it would not play as it was the 'wrong region'!

This is a fun movie. I don't want to say too much that will spoil it for you. This movie is not perfect and I hate the movie character husband in it, what a D-bag. The husband gets what he gets,to get these emotions in me like this actor must be doing a good job. The acting of the Orphan who was played by a 10yr. old was amazing too. Get this movie, stay up late and make sure your kids are asleep. At the end of this movie you will want to ensure they are asleep, sound and safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Thriller!!!","review":"This movie had some pretty good scare scenes, and an awesome storyline about a couple named Kate and John Coleman who lose their 3rd child. They have a son named Daniel and a deaf daughter named Max. They decide to adopt a little girl named Esther. (Isabelle Fuhrman did an awesome job as Esther! She was cute and scary at the same time) Esther begins to do bad things like pushing a girl who teased her in class off a slide, having temper tantrums, drives Kate crazy, threatening to slice off Daniel's manhood, and even killing someone! What is wrong with Esther? I highly recommend that you adopt an ORPHAN!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just watch The Good Son","review":"This movie is pretty much just a remake of The Good Son with a lame M Night Shyamalan-ish twist at the end. Somebody falls through the ice? Check. A climactic treehouse fall? Check. Mother previously lost a child? Check. Drownings? Check. Animals murdered? Check.While the acting in this wasn't that bad, Macaulay Culkin did a much more believable job as an evil child that fools the parents. There was very little in this movie that actually made it worth sitting through the whole thing. The twist at the end was so weak that it actually offended me that the writers expected us to accept that as logical and possible. Who honestly finds people like Gary Coleman and Andy Milonakis frightening? Nobody, that's who."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"Acting is phenomenal in this thriller.

I THOUGHT IT WAS NEW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for love in all the wrong places","review":"Poor Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman at 12 years). All she wanted was a little love. Unfortunately, there are a few obstacles to remove first. This takes planning, finesses, and a little collusion.This defiantly is not \\"Dementia 13\\" but it is a want-a-be. The film is highly predictable as most of the blood is in the first scene. That is because it was supposed to be a psychological thriller yet turned out to be a cheap slasher. The movie may be in a hurry to end but you do not have time to ward the unaware schnooks that they are about to be dispatched by a household utensil or the odd tool. The only spooky or over the top violence was when a poor defenseless pigeon was dispatched with force.Only saw the Blu-ray but nothing really looked fake on the big screen TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"filmbuff","review":"This is a horrible film. It is slow and boring for the first 50 minutes. Then it began to show how a 9 year old child could brutally kill a nun! It continued with all destructive behavior, not just mildly destructive but to the extreme! Now we wonder how why our children have respect issues--- maybe it is because it is becoming socially acceptable. This movie had no content or reason to be made and is not worth the purchase price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't Expect to Like this as Much as I Did!","review":"This movie was not what I expected at all. I thought a mildly gory \\"bad seed\\" tale. Instead, I was fascinated with the story, the acting, especially by \\"the Orphan\\" aka Esther, \\"Max\\" and Vera (the actress). Some might have felt the pace was slow, and yes, there were plot holes, but the pace added to the suspense, the plot holes kept some mild amusement, and \\"Huh?\\" moments, but that just made the film as one reviewer indicated a worthy candidate as a cult classic. The attention to details to create a compelling personality in Esther is to be commended. I recommended it to two friends who watched it after I did and they loved it too. Both felt Isabelle deserved an Oscar nomination and that she is an actress to watch. A very impressive thriller and the ending, although was both suprised and yet not, was one of the best plot twists I've seen in ages. Well done filmaking and acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw this in theatre, love it!","review":"I got quite a deal on this newly released movie, at only $8.99. Thanks, Amazon!!

Happy to add it to our collection at home!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy and shocking, as it is supposed to be!","review":"Isabelle Fuhrman is such a great actress that you will enjoy watching her being a creepy and evil teen aged girl. I'm not a big fan of this kind of movies but with great actors like Fuhrman, I can easily be converted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie","review":"Usually, I do not like movies that contain a lot of violence, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I have had this movie since Christmas 2009 and I have watched it at least 6 times and I plan on watching it more. Isabelle Fuhrman did a fantastic job of playing Esther. This movie is creepy, but it's not what I consider scary. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that likes creepy movies, but doesn't want to end up being scared by them."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like this film","review":"This is a great movie with a good cast and that is well written and well acted. I wish I knew where to meet girls that have the same disorder as the orphan lol.She really is 100% bieleaviable both as an orphan and a methodical minipulative luinatic"},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG!","review":"I can't believe how tremendously funny this movie is! I went along with it for the first half hour or so, and then I realized the plot deals with a bunch of idiots, an a-hole husband bordering on gaydom, a brat son who seems to be around just to antagonize people, a wife who just can't seem to get it, a truly idiotic shrink who, in real life, would be thrown out of the practice -- so I really enjoyed everything from then on. I kept rooting for \\"the orphan\\", waiting for her to do away with the son first, then some of those rotten school kids. The husband got more and more gay with each scene, and went overboard in the climactic scenes. Speaking of climactic scenes -- whoa there, who thunk up that one? All in all, it's a terrific film if you want some real guffaws. Poor CCH Pounder, not only does she get messed up in the plot, but the fact that she even did the picture is sad. But, at least, the little deaf girl does some good work. The extra star is for her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Startling does not equal scary","review":"This is yet another in an endless parade of films made by people who seem to think that, if they startle the audience, then that counts as scaring them. There is nothing remotely suspenseful or terrifying in this film, except that you never quite know when an evil child, or a cat, or some other unseen entity, is going to pop up out of nowhere, with of course a deafening thud on the soundtrack and a jarring splat of music.If you consider that great horror movie making, then by all means, check this movie out."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"the video doesn't work, took it on vacation so we could have a movie night and put it in the player and nothing is there.

It's kind of 'same ol, same ol'....close to boring...I shut it off to finish at a later time..wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Skip It!","review":"Although it starts off interesting because you want to know why this child is so disturbed, by the end you've just wasted your time on this movie. It is truly an unbelievable ending that you say to yourself, I've lost all that time watching this thing and will never get it back. The ending or even alternative ending is bad. If the ending was rewritten with a more believable story, we've heard about Russian orphans being neglected, abused and seen unbelievable horrors in their country in real life stories and the fallout after they've been adopted here in the States, that this movie just leaves you in disbelief. Good acting in the beginning and you are on the edge of your seat to know the outcome, so the screenwriter didn't need to go in the direction he did to make this a watchable movie, but he did and the movie ends up being just plain bad. Don't waste your time on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sooo bad","review":"Normally a movie like this would make the audience question if the child really is evil or if the recovering alcoholic mom grieving her stillborn child is losing it, but not Orphan. No, the audience immediately finds out that Esther is absolutely evil. There are few surprises in this contrived plot. Most disappointing was the \\"chilling alternate ending.\\" There's no context for the scene, so while it might be \\"chilling\\" under some circumstances, there's no way to know what crimes Esther has committed before this ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most ridiculous movie I have ever seen!!!","review":"This movie is so stupid!

It's exciting, scary at times, and has a shocking ending! Best scary of 09 people! Add it to your collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"loved this film =)....","review":"i loved this film im sooooo glad that i rented it. it had twist and turns it had a good story line. what i liked about this film is that you didnt know what was going to happen next and when something scary happend you just jumped up out of your sit. and my fav part was when they started to fine out where she came from and when they fine out where she came from she wasnt really a orphan there. so if you wont a GOOD move to see and you dont know which one you wont YOU HAVE TO GET THE ORPHAN...best move EVER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great character study, good twists","review":"I enjoyed the book with its twists, subplots and good capture of human nature and character -- warts and all. I thought I knew how it would end, but there were enough plot twists to keep me guessing and provide suspense. The only major flaw was the lack of closure on some of the plot points.

The online version has been updated to include newer research reflected in current building codes.This handbook is a classic, don't get me wrong. It should be part of any wood designer's library.

But, in the end, it's no good. There is only one good scene where the Predator tricks everyone and the people realize they were just bait for bigger, better game... In the end the art is terrible,(it looks like it was drawn with only colored pencils) the story is boring, (it lags in waaay to many places), and it lacks the terror of other Predator comics. It is one of Dark Horses 3 issue limited series, not the usual 4 issues, and the story still moves along with the pace of a snail. Basically, it's only worth a. checking out from the library, b. buying it used, or c. just reading it in the Predator Omnibus volume 3, where you other Predator comics that are waaaay better worth the money. Not really reccomended, only for hard-core fans. 2 stars, or a grade C-.

I am sure that this album figures prominently in the collection of bluegrass fans all around the world. I have filed it in the \\"definitive\\" section my CD rack. An absolute favorite. I wish Tony could still sing it like he did on this one. (\\"John Wilkes Booth\\" is an exceptional piece of music.) Some of these cuts will break your heart.WARNING: This is one of those albums you don't really want to spring on your friends too quickly if you're trying to initiate them into bluegrass.

There is not a weak track on this disc, period, and the high points are as good as folk/blues/bluegrass can get. We were fortunate to be able to see three different live shows about the time this disc was released and I believe Tony hit a live performance peak at this time also.One of the highpoints of this disc is an outstanding cover of James Taylor's \\"Nothing Like a Hundred Miles\\". Tony now owns this tune. Sorry James, I love your stuff but how can you ever sing it again and call it your own after this masterpiece recording? Likewise, Mickey Newbury's \\"Why You Been Gone So Long\\" is so right on, how can it get any better? The playing and singing are so natural and unforced, it really is remarkable.

Her views on our relationship to Divinity and Nature are at once both elegant and electrifyingly groundbreaking; going far beyond the explanations and understanding of many authorities. Even though I do not study a Yoruban tradition, I found many analogies and parallels that have made my own personal studies much richer and my rituals (even as a solitary Wiccan) much more moving and fulfilling. This book is a gem to any Pagan study and is sure to become a modern classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I picked this up too late","review":"This is a classic piece of Simpsons heritage. The early 1990's ushered in a slew of t-shirts, books, games, and toys with our favorite TV family plastered all over. The problem is, nobody ever worried \\"is this a good representation of the show?\\". This book includes all kinds of cute stories, lists, and pictures from the point of view of Bart Simpson. I found a copy at a book sale, and it was fun, but the humor is very dated for the times and the show.

Time Warp, Paris morning and Will u' drive me being the most instantly appealing songs to me. For once an honest CD sleave: nothing pretentious here, just a load of simple, irrepressible songs sung in the tired self crowning style of 'power pop'. Which, unless meant as yet another irony, I suggest they lose and just accept what they are, and stop tying themselves to a catagorical flagpole, for the substantial reason. This CD really works. the time, the music, the band. A Breath of fresh air in a humid time for music.

It does get very difficult at times though.Reading early reviews about the spells not working, I found they work fine for me. They do not work until you read the slab that has a certain spell and instructions how to use it. Then you have to save your game. Is a good idea to save the game as much as you can.

In addition, certain words are listed throughout the book in those special \\"boxes\\" and they are entitled, \\"synonyms.\\" Then, 4-7 synonyms are given for that word. This may come in handy, as synonyms are an area of study that these students currently need to review.

Cutler and Taylor have made careers out of agenda driven reality shows. Left-wing agendas...

This was different when Cutler made his famous \\"The War Room\\" and the new war room movie.

But I can't say I don't like a lot of it. I will say though, that Tonex has a very radical style that takes some getting used to. As a young person myself I was somewhat taken aback by his tactics. But I can say that if nothing else his lyrics are clever (Even though I think he's pushing it in some cases like in \\"Nureu Ink.\\"). And they're God centered, which is always good. I tend to think he talks a little too much about haters and chastising the way people act and whatnot but songs like \\"Make Me Over\\" which are no doubt true praise and worship make up for it. I give the CD four stars because you can really get your praise on with a lot of these songs. And once you get past the eccentricity (the reason for the deduction of one star), it's a good CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can't give God the Glory.. then stay home and sing to the mirror","review":"What was this brotha thinking?

Surely glad i didn't pay big money to see this live recording.

Tonex must have went into his prayer closet a long time before recording this CD. Although, I would like to hear more original songs. I would recommend this CD to anyone who wants to experience a new level of praise and worship. The body of Christ could use a make over because of our reluctance to reach more people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I believe...pound for pound...that Tonex is one of the greatest artists (with an e accent) alive....period. With the musical talent reminiscent of Prince...the power of voice like Stokley from Mint Condition...and song writing that Killed Me Softly like young King David of the Psalms...I am inspired by him.His Apostolic doctrine is a wine that is fermented a little..part of his growing process..but never has an artist captured the realm of spiritual music...I couldnt define him...he kept morphing...like Heaven...ever moving about...I met Tonex when few knew him at a show in Harrisburg Pa...and as a son of an accomplished record producer-- I was captivated immediately by his talent.My faith is renewed..because contrary to popular belief...Yah has retained the greatest talent...and the devil is clearly overtaken in the masterpiece known as 'Out of The Box\\"/Yours in ChristBro Nate Edmonds(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Energizing","review":"I tell ya, I was really down and out when this CD came in the mail. I never really had an interest in Tonex until I heard some people commenting about how good the CD is. So I decided to purchase it. When the CD first started I was like WOW! The energy instantly lifted me and caught my attention. Tonex is like the \\"OutKast\\" of Gospel. He takes the ordinary and makes it extraordinary. He takes praise and worship to a whole new level. The anointing I feel comin from the CD is REAL. I know that I will listen to this cd again and again. This is one that you don't let your friends borrow....tell them to get their own. You will enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"yeah, this cd is bangin'","review":"I love the music, the songs and lyrics were great.

But when I got it home and played it, I was a little shocked that it was not a new audio project but some kind of dvd with out the video. This project would be better if it had been a dvd that way the first two tracks would have more appeal.Although this project really has some good new songs on it that would have been better if they had been placed on a studio recorded project with all new songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too far out the box","review":"I didn't really care for disc #1. Way too much background noise with the cheers. Yes, I know, the CD says they're real, but I couldn't get into the songs. The words are what stir the soul. And the re-mix of the older songs was too much. Disc. #2 was ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I thought this album was horrible. I had never purchased any of his albums before and obviously this was the wrong one to start with. I was expecting to receive music along the lines of what he did before with Personal Jesus but after listening to the whole album (which was worse than a complete and total chore), I wasn't sure who was being worshipped. During some parts of the album it seemed as if Tonex was looking for the praise and the worship. If I could send this thing back and get my money back, I would. I am certainly not opposed to music with a beat: Cross Movement, and the like, but I didn't feel as if this album was pointing to the Father. A sheer waste of money. I don't know where Tonex is headed but it appears that he's taking himself there instead of being led by the Spirit of God. Just Horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"3 songs out of the double cd that are worth listening to. I'm going to give it away, it's to radical, yokes wont be destroyed, people are going to be confused. It doesn't bless your spirit.

Get 'Out the Box'!","review":"If you buy this expecting a traditional gospel album - You will hate it. If you but this expecting a totally crazy, loud and mainyl secular album - You will hate it.As you put this CD in, remind yourself to be open-minded. It starts out almost like a club mix. There is techno, rap, hard rock, and everything else. No, it may not be the perfect music for worship, but you have to have balance.The second part is the more traditional type gospel.This is just an extremely anointed singer having a little fun. He even puts a gospel song to the \\"Famliy Feud\\" theme song.This is a great CD - Do not make your judgement based on the opinions of close-minded people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tonex is the bomb!!!","review":"Yesterday I heard that Tonex was coming at one of Lansing's church. So I went to see it. At first I thought he was going to sing but he was actually preaching. The man can preach so I had to get this CD. It's a really good a blessing. Everybody get this CD. I'm about to go to his program tonight. The best song in the whole album is \\"Make Me Over\\". This song really touched my heart and it will touch yours too."},{"rating":"2","title":"In love with Tonex's music","review":"I loved this cd, I listened to it 3 times in a row once I bought it and haven't put it away since. I love Make Me Over, and the ministry that comes along with it. I've been a Tonex-addict since Personal Jesus and the live music is Awesome! This cd has also emerged me into his underground gospel under Nureau Ink, and I can't get enough of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's \\"Okay\\"","review":"Personally, I was expecting more from Tonex in this CD . I thought he would have more songs like \\"Make Me Over Again\\" on it. Out of the 2 CD's, there are only a handful of songs that I actually liked. I mean, if you like moving your hips and/or headbanging...then buy this CD. You will love it! I was just expecting more \\"traditional\\", soul stirring songs from him, that's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not that good","review":"I received this CD for Christmas to add to my collection and I have to tell you I WISH I could have traded it in. The CD is just a huge mix of mess. Yea, Yea I know out of the box right? But C'mon! Can I get SOME order here? It is hard to even follow what song you are listening to because the track listings are all jumbled together . The CD has this Game show track from Family Feud and though the lyrics may provoke thought who wants to listen to the theme from a game show after work sitting in rush hour traffic? I think his vocal range and capability is wonderful but this was not the album to start with. It is full of head-aching rock tracks and it is really not the peaceful and soul-stirring worship experience I was looking for. Sorry can't let the top down and cruise to this one. I say out of the double CD 5 or 6 tracks tops!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of my time","review":"First off the sound quality is awful, that's a HUGE mistake for a live CD but not the biggest; The real problem is how Tonex doesn't know how to be a non-secular performer. He praises himself instead of God. Listen to Donnie McClurkin's live work or Israel and New Breed's \\"Another Level\\" CD, you can be evry entertaining AND stay gospel but Tonex can't deliver that feel. Live performance is where you really see what an artist is made of, judging from \\"Out The Box\\" Tonex is made of cardboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was very disappointed in this CD. I gave it 2 stars because I only liked two songs out of the whole double disc CD. The first disc was rock/dance and the other was praise/dance but they sounded absolutely the same--NO CHANGE. I just don't know what happened and that's the absolute truth. So if you're thinking about getting this CD instead of another one you want...DON'T!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent, comprehensive biography","review":"I found this book extremely readable and comprehensive. Charles has lived a huge life, and this book does justice to that life. While some might think it is too insular regarding Charles and his music, that would seem to be a true reflection of his life as he lived it. Many of the minor characters are vividly drawn. Lydon's style is graceful and evocative. Music fans should rush out and buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of information but too many inaccuracies","review":"When I first read this book, I thought it was a well researched biography. Not so. After interviewing several members of Ray Charles' band, including Leroy \\"Hog\\" Cooper, David \\"Fathead\\" Newman, Ernest Vantrease, Don Peake and Marcus Belgrave, I learned that Michael Lydon did not do sufficient fact checking. The generalities in the book paint the big picture, but the 'devil is in the details' and that's where Lydon goes wrong. After hearing the stories from the musicians, I was disappointed to find that he had not done his homework. Finding out that pieces of the book are not accurate makes me wonder about the rest. I wasn't crazy about \\"Brother Ray,\\" the cursory memoir of the man who lived such an extraordinary life, but in retrospect, that book is at least closer to the truth, and 'guilt by omission' is a better way to define my disappointment with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ray Charles,a new understanding","review":"I have never been a Ray Charles fan,and when the movie Ray cameout,I was sadden,that I had missed a great talent.I brought theDVD version of the movie,and then started reading everything there was about the man. After reading this book,which I enjoyedI found that I did not like the man. I think that the writer ofthe book,told about Ray,being cheap,being a womanizer and theway he treated people in general.I think that the movie version of his life,glossed and sugar coated his life,his career and hismarriage.I came away feeling very sorry for his wife and his children,as it appears they were truly the victims of Ray CharlesI,for one will not spend any more money on the Ray Charles legend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gambit's First Bad Chess Book","review":"If you're expecting another gem like Rowson's \\"Seven Deadly Sins\\" also by Gambit Publishing, forget it!

His reach into nonchess domains does NOT resolve confusion or produce insightful questions but creates confusion and misunderstanding.I've the feeling that because of \\"Seven Deadly Sins\\" Gambit editors decided to let Rowson's intellect roam free in \\"Chess for Zebras\\".

After a few days she left . She found a baby in a house. She called him Hassen.After she found a boy. His name was Asif. After she met a girl named leila.she has a grandmother.But she died.Asif does not like parvana.Hassen always cries.Leila even cries because she misses her grandmother. This book is a very good book.I really liked this book because it has a lot of tragic parts in it with some funny moments. I really liked the adventure and the stuff that the children went through. I was especially interested that the setting was Afghanistan.I liked it also because the cover looks cool.And i like it because it is telling about my country."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Year 7 Experience","review":"I purchased this as I am teaching it in a Year 7 class this year. Through the iPad I can prepare notes to use in class and project the text onto the board to share the experience. This assists me to engage students and helps me trigger text analysis with electronic preparation.The novel itself is excellent. The character journey accompanied by the physical is a favourite of mine and Ellis does it well. The confusion and disjoint with reality experienced by the characters is palpable. The writing is a little simplistic and given the younger audience this can be effective. The themes and challenges presented in the text are what I really look forward to working with my class on. Ellis presents an horrific situation with compassion and understanding and asks us as readers to do the same. Given current global politics, this novel is still as pertinent today as when first written."},{"rating":"2","title":"A journey in words","review":"The story continues as hardships take it's tole.

For a humorless book about funny people? The author tells us how hilarious these people are, but offers no evidence of their wit. We're told of audiences holding their sides with laughter, but the reader is left in the wings when the play begins! There is no evidence of wit in the characters' conversations, so how about a sample of their stage act? I can only assume the 5 star reviewers read a different version of this book than the general populace."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must have read a different book!","review":"This book was a total waste of time.

The 1963 tracks are from the \\"middle period\\" exemplified by \\"Soul Station,\\" in which he perfected his smooth \\"round sound.\\" On the '65 tracks his tone is sharper and harder, his phrases shorter. Like Blumenthal I prefer the earlier stuff, but there's certainly nothing wrong with the later session (except maybe for the title track, which is one of those rinky-dink \\"Sidewinder\\" clones that seemed to lead off every Blue Note date between about '63 and '66.) His reading of \\"The Good Life\\" is especially moving. in the original liner notes Mobley says that he'd like to record an album of ballads; this performance makes me wish he'd actually done so. You should, of course, start your Mobley collection with \\"Soul Station,\\" but this one makes a nice second or third choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Performances by U2 !!!","review":"From the description, we thought this DVD included U2 PERFORMING the songs from the Achtung Baby CD, plus commentary, but there were no U2 PERFORMANCES; only pundits TALKING about U2 !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacklustre giallo","review":"I was disappointed with this film. Having recently seen Martino's other giallo's, this easily ranks as his worst effort. But if you love giallo's (like me) there's some to enjoy here. The music score is good, the photography excellent (and the picture quality of this disc allows you to enjoy it's scenery to the fullest) and it's got some decent kills.However it's nearly completely devoid of any real suspense. It's brutal subject matter is handled rather clumsily, it drags incredibly; for a very long time absolutely nothing happens. Granted, it does have a bit of tension in it's final third, but just think what, say, Dario Argento could have pulled off with a finale like that.This was Martino's last giallo. I personally think he was getting bored with the genre. This movie seems to have been rushed and not made with any real passion. A shame, it had great potential"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and not scary at all","review":"I have ordered a bunch of horror movies, and this is the only one I regret. The story is mundane, there's little suspense involved and the murders are so obviously faked it made me laugh. For instance, the killer grabs girls by the throat, and four seconds later they're dead! Also, the models of the victims' bodies or heads used are obviously faked too (I think they were stolen from a wax statue museum!). There are some beautiful women and nudity but nothing to write home about. You want to know what I prefered in the movie? Some exterior scenery and the musical theme, which is very cute! So, borrow that movie if you want but don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The main selling point? The title says it all","review":"There's a clear reason why all of the male characters in \\"Torso\\" spend their time ogling the female characters: it might have something to do with a certain region of the female anatomy (above the stomach and below the neck, in case you need it spelled out) which is frequently on display in this film. Most of the standard giallo elements get a bit shortchanged here: gruesome deaths, intriguing mysteries, clever red herrings, and so on (the gore is minimal and the killer's identity is extremely easy to figure out). Instead, the film's primary asset is the revelation that clothing is apparently not a high priority to college girls in Italy. Depending on what the viewer's priorities are, \\"Torso\\" is either a disappointment or a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring waste of time","review":"I didn't like this film very much. It was boring and tedious to sit though. I used the fast-forward on parts of it, it was that bad. I love horror movies but this one was just a big dud in my books. Seems like the director wanted to concentrate more on the nudity and sex than on the actual story or murders. The effects were really bad. After watching Lucio Fulci dvds, this one was a big yawn. The only thing this movie taught me is how the people in Italy ride motorbikes with no helmets and how incredibly loose the women up there are.I felt like i was watching a 70s soft-core porno. The tag line of this movie on the trailer is: \\"Torso! It saturates the screen with terror!\\" My version would be, \\"Torso! It saturates the screen with boredom.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Did wonders for my smile","review":"I am so grateful for this product.

His choice of progressive-bluegrass musicians to accompany him here was every bit as respectable as the music itself. For example, the impeccable improvisation and signature \\"rhythm chopping\\" of Sam Bush is a priceless adornment to this acoustic layout. Also, the ability of Tony Rice to maintain that blues element in his hard flatpicking without damaging the spirit of the tune, makes any piece a masterpiece. Mark O'Conner and Jerry Douglas leave their usual effect upon the listener: \\"How in the world does he do that?\\" And Bela's lack of hesitancy to utilize the familiar single-stringing and jazz ornamentation in whatever he desires is, as always, appropriate and well-placed. Nothing imaginable is left to be desired here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD by an Awesome Musician","review":"This is Bela's best project in my opinion. Its always been my favorite of his.

Angus must make a decision. Will he triumph over the sophomore class at the winter ball and win the girl of his dreams ( Ariana Richards ), or will he complete an important science project for getting into a \\"nerd-school\\"?

They all were flipping their hair around like FOO FIGHTERS and looked rediculous. The band was tired and obviously 'born again' as they all had large Christian Croses on and even sang a song holding the Cross. In the end, \\"Free Bird\\" was tried and failed.

It really compliments the previous live DVD too, because it includes many different songs that weren't played on that one.

For example, I think the current Allman Brothers lineup is as good as ever, not only without Duane but even without Dicky , and ABB's Live at the Beacon Theater (2003)DVD is incredible. Yet to me it is an abomination that this LS lineup can use the sacred Skynyrd name. The real Skynyrd indeed was one of the best bands of all time. Here, Johnny Van Zant utterly fails as a Ronnie impersonation, and would never have been hired for a high school dance without his brother's name. Some things should just be illegal.

It is a different type of light but is well worth the small amount of effort required to get used to it.The problem is with the build quality on the lamp structure. The lamp looks sturdy, but appearances can be deceiving. We bought two of these lamps three years ago. Periodically, it is necessary to tighten the screw fittings as they do loosen over time. That is not a big deal. On one of our lamps, however, the fitting has worn so it is no longer possible to tighten the lamp at the base, which means the lamp can no longer stand upright. For a lamp this price, a three year life span just does not cut it.Update: I spoke with customer service, who said there is no way to repair and no replacement part. So buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned it but they wouldn't refund my money!","review":"The one I got did NOT have ANY brightness adjustment control, although note the description: \\"adjusts brightness to the equivalent of ordinary 75, 100, or 150 W bulbs.\\"The light was blindingly bright and because it uses a proprietary pin socket, you cannot replace the bulb with an ordinary lightbulb, and Verilux does not make a lower \\"wattage\\" bulb for this lamp.I was told by the vendor Independent Living Technologies (Garner, NC) that an older model did have an adjustable switch but that the current model does not.

Unfortunately, she planned to use it to quilt by. The light from this lamp is kind of strange and not easy to work by; to thread the needle, she needs to go over to her desk and work under the desk lamp. If I could buy a normal CFC bulb for it instead of only the special Verilux bulb, we might be happier with it. As it is, we're stuck. I'd recommend buying a lamp that can at least accept a standard bulb so you have some options if you don't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Busted","review":"I am putting this lamp out for the trash tonight. It worked fine for a few months of infrequent, gentle use, then for no reason at all stopped working. A replacement bulb also did not work. The lamp cannot be easily repaired or returned. So it has been a piece of expensive and completely nonfunctional home decor. You take your chances when you purchase this lamp.

There is very little to laugh at or enjoy. Most of the jokes are unfunny or make little sense and fall flat and most of the time you can tell that even the actors have little faith in the film when they show little effort to act well.

And he makes his points clearly and thoroughly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource for justifying development tools","review":"I read the first edition when it was first released and I've been quoting from it ever since.Topics first brought to light by this book and still highly relevant today include the concept that good software tools will always save you time, money and staff, and that productivity for software engineers is inversely proportional to the amount of administrative work they need to do.Read this book whenever management wants to save money by scrimping on your development environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This book is a classic and rightfully so. It covers the processes and methods of software development rather than the nitty-gritty details of programming. It's interesting to see what lessons were learned while large projects were worked on and it's great as a reference to compare your own projects and work environment to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sofware Engineering Requirement","review":"The Mythical Man-Month and the Soul of a New Machine should be required reading for sofware engineers. It's unfortunate that computer programmers are still be churned out like word processing operators who know a language syntax and nothing about engineering software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book; miserable ebook formatting","review":"A classic book updated with more recent thoughts by the author. I bought the ebook and was greatly disappointed by the formatting, especially of Chapter 18, the recapitulation of the author's original theses. On my Kindle 2, for example, only parts of the propositions from Chapter 2 show. Advancing the page doesn't help. Reducing the font size shows that the \\"missing\\" material is there but the tiny font makes reading impossible.Buy the paperback, by all means, but Addison-Wesley needs to take this abomination of an ebook.off the market. Professor Brooks deserves far better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it! Read it! Cry in your next meeting...","review":"There is not much one can say about a book which is 30 years old and still be able to predict the future with a staggering confidence.Ever been on a late or failed software project ? Chances are pretty good that this book predicted why long time before your project started.A mandatory read for anyone in the IT business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly outdated advice, unless you study history","review":"I was deceived by the word \\"timeless\\" appearing in the reviews, don't fall for that. The advice is mostly outdated, even the final chapters added in the 2nd edition. The book will serve you well, if you want to study a history of programming (assuming up to date with current state of the art, otherwise even the predictions are faulty). Most of the problems described do have real solutions in the mainstream programmting today.

A must read for everyone involved in software developement projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many programmers have read the book","review":"I read the book and also the reviews and i'm glad to see that many programmers have read it. Unfortunatelly many of them were not able to understand it.The book is not important for technical data (hardware etc) but for ideas, ideas that come from a huge experience of the author. In project planning you will meet with many problems that are presented here and if you will not be able to remember you will repeat the mistakes that you've made before again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp and thoroughly enjoyable","review":"I recommend this book to anyone involved in engineering, not just software people.When it comes to designing complex systems, some big problems cannot be tackled by simply throwing more resources at them. That's a profound and scary observation, especially to those responsible for managing these resources.This book has had a huge impact on the discourse you read about software engineering, particularly on the web (blogs, articles). The views expressed by Mr. Brooks have reached common acceptance in those circles. I must wonder to what extent they have percolated into the workplace however.I suggest contrasting this book with \\"The Cathedral and the Bazaar\\" by Eric S. Raymond for a different perspective on large software development and scaling issues, in the open source community."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read If You're Interested In Software Engineering","review":"This book is a classic on Software Engineering and one of the most often quoted ones. Fred Brooks experienced first hand the development of a huge-scale software development project, the IBM/360, and has learned valuable lessons which he shares in the book. If you're interested in computer science history you will enjoy the description of the pains and joys of software development some decades ago. The article \\"No Silver Bullet\\" included at the end of the book is in my opinion the best essay on Software Engineering ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few nuggets of knowledge...","review":"...but being a product of 1990's Computer Science academia it's hard not to feel like you inately \\"know\\" what Brooks espouses. Perhaps this is just a testament to the effect of the book. Being a couple decades old, it appears to have changed the way generations of software engineers work and think and consequently my generation is a product. If you're looking to pop your head up out of deeply technical work and look at more managerial, business oriented material (that nevertheless contains technical stuff too) then this is a great book with which to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Unvarnished Truth - a must read for software/project management","review":"This book spells out what you already know about writing/managingsofware/software projects -- and a lot more you never though of.It's especially interesting to see that the problems haven'tchanged much; even with \\"extreme\\" and \\"agile\\" and all the othermethods and buzzwords.With no gender bias intended, this book needs to be read by thatmanager with one pregnant programmer who can't understandwhy he just can't hire another female programmer and get the jobdone in 4 1/2 months instead of 9.

Considering this is a new edition, it really lacks footnotes explaining about all the systems mentionned, their size, their importance at the time etc. The author mentions those systems as if everyone knew what they were and did.One of other completely obsolete comments include the phrase \\"we had available a computer-driven text-editing software and this proved invaluable\\". Although, at the time, it might have proved very useful, word processors have long become a commodity, so those kind of claims make the whole matter laughtable today.Not to mention the very boring writting style.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for all developers and managers of software","review":"If you work with any aspect of software (design, construction, support, management) you must read this. So many other books and authors refer to this work that you are at a disadvantage if you don't read it.I was misinformed about the structure of the work before I read it. I assumed that the work was entirely about the Mythical Man-Month problem. It is not. That is only one chapter of the book. Each chapter covers one area and is generally short, to the point and full of nuggets of wisdom.This release is an update to the orginal printing of the book. That is good because some of the original essays are a bit out of date. For example, he stresses that PL/I is the best language for development. Its hardly used at all for new software nowadays. In the new added chapters, Brooks, takes a look back at what he predicted and takes an honest assessment of what he proposed. That is refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, yet old","review":"This is a great book for software engineering. However, it is not a reference book for you to learn the SE in general, rather it is a book pushing you hard to think the SE in general.

I also understand the need to criticize this book now. I just do not like the writing style or the antiquated ideas of Brooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Must Read","review":"I read this book some 5 years into my career, and it was like deja-vu. So many of the follies in the world of computers and software projects I had either committed or experienced or been witness to were mentioned I felt why people still blindly march into the dark hell of project failure, when this book has been around for more than 20 years! The biggest point I found was this: adding people to a project only makes it more late. Yet find me a Project Manager who believes otherwise and I will show you 100 others who do not!The only quibble I have with the book is that the author sees it fit to litter the book with religious quotes and observation, about the might of God and His grace - there is a time for religion and there is a time for software engineering pearls of wisdom - and the two should not be mixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"How men and women can adapt their communication styles","review":"A psychologist who leads frequent workshops on the material of her book, Dr. Tingley encourages women to do active listening, and to speak more like men (and men to speak more like women) to improve their communications with the opposite sex. Communicating adaptively is one way, the author states, to end the workplace war of the sexes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch it for Vincent Spano","review":"Thrills, suspense, violence...All this with a sweet undertone of an innocent child.

I thought my ears were messed up, then I thought my tv audio was messed up. Then I did a search online to confirm I was not the only one with this complaint. There is this echoing sound throughout the entire movie that sounds like a jet overhead or underwater whooshing, to an echoing in a cave, or the hissing of a flare. It is the worst audio I have ever heard on any format ever produced by a professional distributor. We should all be refunded for the cost of this item and replaced for free! The sound makes this movie nearly unbearable. This product has just lowered the bar on blu ray expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incomplete","review":"Dont get me wrong these are all classic, incredible recordings.

I have seen her live in Washington, DC two times now and was totally blown away by the strength and clarity of her voice on both occasions. Some of the songs on this album are absolutely top-notch. \\"Bem Que Se Quis\\" and \\"Lenda das Sereias, Rainhas do Mar\\" are my favorites as well as her version of \\"South American Way.\\" Any one of these songs justifies the purchase of this album in my opionion, though some of the others aren't as good. I'll have to disagree with some of the other posts regarding the American R&B and jazz standards that Marisa ended the album with. I find the renditions of the last 3 songs to be sort of boring and unimaginative, finishing up the disc with a whimper rather than a bang. But that's just my opinion..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marisa fan:\\"Just plain awful!\\"","review":"I am one of Marisa's biggest fans-I absolutely love all of her other CDs, but I feel I have the duty to warn any unsuspecting Marisa fans that this album is just plain awful. Even on the first listening of this CD its clear that Marisa is yet to find her voice or her sound. At times on the album she sounds like a female impersonating Louis Armstrong. And the songs in english? Someone should've taught her the songs phonetically-they are so bad, they're humorous!!! This album doesn't even have one song that would merit its purchase. Go buy Rosa e carvao instead!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for kids","review":"I purchased these and the pirates of the caribbean ones as gifts for my nieces and consins kids and they just loved them, specially when they light up.

I have looked into all of the other compilations of her 60's work that are available, and none have quite the character of this one.At 32 well-picked tracks on two discs, this is a terrific value. Further, unlike many of the \\"best of\\" albums, the tracks are all in chronological order - a big plus for me.This is actually a slimmed-down version of the \\"long-box\\" edition Polydor released in 2006.

It is relatively relaxing. The clouds flying by are not that relaxing and can be disturbing at times, they are too fast, but the scenes are exquisite. The Native American flutes are very relaxing. There are what I see, as major flaws in the DVD though, the major one being a long blank screen gap between the chapters, which kills the relaxation experience. It really isn't sold as a relaxation CD or DVD. I purchased my first copy of a series of Elements sets at Borders. I was looking for relaxation DVDs so I thought I would give it a try. The first one was of the Great Barrier Reef. Absolutely beautiful, but the shark scenes and the divers ruined the relaxation response.I guess you get what you pay for.

The Sylvania unit was up, programmed, and working in 5 minutes. Maybe less. I'm not even going to use the Intermatic. It's so inferior to the Sylvania. The Sylvania is VERY intuitive and clear to use.

If the bag wants badly enough to open back up, e.g. if it's stretched tight around a kaffir lime, then some air will get back into the bag.Perhaps this doesn't happen with brand new gaskets, but not a robust design, when it would have been so easy to keep the pump running until the seal was complete. In fact, this is I-can-barely-fog-a-mirror stupid.Planes tend to stay in the sky because if one thing goes wrong, they have redundant systems and robust designs, so the pilots can work around the problem.

Tilia assurred me that it was covered under a one-year warranty, that it would be replaced, and that I needn't return the original unit. Our next call was prompted by its failure to arrive in a reasonable time. We were told that they had no replacements, it was back-ordered, and would arrive within several weeks.

I used the cannister hose to help troubleshoot where the problem might be, that's when I determined there was little vaccume. There was no vaccume at all when a bag was in it, not even at the fast setting. It made quite a racket, I don't think it's supposed to do that. It seems like a relativly simple machine, but since it's a discontinued model maybe it got banged around a lot or something. Who knows. I'm bummed.I still am encouraged by foodsaver owners of differant models, and I sit here with lots of food to freeze, so I am going to go by sams or walmart to find a differant model that might work.edit to add:I got the upright fully model at walmart and it works fine. It sounds nothing like the V2440, it makes a sound but it's not as loud and does not vibrate. It's pretty easy to use, although I would really rather not had a fully automatic one.

A product that cannot be relied on to function and perform as advertised is not worth the Chinese junk it is made of. Works pretty well for the first few months then the trouble begins.

Instruments not made by a respected manufacturer will not last and most repair shops will not touch them (and believe me, you WILL have problems). Save your hundred bucks and invest it in something good because you're going to end up buying another instrument a few months later. I have seen too many of these instruments and even if they don't physically fall apart right away (which many do because they are made of very low quality metals) they are very out of tune and require a lot of air, which is very FRUSTRATING to students. If you want your student to be successful and enthusiastic about playing, please purchase a quality instrument. Good used instruments can be found for as low as $200."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I am not happy with my experience with Austin Bazaar and the trumpet we purchased.

We sent it, through the school, to be fixed by the place that they send their instruments. The valve still sticks, obviously defective. And my son is so discouraged and frustrated. He hates to practice because he can't play right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the Money, but be careful when using the oil","review":"First let me say this trumpet is great for the price. If your child is a beginner and you want something you don't have to worry about it, this will fit the bill. However, if you are not sure how to oil the pistons, don't do what I did and take them out completely. It took me all night to get them back in the right way. In all fairness the company tells you not to, but I didn't think I was doing it right the way they told me to. My advice is to take it to a music store the first time and let them show you. Dealing with Austin Bazzar was very positive and would not hessitate to recommend them or use them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good instrument for the price - great seller too","review":"I am really pleased with my experience shopping from Austin Bazaar. They were very proactive in communicating me the order status. The instrument arrived a couple of days before the scheduled delivery date and was well packed.

So my son has missed many lessons due to the condition of this trumpet which will effect his band grade.I am afraid that this will kill his spirit for learning music. He is a straight A student, and now this is going to lower his GPA. All that I have to say is SHAME ON YOU austin bazaar! Oh also the teacher made the statement that the brass on the trumpet of the trumpet was so thin that she felt that I was had by the company! I am so unhappy because now I have to buy another trumpet.

I would never throw away my NLT or NIV and replace them with this because there isn't enough meat to it.-It is a way to make tangible Biblical concepts that are difficult. For example, referring to Jesus as Boss. I've never met Jesus in the flesh, but I do have a boss at my job, and I care about his opinion of my work and try to do what he says.-It is a different perspective, not a different message.I wish it didn't skip chapters too, but that's only further evidence that it should be used as a supplement.

As stated on the cover pages it is like the Message bible but with Attitude - capital A. An easy read for beginners and people more familiar with the bible story. Modern day language & terminology may offend some but there is an audience that will respond to this translation. My 86yr old mother is reading it and loving it. Word on the Street makes you stop and think about all the main characters of the bible, maybe explains things a little clearer and definitely opens up discussions.

I give Rob Lacey credit for trying but this is just such a mess. I read five pages and began laughing. In order to simplify the Bible Word on the Street had to water down a lot. To me this Bible was like handing a starving person a bowl of popcorn because you figure that cutting into a steak is too much for him to handle.My bottom line on Word on the Street is this: It's an okay introduction for someone who wouldn't normally pick up a Bible but that's all it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't I give it ZERO!!!","review":"This is horrible.

This book opened my eyes to the plight of the Spaniards after the Civil War, and the amazing juggling act Franco pulled off to keep Spain out of the war. Franco showed tremendous courage and ingenuity to resist the incredible pressure brought to bear by the Germans to bring Spain into the war, which would have allowed German troops to pass through Spain and capture Gibraltar. The German capture of Gibraltar in 1940 would have had catastrophic implications for the British and allowed the Germans to dominate the Mediterranean and Northern Africa.

If you completely remove the vocals from the mix, I might even enjoy this record. If you replaced them with someone who could either sing, or even bark/shout in some listenable way (like say, the singer in Unsane), I might even listen to it a lot...But *this* is seriously a joke.

One thing I noticed was that while the music here is as brutal and technical as ever it was a bit catchier I would say and possibly even sticks in your head a little, not something I thought I'd ever be saying about this band. Another thing slightly unusual is the amazing production job they did this time, lightyears beyond the horrible lo-fi rumble on the Agoraphobic Nosebleed split.

But, just like their Best of Dance, Trance, and Divas series, this one includes mostly 3-4 minute radio edits with just one or two full length mixes. I actually LIKE that the songs are not segued together, but i think it would be better if Robbins released compilations with maybe a few less tracks, but with all the long versions. Also, note that this is really TRIBAL stuff, and not much in the way of vocals, if that's what you're looking for. So, anyway, the longest versions you get this time around are:Elements (Danny Tenaglia) (7:36) (album version, not the 12\\")Feel This (Robbie Rivera) (7:51)Gia (DJ Gregory remix) (7:47)Drums Control (Richie Santana) (8:20)that's it. the rest are short versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"The tape and enclosed materials were wonderful.","review":"I really enjoyed Dr. Neimark's tape and action plan.

From the Rabbi to Mendel to the animals, who perhaps possess the best judgement of everyone (as expressed by words and in illustration), the town is alive and exceptionally funny, with everyone trying to be understanding, thoughtful, intelligent, and considerate. The message is clear, everybody must be dedicated to something, and must make decisions, we all just have different ways of arriving at them! This is a book to be shared between parent and child(ren), and not only at Hannukah. In my opinion this book would be a welcome edition to any home library, especially those of individuals who are understanding, cooperative, caring, and dedicated to family, to education, and to traditions. It also helps to have a sense of humor (e.g., at times this Chelm is too familiar to me!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Manual for increasing your use of Pivot Tables","review":"This was an excellent guide for using a pivot table.

Irrespective of budget, though, is the need for the viewer to forget he/she's watching a movie and feel as if he/she is immersed in it, watching it live. This requires an element of believability, both plot-wise, as well as visual imagery. This movie fails miserably on the visual imagery believability test. It is micro budget, and whatever semi wealthy family member that loaned money to the director is very likely still asking for his/her money back. This movie is just ridiculously bad. Ooh, an evil nun wreaks havoc. The first time you see this nun (which, BTW, happens to occur within the first 5 minutes, major horror error), all hopes of movie redemption are quickly cast aside.

It has nearly 1000 pages so it has room enough! I found that the examples were short, consice and usually very illustrative. The code snippets were easy to set up/copy and this made me type in quite a few of them!What I liked especially, and what is seldomly found in other books of this nature is that the started the book with creating Windows programs from scratch without using MFC. And a lot of times when introducing new MFC- concepts MFC-threads, MFC-Internet classes, the author first shows us the \\"Core Windows way\\" of doing things.Mainly because the authors ability to explain what happens underneath I feel this book is worth reading.I really loved writing windows-NT services in plain c++ - Without a single component!Terje"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good IF you want a superficial review of a LOT of topics","review":"First, let me note that the book is about 1000 pages long, and has 53 chapters. What does this mean? It means the author has talked about a LOT of topics, but as superficially as possible. I read this book and thought MFC was extremely complicated. I thought windows programming was extremely complicated. I thought I was stupid for not understanding it! But the author made one (and only one) good point. He said that one should understand the Windows API before starting MFC. I read the reviews of Petzold's _Programming Windows 95_ and bought it. It is the best book I have ever read on the topic, and is so clear and easy to understand. Another good book that is specifically about MFC is _Programming Windows 95 with MFC_ by Prosise. I think Petzold is better, though. :)A word to the wise: be wary of books that have the name of a compiler in the title. I learned this the hard way!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Visual C++ reference","review":"This book gives excellent coverage of the C++ language as it pertains to the Windows environment. Despite it's title, however, it's coverage of Visual C++ appears to be an afterthought. Almost all examples are console apps to be compiled and ran from the command line. A good book for C++ programming, but not for learning the capabilities of Visual C++."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent turners, will not fit Squiers","review":"These tuners are excellent. One issue I had with them was that the mount pins are approximately 2-3 mm further out than squier tuners (I own a Squier Deluxe Hotrail) this mean you will have to drill into your head. I have a drill press so it was easy for me to make a precise modification. Keep that in mind when purchasing these turners."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Strat is now locked and loaded","review":"I never really had an issue with tuning stability with the stock tuners on my American Standard Strat. What interested me the most was the easy string changes and locking tuners have really helped with that. But I have noticed that it does stay in tune better than before. These are easy to install and simple to use. All you need is a 10mm socket and your are set. As others have pointed out, these are staggered so there are 3 long ones and 3 short ones so you need to make sure you get them on the right way. It only took a couple of minutes to install and they fit like a glove. I've read some people complaining about the additional weight on the headstock but I don't even notice the difference. They work just like genuine Fender parts would be expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drop in replacement on MIM Strats","review":"I ordered a couple of sets of these for 2001 and 2011 MIM Strats that I have and they were a drop in replacement that installed in about 10 minutes. I didn't have tuning problems on either of my Strats but wanted these tuners for the ease of changing strings.The tuners work exactly as they should. I had read that locking tuners will add a lot of weight to the neck and possibly throw off the balance. I weighed the old ones that came out and these tuners and the increase in weight is 7.2 grams (1/4 ounce). That is slightly less than the weight of a quarter and a dime so if you are concerned about the weight you could tape a quarter and a dime to your headstock and see if you even notice the difference. I can't notice it.The 2 sets I got were made in Taiwan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big improvement for a Squier or similar","review":"Great tuners for the price, not quite as good as the Schallers they are modelled on, but a bit cheaper.A huge improvement for tuning stability compared to the basic tuners fitted stock to many cheaper guitars.No problems with them after nearly 12 months of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I bought these, and although they look very nice, two of them came defective, and that is unacceptable. The string capturing shafts slid out of the base. Not the solid sound I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all comparable to Schaller tuners. Cheap, poor build quality!","review":"I bought a set of these hoping to upgrade a tele with tuners that have gotten a bit tight over the years. I own a couple American Deluxe strats with locking tuners on them, the ones made by Schaller. They look very similiar but the build quality is VERY poor. I could actually see the shaft rocking back and forth on one of them. None of them really had a smooth mechanical feel. I am returning my set. I'm sure they work fine for those upgrading a MIM or very cheap tuners, but these are not much of an improvement over budget tuners. I was expecting a pretty decent set of tuners for the price. Dont waste your time with these ... Buy the real Fender Schaller tuners and save yourself some trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fender Locking Tuners for MIM Strat","review":"I purchased these Fender Locking Tuners for my MIM Fender Strat. I bought the guitar used and I could never keep it in tune, as a result I could not use it when playing with my church group ( which is in tune) These tuners arrived within 5 days of me ordering. They are Made In Taiwan. Changing the tuners was a breeze. Just remove the string from the old tuner, then remove the single nut holding it in place. Slip the new Locking tuner into the vacant hole and tighten the nut. Fit exactly without any modification. The guitar now stays in tune.( Though not as good as my Martin) I had not heard of locking tuners before, and was very pleased with the ease and how quick it made to change strings.Good purchase, good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Get LOCKED Out!","review":"I just installed a set of these Fender Locking Tuners and they are AMAZING! I have a MIM Strat that had stock tuners on it and it was such a pain to change the strings. I put these staggered tuners on in a matter of minutes, literally. It was extremely easy and didn't require any instructions. I'm not a handyman by any means, but if you pay attention to how you take off the old tuners installing the new ones will be a breeze. All you'll need is a small monkey wrench or a wrench that's can fit the nut on the tuners. Once they're in place simply pull the string through the pin, screw the locking wheel snug, cut the end of the string and tune. It's that simple! I really think that you'll love these tuners. You won't regret spending the money and Amazon has them probably the cheapest that I've seen. Enjoy!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect upgrade for any Strat or Tele","review":"These locking tuners are perfect for any Strat or Tele. I have an American Strat and an American Tele that both came with fairly decent non-locking tuners. I also have a Carvin and two Paul Reed Smith guitars that came with locking tuners...they are certainly worth having. Fenders (at least American-made ones) are very easy to swap out tuners for these...the holes are already there, there's no need to drill holes for screws, everything is so easy you have to do it yourself. I've swapped out the tuners and have never looked back...the only question is what to do with the non-locking Fender tuners I have now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"Direct replacement for the stock tuners on my 1996 MIM Tele.

I had never used locking tuners or replaced tuners on any guitar. It was a breeze and they are freakin' awesome. String changes are SOOOO easy and they stay in tune and the staggered posts are good for me. I was impressed with the looks, the weight, the fit and the precision build. I had no troubles with anything and they continue to function perfectly. I am pretty sure that they wouldn't fit right on Squier's or even my Jimmy Vaughan that has the crappy \\"vintage\\" tuners. Fortunately the regular sealed tuners on MIM's and MIA's appear to be very standardized. I am going to buy a set of these for my new Fender MIM tele asap and put them on with my first string change.

It is highly subjective, written from an atheistic and far left-wing perspective with constant jabs at actions of the Israeli right as well as Israel's religious Jews.While a few of the ideas presented in the book were worth some consideration, it suffers greatly due to the decided slant in the style of writing. Contrary to the above review, this book has had little, if any, impact on Israeli politics, as very few Israeli politicians could take this book seriously due to the level of moral relativism present throughout the text. To assert that this book had anything to do with the wall along the green line is absurd.For a objective look at Israel's wars and modern Israeli politics written from a moral, yet centrist, perspective, readRight to Exist: A Moral Defense of Israel's Wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dubious recommendations","review":"Van Creveld does point out the problems Israel faces: terror, conventional attacks, and possible long-term hostility and threats no matter what it does. And he has a solution: reduce the threat of terror by getting out of the land that was under Arab occupation in 1966.Unfortunately, the argument for doing this is unconvincing. And there are some strong arguments for doing something else. One is that ethnically cleansing the West Bank of its Jews is already a serious abrogation of human rights. Another is that it may well encourage Arab terror even more if the interim result of it is to gain general acceptance of Arab rights to steal Jewish land. I was not impressed by the author's grasp of such problems. Van Creveld may be correct that a fence separating the Jews and Arabs is a good idea. But there is no good reason to put even the heavily Jewish portions of the West Bank on the Arab side of the fence even when these areas are adjacent to the 1966 Israeli border."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome knife sharpener","review":"Awsome sharpener!!

His use of language is poetic, rich and dense, and yet enhances the plot rather than hinders its movement.The three books of this series are all good, fun and amusing...it is a change to actually laugh in the middle of a sci-fi/fantasy book when you suddenly 'get' the concealed joke.If you love ancient Rome as I do, and yet want some fun too, then read this series at once!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A review by a decendant","review":"My surname is Alberti (52 years old), I am a direct decendant of Leon Battista Alberti (1404-72).

You can have guitar / keyboards co-exist without going back to their sugary sound of TFC.What I really can not digest is the filter/effect on the vocals. What is the point ?

Keith and Ronnie were so elegantly wasted cool. Sharing a mic on Honky Tonk Women, Ronnie would approach the mic with cigarette in mouth and then quickly take it out and put it at the foot of the mic stand. Keith would sidle up and drop down and in a flash would have that cigarette in his mouth, both of them smiling in agreement that this stage is where it's at. And Stanley Clarke playing an out of this world bass solo with Ziggy pounding out a funky beat! If this double CD set is the only live chronicle of this band having a blast, then it's totally worth owning. Great that this gig is officially released.

I saw the Stones there in 1975 and that was not great either, and every other time I've seen them (37 times and counting) the've bested that performance.

It's not very aerobically strenuous for me yet, however, it works my muscles very well. I'm only 12 weeks along and it's still pretty easy. The video has you use a chair and sofas to do strength trianing so no weights or tools required. I could see when I've doubled in size this video being aerobically taxing (in a good way). The video is filmed in a living room and it's just you and Erin. The video has a very personal feel to me. Erin O'Brien even has to run off to pee (I'm sure it's staged but it's cute and I like it).

And I could do without the part where she makes it a point that we should pause the dvd if we have to use the bathroom and the video actually stops for a few seconds.But I do like that the instructor gives you tips on form and she is very encouraging, telling you to keep going and not treating you like a weak pregnant woman that should just sit around!!!Overall it's def a great workout dvd for any pregnant woman that wants to do more than just a few stretches!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout","review":"I thought this was a good work out DVD for pregnancy.

Prior to becoming pregnant, I was an avid runner. Once pregnant, I turned to walking and it just wasn't giving me the heart-pumping workout I needed and got from a good run. I decided to give this video a try and LOVED it. The workout is done in her own living room, which is a welcomed change from the typical staged workout rooms. She moves quickly and doesn't spend a lot of time explaining every move, which I appreciated. You simply move from one exercise to the next, in order to keep your heart rate up. I have purchased several videos and always find myself bored with the instructor's lengthy explanations.I recommend this video for anyone willing to accept a tough and challenging workout!

Her use of dynamic sequencing really does get you a good workout. I like how well she describes the proper form of movement.

Before getting pregnant I did the Power 90 DVD's (which I LOVE, but I was concerned the impact was too much with a baby). My biggest complaint is that she doesn't explain the moves. She just jumps right into a routine, if you don't know it, she isn't gonna tell you! The DVD has a homemade feel; taped in a\`livng room, and a generic feel. If you enjoy aerobics tapes and can keep up with constantly changing movements without instructions maybe you will like this, otherwise; might I suggest a treadmill or walk around the neighborhood in fresh air and the toning segment of Denise Austin's Fit & Firm Pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"O'Brien has very little knowledge on this subject!","review":"Yes, Erin O'Brien may be a personal trainer with is a certification after a number of \\"training hours\\" and probably would do a great job working at a gym with the general public. Unfortunately she has VERY limited knowlege of the changes that happen physiologically within the body during pregnancy and the precautions that should be taken during this workout at various stages of pregnancy. I am pregnant with my second child and am a physical therapist. If I did not have a broad underatnding of precatutions that shoudl be taken not to damage my pelvis or low back during her numerous squats and one legged activities I would most likely have a significant injury that would cause me pain through the rest of my pregnancy. Look elsewhere for a workout DVD by someone who specializes in womens health and fitness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyper-Advanced workout","review":"My wife thought this would be a useful video after viewing an interview with Erin and her husband on television. I found this to be fast-paced and much more advanced than what we were expecting. If you are a hard-core aerobics junkie then this must be designed for you--I am not pregnant and I found the pace painful to even watch; oh, and the partner portion of the video is perfect for those that need more than their own weight to use during aerobics. Erin's husband provides more resistance by leaning on top of his wife through the exercises, as if being pregnant was not enough.I am sure Erin means well. However, for a normal person, you may need to watch the video at half-speed to keep up. James Denton seemed as bewildered as I, but it was cool to see another puzzled husband accomodating his wife. He did his best going through with the exercises, so kudos to him for supporting his energetic wife in this enterprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor filming","review":"This video is terrible. I have turned it on twice to try to do it and just can't. The filming is just terrible. It's filmed in her living room, which is fine. It gives you a sense you can do it at home. However, the lighting is terrible. The sun is in your eyes and just incredibly shadowy. Besides that she uses her furniture for all of the exercises. Again, you think great. You'll be able to do this at home. That is probably the case if you have traditional furniture, sofa, coffee table, and chair. However, I have an automan instead of a coffee table, my couch is against the wall. So? Other than that it is just boring, with elevator music playing in the back ground. A positive is that it does look like a good work out. I do a lot of exercise with videos at home. So I can see that it looks safe and has a good intensity. I just couldn't stand to watch the thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good amount of exercise","review":"I was doing prenatal yoga, and felt like I wasn't getting enough workout so I decided to purchase this DVD. I had done aerobics before, and this DVD was just right amount of workout. In the beginning (around 20th week), I sweated just a little bit when I was done with the 40 min workout. Now, I got used to the program but it's still challenging enough because I've added up few more pounds. Good workout for thighs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"I have been working out throughout my pregnancy (I'm 23 1/2 weeks right now) and really enjoy this workout. The first time I did it, the lunges and squats were kinda tough, but since it has gotten easier. The workout is a nice pace and feels shorter than it is to me. I love that she reminds you to keep your abs engaged and I like the oblique work since you can't lay flat it is nice to work the abs in creative ways. Some days that I do this, my lower body is more sore than when I do my non-prenatal dvd's using weights. I think it must have to do with my form and the sequencing of the exercises and reps. I wish there was a little more upper body work but I can easily add a few exercises if needed. The tricep dips are tough and work a much needed area. All in all, I love it and will continue to do this workout as I am able."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This was the only pregnancy DVD that was available in my local record store so I picked it up. I'm in my fourth month and haven't been able to do much in my first trimester since I was on Bedrest. I was pretty disappointed with this DVD, the sound, image quality is not the best looks quite amateurish.

INTENSE WORK OUT!!","review":"Erin O'Brien's Prenatal Fitness FixTHIS VIDEO IS REALLY HARD CORE, BUT IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU. NOT FOR THE AVERAGE MOTHER. The video is divided into 4 sections. The warm up, gets you really warm...typical aerobic class grape vines, etc., The next part is pretty intense lunging, squatting and plank type positions, pushups, etc. The 3rd part is floor work with lots of leg lifts (you'll want a really good thick mat here or your hips will be aching). The last part is stretch and relaxation, although i didn't find it very relaxing. If you are used to Yoga practice for stretching and relaxation, you'll probably want to skip this part as I did and just throw in the stretch and relaxation part of a pre-natal yoga video. (you need water, a mat and a chair to complete this video)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for really working your body.","review":"I am only 5 weeks along and did this video and sweat the first time. I can see when I get into my 3rd trimester it will be tough, but that is the point. I want to keep my muscles toned all through my pregnancy and that takes work. I have a Denise Austin video that was boring compared to this. Also, she does it in a living room setting using a coffee table and couch as props. It is very realistic and shows you, you can do this is a tight space. Also has a great 20 minutes separate workout to do with your husband helping. I like it becasue she changes routine just when you think you can't handle one more of the rep you are in. She even pauses for pee breaks and water breaks. I should add, I just had a baby 6 months ago and even though I lost all my weight, I am not in tip top shape and I was able to do the entire video. She gives instruction on how to make it less hard if you are having trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Prenatal Workout!","review":"I am 7 months along and have been doing this video for about 3 months. At first it was a bit of a challenge, especially the squats! But the more I did it, the easier it got and the better I felt. I try to do this video at least 2 times a week alternating with elliptical workout on the alternating days. It makes me feel great and I feel like I am doing something worthwhile for my body. This is my 3rd baby and I have tried a lot of other pregnancy workouts; none have been as good as this one. I would definitely recommend this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not flow well","review":"This is the strangest workout video I've ever seen.

There are much, much better ones out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for fit women","review":"I bought a few prenatal fitness videos so I would have variety. This one would have to be the most challenging, which is good for me! I actually got a good work out from this one. I am now 36 weeks pregnant with great blood pressure thanks to this workout that challenges moms-to-be. Other work out videos I hardly broke a sweat but this will keep me strong for labor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout, pregnant or not!","review":"I bought this video, a little dubious about what a pregnancy workout would entail. I found it to be incredibly helpful! Though the quality of the video has a very \\"at home\\" feel, Erin has a full workout with a quick pace that will keep you working. I didn't feel like it was too strenuous, and there is lots of time for stretching and relaxing.The feel of the video is very laid back. Erin is in her home working out. There are many humorous moments, like when she has to go to the restroom in the middle of the workout. (It's also nice to have a pregnancy video led by someone pregnant.) I would recommend this video to anyone who wanted to stay in shape during their pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great workout!! Actually makes you sweat...","review":"I was in pretty poor shape before I got pregnant. I was too tired to work out the first 11 weeks, but at 11 weeks I started doing this DVD and it was enough of a workout to make me A) sweat (a lot) and B) SORE! I started doing this 2-3 times a week...by the time it started to get \\"easy\\" for me, my belly started growing and it was getting to be a real workout again. I am not 27 weeks and do it about once a week. I will probably start using it more often when it gets a little hotter and I can no longer go on walks outside.There are some issues with the sound during the DVD so I gave it four stars (it can be a bit hard to hear, but once you've done it a few times you really don't need ti hear it).I have not tried the partner workout portion of this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be dangerous to follow her speed","review":"I am a pretty fit person (been working out at least 5 days a week, including one day with a trainer, for years), but I think this video contains prenatal exercises that are way too fast and jerky for most pregnant women. If you go at your own pace, it's fine, but following her speed (especially during the \\"double-time\\" parts) is probably too much for most women. You can tell she's a group exercise instructor--I'm sure she's a great teacher in that context. But I don't think the dismissive \\"you're okay, you're fine\\" comments she makes during the more intense parts of the video are necessarily the message to send to a pregnant woman who may be overexerting."},{"rating":"2","title":"great DVD!","review":"I used this throughout my pregnancy and it is a great workout - it is something you can do everyday!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't make myself sit through it again","review":"I've done this video 2-3 times, and I can't make myself do it again.She is a cute, fit little lady, and knows her stuff, but I just don't like it. It's not a hard workout, and there's too much non-workout related material and talking to sit through. For example she says: \\"If you have to go to the lou, pause me, don't make me work-out alone,\\" then a couple minutes later she runs off the set to use the \\"lou\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHOA! way too fast for a pregnant woman","review":"I'm in my first trimester and consider myself to be in moderate shape. This DVD was WAAAAAY too intense for me. I can't imagine keeping up with this workout further along in my pregnancy. Just the warmup alone had my heartrate going. It is very fast paced -- Erin calls it \\"circuit training\\" -- basically not giving you a chance to rest as you go from one exercise to the next. If you're a pro at aerobics, this is the DVD for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fitness Fix","review":"I was so excited to try out this video, but I have to say I was very dissapointed. After the reviews I read I thought this was going to be a good workout. I don't think I broke a sweat once during the entire thing. I could have folded the laundry and had a better workout. I was 17 weeks when I tried this and running has become difficult with all the trips to the bathroom and some round ligament pain. I think this video is meant for people who eiether have never done any type of exercise before or who are in their 7th or 8th month of pregnancy. I am used to running about 20-30 miles a week so if you are expecting a good heart pumping workout from this you are going to be very dissapointed. Go for a fast paced walk instead. The quality of the video was fine and the music did not bother me. I have also purchased the video with Karen S, but have not tried it after I wasted 40 minutes on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANNOYING!!!!","review":"No one else found this woman annoying as hell? Its an ok workout if I put her on mute and use my ipod. By the way who is on the cover? It looks like an entirely different person one you put the dvd on. Her stomach is hanging out and I just found her revolting. She needs James Denton to come on just so people will buy this. I tried to pass it off to a pregnant friend of mine and she gave it back to me cause she couldn't stand her either- ya uh ha your ok your ok. I'll take Denise Austin anyday over this lady."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke!","review":"If you exercise regularly, please save your time and money. I did this video in my 23rd week and I never even broke a sweat.The video is 40 minutes long. The first 10 minutes are a lame warm-up (as in step-touches).The second segment is some moderately challenging lunges, squats, etc. However, there are several segments that tell you to drink water and then you get to waste your time watching Erin drink water. Wow, that gets my heart rate up. At one point, the video freezes, and \\"If you have to pee, pause the video\\" comes up on the screen. Really?The third segment is some lame pilates - I could put together a better routine myself.The fourth segment is stretch and relaxation - I turned the dvd off at this point, out of frustration.The production quality is laughable - I really think Erin and her husband shot and produced this right out of their house.Even in my ninth month, I'll opt for a brisk walk over this waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This series deserves better","review":"Triloka had put out the wonderful series \\"Trance Planet\\", which I had to own all volumes for, but Planet Chant really left alot to be desired. In places it was far too \\"techno\\" for the subject matter. If you are expecting indigenous chants and slices of life from places around the globe such as the label implies, its best to look elsewhere.

I found Kirk's fun and intuitive approach (very Mac-like) to be perfect. As a long time Apple user, and often times under utilizer of software (because I hate to read manuals). It was refreshing to find someone that gets it, and writes a book for those of us that need a little humor with our how-to. Check out is webpage too.Another added plus...

Not one of the songs is anywhere near as good as the original versions (and \\"Garden Party\\" was pretty lame to begin with!) It's hard for me to understand, as anyone who's heard the LIVE 1983-1985 album can attest he brought MORE power to his oldies as the years went by, not less-- as here.But the worst thing is that, apart from the cover photo, NOTHING on the outside packaging hints that these are anything other than the \\"original\\" recordings.

I have the one called \\"All My Best\\" on Silver Eagle Records which are the same recordings. I completely prefer the new version of \\"I'm Walkin'\\" to the original, but other than that, I'd have to say the originals are better. BUT, that doesn't make this a bad record.

This 81/2 by 11 hardcover book is focused on Japanese erotic art. Many of these beautiful and detailed drawings came initially from the Japanese pillow books which showed various sexual positions. These books were often given to married couples as gifts. Japanese erotic art is intertwined with their culture and religious beliefs. These drawings represent how the Japanese viewed the nature of love and sexual desire. They did not view it as dirty or perverse but part of the total aspect of being human.In conclusion, these erotic drawings are classics and will be of interest to anyone who is into Japanese cultural arts as well as martial arts.Rating: 4 Stars.

In this collection of tales, employees and clients must deal with a murderous pimp, a gorgeous and thoroughly evil mind-controlling lady scientist, a dumb, lethal monster of a hood. Occasionally Lady Sally's husband, Mike Callahan of Callahan's Crosstime Saloon, is on hand to help out although everyone seems to get along fine without need of his presence.Spider Robinson is a favorite writer of mine who mixes solid story-telling, a Robert Heinlein sense of humnor, and his own interest in music and, god help us, puns.

But the writing -- bad dialogue, weird pacing, badly developed characters, it all gets in the way of enjoying the story.

It started slow and at first I thought I was glad that I hadn't read this one first because I might not have read the rest of the series, but by the end of the book, that problem was gone. The only problem I had with this book had nothing to do with the story itself. The book had a few typos and what seems like an unusually large amount of extra and misused commas for no reason in many sentences on most pages. My biggest pet peeve with this book is, however, that it has no chapter demarcation. It would be so much nicer if this series had it, but as of yet, none of the books have had it. Thankfully, now the rest of the books in the series don't differ so that the chronological and publication orders are the same.

The fact that they did not use professional actors, makes the film even more compelling, as you see China caught in a cultural transition, that it is not sure how to deal with.

It also shows that change is possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"I loved this movie because they used non-actors and the cast are just so natural and real. When you watch this film, devoid of the slick Hollywood movie magic that we've all gotten so used to, you can't help but be moved by the storyline.Also, because there's really no 'acting' in this movie, it is really funny to watch these people so obviously working to tell this story with little to no acting skills whatsoever.

This was more for simple/small jobs (pc repair work, hinges, drawer handles, etc...) that don't require much in the way of tools. This was a waste of time and money. I now use this as a door stop. The battery does not last more than 20 min. before you have to charge it (not a removeable battery) so you lose the tool when charging.

I dont like the character of Kel at all. It really bothers me that shes just soo lovesick all the time. Shes supposed to be a strong female character, yet all she does is throw herself at different male characters. She is only 12 years old for heaven's sake.

The turn of events between Kel and Stump at the end is giving me the impression that Stump is mistaking Kel for one of his daughters. I have to say this, Cleon has got it bad. And I think I know who her benafactor is but I could be as wrong as jello is solid so I won't say it here.

There is also Lalasa, Kel's new personal servant, who was abused and frightened in her previous home. Kel takes it upon herself to teach Lalasa self defense. There are also several new pages along the way, including Owen, a cheerful, tactless boy one year Kel's junior. There's also all the old, familiar characters we know and love, like Cleon (who starts acting very...oddly towards Kel), the Stump, the sparrows, and Neal (who Kel develops a crush on... ^_~).Of course, the story's filled with hilarious humor that you can relate to, heartwarming moments, and thrilling moments of suspense.

I don't think Alanna would just yet since Kel is still in a sense proving herself and you want her to stand on her own two feet- but I could be wrong. Also, will Neal reciprocate Kel's feelings? And if he does, will it be another passing-by Jon-and-Alanna kind of thing, or the more lasting attraction of Numair & Daine? (BTW: someone miscounted Neal's beauties. It's just Daine, Uline and the Queen! :) The big question is: what in the world is Joren up to? I don't trust him one whit. He is way too suspicious; but what taught him subtlety? Tuck in and enjoy!

Jump, her new dog companion adds a lot and Peachblossum her mount and Queen and her group of Sparrows return. Plus Neal, Daine, and all the old group have roles in this story too.

Nice to know Keladry hasn't slackened on her ongoing quest to protect those around her from bullies. One minor point: I still find myself wondering what happened to Princess Kalysin?

It tells of her troubles, accomplishment and a bully which she hates and has to help her friends in protecting the first year pages not get beat up by this bully.

Kel wants to become a knight. She would like to please the strict Lord Wyldon who seems to always think that Kel isn't doing good enough. Kel isn't like other girls who love gossip and sitting around doing needlepoint. Therefore all of her friends are boys, except for her new timid servant Lalasa who Kel would like to know better. Kel begins to mature in this book physically and emotionally and she hates her body for it. She has her first crush on her best friend, Neal, and her friend Cleon has a crush on her. Neal has fallen in love many times and takes women by their looks however. Kel masters her greates fear which I will not mention and Kel ultimately proves that girls and women alike are in no ways weak.

The enormous personal conflicts and pressures on Christians in Nazi Germany are illustrated with episodes from his life and his own writings, culminating in his role in the plot to assassinate Hitler. Most timely in today's war on terrorism. Highly recommended for religious libraries."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Man Who Walked His Talk","review":"Superb documentary about a German minister who stood up publically against Hitler. Bonhoeffer taught that following Christ's call was not cheap or easy but ultimately rewarding. The film shows the real power and charisma of Hitler to great effect. Bonhoeffer recognized Hitler for the evil he was and didn't hesitate to speak openly against him when it was dangerous to do so.What was most interesting to me is how Bonhoeffer went from a committed non-violent teacher of the Gospel to joining the conspirators who tried to assasinate Hitler in order to spare Germany and her people.A fascinating slice of history and spirituality. If more demoninations had preachers and teachers like Bonhoeffer, Christianity wouldn't have the sorry reputation it has today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Informative but dry and boring.Had some interesting facts but was very slow paced,They sure could have made this a much better piece on an amazing man of that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"first class biography of a man who stood up against evil.","review":"This is a excellent well made biography of the theologian and important nazi resister Bonhoeffer. WE get his life story and the story of his beliefs and how he became a resister of Naziism and how he met his end at their hands. He even became a full fledged conspirator along with others against hitler and his ilk. So he crossed that line from peaceful protest to violent action. We learn why and how he was moved by religion to believe he had to go that route.

(We see Bonhoeffer in a moving image only once, at a family outdoor event, as I recall).At the same time, they've made a movie about Germany, and in particular about how the Protestant and Catholic churches in Germany coped -- in some cases, welcomed -- the rise of the Nazi party, and about how Hitler himself used religious speech to his own ends. Almost all the footage of Hitler in this film is stuff I've never seen before; some of it startled me.I learned a great deal, and was glad I did. The movie will probably appeal most to people interested in Bonhoeffer as a theologian and writer, but History Channel fans may get gripped too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally worthwhile","review":"I enjoyed this DVD from start to finish. It was moving, yet not over-sensationalised. A great primer before sinking your teeth into some of Bonhoeffer's books: Discipleship, Letters & Papers from Prison and Life Together possibly being the most accessible.A great timeline of Bonhoeffer's life.In addition to this I'd recommend the issue of Christian History magazine devoted to Bonhoeffer.

The holster itself is light, has good belt-loops and an arched shape so that it aligns very well and comfortably to the shape of your hip. However, once you pop your Glock 17 down into the holster, the pistol won't come out of the holster again without you using your other hand to restrain it while pulling the pistol out. If you don't use your other hand to grip the holster you will not ever pull the pistol out, but rather just pull your pants up to the point that you are giving yourself a wedgie. That's how strongly this holster grips the Glock 17.I'm sure it's possible to stretch or break the holster in somehow even if it's hard and solid plastic, but if Fobus had just put two damned little adjustable screws at the edge instead of two bolts, the problem would be solved.

However, for learning Windows programming, this book is awful. It uses MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes), which is a terrible place to start. Even Microsoft won't use this technology.I recommend 'Windows NT 4 Programming from the Ground Up', by Herb Schildt. It uses the Windows API functions, which is a must learn for any Windows programmer. Also, I recommend exploring other books for C++ tutorial.

I skimmed through the contents and thought, \\"Great, it contains what I want to learn!\\".Until I started reading the damned thing, that is. It's not so much the subject matter, as it is the lack of depth which is the problem. The author spends far too much explaining the same stupid steps (\\"Click here, and here, and here, etc\\") over and over without going into any relevant detail. The examples are painfully primitive, and trying to create apps with any sort of functionality resulted in lots of fishing in the MSDN Library.If you're an absolute beginner to Visual C++, then this book will give you a good feel for the basics.

Knowledge of C/C++ is helpful and virtually inevitable, either before or after you read this book.

However, it will use the word 'pointer' or 'class' with almost no explanation.

On a more positive note, Elijah Wood was quite good; his southern accent was a lot better than Costner's. And the movie effectively conveys the mood of a hot, rural summer with almost no parental supervision.

Sure, it is a dumb fairy story involving giant, steroid-bloated hulks (they are and remain incredibly strong and fit guys, whatever their juice habits may be) waddling around and waving chunks of metal at each other while in their fur gachies. But, darn it, they're having so much fun with it, you can't help but have fun right along with them. If a man dislikes the performance of Peter and David Paul, he must dislike life; for that is what they are: great, giant, hulking, good-natured living men! I mean, the facial expressions! The bon mots! They're wonderful!It is a darn shame that this is not available on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great pen-stylus","review":"I first purchased this pen from it's original manufacture over 2 1/2 years ago, and have never gone back to using a plain PDA stylus since. On the plus side, it's slim and perfect for older general Palm III's (III, IIIx, IIIxe, original PalmPilot). You can get refill pen cartridges at office supply stores (they're actually standard ink cartridges for regular pens). It's not a lot of $ either.On the down side, it takes some dexterity on your part to take it apart and put it back together when you put in a new cartridge. It's not for the V, VX or m500, m505 series.Still, I've saved many a shirt pocket by no longer having an ink pen in it (a bit geeky, I know), and putting my Palm IIIx there with this slim pen-stylus instead (O.K., defintely geeky)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Supplement","review":"This book is the type of art book that is the exception to the picture rule. The fact that there are no pictures doesn't detract a bit from the abundant amount of information it contains.

When I called, they were stubborn and made me pay postage to send those boxes back that I did not order. Plus they were very use pathetic. I did research and realized the original Firm has nothing to do with the old. It is now owned by Gaaiam. The choreography is not half as good nor are the workouts.If you are ordering Firm workouts you need to get the older ones before Gaiam bought them out. They just use the name. Ideally dislike this corporation and will refuse to purchase anything with their name on it. beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love so far","review":"I have only had the set for a week, however I have done about nine of the DVDs. First of all, they are moderate to hard intensity. Do two in a row and you will be pouring sweat. I don't think doing 20 min three times a week will help my weight loss goals (I only want to lose about 15lbs) and I am not overweight so I will have to work hard for weight loss (like everyone else). I agree it is tricky to catch on to the moves. You do receive little instruction. If you have a fair amount of coordination you will catch on...within short amt of time. I have lost two lbs in 5 days so I'm pumped. The videos are exactly 20 min which I love. The instructors are what you would expect. I think like anything, if you eat right and do the workouts you will benefit. I also did the four day kick start plan it comes with for diet and loved it. Recipes were simple and good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I have been working out regularly for 10 years and am in great shape. I work out at the gym and do exercise videos regularly for fun variation. I received this set as a birthday gift. The workouts WILL get your blood pumping and provide a good workout, but this has got to be the most boring workout series EVER! The instructors are annoying and the routines don't capture the interest at all. It is my experience that if a workout is not fun or interesting, it stays on the shelf. That's where The Firm is now. Try Hip Hop Abs or The Biggest Loser series instead...fun, challenging, and effective!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice!","review":"So far so good!

I kept seeing it in Target and the majority of the newer firm videos I do once and never again so my gut told me NO. But I so needed something new to motivate me so I caved and bought it. My gut was wrong for once! I love it! The workouts are super quick and I feel like I got in a great workout in 20 min. I love how you get a new workout every other day so I am looking forward to each one before I do it. I also try to walk a mile or so after. This is perfect for me especially during the holidays to help offset alll the eating. I highly recommend!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Firm Express - only for prior firm users","review":"I loved the infomercial and was hooked from the first day.

Not worth it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"They jump in too fast with the moves, once you learn it they are already moving in to the next move.

I am over the age of 50 and overweight and there is no way that this body is ever going to be able to do half of those moves. The videos including the first ones go way to fast for people that are not familiar with the moves and are not so lucky to be so coordinated. They move way to fast to try and get the moves down before moving on. I just got totally frustrated with the program so I'm returning it. If you have a hard time getting from a standing position to a push up position then forget this workout. By the time I got down and back up once they were finished with that portion of the workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing rip-off from Gaiam","review":"I own a great deal of the Firm DVDs and have generally been happy with the program and company. But when I received the package, despite the box being sealed and Amazon's great packing, the discs had fallen out of the sleeves they were in (they were not properly secured or wrapped) and were scratched. This is the company's poor packaging/design. Even so, approximately 1/2 the discs were the same one's Giaim has packaged and sold as other DVDs (i.e., Turbocharge Weight Loss and Ignite Calorie Burn), which I already have. Definitely NOT worth the $ and VERY disappointed in false advertising and poor packaging!!!! I am returning this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"The workouts are great, though by the time you figure out the routine you are on to the next thing. I do enjoy them. Good thing is they are short, so before I know it the workout is done & I've worked up a sweat. On some of the workouts I really feel it the next day (sculpting), which is great because I was worried that they would be too short & I wouldn't get a good workout. Very glad I bought these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for advanced","review":"I bought this product thinking it would deliver the results they are saying but nope!! I consider myself an intermediate, advanced and it is not what I expected. They are too short in my opinion plus their 8 second MINI bursts are not enough to get my heart rate up, not even half way., I w/o 6 days a week for around one hour or more and obviously had to stack 3 or 4 in order to get a good sweat. So if you're an advanced, there's no way you'll be satisfied with this pack.

This works for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"High expectations for the underfitted","review":"This product is fast, short and to the point. However if you aren't already in good shape it's very difficult to keep up. It goes so fast that you can't learn the steps before it quickly changes the routine. I did the firm back in the 90's it was wonderful and I wasn't in shape. They should come up with a firm pilates mix that way you build up the core and get fast results with instruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"Many years ago I did the Firm video workouts with the different steppers and weights. But I just don't have time to workout for an hour anymore, so haven't done them in quite awhile. I decided to check and see if they had anything shorter, and I found these. I was always intrigued because I get so bored when I exercise, so I liked that it was a different video every time you workout for a month. I have just finished week 3, and I have to say these are great workouts! I'm 56 years old and would like to loose about 30 lbs, so I'm not as young as many people who might want to do these. I work as hard as I can, and keep reminding myself that it is only 20 minutes -- I can do anything for 20 minutes, and I just keep going! If you are coordinated and like a fast-paced workout, you will enjoy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Losing weight!","review":"I super love the videos! The Cardio workouts take my breath away! Literally!I have always been a fan of instructional DVDs because I can fit them into my schedule and plans. When I got this DVD, I started with the workout sessions right after. After 30 minutes with no breaks, I cracked with a heavy pounding heart with sweat drenched all over my body. The Cardio workout speaks well for me. It provides me with the necessary push and pull of muscles and sweat that is needed for my everyday workout regimen."},{"rating":"1","title":"they should warn you.......","review":"Because this was a 12-dvd set, I assumed you were eased into this program---which really sounded great on TV. NOT SO! I would NOT recommend this exercise program for women over 50. I injured myself just on the first lesson!Some great exercises, but the intensity was just too much right out of the shoot. I returned the program sore and quite disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"very sad at the loss of integrity","review":"The \\"old\\" Firm workouts were straight-up and honest, ie \\"you will see results in 10 workouts\\". Yes, results, from 45-60 minute workouts in 10 sessions. You will feel better or start to notice some positive improvement, depending on your starting point. Perhaps your arms are stronger or your belly is a bit flatter. None of this 15 lb weight loss in 30 days, which is ALMOST metabolically impossible, and if it did happen, would be due to an extremely restrictive diet and not some silly 20 minute exercise program. Although I loved the Firm Classics (it took 6 months of 6 day a week workouts to lose 25 lbs) I do not recommend for anyone over 40 or overweight and the false hype is very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I absolutely love this workout program, with my schedule I can't workout on a daily basis so this definitely works for me. I felt the burn the very first day after the workout. After the first month you can definitely see a difference in my legs and arms. I will continue with this program until I reach my goal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I really want to like this workout series, but if you are not quick to catch onto to moves none of The Firm DVD's are for you. The instructors do not give enough demonstration or instructions on the moves until they are actually doing them. I end up having to stop and watch the moves performed, then when I feel I have finally got it down they move on. I am frustrated because I do not feel I am getting a good workout because I am not able to continuously perform the exercises. Maybe if you have more patience The Firm DVD's would be good for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly choreographed warm ups","review":"These could be good, I used my HRM during the first 6 videos and on avg burn 200 calories in 20 minutes. That's nice, but not any more impressive than doing Core Rhythms 20 minute video. Moved onto the third week and just cannot master the overly choreographed warm up, she's got you twisting, turning and kicking. And when I couldn't master it before she moved onto some other twisting, turning and kicking move I just got frustrated and turned the dang thing off after 3 minutes. If only the Firm website would allow feedback. They need to put out a tutorial video to go along with these. Even Core Rhythms was smart enough to do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the Firm used to be","review":"These videos stick to the 20 minutes, but the workouts are not enough to get \\"thin in 30 days.\\" Nothing like the traditional Firm workouts. Some of the movements are too fast and could cause injury when combined with weights. I would suggest Jillian Michaels Ripped in 30 workouts for a shorter, effective, kick-butt workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"Warm ups are a little too difficult, but for 20 minutes, this is a pretty good workout.

I consider myself a moderate exercisor, but high impact is very difficult for me with bad knees. I needed something low to med impact.

Not grandmom 54, work out daily 54. Even I can't use these anymore. I kept them too long, trying my best to enjoy at least 1 of the set, or I'd have returned them sooner and gotten my money back. I\\"m sorry to say that's the last Firm dvd I'll buy. You've missed the mark. The age people you're tailoring this to don't have to work out on a regular basis. My age person does.

I'm disappointed and wanted you to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the high dollar tag","review":"I purchased The Firm- Express after spending a month doing Jillian Michael's Ripped in 30.(that dvd cost $9.99)I actually enjoyed Jillian much better and felt that I got a better workout. The Firm has too many choreographed moves coming at you too fast. Sure, it looks pretty but the average person can't keep up and get the moves correct to maximize the workout and prevent injury. I pulled something in my knees twice trying to copy their 90 mile an hour moves. A lot of the time, I had to just march in place. Since you only use each dvd once, you can't learn the move. And their diet info is very standard. This info is everywhere. The program would be better if it was less expensive, had fewer dvds that you could repeat and learn the routines, and the routines don't have to be this complicated! Jillian's dvd has 4 routines on one. Want to buy my copy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to Love it","review":"I have been an avid Firm believer for about 14 years now. I have almost every Firm workout that has been released on DVD and I workout with them regularly. I have to say that when I saw the informercial for the Firm Express I was excited and ordered. Once I received it, I was quickly disappointed. The workout doesn't flow well and the instructors switch moves before even telling you what they are doing. I felt very rushed, hurried, and often times lost, even though I am quite familiar with the moves. I felt that because they were trying to get so much out of a 20 minute workout form and function suffered. I would rather feel that I was getting a safe, effetive workout in 30 min., than a rushed and unsafe one in 20. Stick with the Tranfirmation Firm system it is much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good results in 20 minutes","review":"It's pretty motivating to work out when you only have to do it 20 minutes 3 times a week. I paired the Firm Express with weight watchers and lost 10 pounds in 3 months (now at my goal weight). I followed the recommended weekly workout plan and added the 10 minute kickstart workout 2/3 times during the week. After I finished the first month of workouts, I did the Flat Belly workout which is 4 days of 40-60 minute workouts. I definitely saw results with that. As mentioned by others, the moves can be a little tricky but it made me pay attention and work harder. I think I enjoyed the cardio workouts the most which is unusual for me. In the past, I've been a fan of the Firm sculpting workouts. My only complaint about this workout is that there are so many DVDs, seems like they could have put more than one workout on a DVD. I would recommend this workout to anyone who is crunched for time, I think it's worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what it promises","review":"I have been doing the firm workouts-as well as others- for over 20 years-needing to get rid of that last pesky ten, I eagerly bought this system. I doubled the workouts because the math just doesn't make sense to me( calories in calories out) and I worked out 5 days a week, really watched my diet, cut out all alcohol -and guess what-NOTHING!!!! its been two weeks and NOTHING. So for those who are looking for miracles, look else where. These are easy work outs for an experience exerciser and if I stopped at one I wouldn't feel worked out at all. Much as I love the Firm-and I do-I cannot recommend this system. Try Tracy Anderson for hard work and good results fast.

Ok I don't have much co-ordination, but I found even the first DVD in the series to be impossible to follow! I watched the DVD a few times before attempting it but I still couldn't keep up and I ended up doing 'half moves', which felt like they were having no effect. I also felt that I could easily pull or strain something. In the instructions they stress that form is very important, but you are not given any time to check it.Also, the way the program works is that you only do each DVD once in 30 days, which doesn't give you any chance to learn the routines.I'm going back to my other fitness DVDs"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a different workout","review":"I read these reviews before I purchased this kit, but I thought the other reviews were probably from people who weren't in good shape. Well, now, I know why these workouts are free on hulu and the infomercial isn't on TV anymore. They lack sufficient warm-up, provide very little form instruction which could easily lead to injury, and are just generally ill-conceived. I was very disappointed.

WordPerfect remains absolutely the best wordprocessor for serious document creation, and Quattro Pro is back to its old reliable self after the unfortunate detour through version 9. The new cross-tabs feature outdoes Excel's pivot tables and the new charting abilities are terrific. Presentations supports all sorts of new multi-media files and continues to be a very solid, underappreciated program.

In short, he adheres to the principles of good science and objectivity.The text and observations are rich and dense, with no fluff or emotive arguments.

It's logical that some relativity has to be involved in such a measure, anyone trying to do so will inevitably have to define a method, which in turn will definitely have to use subjective or indirect indicators. So, even if I'm not 100% convinced by his methods or in agreement with all his conclusions, I have to admit he has done a tremendous effort and a great job, Charles Murray deserves credit for this, and for making an otherwise coffe table book an excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corporate funded Eurocentrism.","review":"The author of the Bell Curve is at it again, this time with a thesis that misinterprets the data of world history very badly.

I could really relate to the poem \\"I Ran Alone\\", because of a past experience I've had over the summer and thats when the poem takes place.

Fay Hope Cusick has a way of captivating the reader with each word she delicately places on a page. Each poem is a perfectly captured moment brought to life like a pinting on a canvas. There are many poems that seem to be wriiten just for the reader. \\"Twinned Towers\\" is a marvelous description of the two sky scrapers that stood in the heart of New York City.

The dock isnt tight, and when you pull a 4g ipod out of the dock, it doesnt pause like it should. The knobs and buttons are cheap. GRRRRR.

A guy like Paul Westerberg doesn't need some multi-tracked wonder to be able to capture the spirit of his music, and with this collection of songs we are able to sit in the basement with an artist who has so much more heart/soul and spirit than any other person on this planet. The fact that this album sounds the way it does is because it's not pretending to be anything other than what it really is - an honest portrait of one of the finest songwriting talents there has ever been, playing a solo performance - just for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit and Miss","review":"Seems that Paul Westerberg needs about 3 years between releases to recharge his battery and have something focused to say. This one, unfortunately, is too soon for that to happen. It rambles and meanders through its 13 tracks. I like most people feel that Westerberg is not at his best when over produced, however there's difference between that and not produced (just another word for edited, really) at all. This suffers from self-indulgence and lack of artistic objectivity. Stereo/Mono was about a artist finding himself, this seems more about a artist playing with himself. I recommend everyone wait for the next release, by then enough time will have passed for another incredible release from Paul Westerberg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Self Hypnosis WORKS","review":"A wonderful book that could change your life . . .Self-hypnosis is subtle but very real.

I often got the impression that though this was supposed to be a \\"tell-all\\", Mr. Ammons was reluctant to diverge a lot of information he could have told.

He gets a lot of his info from Regina her publicist but his own first hand info is interesting.

Still I found the premise, that it's basically all the government's doing, a little tough to take. What about those entrepreneurs who succeed on their own, make it big, and yes, far outpace the average income in the U.S.? Is the gulf between rich and poor any wider now than, say, between Andrew Carnegie and the immigrant mill or factory worker? There's no doubt the rich enjoy special privilege, but it seems a bit simplistic to say that's the entire reason for inequality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting opinion - but not based on any facts","review":"Phillips does know something about marketing.

The over reaching always involved the monumental costs of waging wars. Phillips did not ask the question in this book, but I cannot help but wonder, \\"How large does the national debt have to be before the interest on it exceeds the amount taken in by taxes?\\".

It's too bad that 5 is the highest rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phillips delivers a potent wake-up call","review":"I found Phillips' analysis of financial market focus verses manufacturing and what it portends for US hegemony veryinteresting. Consider the number of industries that, thanks to NAFTA and the WTO, are increasingly being lost to China and Mexico. This type of economic policy is good for the top 1% club that will benefit by financing foreign industry. Once these industries are lost they won't be coming back in our lifetimes. How many articles of clothing or consumer electronic goods are manufactured in the US?Phillips also brings to light the extraordinary power wielded by the Federal Reserve and Alan Greenspan. How is it that someone who has never appeared on a ballot can wield so much powerin a democratic nation?Perhaps all the confusing statistics and abstruse pronouncementsfrom the Fed constitute a convenient farrago that shields elected officials from being voted out of office by the 99% of the population who haven't paid for their services."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reverse psychology only works on Democrats","review":"First of all, isn't it all so obvious that the 5 star reviews are all from the same person-DUH!The way that guy reviews this tome, you would swear he is reviewing War and Peace or some really outstandingwork.And notice how anytime someone tells the facts about Al Gore, how he (Gore) tried to steal that last election or Mr. Zipper and the \\"The Worst Family\\", that those reviews are inundated with unhelpful votes?

The only thing that I would add to your excellent review is that it is long past time to revamp the social security system. In it's present form it is an antiquated system at best that won't be around or won't be enough. It definitely needs to be privatized as other countries have done.

A one-star review begins: \\"I didn't buy this book, but browsed it at our local Borders, so perhaps I missed a few points.\\" Another reviewer worries about the influence of Carl (sic) Marx. Mr. Phillips is also subject to ad hominem attacks for being associated with Richard Nixon 30 years ago or for having written another book 12 years ago that some reviewers didn't like.

They neither attack Phillip's statistics nor his conclusions. They simply state that the Constitution does not guarantee wealth. Are these persons Americans? I would revise that term; instead, I would describe them as Social Darwinists.(A n apology to Mr. Darwin who never endorsed that philosophy.) American individualism is an important trait of the national character, yet civil-mindedness and social beneficience are also important values. Even if you are a member of the Right, pick up this book -- at the library if you are parsimonious as well as unsure as to its value. It is well-researched and his conclusions are based on hard data.

We need well-paid workers who come up with innovative ways to do things, not third rate mutual fund managers who dominate the economic landscape. When the Dutch and British went through \\"financialization\\" they stopped creating new products and let their versions of Wall Street take over, as Phillips rightly points out.

He shows a Trinitarian approach to healing by looking at the Sovereignty of God, the Atonement and healing anointings.Dye is very practical and devotes a chapter to health and hygiene and challenges Christians to not only pray for the sick but to show compassion by looking after them.This is the best book that I have read on the subject of healing.Get it and be blessed and encouraged to minister to the sick and hurting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cosmetic","review":"These plugs push into and cover the screw heads of Blum screw in leveling legs.

By just reading it, the main character Prospero is very ambiguous, as to whether he is benevolent or malevolent. It probably takes a good actor to interpret him just right, to capture the audience's emotions.

Most of the concerts they're more vigorous. Most of the time, the concert was predictable. Even with the best audio equipment, this great track selection - focusing Californication hits - didn't make me feel inside of the crown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"There is only one reason why I do not rate this DVD with 5 stars: I really like \\"Could Have Lied\\" and \\"Soul to Squeeze\\" and they are not in the DVD.

It's just difficult for me, because the Red Hot Chili Peppers are on of my favorite bands... Unfortunately, this one pales in comparison, not due to the performance (which is excellent) but due to the song selection. The oldest songs they play (if you don't count a Ramones cover) are songs from \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik.\\" Where's \\"Fire?\\" Where's \\"Me and My Friends?\\" These and others are Chili Peppers classics, and should be included in place of mediocre at best current songs like \\"Don't Forget Me,\\" and \\"Venice Queen.\\" The other strange thing about this DVD is the lack of upbeat songs. They opened with \\"By the Way,\\" for Christ's sake. I'll end this review by saying that despite the mediocre at best set list, the show is captivating, and incredibly well played. It's excellent by the standard of live DVD's in general, but not great by the standard of RHCP DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought this disc and I want to die with it in my hands...","review":"I am not a huge chili peppers fan- I own every chili peppers album except the first three albums that were released in the 1980's. I hate most music from the 1980's- including the red hot chili peppers music which was released in the 80's.Although I own all of the good albums, I would never go to a live chili peppers show. I do not enjoy the atmosphere of a live show. I saw the Foo Fighters live, and they rocked and rolled with authority, but some a------ behind me at the concert kept blowing his smoke in my direction. I hate concerts because I have never enjoyed myself at live shows......But this DVD is amazing. The chilies rule. The audio is superb- you get a choice of stereo, 5.1 DD or DTS! The video is also anamorphically enhanced for 16:9 displays- this means you get to watch the show in 480P if you have the equipment.

Use these on all four of our cars and cuts down oil change times by quite a bit. Any Honda owner knows they hide the filter to make sure you donate blood while attempting to remove it. With the piece on the end, just ratchet it off! Never a leak. Always runs for a full year, usually 6-8000 miles before change out. Combine it with superior synthetic oil, no problems.

Ever since I switched to K&N, my used oil seems less dirty when I drain it and having the 1\\" nut welded to the top of the filter makes changing it a breeze. If you own a car with a hard to reach filter, that nut alone will make it worth every penny of the filter's cost. I have a Toyota Camry where I can barely even get my hand back to the filter through the tiny opening, let alone get enough leverage to loosen it by hand or use a conventional filter wrench.

This record proves that it doesn't take much to make these tracks always enjoyable.Yet how could they not be? These are all-star lists of session musicians and radical concepts. \\"Montara\\" creeps along at a sensual pace, \\"Shades of Slim\\" retains its fluid, funky vibe in the forty years since it was released, and \\"Mystic Brew\\" (a track that is sampled to death, for good reason), sounds better than ever before.Good call on Blue Note to allow Madlib into the vaults.

Even my 9 year old son continues to listen to it at bed time. It is a calm and cheerful reading. Each character's voice is permeated with texture and feeling. So, much so that i wish it were still in print, so that i could get it for so many friends who have young children, and so that i could give each of my children thier own copy.

Not only is POOH to be found in the person of Mr. Dennis, but also Eeyore, Piglet, Owl, Christopher Robin, and on and on and on. It must be very crowded in his person, to be sure, but it is also as warm as you would expect the books of A.A. Milne to be.Alas, if you do not live close enough to Mr. Dennis so that he can introduce you \\"in person\\" to the company of Christopher Robin and friends, you're still in luck.

And also incomprehensible (which it probably was--I was mostly drunk and completely angry at the time). So, I am trying again to help any potential buyers. Be warned: this cd is NOT an ELP cd in any sense of the word. Sure, it features recognizable snippets (mostly the same ones over and over and over again) and the occasional sampled Greg Lake vocal and some talking by Aaron Copland (I think), but in truth it's nothing more than a bunch of sampled clubtrippy mixes that lead nowhere and sent this listener to flinging the item in question out my car window as I crossed the Rio Grande River Gorge.

Barely recognizable \\"samples\\" thrown together into this mess -- I can't believe that Greg Lake or Carl Palmer would have anything to do with this. In fact, I can't believe that Keith Emerson would put his name on this disaster as a producer. If this is ELP's attempt to find an audience with the club scene, it's a miserable failure.

It took all the anxiety I had about biblical submission away... And shows husbands how to be servant-leaders, just like Christ. Books now days either show you how to manipulate or tell you to loose yourself for the sake of marriage and I wanted neither. This book is a refreshing look at each roll in marriage...the way God designed them to be, so that we can have biblically based marriages.

Has a child who is very hurt about the divorce and somehow wants her dad to hook up with another girl. this doesn't happen in real life! Furthermore it isn't even enjoyable - who enjoys watching a guy and several girls get hurt over and over and feel lost and get pregnant. Apart from that if the premise is based strictly on emotional love then why do you write in the story about a girl crying about her dad and mom one moment and then as if it doesn't matter at all. I am a guy - so this review may have salt on it - however my girlfriend and I watched it and she said at the end 'i can't find one morsel of good from that movie'"},{"rating":"1","title":"A SORRY EXCUSE FOR A ROMANTIC COMEDY","review":"In a movie that tries to pose as a warm father and daughter tale:a) We learn that the girl's mother slept with the father's best friend as well as with one of his other girlfriends, the latter also happens to be having an affair with a guy in his sixties (Kevin Kline in one of his most indifferent performances ever).b) The girl learns, among other things, about threesomes & several applications of the word \\"sleuth\\", with the backdrop of the Clinton campaign and administration, complete with detailed Geniffer Flowers and Monica Lewinsky's references.If this is your idea of warm & fuzzy, don't miss this DVD.

I saw this a little bit after it came to DVD. I really have to say this movie is horrible. HORRIBLE! Ryan Reynolds is like a total playboy and doesn't know what he wants like 3/4 through the movie.

To have a child that young talk that explicitly is just wrong. I say shame on Universal Studios and Abigail's parents for encouraging her to be in PG-13 movies and to be the reason for the rating. If I had known that the frank dialogue on the rating was from a child no older than mine, I would not have rented it and will get my money back from movie gallery. I think they should have to say frank dialogue from underage child. I was also suprised to only find one other review in the 15 to 20 I looked at that mentioned how much it bothered them. It was so unacceptable and not needed, It could have been a good movie without all of that sexual dialogue and promiscuity in the plot. I could not finish the movie and will no longer spend my money for Universal Studios or Abigail Breslin's family to use to make more trashy movies.

The evolvement of the characters through the years is done very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise","review":"This movie seemed like it could have possibilities but I wasn't highly enthusiastic, especially since I don't like Ryan Reynolds much. However, the story has a cute premise and keeps you on the edge wanting to know what's going to happen even though, as some have pointed out, it moves a bit slowly at times. Of course if you don't like the whole Bill Clinton era, you might not like this film as the 1992 campaign and some subsequent events play a big part in the setting. I definitely wouldn't say this is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and I wouldn't put it in the same league as Love, Actually, but it has a similar feel in some ways, and it's worth watching in its own right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe skip this one?","review":"Definitely, Maybe is a fairly inoffensive rom/com starring Ryan Reynolds, Abigail Breslin, Isla Fischer, Elizabeth Banks, Rachel Weisz, and Kevin Kline. Will Hayes (Reynolds) is getting a divorce. His daughter, Maya (Breslin), begs him to tell her how he and her mother met. After some persuasion, Will complies, telling the story of his love affairs with three different women. (The catch is that Maya must guess which one turned out to be her mother.)Performances were all fine, though I did feel that the on-screen relationship (and the dailogue) between Reynolds and Breslin left much to be desired. The best parts of the movie were the dramatizations of Will's past. The film slowed down every time we stepped back into the present, at least until the very end of the film.The only performer who really shined in this film was Fischer. No wonder the girl's a rising star.Not a must-see."},{"rating":"1","title":"That Football was Spiked!","review":"Terrible sequel is by far the worst of the series till part 4 arrived. A Canadian teen named Alex is failing school and having trouble on the football team and then Mary Lou comes back to Hamilton High and then makes Alex popular and then he buries the dead bodies in the football field.

How could anyone give this movie five stars. It was the worst movie ever made. How could they take the prom night franchise and turn it into some lame horror movie. It's ridiculous. The plot was dumb and pointless and the one-liners absolutely not funny. The movie was a disgusting mix of sex and violence, that tried to hard to be funny and failed. this is definitely the most pointless movie and the worstsequel ever. DUMB! just plain dumb!

Following a night of passion with the ghost and finding himself in a \\"compromising\\" situation (lacking his clothes), Alex is caught in a web of murder, thanks to his new squeeze the ghost of Mary Lou. The actress that portrays Mary Lou is very talented but she dosent capture the flavor of the character. This movie starts a downhill slide for the series turning it into a 2hr. hack-n-slash fest. Take my advice and consider prom night 2 first, that is if you havent seen it. this movie is best described as a comedy with it's guts ripped out and exposed."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money!","review":"A cd has to be really great or really bad to make me write a review. In this case it's the latter. It's hard to imagine how someone could take such a selection of talented artists and produce such a crappy cd. The audio quality is some of the worst I've ever heard. On most of the songs,the lead guitar is lost under the booming muddy bass. It's like listening to a recording of a garage band on AM radio. If the artists on this cd,ever heard this cd,they would be embarassed.There are no liner notes. Never heard of this label,never want to again.

Her family - her father, her brother and her seemingly difficult sister. No one is there to help her - they all seem incapable of helping themselves.Words such as 'lyrical', 'poignant' and 'critical acclaim' have been used to describe this book, all I can say on this is let that be your warning.

They improve the feel of the screen, but I haven't noticed that they improve visibility...on the other hand they don't seem to degrade it either.In my case they have not damaged the screen in any way, they remove very cleanly so you can use a new sheet.They take practice to apply, and each of us will figure out our own technique. It's important to clean the screen first, and do the application in a lint free environment like a bathroom as opposed to your computer desk.Don't panic when you see some bubbles after the application, they will go away by themselves in a few days...but you really should try to get most of them eliminated during the application process if possible.I'm very satisfied with the product, all things considered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"Blurs images slightly, actually reduces handwriting recognition (more recognition mistakes-less tolerant), and the \\"Fellows\\" label on the overlay actually covers part of the toolbar.

I still tried but, it is very difficult. I would reccommend going to the compaq website and going under ipaq accessories. They sell them there for 16 dollars with screen protectors without adhesive.

He is very telling on the scandalously unfair way the riflemen were treated and he speaks with what seems to be a voice from the trenches. Even when he is wrong, and he can be so wrong he seems mad at times, he can be forgiven because these may the opinions of the riflemen of that time. Unfortunately no-one edited this book and it is marred by a remarkable amount of repetition. There's a lot of chapters and in each one the same stories, the same complaints, appear again, sometimes twice. In the end it is almost impossible to bear to start the next chapter. A nice man, but you had better be very interested in the GIs of the 34th Division because this is a very hard read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it today","review":"This is a wonderful collection of poems and paintings with some history thrown in for good measure.

Each book has a one-page overview that puts it in perspective. Every third verse (or so) has a side note that explains the verse or it's historical context, or both. Additionally, there are three very good study plans depending on how much time you want to invest in your studies, each with checkboxes to track your progress. All in all, it is everything a casual, beginner student would want.However, if you're serious about understanding the Bible in either a historical or a theological context and you're willing to invest significant time and effort into it, then this study Bible will probably not quench your thirst and you should look for a more serious guide. I'm often left wondering about passages and am sometimes unsatisfied by the short notes on the sides of the pages. Still, I have to say this is a very good resource, all things considered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful tool","review":"I have purchased this Bible for all three of my teenage daughters. I remember how hard it was at their age to understand a lot of the historical and cultural contexts. This Bible has, in its margins, most of the questions that one would ask.

Sometimes, when I am preparing a Sunday School class, I will refer to their Bibles to see what they say on a issue.

More melodic, occasionally slower with a more epic/folk metal sound than its brutal predecessor, the outstanding Forever Endeavor. This new approach, falling somewhere between melodic death, thrash, and folk metal (though still dominated by the death and thrash) is great! As melodic death tends to vary in style from dominated by death metal to having strong power metal tendencies (read: overuse of synthesizers and all things cheese), I've always appreciated those album that shy away from the power metal. I can handle it in small doses, and occasionally an album will come along that is strong enough to overcome the cheese, but for the most part it's a turn off. And that's what's so attractive about Enforsaken. No power metal, here! These guys are clearly strong musicians, and uncompromising in their own vision without a desire to make their music more palatable and catchy.

Fortunately, that aspect only comes to play on a few areas on this album, the rest of the music focuses on playing nu-melodic death metal with some thrash elements thrown in for good measure (\\"Halo Ruin\\" being the prime example of this with its familiar thick chugging). The marriage of thrash and death these days is a risky one, and most bands end up sounding the same. Enforsaken ends up with a face without identity, but you definitely could do worse.

And as for you ever so insightful observation, and I quote \\"Mark Wahlberg performed it in Boogie Nights as a mockery\\". I don't think you're right. The producers of the film wanted to include what helped to define the 80's. Whether you like it or not, the Transformers are a big part of that.

But if they don't make you nauseous, I can guarantee you'll be laughing. In particular, listen to The Touch by Stan Bush. What was this guy thinking? I bet he's pretty ashamed of himself today if he's still alive. The song's also funny because Mark Wahlberg performed it in Boogie Nights as a mockery.

The music is mostly hard rock and heavy metal, with some nice instrumental pieces to round it out. (For a sample of the instrumentals and \\"Dare to be Stupid\\", MIDI files can be found at my page at http://www.mindspring.com/~cerebros) Stan Bush fans will also want to listen to the \\"Sailor Moon\\" soundtrack CD, as it contains \\"She's Got The Power,\\" a song about Sailor Moon that Stan performs.

I used to collect the toys back in the '80's, I've seen almost all the episodes of the TV series, and now I am searching the Net in order to locate the Limited Edition double album \\"Till All Are One\\", at first only available at BotCon '97, the annual fan convention. Wish me luck, people! Anyway, the music included on this CD are incredibly terrific, the two Stan Bush songs are really fantastic, the three Vince Dicola score tunes are very moving and soothing at times. The '80's rock ballads from now-unknown bands are all right as well, my favorite being Lion's Theme song from the beginning and the end. However, Weird Al's \\"Dare To Be Stupid\\" is a little, well, I should say, silly for this soundtrack. Anyway, I would recommended this album heavily, it's just what the TransFans ordered!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD/Soundtrack ever","review":"This may very well be the best CD/Sountrack you'll ever buy.

Well, mine is \\"The Touch.\\" I miss the Transformers like no other but with this cd I can relive the memories. And with Weird Al on it how can you go wrong? Anyone who wants to discuss anything TF related can get in touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Soundtrack","review":"I saw Transformers the Movie when I was a kid, and the music was one of the first impressions that stuck on me by the end. In fact, I'm listening to it right now as I write this. I know the songs are done by nobodys, but they are good, solid songs with very good lyrics.They are also all in the movie, not like some current movie soundtracks. I especially like Vince DiCola's instrumental work, with is sad that there is less of his music on it. I heard that on botcon.com there is a 2 CD set with previously unreleased music from the movie.I hope you'll enjoy it as much this soundtrack as much as I have.Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairly Good Soundtrack Album","review":"Sure it's a soundtrack from a cartoon movie but it's a great cartoon movie.

Really.Stan Bush was/is certainly better than most pop musicians of his type, but still grates - his powerful voice is let down by some embarrassingly naive lyrics. The metal tracks by B-list bands are cheesy beyond belief, reminiscent of several pastiches. The music highlights have to be Vince DiCola'a storming instrumentals, with incredible bass-lines. Only they save the album from being just another bog-standard cartoon Movie CD.If you love/enjoy the film, get it. Otherwise, you won't really care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for kids","review":"When I was a kid, I loved this soundtrack. It was the coolest thing I heard. But I grew up. I \\"matured\\" from this album. No, this isn't your \\"Barney\\"-type album. This is heavy metal - by a bunch of no-names. Oh sure, \\"Weird Al\\" is on here, and ya gotta dig him, but he can't save this album with \\"Dare To Be Stupid\\". While the music worked perfectly for the movie, none of it is exactly \\"good\\". The best stuff on this soundtrack is by Vince DiCola. Everything else is your stereotypical 80's fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectre General Is KICK-AXE","review":"If you love these Spectre General songs, Hunger & Nothings Gonna Stand in Our Way, you must hear the KICK-AXE Vices and Welcome to the Club CD's.

I would recommend it to all Rosenberg case buffs for its portrait of Ethel's family relationships and background... Greenglass comes off as one strange and unlikeable guy...I do have a couple of criticisms of the book. For a NY Times editor, Sam Roberts, the author doesn't write all that well. Some of his sentences are confusing with pronouns that refer back to previous sentences, only the reader doesn't know to which person previously mentioned. There are a also number of passages which seem to me to contain confusing non-sequitors... reading The Brother is a bit like coming in in the middle of a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"This is one of the most brilliant works of non-fiction I have ever read. The trial and execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg has always been a sensitive and controversial subject for Americans. Although many authors have written books on the subject, only one has been able to talk to the chief witness who testified against the Rosenbergs and sent them to the electric chair for espionage, Ethel's brother, David Greenglass. Sam Roberts did some excellent research and has found a bounty of never before told information about the case and the family. Every chapter is more exciting than the one before it. Excellent job Sam"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Was disappointed","review":"I enjoyed the previous two books about Sea City and thought I would like this one but turned out it wasnt what i thought.

He had no business there unless his buddies were going. Also I don't think boys should be baby-sitters. I'm not prejudiced, I just know that things get out of hand when theres a boy baby-sitter.

The discussions about Voodoo are detailed, professional, informative, scholarly, and very non-biased. The history is quite in depth so don't buy this book if you are looking for a light hearted explanation of teh subject.

I would classify the author's effort as \\"well formed stool\\" to steal a phrase from \\"Mountains Beyond Mountains\\" which, I think, expounds on the subject of B.S.

It is worth reading. Critically speaking, however, much of the connotation and denotation of the word analyzed within this book is lost within the philosophical logic. The word under consideration is used often in the American West, but all of the rugged ranch humor associated with that word is lost within a philosophical dissection of the word's etymology. That said, the logically twisted arguments presented in this book create a paradoxical gift for the reader.

It is really no more than a glorified lecture from an established philosopher who, it would seem, has become big enough to pull a con job on his readers. In the end, Frankfurt takes all this time to reach the conclusion that BS is different from lying, in my opinion hardly worth the paper it's printed on. All in all, an inconsequential and not very entertaining analytical exercise by an emeritus academic with too much time on his hands.

The main conclusion of the book is that people BS because they want to impress others and thereby magnify their stature both publicly and privately. This is neither new information resulting from novel argumentation nor even well analysed in the text. By the way the book is 67 pages long with double spacing throughout, and only the size of pocket diary. I give this information to help quantify the BS it contains. Having read it, I concluded that it was a complete waste of my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK< here's the BS conundrum...","review":"Yes, this is a worthy topic to explore.

Frankfurt attempts to analyze what BS is, and more importantly, how it is fundamentally similar to and different from a lie.As philosophy goes, its pretty easy reading. The analysis is easy to follow, and I tend to agree with many of his conclusions: among them, that we accept BS more readily (and with better humor) than a lie; that someone spreading BS is more concerned with him/herself than the truth, and that the production of BS is stimulated whenever a person speaks beyond their knowledge.Its a short, interesting read, and somewhat humorous (in a dry sort of way). Of its greatest importance, though, is that it will get you thinking about BS - who is giving it, who is taking it, and why. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting on many levels","review":"This \\"Essay in Book's Clothing\\" can be appreciated on three levels.1 - At the surface, it's a pedantic description of the subject. What is bull****? What isn't? Why? How does it differ from lying?2 - At a secondary level, one might interpret the whole essay as bull****ing on bull****. I suspect this was not intended as the purpose of the essay, but it is an interpretation.3 - If you take it seriously, the essay is an attack on cultural reletavism - the idea that truth is not objective. The author attacks bull****ters not because they lie, but that they have a complete disregard for the truth. At least liars respect the truth enough to be false. The bull**** artist does not care one way or the other.It's a bit wordy in getting the point across (strange for a 67 page book!) but still worth reading. It won't take long to understand it - honest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Bull","review":"This is a masterpiece on what is something so inherent to our nature that it almost hurts to see it exposed. The correctness of Professor Frankfurt's philosophical analysis on a subject that we tend to find trivial spins off in wonderfully clever, humorous and life changing messages that I gobbled up in 70 minutes! Once you start reading it is impossible to put the book down or you lose the constantly changing nuances in his train of thought. And he leaves the best to the very last sentence... Bravo! It has opened my appetite to find more analysis on the application of his philosophy.

I read it about 20 years ago when I was actively working to defuse ethnic tension -- of which there was a lot -- at a major university. Normally, talking about different cultures' senses of time is a way to get people really mad, but Hall's non-judgmental approach was a great way to get people on both sides of the ethnic divide to better understand what was going on. Unfortunately, intellectual understanding is not the same as being able to move between M-time and P-time (the two basic approaches Hall found). I had minority students who understood the need to adapt to the university's M-time, but who ran into major internal and community barriers. And, when I (from the majority culture) tried to move into P-time, I couldn't do it, even though it clearly was more efficient in those instances.

However, with this CD there was a foray on a couple of tracks using the voice of Hui Cheng and this does not sit well with myself or most old-time fans of OC. So if you can skip like tracks 1, 4 and 9 on this CD you get good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skecher shoes win again!","review":"Hi,I think that these shoes are great especially if you cannot tie your shoes.

Norman Jewison was on the TCM documentary of Steve McQueen, seemed like a nice guy with some fascinating stories, and I thought it would be interesting to read about his career and all the celebrities he has worked with.I thumbed through the book, reading bits and pieces. On the back cover was a praising review from Gore Vidal - Strike 1. Below that was a praising review from Cher - Strike 2. Inside was a picture of Jewison with Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas - Strike 3. Not to mention the book states John Wayne supposedly called Jewison a \\"pinko Canadian.\\" Also not to mention a few other things I found offensive. I put the book back on the shelf, kept looking and wound up buying \\"Capote,\\" about the life of Truman Capote. He was a Southerner, a writer, hob-nobbed with the rich and famous, and on the back book cover it said he had a feud with Gore Vidal. Home run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discursive, Not Step-by-Step, but Good Reference","review":"This book is for advanced programmers only. If you're a beginner or at intermediate level with FileMaker, most of the screen shots will be too small and the techniques too advanced. But advanced users will love the four appendices: Additional Resources, Calculation Function Reference, Script Step Reference, and Documenting FileMaker Pro Systems. The book is worth buying just for the appendices!Numerous advanced techniques are discussed, but not in a step-by-step fashion. The files on the included CD are rudimentary but helpful. Examples include constructing a \\"self-join\\" file, implementing dynamic report columns, extracting values from checkbox fields, highlighting portal rows, and constructing a \\"back button.\\" There is a good discussion of relational database theory and how to use the new Relationships Graph.This book is a must-have for all advanced FileMaker 7 developers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Filemaker 7 Book","review":"I sat in Barnes & Noble and compared \\"the Bible\\", this book and three others. This one by far had the best examples that really illustrate how intricate features work, and usually more than just one example. I am very experienced with Filemaker and find this book to be an excellent reference. It does have the first couple of chapters for newbies, which I skipped.Only downside is that it is heavy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, for hard-core developers too.","review":"Whatever part of the brain deals with the logic of handling information is quite a bit larger in Scott Love than most people. I consider myself a middling to advanced developer of Filemaker applications and Scott's book just blew me away! He introduced concepts to me that I had not even considered and did so with clear and detailed explanation and examples.There is just too much to praise about this book in a review. It's not a lot of money so if you are stuck on Filemaker, feel it's the solution for you but can't seem to move ahead, BUY THIS BOOK! You will be happy. And, no I am not Scott Love's publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Using Filemaker 7","review":"Initially, I found the book a good manual with concise description. However, for the high price of the book, I expected not only a manual but also a set of templates that could be used in the real world. I found the samples a big disappointment both in preparation and design. I would expect from the top notch experts that I would end up with a valuable coherent Filemaker template system that I would be able to use at the end. (For example, a inventory, invoice and shipment tracking that has relational, lookups and multiple files). Instead these guys were jumping from militia to pet store samples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book for the real world","review":"This book is fine if you want a very complex application, but it does not touch on real world examples. It try's to teach how you to do data modeling but falls short on useful information, the book would be better if they got rid of the first 1100 pages and just published the script and functions references. If you need a book on Filemaker 7, buy the Filemaker Pro 7 bible instead. A much better series. In summary: If you are new to filemaker this book will only confuse you it will not teach you any thing useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"kizuna","review":"i heard from the interset and say that is very good and wonderful story of love.. i want to buy one and read it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth purchasing","review":"I only liked one song on this album and that was the first track called What YOu Gave Away (alias Remix)and it is the only godd one on othe whole album.

It is dry, disorganized, and has nothing to offer a Christian's daily life. The ONLY thing most of its readers can remember about it is the nit-picking distinction between Jehovah's \\"purpose\\" and Jehovah's \\"plan,\\" which gets far too much play.

This will, inevitably, create a washed out picture that cannot be recovered with Photoshop. The only thing moderately useful in this package is the flexi-tripod.

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unenjoyable","review":"Hell's Angels 69 is essentially a stereotypical caper movie in which a couple of protagonists try to pull off a heist but things go seriously wrong. Only in this case the main mistake they make is upsetting members of the Hells Angels. Using real bikers, this film had great potential, but it fails on all counts.Hell's Angels TRIES to be a deeply serious film, but unlike artistically good caper films (e.g. The Asphalt Jungle or The Killing) all the characters are one-dimensional and absolutely nobody is in the least bit likeable, nor are any insights provided. And because it tries so hard to be serious and weighty, the film commits the even worse crime of being no fun at all. It doesn't even work as an unintentional comedy. In other words, Hell's Angels 69 is nothing more than a dreary, pretentious, existentialist film about the dangers of greed and hubris. NOT a good adventure film or biker flick. Get Wild Angels (which manages to be both fun and dramatic) instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie with VERY DISAPPOINTING Ending","review":"My husband and I really enjoyed the movie until the last 10 minutes or so.

First of all the rumble that rocked Las Vegas never ocurred in this film which did lack action. Still it was well made and it features many original members of the hells angels Oakland chapter.

Satans Sadists is probably the best biker flick I've seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but not great.............","review":"The Angels did better acting than the actors! They did their own Moto-X stunts,because they fell in the desert a few times and stuntmen would'nt have fallen.I think if the main characters would have stuck to DIRECTING/producing only and not acting/directing/producing, it would have been a lot better made.

Those in the know will be aware that John has had serious health issues of recent times (including having part of a leg amputated) but the tone of this album is extreemly healthy. I admit that I'm a huge John Martyn fan, but I hadn't expected the album to so quickly invade my subconscious. John Martyn's music does that, it takes you to an ethereal place where lyrics and meoldy fuse in a way that is difficult to describe. My only disappointment is that there are only 10 tracks but then again, quality is always better than quantity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Martyn Magyc","review":"John Martyn's music glows with a vitality that has remained undimmed through the years and which sets him apart from his eminently worthy musical peer group. Even when reprising his early work, which he does here with the song 'Go Down Easy', he has something new to say. 'On The Cobbles' is proof positive of his enduring magic.

It breaks the stereotype that all overweight people are out of control and lazy. It shows how food just like any other substance can be abused in the quest to avoid dealing with emotional problems. My only complaint is how the author gets a little too Freudian in my opinion. Some of the chapters dealing with Oedopus complex are way off the mark and are a throwback to old school psychology.

I put the thing in the garage to avoid the smell. I realized that my hands smelled. I had to wash my hands thoroughly with soap to get rid of the smell.

It's portable size and almost free price were the selling points for me. It's easy to get different angles but just so you know, it doesn't wrap around objects. It also has a little clip on the side so you can clip it to the outside of your pocket. That's a good thing because I wouldn't want to put it inside my pocket because this thing SMELLS TERRIBLE. I'm not kidding. You had to be wondering why you can buy these things for $1.35. Now you know. It smells like a combination of 'new car smell', gasoline, and tar. This thing must be toxic.

It showcases Tenacious D's backstage rituals and antics; great for all of the diehard fans.

I beg to differ. Beethoven was no duffer. As many contemporaries noted, he strode out to the countryside at a brisk pace. And, I believe, once he got there, Beethoven did not seek to depict repose or bucolic bumptiousness or even metaphysical thanksgiving. Karajan -- sounding better than ever in this remastering -- seems to be telling us that Beethoven was alive to the shimmering, pulsating, unified vitality of nature. It's been written that Karajan did not like the Sixth Symphony. I have found no statement anywhere to that effect by this nature-loving conductor himself, and certainly no evidence of it in this glorious recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars are not enough!","review":"These performances have been in my music library since I first received the vinyl Beethoven Edition package for Christmas in 1970.

Even the ballads are absolutely amazing, especially \\"Where Is The Love\\" from Inside Out and \\"How Long\\" from Tough Love. These two albums are amazingly well produced by Billy Baumgart! Top notch performance from Mark Amb on songs like \\"One For The Money\\" and \\"We've Lost Ground\\" The song I love the most is probably the awesome and iommensely powerful \\"Who Cries For Me\\", this song is an excellent song, with a hard hitting message that should make some people think about their actions! Altogether, this CD combines two flaming on fire records that can not ever be possibly dissed!

A real waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"An incomplete guide.","review":"Touring the California Wine Country is not a comprehensive guide, partly due to the fact that it tries to cover too vast an area. It does provide good listings of Wineries in all eleven wine regions, along with places to dine there. However, the author did not include lodgings for the areas. Maps are provided, but they are not particularly detailed, and the overall format of the book is not innovative or extraordinarily user friendly. I would not suggest purchasing this book unless you purchase it in conjunction with at least two other guide books. There are quite a few good ones out there that are easier to reference quickly, but still provide history, logistics, and inspiration for touring wine country."},{"rating":"2","title":"great winery tour book","review":"Maybe the title is too broad - this book is not a comprehensive guide to vacationing in the Wine country. It is a great resource for casual wine enthusiasts.

I was surprised to see that Ms. Rosewall was not closer to my age (63) as she enjoyed so many of the places that I did, which unfortunately are no longer there. One of the reviewers compared it to Lake Woebegon, but to me, there is no such similarity. I still feel the same way about the lake when we visit.

The author states on page three that \\"English writers have responded to three influences on our language.Two are historical and one cultural.\\" The two historical influences are quickly dealt with, but the cultural influence is never clearly presented. I read the chapter at least four times, but couldn't find what he was talking about. Perhaps it was edited out of this edition. A very frustrating beginning to the book. Perhaps, the author would be kind enough to tell this reader what is the cultural influence he spoke of, and on what page(s)?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Instead of buying this","review":"I think a faster way to get the most important lessons from this book is to go straight to the source--that is, (download or buy) then read George Orwell's essay \\"Politics and the English Language.\\"By accident or on purpose, Williams has done in 200 plus what Orwell did in 20 or less.If you don't like Orwell's English bias (especially towards interminable Dickensonian sentences), a bias shared by Prof. WIlliams, then after reading Orwell, take the pleasant stroll of reading anything and all of Twain, Melville, and Hemingway. But, out of all things to read about writing well, I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you write, buy this book.","review":"It's a shame that this excellent book is not better known. I stumbled upon it after I had learned, the hard way, many of the \\"secrets\\" of good writing that Williams lays out for you here. What he does, unlike all the other advice-givers, is explain and show how to make your writing easy to understand and a pleasure to read. His own writing is crystal clear, and he provides examples that he fully analyzes to show, without fuzziness, why he claims that one approach is better than another. If you *really* want to improve your writing, buy this book and work your way through it. By the end, your writing will be better than that of 99% of your classmates or co-workers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have for Academic Writers","review":"For students, scholars, or everyday writers, this is a must-have book. This is a great book for learning how to hone your writing skills to get thoughts on the paper in a way that is still understandable to the reader. He goes over how to effectively construct sentences, link those sentences into paragraphs, and then shape those units so that they are concise, elegant, and coherent. Williams provides multiple examples of what good and bad writing looks like and the keys on how to transform bad writing into good writing.The best part of the book is the connection that Williams makes between thinking and writing. Bad writing often masks incomplete thinking, so this book is also a guide indirectly of how to read more effectively and deeply. For any student who wants to take their writing to the next level and beyond the strong Strunk and White foundational grammar, this is a book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for to improve my writing","review":"I want my writing to be clear, cohesive, coherent, concise and elegant.

I did not get a return response as promised ... instead, they just canceled the subscription without telling me, no notice, no apology. What a sham!! The bad taste in my mouth lingers.

It's so completely feminine (I am a dude by the way) in a way that dudes can enjoy but not relate to - and sort of explains the actions of some of the fringy girls on the playground when I was growing up.

We have had these since my daughter was 2 and she has never expressed fear about them or anything like that. In my opinion, they are not scary.

That was the only thing that was a little frustrating.But when you see if when it's finished, it comes out real nice.A plus for this model is the display stand, although I wasn't sure to glue the Interceptor onto it so I didn't, as well as 2 support pieces if you don't want to use the display stand.This is my 2nd model that I glued together myself, and my first to paint.Rather fun to build these kinds of models I should say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimmy Swaggart 1984 edition Bible","review":"Everything was handle3d very well and the bible received in great shape.

Because most other books about dendrology in the Southeast are so outdated, this is definitely the best resource available for any botanist, forester, or anyone else who would like a greater appreciation of our most fascinating natural resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mole Music","review":"David McPhail writes some amazing books. This is one of his lesser known books but my first graders really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Power of Music","review":"One of my day care students brought \\"Mole Music\\" to class for show and tell and I fell in love with it. It's a story told through pictures and words (start looking at the pictures even before the title page!) about the influence our music has on the lives of others - whether we are aware of it or not. A wonderful book to share with any lover of music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, inspiring, charming book.","review":"This is one of the most delightful books about music (and life) for children that we have ever enjoyed. Mole unwittingly changes the world with his gift of music...and McPhail's gift of secret tongue-in-cheek illustrations provides reasons to re-read this book forever (did you find what happened to the TV?!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet book shows shy kids confidence","review":"Gentle book, tells shy kids that they can influence the world in a positive way just by being themselves. Also helps kids losing the energy on a chosen instrument."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kobayashi Maru vs. Gen Order 1","review":"In \\"Prime Directive,\\" the Stevens' create a near-perfect scenario in which Kirk and the others are tested with regard to how far Starfleet ought to take its most sacred General Order.The book weaves its way through the plot effortlessly, and deals with the issues raised by the Prime Directive in the clear, albeit Chris Columbus-bashing light of the enlightened revisionist history of the late 20th Century. Although the ending is a little too easy for me (and for Kirk and co.), the novel is a very strong, moving, and well-worked read, and I recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prime Directive: The Audio Version","review":"In the world of Star Trek the term Prime Directive refers to the principle of non-interference. This means that ships of Starfleet are prohibited from interfering with the normal development of the worlds they encounter. In Star Trek: Prime Directive, Captain Kirk is accused of violating the Prime Directive and is subsequently relieved of command. However, an investigation is conducted (with the astute Mr. Spock as one of the investigators) and yields some interesting results--and a strange, new alien life form.The audio version of this book is an abridgement and contains music and sound effects. It is fitting that James Doohan narrates the story as many of the events are told from the perspective of Montgomery Scott. I have not read the book, but I did listen to the audio version twice and got more out of the story the second time I heard it. In short, Star Trek: Prime Directive is a very good story to listen to in your home or car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kirk No Longer a Hero?","review":"In a time where the people of a planet are affected by a decision Kirk makes to save the Enterprise when the people of that planet jeopardize her safety, Kirk and the Enterprise Six (includes all but Scotty) are put on trial for breaking the Prime Directive. It is a great book and a great story. I would suggest this for any TOS fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best","review":"This is the best Star Trek novel I ever read. The best Sci-fi novel. It's one of the best BOOKS I ever read!The storytelling is superb, absolutely moving. The Reeves-Stevens have outdone themselves again this time. It does not get any better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"kind of disappointing.","review":"From the moment I picked up this book at a second-hand store, I couldn't wait to read it. The premise was so captivating, plus I love the Reeves-Stevens' books. However, the more I got into it, the less I liked it. While I enjoyed the idea of Kirk as a fugitive, the thing with the uncontacted planet was boring. The ending and the discovery of the true culprit was quite unbelievable. Alos, the rescue of the Enterprise and the reunion of the crew was very corny and a little too unrealistic. I also hated Kirk's love interest, the woman form Who Mourns from Adonis,she really got on my nerves! If you want a good novel from these authors read Federation and leave this one in the book bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so much?","review":"First, I haven't read it yet, so this is not a \\"review.\\" I only rated it because the website won't let you post any comments without filling in all the blanks.I came to Amazon specifically to download this book for my iPad and was stunned to see the ebook version costs $8.99, while the paperback costs $7.45 and the hardback is an unbelievable $1.65.

I'll go search the other download sites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Sams At Once","review":"I know this one has been out of print for a while, and it is customary to review newer things or at least things that can be located without a search, but I couldn't stand to see such a fine book supported only by a one star review. This is the only novel where Sam Leaps into two people at once, identical twins. His psyche is split in half, and we get two different versions of Sam: the side that is dedicated to solving the Leap and continuing on to help more people, and the darker more selfish side that is tired of jumping around and wants to settle down and satisfy his own desires. Their two lives unfold and they finally confront each other at the end. I had to leave off the fifth star because this one doesn't reach the emotional depth of several others in the series, the ending is good but not very touching (unlike Angels Unaware, which is perhaps the best in the series)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking.","review":"The title says it all. The publisher gambled double or nothing and lost. Hernderson's portrayal of the time tripping Sam Beckett was very sub-par. The story was bland with very little relation to the television series what so ever. I give it two thumbs down, only because I am limited to only two thumbs.

The style is mostly compared with Nick Cave, But it is even better. Smooth, ever-repeating bluesy sounds appear with a warm story-telling voice. Like a lonesome cowboy in a bar in a corrupted and dark city. Like no one to love is no one to hate. Latif Gardez understands. One of the most interesting parts of Mystery Slang's music is that Latif Gardez speaks about harsh feelings, like 'you been set on by a cooler girl, your knees shake so hard they could play Danny Boy, your hands trembling over a jar at noon......Both Mystery Slang CD's (River Towns and Venus Groove) are one of my most personal albums. I've got two of each of them...just for sure in my safe...Critical as I am, I would give it a 9.5 on a scale from 1 to 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"just for the basics","review":"If you have ever washed a car before, this book is not for you.

It came as a disappointment to find that I couldn't get into it at all. I persevered with it for a while but became so bored that I couldn't focus on it anymore. I put it down and never picked it up again.I thought it was a shame that such a great idea was rendered in such a uninteresting manner. However, it appears that I am in the minority in thinking this. Perhaps it would have made a difference had I ever seen the stage show?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Jerry Springer then you will love this book","review":"On the basis that there is a grain of truth to every myth this author applied that truism to a well-known fictional character. In doing so he went perhaps a bit too far. Everything that was enchanting about Oz became perverse. Characters took on opposite personalities, and became guilty of every petty motive or moral debauchery possible. The author seems to have exploited every sleazy device to tell this story; rape, adultery, murder, manipulative personalities, animal cruelty, social snobbery, political machinations, and on and on. The story went on forever and became more and more depressing.This story, like others by Maguire, is dense with interweaving plots, too many characters and events, some of which are never fully explained so the significance to the story is questionable. The result is convoluted, sluggish and self-absorbed. I don't recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea -- terrible execution","review":"The author needs a better editor to cull down this pointlessly long novel. It is a shame because the essential ideas are great. You get answers to the questions like the origin of the flying monkeys, and why the witch has a green face. But the imaginative bits are swallowed whole by the uninspired dialogue and the uber-pretentious \\"theme\\" of evil. Apparently unloved people are seen by others as evil, but they are not really evil. hogwash.

When I saw the negative reviews for the novel, I thought that the readers were being unfair. However, they were truly correct. Gregory Maguire's only decent contribution to the world of literature was allowing us to perceive the Wicked Witch of the West in a different light. Everything else he wrote was a mish-mash of dense and boring musings. His interest in the nature of evil was the only thing guiding the book, and he did not even end up doing a good job at exploring the subject. He seemed more preoccupied with inserting extraneous sexual content that was relatively meaningless, which brings further questions about the nature of his psyche more than the nature of evil. Was this a treatise on evil, a bad romance novel, or a boring stab at an interesting concept? I still cannot resurrect a reply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked Warning!","review":"I cannot understand the good reviews for this book. Apparently, fans of the \\"Oz\\" books like it.

I'm a 31 yr old woman, and an avid reader of many genres and I couldn't stand this book. It was nothing like I'd expected. I could tell that from the start of it, but I really liked the idea behind the book and wanted to like the book. It was just awful... depressing, predictable, humorless, monotone, and lacked imagination. It dragged on for most of the story, and it was really hard to pick out what was important to the story because so much of it was just basically meaningless chatter. The story didn't flow well. The book only did so well because of it's association w/ Oz, but don't read it for that reason because it's nothing like the books or the movie, and it wouldn't even stand well on it's own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never takes flight","review":"I wanted to like this book. I kept waiting for something ground breaking and deep. All of the ideas presented here are not new, although they are presented in a different context than normal.

I read it to the end in the hopes that it would suddenly take a turn for the better. I was disappointed to the last word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Pleased","review":"I was purchasing this book for a Christmas gift.

The book Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell(AMAZING BOOK, must read) which is, at 1006 pages, almost exactly two and a half times longer then this book, which is 406 pages.

I forced myself to do it.BTW, I have read the original series of Oz books by Baum - and I'm not picking on this book because it is different - it is just poorly executed.The general concept is still great - can a real author step up to the plate and get the job done?

After that, I realized my attention span was waning. The characters are so hard to keep straight and the story seemed to drone on forever. Despite my waning interest, I really wanted to finish the book before I saw the Broadway show. Alas, it didn't happen. I realize that life wasn't over and that I enjoyed the play without having finished the book.The idea is phenomenal. How creative. The execution and the actual story, however, is one I could not get into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked is Torture For Its Readers","review":"This is an awful book.It starts out interestingly enough, explaining the origin of the Wicked Wich, green skin and all, but then gets mired in a ridiculous and unbelievable plot about religion versus naturalism and the rights of talking animals. In the process, Maguire goes off on pointless tangents about bestiality, class consciousness and consipracy theorists.When you finish it, you'll be singing \\"Ding, dong, the book is done!\\" It's an overly long exercise in nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever","review":"We chose this for book club thinking it would be a good choice for Halloween month.

Maquire weaves his tale in and out of the goody-two-shoes sweetness of the 1939 Oz movie, injecting it with acid, cleverness and wit. If you're not prepared for the denizens of Oz to procreate, have conflicting opinions, fight with each other and generally act in a more \\"realistic\\" manner, Wicked may put you off. Enjoy the Baum books instead. I found it compelling. A solid read, well thought out."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not your basic yellow brick road...","review":"I love the Wizard of Oz and everything about it - for many, many years. Imagine my excitement when I read the premise for this book - how clever and what fun !!But alas, when we enter the City of Emeralds Fiyero and Elphaba get to the, pardon me, root of the situation. What a bummer. Why did we have a great plot, imaginative characters, and then ruin it with obligatory sex? This ain't Peyton Place - please ....Why couln't this book have been as decent and true as the original Wizard? Leave the sex stuff to book of that genre. The Fiyero and Elphaba scene ruined the book for me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rated \\"R\\" book","review":"I am an avid reader, and have read many, many books. I purchased this book to read because I love the music and the play. I did not read this book because it held my attention (because it did not do so- ), But rather, I read it because I was curious to know the biographies and backgrounds of the characters mentioned in the musical. It did provide me with the information I desired, but I had to sift through a lot of \\"sludge\\" to get it. This book should be rated \\"R\\". It's descriptive talk of the various sex scenes is disgusting. It details sexual positions, orgasms, lust, cheating, adultery, and other steamy subjects. Though the book as a whole is not like that, there are several chapters that are just written pornography. I don't recommend this book to anyone; especially minors. But, even as a 22 year-old single male, I will never read this book again, nor will I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME- TERRIBLE BOOK","review":"This book is horrible, from just a few pages in you start to get a glimpse of the meaninglessness of the plot.

The plot of this book, in addition, seemed disconnected and random. It was hard to get into the story, hard to care about the people involved, and at times just had an uncomfortable feel to the setting.At best, this is a unique study of good and evil in fiction. However, unless you're an English student studying feminis literature or fiction archetypes, this book has little to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, Vulgar","review":"Considering my first introduction to WICKED was the music, I eagerly looked forward to the book.

I have not seen the musical, granted, but I can only imagine what it must be like. Not only was I deeply offended by the beginning of the book and its explicit details of her mother's promiscuity, I was bored. I couldn't finish it because of that. For only the second time in my life, I felt tired after reading. I am so glad I did not buy the sequel to this book at the same time that I bought this one. If I could give it negative starts, I would. I am so thankful my mother never read this book when I bought it for her for Christmas last year."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time and Money!","review":"I read to page 200 when I realized I was only still reading because I had spent $12 on the book--not exactly the best of reasons! I had been wanting to read the book for a long time and expected GREAT things because of all of the hype. I was severely disappointed. The plot was non-existent, jumping around, getting me partially interested and then halting, only to continue on somewhere else. All of the characters were extremely unlikeable and unbelievable. The Land of Oz was a wasteland, holding nothing magical or even somewhat representative of the land from the original. Instead, I found a book full of political rantings, which I could care less about, and pages filled with cheap, tawdry sex scenes. Maguire couldn't find an interesting plot, so instead decided to take a cheap shot and expand on his characters' sex lives. I had originally planned on reading Maguire's other novels, but now I know to not to waste my time or money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked Hard to Get Through","review":"I read this book years ago when it was first published.

In addition, I had enjoyed an entertaining talk given by the author at a local Arts and Letters program. I was very disappointed. I had to push myself to finish it.

Unfortunately, although he ostensibly chose to set his tale within the land of Oz imagined by L. Frank Baum, Maguire soon jettisons this well-known world of childhood in favor of his own postmodern interpretation. The result is an Oz of relational angst, animal activism, political intrigue, alcohol abuse, murder and explicit sex, with more than a little autobiography mixed in for good measure. The result is a story that unspools like a broken film from a projector.This is the rarest of books: a story where the musical adaptation is far superior to the source material. Don't bother with the book if you can see the Broadway production instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely Disappointed!","review":"This book had so much potential and fell way, way, way short of my expectations. A few parts were readable - but overall the book was poorly written and not worth reading, unfortunately I bought this book and another book by the same author at the same time and WASTED my money. Not entertaining. Crude and vulagar at times. Sadly I had to force myself to finish the book - the only book I've started and not finished was the Book of Mormon - this was almost the second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boring at Times but Thought Provoking","review":"This book had a tendency to drag on at times. But with that one flaw overlooked this was a fascinating read about evil. Other reviewers have summerized the plot much more vividly than I will be able to do so. It is a moving thought provoking story that I have found myself thinking about repeatedly at odd moments.It is worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked little critter","review":"The book provides the \\"origin story\\" of the Wicked Witch of the West (you know, the one from Oz). Be advised that, while it is a \\"prequel\\" to The Wizard of Oz, it is not for children. There are many discussions about religion and politics, so it probably wouldn't be of interest to kids. Oh, and there is sex, too. Anyway, it is an interesting re-imagining of the land of Oz. Adult Oz fans should give it a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful--WARNING: THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR CHILDREN","review":"This is a wonderful book for so many reasons: great story and writing, interesting look at the nature of evil, etc. (see other reviews). That said, this book contains some graphic sexuality and other complexities that are just not for children. The play is O.K. for kids, the book really isn't. All parents are different about this sort of thing, but seriously, if your kid is younger than 15 or 16 read it, and decide for yourself. (You only need to read the first hundred pages to know.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wizard of Oz - all grown up!","review":"If you loved the Oz books and movies as a child, you will love this book as an adult. Discover the underlying motives, fears, desires, prejudices and politics of the inhabitants of the Land of Oz as seen through the eyes of Elphaba, better known as the Wicked Witch of the West. This is definitely not a book for children as portions are quite suggestive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touch Of Genius!","review":"This remarkably clever tale never fails to amuse as it smacks of modern life troubles mixed in the Frank Baum fantasy world of Oz. Who would have thought that the Wicked Witch of the West was born disabled and disfigured to lousy parents, causing her to inevitably become evil? What's a child to do if born green, ugly and overly sensitive to water? Let's not forget the alcoholic and self-loathing parents of this child.This fantasy follows the life of Elphaba as she grows and learns about discrimination and hatred only to have her sister witch killed in a freak accident (enter Dorothy and her house). Frank Baum's Oz books are just the starting point for Maguire's twisted tale with modern overtones. It includes all the original Baum characters and gives them another dimension; one that Baum could only have had nightmares about! It's a masterpiece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Woman!","review":"This character has always fascinated me and in this book she was brought to life. She was given a history and we can see why she was how she was. It also brought to mind the question \\"What is evil?\\" We were led to believe she was evil by viewing the movie from the perspective of Dorothy. Here we can see the perspective of the Witch. We meet characters from the movie, and delve into their lives as well. We explore the politics of OZ and their religious beliefs. The author holds true to events from the movie and adds to them as well. Truly, I LOVED this book and I highly recommend it for anyone who has an interest in OZ. I was sad to see it end."},{"rating":"2","title":"welcome back to oz","review":"i read the other reviews & i see everyone mention the movie -hello? this was a continuing series of books picked up by other authors after l frank baum died some good some bad -this one is GOOD- even if you only know the movie or have not read all of the other books this stands alone & is marvelous -added on to the other oz books it is still marvelous & a welcome continuation"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story.... But Slow Read","review":"I really enjoyed Wicked. The plot was very detailed and the characters were extremely well developed. Two downsides -- the book was a fairly slow read -- due to the complex language used, I really needed to slow down and closely pay attention to every word. Also, my eleven year old is a HUGE Wicked fan (we saw the performance, she is familiar with the story, etc.) & due some VERY suggestive elements in the story, I had to hide the book from her.I would still recommend Wicked to adults & mature older teens who want to learn about the lives of the witches that governed Oz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wickedly awesome","review":"I have never been a huge book reader. Ever since I was young, books have never really capture my interest. After taking a job that gave some time to think, I decided to start reading again. Wicked first captured my interest in a Barns and Nobles. The first couple of chapters are pretty unexcited...but PLEASE keep reading, it gets MUCH better. This book has it all. Politics, religion, points that make you laugh and points that make you cry. If you like stepping foot into the main character and realizing that things aren't always what they seem...then this IS the book for you. You find out the the Wicked Witch really isn't all that Wicked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As much as I'm in love with the musical (and I know the musical was only loosely based on this book), I was severely disappointed. Not only was the story not what I expected, but I felt very detached from the characters the whole time. I didn't really care what happened to any of them by the end. It also felt like the author went through and used a thesaurus for a lot of the book just to use random (seemingly sophisticated?) vocabulary. It took me (a fast reader with lots of time on my hands due to a part-time job) several weeks to get through this book because I kept falling asleep. I wanted so much more out of this book that I just didn't get."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Side of Oz","review":"I've read this book a few times in the couple of years it has been since I bought it, but I always enjoy it. I always feel like I catch something different, or see a parallel to the classic Wizard of Oz. Because the original book was political, it's interesting how heavily Maguire stays with that political theme. You're going to find you are a little disappointed Dorothy ever shows up in Oz by the time you're done reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked","review":"Just a very dark and disturbing book. I tried and tried to get into it and forced myself to read but just couldn't get into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made People Talk","review":"I assume that I came into this book with preconceived notions as to what it would be about. I had the 1930s movie in mind and braced myself for a pleasant look into the life of the Wicked Witch of the West.That isn't what I got. I was surprised as I'm sure many readers were at the raw, deep, and sometimes disturbing tone of this book.I applaud the author for taking on this story. He made people talk. Even now, years later, people are still talking about this title. He took a risk, he went out on a limb, and he succeeded in creating a book that people are intrigued with. Whether the reaction of the reader is good or bad, people are talking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguingly beautiful!","review":"I found it surprising how interesting this book was, even knowing the story of the Wizard of Oz, I could not put this book down! Completely worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gift from My Students","review":"My Senior English Students gave me the book as an amusing comment on my personality as an English teacher. (That particular class and I had a fantastic rapport. So, I assigned the book to the class.Extremely well written, full of wonderful vocabulary, plenty of literary devices, delightful variation of sentence structure, and, oh my, the character building! Not only did I cherish the opportunity to teach a classic in the making, I valued the multitudinous openings to talk to my class about the effects of bullying.The gift from my students turned out to be an all-around gift to my student. I highly recommend this book to all English Literature teachers.Thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Me","review":"I found the sexual references in this book a little too descriptive in this book so I stopped reading it... I think this might be a book just for adults (i'm teen)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Run Toto! Run!","review":"This book reminds me of a guy I knew in college. An \\"angry intellectural loner\\" type who carried around a copy of \\"The Communist Manifesto\\" and had only a passing acquaintance with personal hygiene. He usually kept to himself but once in a while someone would feel sorry for him and invite him to a party. He generally managed to alienate everyone around him by twisting everything they said into something negative, by his attempts to impress them with his intellectual superiority, and by pointing out how shallow and bourgois they all are. By the end of the party, this guy was always alone with his angst and his vodka. This book was like the literary version of that guy. Angry, dreary, and humorless."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF TIME","review":"I read this book because everyone was raving about the play. honestly, the best possible description is: great idea but TERRIBLE product. see the show, don't waste your time reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked: The Disjointed, Long Winded Saga of the Wicked Witch","review":"I was very excited to receive my copy of \\"Wicked...\\" in the mail. But, once I started reading, I became quickly disappointed. I am an unsually speedy reader and found myself dragging through this extremely cumbersome text. The story is interesting, but it is bogged down with too many details and disjointed ramblings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked good!","review":"This was a great book! I read it before I saw the play. I loved them both even though they were different in many ways they still most of the same characters and both were brilliantly told. I'm hoping this book gets made into TV series so people can see just how great it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new meaning to Oz.","review":"I think this book is prabably the best I have ever read. If you read the Oz books like I do, you will love this book, there are no words describing how good this book is. I am wishing Gregory Maguire would write another one, and if you are reading this Mr. Maguire, I would love if you wrote another one. Trust me you will love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story marred only by the ending.","review":"Despite what other reviewers have written and what the blurb on the back of the book says, I never thought this story had anything to do with determining the nature of \\"evil.\\" Basically, it's just an extraordinarily beautiful, rich and detailed retelling of the Oz story from a different point of view. I was terribly disappointed with the ending, however, Elphaba loses all her idealism, courage and spirit after her lover is killed. She wastes away to a shadow and all that is left by the end of the book is her guilt, sadness and denial. Elphaba is such a strong, interesting and innovative character full of intelligence, justice, action and fury, it just doesn't make sense to me that she would lose all this and then retreat first to a convent for seven years and then to the outlands of the Vinkus before acceding to her own death. On the other hand, Frank Baum decreed the ending of this book 98 years ago so perhaps there was nothing more Gregory Maguire could do."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read with rich language and imagery.","review":"If you enjoy books such as Grendel or Good Omens:The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter then you should greatly enjoy this rich tale from the perspective of Aelphaba, Wicked Witch of the West. The tale takes you through a an examination of how those mosters we have been told to revile got to where they were. It also requires a closer examination of what we consider evil and good and how we make those judgements. Definitely a book for those who want to think but love a good story with rich langauge and imagery"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this book","review":"I wanted to like this book, I really did. It wanted to be profound & thought-provoking as reflected by the silly & pretentious \\"study\\" questions provided at the back of the book. It ended up being a series of false starts, silly, indecipherable symbolism with an aimless plot.I kept asking myself, \\"when is this book going to take off?\\" & all it did was taxi. Though amusing at times, generally it was a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad and beautiful","review":"This is an incredible book. I had no expectations when I picked it up, but I'm so glad I did. It gives a whole new perspective behind the mind of the Wicked Witch that made me love her. Imaginative and detailed, this book is not for everyone. There are many who may not understand the beauty in the writing. That being said, I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good old fashioned dark fairytale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long winded, plodding. Blegh.","review":"Short review here: This is the second book I've read by this author (the other book being 'Lost'), who I'm starting to suspect is long winded and boring at parties. Interesting ideas, believable political maneuverings in Oz, but moves wayyyyyyy toooo slowwwww for a story with a known ending. Started skimming about 3/4 through, and it was STILL too plodding. Beg, borrow, or steal it. Don't add it to your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked? It will change your mind...","review":"Ever since I was a child(and I am 61 now), we gathered around the tv to watch 'The Wizard of OZ' at its once-a-year showing. It was wonderful! I purchased the vhs tape...then the dvd. How could I have been so taken in by Hollywood? Dear Elphaba,\\"...I am too green to walk into a public place and do something bad. It's all too expected.\\" ARE we born wicked? ? hmmmmm."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT worth all the hype","review":"I bought this book in hopes of reading a fun, unique fantasy story to transport me away from reality. However, I soon found myself in a long political rant that barely had ANYTHING to do with the original Wizard of Oz. The book iself it written very well, which is why I gave it two stars, but so much of it was flat out boring. It is very long and as time went on I felt as though I was really dragging myself through. Not to mention there is not much that actually involves Dorothy and the rest of the group associated with the Wizard of Oz. I also found the \\"murder\\" scene with the water shockingly anti-climactic. There were some clever things and ideas, but this was so filled with politics and other boring stuff that it left me greatly disappoiinted."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for adults, but not for kids","review":"This book was amazing!! I've never seen the play but I got really into the music and decided to buy the book. It has a few questionable parts/random lines but over all it's an excellent book and a great buy! I highly recomend the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This book is pretty bad. The plot is uninteresting and the author changes the events from the Wizard of Oz in order to make his characters work. Unfortunately, they don't work. Worst of all, the author removes the \\"magic\\" from Oz, literally. Don't waste your time reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost didn't finish it","review":"The book is wordy and weird, the author starts subplots/story lines but doesn't fulfill them in a satisfying way, and she tries to say something about religion and politics but gives a confused message.I finished it, becaue I like to finish what I start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked awful","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. There are so many reviews stating how amazing the book is. I did not find that to be true. It is fairly boring. The idea is great; it just wasn't presented well. It reminds me of the series LOST in that it adds these odd crazy things along the way for no reason whatsoever. Thing that do not belong in the plot, are never explained, and never come up later. Also, the characters are not developed very well, not even the main one, the Wicked Witch of the West. At the end of the book, I still felt as though I didn't know her very well. The ending also felt rushed and abrupt. On a side not, the musical was great! Skip the book, go to the theatre!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How could such a great show come from such a horrible book?","review":"I like a lot of people thought that it would be good to read the book after seeing the broadway show - huge mistake. What a piece of crap. I loved the show, but I think the greatest thing about it is that it only took a few names from the book and none of the story. It is sad to me that Maguire gets to be associated in any way with the show. Do not read this, it is not entertaining and I don't know how the show even became based on it. Give the broadway writers credit in taking one of the worst books and changing it into one the greatest shows I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baum Would Bomb This","review":"This book's premise and opening three sections are undeniably interesting. The Wicked Witch's childhood and foray into college were engrossing to read about. The rest of the book became a thinly-veiled retelling of Hitler's rise to power in Germany and a lecture about how power corrupts and how evil it is to infringe upon the rights of others. Unfortunately, the main character is largely devoid of personality, and Maguire doesn't have the ability to lure the reader into the fantasy of Oz.This book is a critic's darling, but I don't think it would win the People's Choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish it was better","review":"Several friends strongly recommended I read this book, certain I'd be crazy about it. I'm not. While the plot shows a lot of originality and craftmanship, and the themes are rich, Maguire doesn't have much insight into these characters or wisdom about these themes. It is a plot-driven novel, all of the characters are flat. In other words, Maguire plotted a course from point A to point B, connected the dots, and no character changes along the way. I didn't stop once to ponder what this artist was saying about life. I spent no time apart from the book, processing the knowledge that is being imparted. It's entertaining, but for me, what makes a novel worth the hours spent reading it is a unique insight into the ways of the world. This book is bone dry in that regard, and leaves you hungry for a Nobel prize candidate or winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"I wish I could get the person who said they were going to throw their book away to mail it to me! I am a high school librarian. Several of my teacher friends and I have had the best time reading this jewel and comparing our notes. We laugh, and believe it or not, compare what is done or said in the book to current culture. We are planning a road trip to NY right after school is out to see the musical. I think possibly those who can't appreciate it are not creative thinkers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Read if you liked the land of Oz!","review":"If you have read the Oz books and not just seen the movie, this book will be a severe disappointment. At no point is he true to the concept of Oz as written by L. Frank Baum. While I was intrigued by the \\"alternative\\" viewpoint, I have been VERY disappointed in Wicked. I will not be buying any more books in this series. If he had to write this story, I would have preferred he created his own land rather than trying to milk the Oz franchise. On its own, the book would not have made any impact without the cheap and completely erroneous tie-in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Reading *Wicked* was an effort in futility :( Both the book and Elphaba's life in it. What a hopeless morass of anger, hatred and unforgiveness and self loathing.I kept hoping there was to be some redeeming quality, but it never lived up to any possibilities.I loved the idea that perhaps the Wicked Witch wasnt so wicked or had a reason for what she was doing. But in the end, all she did was for selfish reasons only.I want back the days I spent reading this waste of time book. And will never read another book by him again."},{"rating":"2","title":"...a wicked feast of language and allegory.","review":"So, you thought you knew the story of Oz.Maguire gives a whole new spin on the classic L. Frank Baum story. From the Wicked Witch of the West's childhood as an obvious outsider, to her school days which shape her ideals, to her time as a visionary, fighting for Animal rights. The story introduces you to Elphaba's one great love and her later years as an outcast. Maguire paints the picture of a woman torn by her passions and her ethics. It will leave you asking yourself to define just what is wicked?A gripping story that kept me flipping the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wickedly Missing in Depth","review":"The author had a pheonominal opportunity to do so much with this story, but never took advantage of it.The story focuses on the birth, life, and death of the Wicked Witch. The author does give her more of a three dimensional outlook instead of the cackling green monster in the Wizard of Oz. However, the story is very slow to start and then goes no where. Frequently, the story started to go in one direction and then the author abandoned it and started in a new direction. The witch's quest for the shoes was greatly down played, as was there significance. Moreover, the granduer of Oz was barely touched on.I was hugely disappointed in the book and had expected so much more considering there was so much more the author could have done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I saw \\"Wicked\\" on Broadway and borrowed my roommate's paperback just to see how much better it would be compared to the musical. Unfortunately, I wasn't that impressed. Maguire's style of writing dragged on and needed to pick up the pace on some parts of the story. I loved the adult themes of sex, racism, and discrimination but it could've been written better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning - a good but ADULT book","review":"I have just barely started this book - and I'm already hooked. However, I wanted to post a comment that I think is important for potential buyers: THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S BOOK. In today's age of Harry Potter, lots of parents are looking for more ways to engage their middle school-age kids with additional fantasy reading. Looking at the reviews of this book, it would be easy to think that this is simply an imaginative retelling of the original tale - and you might assume it to be written for a similar age group. Absolutely not! Like I said, I am really hooked, and expect it to live up to its acclaim, but by page 15 I was already calling my Mom and warning her NOT to give it to her friend's 13-year-old as a gift - the sexual content is both explicit and mature, right off the bat. It serves the story well - but I would not want someone handing it over to an unsuspecting teenager of mine. So now that you've been warned - adults, enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down, except...","review":"A rich, colorful and imaginative version of the Wicked Witch we grew up with. I couldn't put it down. It's a Harry Potter for adults -- unfortunately for adults only because of an unnecessarily pornographic section involving sex between, well never mind. Aside from the bestiality, a great read right to the end, where the plot veers awkwardly to fit the story we know. Tear out the study questions at the back of the book. They are annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked","review":"I recently saw the play, Wicked, and decided to read the book. I purchased all 3 in the Wicked series. They came quickly and were in perfect condition. There is a lot more in the book than was in the play. If you like fantasy I recommend it. Can't wait to read the next 2 to see how it all plays out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Original","review":"This is simply one of the most original books I have ever read. Books are expensive in terms of time invested, so I try not to waste my time with countless \\"volume authors\\". Maguire most certainly does not fit into that category. He has put together something truly unique and original. Definitely worth the time spent reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book offers none of the magic and splendor of Baum's Oz!","review":"With all of the opportunity afforded by the wonderful world of Oz created by L. Frank Baum, how is it possible to write such a horrible and disappointing book about one of Oz's most interesting characters?? Of the countless new ideas that could have been imagined, or already known details that could have been embellished upon, about the fabulous Wicked Witch of the West, Wicked instead offers a dry as sawdust story of characters, places and chapters that flesh out no more than a skeleton and inspire about as much emotion from the reader. As a long time fan of Oz and reader of Baum's entire series on the magical land, I was ready to devour this story about the Wicked Witch of the West. I was sorely disappointed and can only hope the musical that everyone raves about is a completely different story. I really hated this book and recommend not wasting your time reading it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"muddle in the middle","review":"Thanks to Equipro for exposing this sham of a hyped-up novel. I am in the muddled up middle and ten pages past hoping that Maguire will fulfill the expectation of this reader for a thoughtful, worked out story. Contrast this to j k rowling's effort; never a loose thread or confused plot line in 7 books!!! Maguire I am leaving your quagmire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"Difficult to get into - difficult to believe someone would write an entire ook on this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"I wanted to know the full story behind the broadway musical ... I was sadly disappointed with the profanity and certain language usage... I was able to understand more of the \\"full story\\" behind the musical... but I didn't enjoy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was she really that Wicked under all that green?","review":"Wicked, by Gregory Maguire was an enchanting extention of The Wizard of Oz. It brought parts of the movie into view that would have otherwise been left hanging. Yet, on the other hand thier are twists and turns that were totally not expected. This book is definitly not for children. The wicked witch is not as wicked as one may have hoped or thought. I think this book would suit anyone who enjoys The Wizard of Oz, but would like to see it in more of an adult light. I will leave you with this.. Witches do have feeling and love in their heart after all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank goodness I borrowed this....","review":"Like others, I decided to read this book due to all the hype. However, I had thumbed throught it at the bookstore and wasn't fully convinced I would like it, so I borrowed it from a friend. Smart move.While the beginning of the book is somewhat engaging, when Maguire does the first leap of time (and not the last) from Elphaba's childhood to her being in a young lady's school, the plot starts to unravel. Macguire seems to think using sophisticated grammar along with sophisticated ideas constitutes character development. But, as with other readers, I hardly connected with any of the characters and with least of all the main character.I knew how the book would end, but I didn't realize how badly. It almost seemed as if Maguire was up against an editor's timeline and stayed up all night to finish the end. It's disjointed, disengaging and disappointing.Too bad, it was a plot that could of proved extremely interesting had the execution been right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tale of good and evil","review":"I know this has been reviewed so many times, but having just finished this, I wanted to say my piece before I forget. In a nutshell, I have mixed feelings about this book. It's great overall if not sometimes written in a confusing way and sometimes I was getting a little lost here and there. The Wicked Witch of the West was born as Elphaba and all her life had been ostracized by her parents and society. Her sister is the W.W of the East and her college roomate is Glinda. It's an entertaining story of her life. It's enthralling, magical, dark and amazing. I'd like to see it made into a movie. It would certainly not be for kids. I do like the story, but it's that sometimes confusing style of writing that didn't help make this the most enjoyable book ever. I think this is definately something you would have to read for yourself to get an opinion of it. Worth a read for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Information","review":"I realize that the author is trying to get the point across that Elphie's mother was not faithful, but way too much information about her love life. And I must say that I find that I liked Elphie more in the play. See, I thought she was a good girl who was hurt because she did good, then she turned evil. Then the author goes into description about her seing Fiyero every night for \\"classified business\\" The book REALLY DID NOT NEED THE SEXUAL CONTENT. I realize that things like that happen, but he really went into too much detail, I'm not even finished with the book yet!!!MOST DEFINATELY see the play and listen to the music. Don't read the book it is NOT WORTH IT. The play is SOOOO much better!!! I wish I had never bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"ok, well i have to admit that i've never read the book. but im going to buy it! my friend read it and said it was amazing. i actually saw the broadway, and i was blown away. it's incredible and i think everyone should see it! (i suggest reading the book after...musicals are always more fun when you dont know the plot OR the songs)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked","review":"I think this book is a must read for everyone. The only thing I did not like about it is how Dorothy does not enter the story until the end and only has a very small amout of interaction with the witch until she dies. I think this could have been developed more thouroughly, however I do reccomend the book to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it negative stars if I could","review":"Because a friend wanted me to talk about this book with her, I managed to finish it, but ONLY after throwing it at the wall in disgust three or four times. Don't get me wrong, it's brilliantly written. But it is preachy, holier-than-thou, and irritating on every page. I would have been delighted to learn that MGM had sued him. Instead a wonderful musical was made from the book, leaving most of the faults of the book on the page. Sometimes life just isn't fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time!","review":"I am a fiction and fantasy fan, but I did not like this book at all!

A creative and demanding endeavor this book must have been to write, and the author creates his fantasy world with much finesse. The only thing that truly disappointed me was one especially graphic \\"sex scene\\"- that I still cannot figure out its relevance whatsoever! Aside from this one misstep, I recommend it heartily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a favorite...","review":"I really didn't like this book; I couldn't even get into the book until about half way through it (if not longer). Although the ending was pretty philosophical and overall pretty good, I really didn't think it was worth of the monotonous reading to get there. I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I definately enjoyed reading this book, though it was slow to start. There were also some times throughout the book where it kind of dragged, but at other times, I couldn't put the book down. I liked looking at the story of The Wizard of OZ from a different perspective. I have passed this book on to friends and family, and plan on reading Son of a Witch soon. This was my first Gregory Maguire book, and I plan on reading some of his other books with a twist too.I strongly recommend this book to anyone want to know the \\"real\\" story behind the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Witch of the West","review":"So this is OZ... Very seldom do we get a chance to delve into worlds we explore in literature and movies in this manner. Most often we are left with only the original story and the fascinating theme dies there.Wicked allows us to take what we know about Oz and learn it's history, it's politics, how things work and what the beings there are like.The Wizard of Oz is a fine story and I know of no one that isn't familiar with it, and perhaps no one (I know I certainly never did) gave much thought to Oz itself, but Maguire has taken this concept and made it enticing. While the Wizard of Oz was about Dorothy, Wicked is more about Oz itself and secondarily about Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West.Maguire, delves into that mysterious notion that one is not wholly evil nor is one wholly good. He writes a mature story in an intelligent way.It's enriching and satisfying, and definitely worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have ever read!","review":"I threw the book in the trash when I was done with it. I saw the musical and wanted to know more behind the scenes. Believe me, the story of the musical was soooooooooo much better than this difficult to follow piece of dung. There were mysteries setup that were never resolved. You are left still wondering. It does people a disservice to put the musical's poster on the cover because the 2 stories could not be more apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a summer read","review":"I am reading this as a book club suggestion. While fantasy is not my usual genre, I am willing to read it for discussion purposes. I find it to be very \\"drawn out\\". For those who enjoy this genre it might be an enjoyable read; for me, I find it to be one that I must finish and will be glad to have accomplished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to finish this book...but I couldn't get into it.","review":"A friend recommended this book. They said it was funny. I got halfway through this book and kept waiting for the story to take a turn and take off. But each time I picked it up I felt like I was just trying to finish it, not really enjoying it. Finally a friend of mine asked why didn't I just start reading something else. So I did. I sold this at a used book store and picked up a few others. Granted I had just finished two amazing books that were full of suspense and I couldn't wait to pick them up again. With this book, halfway through it, I was still bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the soundtrack not the book","review":"First I have to say that Gregory Maguire has a beautiful command with the English language. Overall the thing I enjoyed most about this book was his use of words and bringing things to life with them. However that was the only thing I enjoyed about this book. If you are reading this because you love the musical or the original novels, be careful and know that this book has very little in common with either. In fact I felt that this book betrayed L. Frank Baum original characters and his fantasy world of OZ. I kept waiting and reading hoping I would love this book as I loved the musical, as I loved the original books, unfortunately I felt it was just an excuse to get out some religious and political ideas the author had probably been thinking about for years. It had such potential and fell short. If you like the idea of the story spend your money on the soundtrack of the musical by the same name. That is worth your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Classics don't always breed classics...","review":"I'm only on chapter 4 but I have to say, this is one of those cases when I think the musical (which I want to see but haven't BTW) has to be better than the story it is based off of.I mean, while the story is meant to be different, and I know elements of the OZ books are dark (I've read pretty much all of the real OZ series, which has much more depth than the movies) I just don't think Wicked stays true to the written 'authors tone' of OZ.If it was written in a more sort of 'talking to the reader' way I think I would be able to take it more seriously (I thought it was going to be written in 1st person when I bought it as well) but because it is so 'out there' and on top of it doesn't connect with the reader I think it falls flat many times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overated POS","review":"Ultimately goes nowhere. Characters where developed become vague. Supposedly questions the nature of evil. Mainly an exercise in marketing gimmickry. Total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politics, good and evil, fantasy, pulp fiction????","review":"Political satire, meditation on the nature of good and evil, fanatsy novel, pulp fiction? Intriguing concept, miserable execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't deserve even 1 star","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. As a fan of the original Oz books, I looked forward to a glimpse of what made the Witch wicked. This book was not only filled with hedonistic sex that had little to no point in the story line but also missed the story it was supposed to tell. The characters were so far off from the originals that I couldn't even recognize them. It had none of the magic of Baum's stories. I read the book to the end hoping to find something of interest or value, it just wasn't there. My teenagers enjoy fantasy novels (Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Chronicles of Narnia). This was dismal by comparison, throughly inappropriate for youth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment!","review":"I couldn't wait to read this book. I had heard so much about it and I'm a huge fan of the Wizard of Oz so I figured this was going to be my new favorite book. I have never been so disappointed (book-wise that is). There is not one single likable character and it was so boring. I still have about 50 pages to read and I don't even care if I ever finish it. I am really curious how this could be such a huge Broadway show - there's nothing enjoyable about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wickedly boring","review":"I had heard so much about this book and I was so eager to read it. 100 pages in, and I seriously began to question whether something was wrong with me. I was painfully disappointed with this book. It is slow and plodding.Some hail it as a masterpiece, but I kept waiting for the book to pick up and get better. It never did. Perhaps this book was too philosophical and political for me. I really didn't care about the plight of the sentient Animals. I read this book because I was expecting and entertaining read. I was very disappointed. No doubt all of you reading this review will say my review was not helpful. But like Elphaba, I dare to be different. This is my honest feeling and I will not conform. I am not ashamed of my green skin and make no excuses for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiler alert... it stinks!","review":"Ugh this book just made me feel dirty. I found it to be perverse and disturbing, and I'm not easily disturbed. Examples: Unless you are writing a medical book, there is never a good reason to describe in ANY detail a case of, er, loose bowels. Seriously?! Likening two mountains to a woman's open legs?? Sexy topography? Really?! On a more techincal note, I felt the story lacked depth. I just plain didn't care about any of the characters, and whether they lived or died, because the author didn't build that kind of sentiment. The story itself just wasn't very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fairy tale based on the Wizard of Oz","review":"This book has absolutely nothing to do with Wicca or witchcraft. It is the writers opinion of The Wizard of Oz. Very stupid, and out of date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked was a real downer.","review":"After obtaining tickets to see the stage show \\"Wicked\\" with my grandchildren, I ordered this book to learn how it related to the earlier OZ books. I forced myself to finish it, but have talked with other people who gave up on it. It is depressing with far too much angst; Dorothy doesn't appear until about page 375 and is hardly the brave little girl in the real Oz books. Fortunately, the story line in the stage show was changed and the characters fitted my expectation of characters from Oz. Save your money on this book and buy tickets to the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Doesn't stick with anything the original has. None of the whimsy. A little boring actually, with some decent parts but not many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing","review":"First of all, I am obsessed with the Broadway Production of Wicked. The story line is unbelievable not to mention the songs. The book was the influence on the play, and I felt like they only used the idea of the Wicked book, not the plot or characters. I was dissapointed in this book because it just wasn't a good story. But I stuck with it because I enjoyed reading the book that started it all and learning about Elpahba's life that the play skipped over. I would only recommend this book to people who adore the play like myself and are interested in seeing the sad truth of Elphaba's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked; the life and times of the wicked witch of the west","review":"I, an enthusiastic reader, found this novel to be both familiar and new to my mind. The classic tale written by L.F. Baum has been turned upside down in this new work of fiction. I once thought of the Wicked Witch of the West as a cold-blooded villian, however my views have since changed. This novel has opened my mind to many new views and ideas about the land of Oz and one green inhabitant.I highly recommend this novel to the mature, insightful reader. Some subject matter may not be appropriate for juvinile readers. This novel, though long, has much more to offer in terms of perceptivity than most books published today. I have not read a book that probed this much thought in a very long time.\\"Are people born wicked or is wickedness thrust upon them?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad...","review":"I loved the \\"idea\\" of this book, and after trudging through the beginning, was finally pulled along by some really clever writing...but man o man after \\"Shiz,\\" it was sluggish and I, unlike the reader who didn't want it to end, could not believe I was still turning pages and the damned thing wouldn't! The same story could have been written in half the words. And it could have been tighter. We still never understood who exactly Yackle was, whether Grommetik murdered the Goat, if Fiyero was still alive. And we were left in the cold with undeveloped characters like Nor and Liir and even Glinda. There were so many questions and allusions that kept me reading in hopes of some resolution, long after I was ready to call it quits. But they were never answered! In sum, this story was like a sieve, the good and the bad all mixed together but in the end falling through the holes like so much sand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish this Wicked Story Was Better","review":"What a great book this could have really been. It was slow in many parts and included a sex part toward the start that did not really need to be there. Didn't like the ending. Much more could have been explored with this book. Not sure if I'll read the Step-sisters. Would not encourage anyone under 15 to read because of the sexual tones and that age could even be raised."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cute idea, too Adult","review":"I picked up this book at Target, because I heard of all the craze about the musical. The book is very different. The storyline was good but distracted by extremely detailed sex scenes with Fyero and the Wicked Witch. I didn't think this went much with the story and got so graphic that I decided to return the book. I've talked with some other mothers who were considering reading this to their children, but decided to read it first. Too bad. If those scenes weren't in there, it'd get even more of an audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"After seeing the incredible production of \\"Wicked\\" (the musical) I purchased the book. The book is dark, disturbingly graphic and nothing like the musical. Frankly, I only got through the first chapter. Loved the musical, hated the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed!","review":"I was very disappointed with the book. I hadn't heard anything about it before I started reading it and was shocked at how explicit the material was. I expected it to be written like a classic novel and it was completely opposite. I actually quit reading halfway through the book. It didn't matter how the book ended...the way the characters were portrayed and the content of the book was so disappointing for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book was slightly disturbing but mostly boring - I must confess, I only got through about half of it before I decided to put myself out of my mysery and abandon it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasnt that impressed","review":"I really was not impressed with this book. The idea is wonderful and I like seeing the wicked witch in new light. SOme of the stuff that was added however was not needed. It would have been even better without it. I dont think the original author of the Oz stories would be impressed with what he turned his book into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy unabridged 17 cds too long should be shortened","review":"I'm only giving 2 stars because it waffles on way too long.I would give it a 4 and 1/2 star if abridged.The story line is brilliant and as a huge fan of the Wizard of Oz (seen video so many times because raising children) I don't mind the idea of Oz being filled with danger and evil characters. Hearing of Elphaba's birth, school years through to her becoming a witch was very interesting.I would give it a 4 and 1/2 star if abridged.The strange sexual themes could be removed. Story could easily be 5 cds long or even 8, more than that is just rampling. But what a brilliant concept just raved on too long. (Narrator excellent)"},{"rating":"1","title":"wickedly awful","review":"I tried several times to finish reading this book. It is simply awful. The characters don't make sense and the prose is just boring! A grave disapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richly imagined","review":"This fanciful novel by Gregory Maguire tells the life story of Elphaba, better known to most of us as the Wicked Witch of the West. I loved it. Baum only told us Dorothy's side of the story in The Wizard of Oz. In Maguire's novel, the reader becomes enmeshed in the politics, philosophy, and world order of Oz. The novel hotly debates the topic of evil through various conversations and plot lines, showing us that everyone has a reason for their actions and that people often simply misunderstand one another. In addition, it explores themes of isolation (Elphaba, with her green skin, is different from her friends/neighbors, a thing to be scoffed at or perhaps feared), commitment to a cause (and what sacrifices that may entail), and love. The characters are richly imagined, and unfortunately for Elphaba, we all know how the story ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The idea of a story about the Wicked Witch of the West was exciting, intriguing. I bought the book with anticipation of an original fantasy spinning from a familiar one. But from page one it seems this author needed a venue for his sexual appetite and has tortured this idea with his eroticism and cynicism. While I could have endured a satire (his themes were interesting), I was not interested in soft porn.His use of language is fantastic. The themes he introduces are definitely food for thought. If only he could have left the excessive innuendos and gratuitous sex scenes out, I think I would have really enjoyed this novel. As it is, I find myself slogging through because I never leave a book unfinished. If your curiousity compels you to read it, I recommend going to the library instead of wasting good money on it. Then, if you disagree with me, you can purchase it for your collection. It doesn't even begin to compare to Tolkein, BTW."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was intrigued by the concept of this book, being a Wizard of Oz fan. This book could've been written so much better. Throughout most of the book there's sexual content and at times it's disturbing. It ruined the book for me; who wants to think about the Wicked Witch of the West having sex? It takes the magic of the real story away. The book also drags out tediously. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly boring.........","review":"Raves to the promoters who so aptly hyped this snore-monger. THEY, anyway, did a great job. Had high expectations,- a broadway play, all that. I finished the book, waiting for a story to start. Would like to see someone with an imagination, and engaging writing style, do a story based on the idea. COULD be a fun read. Wanna sleep? This'll do the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the all time worst books","review":"I was so excited to read this book after learning about the premise. Once I started it, I was really disappointed. I could not finish this book. I was bored out of my mind! I finally flipped ahead to see if it got any better, but figured there were way too many excellent books out there to waste my time further with this piece of garbage. Believe me, I am being generous with the 1 star rating!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't That Cool","review":"I found bits of the story interesting & fun to read.. However, the politics & religion aspects of it, put me to sleep. By the end of the book, I wanted to jump for wasting my time w/it. In My Own Opinion; Maguire should have left the 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read a different book!","review":"I finally finished the book and I thought giving birth to my children was easier than reading this book. There are plenty of authors who create worlds, civilizations, and characters that are so much more vivid and compelling than the ones created in this book. Was it a comment on politics or religions or WHAT?When I started the book, I thought it was strange, but I kept trying to be open-minded. So I read about the animals, Animals, the Unnamed God, Lurlina, the Kumbric Witch, Tik Tok religion, the Wizard, the Grimmerie, and the shoes. You are probably asking, \\"What does all of that mean?\\". Guess what, I am asking the same question and I read the book! I was waiting for all of these pieces and many more to be explained. Sadly,they were not. It felt like I put together a puzzle only to find out that the last few pieces are missing. This book was a HUGE disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointing","review":"I was quite prepared to fall in love with this book, and predisposed to patiently follow the dense, somewhat emotionally detached prose in the hope that there would be some kind of epiphany, a moment when I would unlock the deeper meaning behind so much of the mystery in Wicked. It never came. I found this book to be much ado about nothing. I had the sense of sitting through an undergraduate philosophy seminar where 20-year-olds spin theories of about truth and ethics without understanding anything deeper about life or themselves. In the end, I knew Elphaba only slightly better than I did after the first 100 pages, and Glinda, the Wizard, Madam Morrible, and the host of other intriguing characters never really achieved any depth. I'll be seeing the musical in a few months and I have a feeling this is the very rare case when the derivative work will be more satisfying than the original literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked is not Wicked","review":"A overly descriptive story. The play was so much better! I love the play and to go from seeing that to reading the book was a disappointment. Just because you like the play doesn't mean you'll like the book. I read the entire thing waiting for it to get better and it never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont know what all the hubub was all about","review":"I bought this book since everyone is talking about and saying how good it was. It was terrible. The only thing that kept me reading was I thought it must all come together in the end so good to make up for the rest. I felt like entire sections of the story are missing -- it jumps, with no assist, from time to much later in time. People change and there is no lead up to what made the change or poof in half a sentence all was different. I did not find anything I could say would make this book worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to expectation","review":"I read the intro and thought this book had so many possiblities but did not live up to them. The story got dull and jumped around a lot.It started out good but was a let down from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have never been so happy to finish a book!","review":"I was very excited about the idea of a story from the witch's point of view. I liked the very beginning of the story up until the time she went to school. Then it was all down hill from there! It became a job for me to even finish this book. All the extra stuff thrown in there was what I didn't care for. The story it self, the story of Elphaba and how she suffered through her life. The dealing with her family was really interesting. But all the Animal VS animal stuff really what was that all for? Leave all that and the sex stuff out and you have a great story. I liked the ending of the book and was so very pleased that it was over and I never have to read it again. I wouldn't even think of starting the second book. I would not suggest this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get into","review":"The book was is a let down, because you are excepting one thing and getting another.The main problem I had with this book was the author didn't set up the chapters. The title said one thing and you end up reading about something complete different and for me this was the reason the book was so dry.It wasn't until the fiftieth chapter did I start getting into it and that because I was really trying. The author also jumps back and forth on topics that you can't keep up, it almost enough to make your head spin. The only to really understand this book is if you know something of the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" besides the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A CHILDREN'S BOOK!","review":"This story begins with too much vulgarity and distastefulness for me. After putting it down several times, I finally closed the book having read only 40 pages and said, \\"that is enough.\\" The writing is demented and demoralizing. My message to everyone: CHILDREN SHOULD NOT READ THIS BOOK! It is an adult story. Do not be fooled by the cover or the title. Personally, I think all copies should be burned at the stake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poorly written","review":"I don't see how this book has so much praise and hype. Yes, the story is a clever take on a classic, but it's so badly written that the book is almost painful to read. By the end of the book I hated the characters and the plot left me cold. If you're used to good fantasy books like the \\"His Dark Materials\\" series or \\"Earthsea\\" then you'll be very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked","review":"I found this book to be just plain boring and finally gave up on it after 150 pages.

Verbose and boring. Now I'm afraid to see the show, but I've heard it's a far cry from the book. Here's to hoping."},{"rating":"1","title":"wicked awful","review":"If I could give this book no stars I would. Wicked had so much potential and was a huge disappointment. Honestly, I have no idea how this got published or ended up as a bestseller. In a nutshell . . . Maguire doesn't know how to write. The characters aren't developed or even likable. He talks in circles without saying what is really going on and never even explains things later. He gets going down one storyline and just as you think he is going to explain it all, it stops dead in it's tracks and it's suddenly years later. There are sexual scenerios that are just plain odd and don't add anything to the story. Macquire uses so many \\"big\\" words you spend more time in a dictionary than actually reading the book. You're smart Macquire, we get it. I have never written a review before, but I was so annoyed by the book and Macquire that I had to warn others. Macquire should give us all our money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inventive re-thinking of Childhood Stories","review":"This is an interesting read, taking icons of childhood and examining them with an adult point of view. Maguire does an excellent job of character development, and at the same time paints a fascinating picture of the geographies, technologies, and politics of Oz. His wicked witch is a tormented - and very honest - character worthy of Ayn Rand, if Rand had thrown a little magic into \\"ATLAS SHRUGGED.\\" OK, maybe that's a bit of a stretch, but Elphaba's odyssey is fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This book was amazing, it gives you a feeling of empathy for the Wicked Witch of the West. As a high school student this book was not aimed towards me, but I believe that any person of any age could get something out of this book. It is very well written, and I would recommend that everyone read this book.(The Broadway Musical \\"Wicked\\" is based on this book, and although it is different, is amazing in it's own right)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After hearing so much about Wicked, I decided to pick it up at the bookstore to see what all the hype was about. I'm only about halfway through the book, and I'm not sure I'll be able to make myself finish the other half. The storyline has so far been painfully plodding and dull, without even the benefit of likeable or charismatic characters to keep me interested enough to continue. There was so little character buildup with any of them that they all tend to sound equally irritating with the unnecessarily flowery language. The plot is vague and confusing at this point, and doesn't show any signs of improving. On the whole, I'm not sure why this book has gotten so many rave reviews, although I'm glad it was made into a musical, because I DID enjoy that performance. Too bad the written version doesn't share the same appeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This book was extremely difficult to get through. It's dark, demented, and twisted. I chose it for the Book Club I'm hosting this time around and none of the other members liked it either. I have one word for this book....disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"After seeing Wicked on Broadway, could not wait to read the original. After all, books are always so much better then movies or plays. Always! Not this time. What a disappointment.

I was very disappointed about the language. Portions of the story were too slow and seemed to take a long time to come to a point that I became bored. Other portions used descriptions that were almost too difficult to decifer that I ended up skimming through.

Read the sequel (Son of a Witch)and loved it, too -- wish Maguire would write another one -- I want more...Bought the soundtrack from the Broadway show -- it, too, is wonderful. Heard Son of a Witch on tape while traveling-- read by the author -- it was so good, I kept missing my exit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Original, witty but very different from the popular musical","review":"I saw a stage production of WICKED before reading the book. The musical had surprised me with its unique, clever spin on the classic L. Frank Baum story made into a phenominon by the 1939 movie version, so I was interested to see this source material.Maguire has done a Herculean task in concocting this detailed story that is so innovative and yet intricately tied to the Baum series. The details and politicizing eventually slow down the storytelling in third quarter of the book, but rejuvenates in time for the climax. But make no mistake, this is a very different & more adult version of Elphaba's life story than bounces across the Broadway stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Premise, Great Promise, Needs Prose","review":"I saw the musical first. Loved it! I received the book as a Christmas gift and was excited to dive into it. I was unfortunately disappointed.The premise is great.

I suffered through this mess all the way to the end hoping it would (or even COULD) somehow be remedied. I've never read anything so anti-climatic in my LIFE. Nor have I ever had so much REGRET in finishing a book. I seriously cannot even believe there is anyone on the face of the planet who enjoyed this. The worst part is, I own two other books written by this author (that's what you get when you buy the sequels and accompaniments based on hype and not your own reading experience) - so lesson learned for me I guess!Bottom line - SKIP IT.

Can't wait to be finished with this book.

It was, until I got past the first chapter on the future witch's childhood. From then on, this book became a chore to finish. It doesn't even know what type of book it wants to be: tongue and cheek, serious, political or sexual. All of these elements are thrown in for good measure. Strange dialogue and silly plot twists persist throughout the book. The horrible throw-away ending only added to my regret at not putting the book down when our heroine was sharing a room with Glinda (the soon to be Good Witch of the North,) in college. (Really.) Don't be fooled by the premise of the book, which appears to have great promise. That promise is not fulfilled. To each his own, but I'm at a loss to understand how anyone could have given this book five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the FOR SALE pile","review":"Way too long and nothing really happens. I really hope that the point of the story wasn't to show that the shoes were why Elphaba was evil. In the book, I enjoyed her character immensely.

The author's discourses on good and evil, his preaching about animal rights, religion, and so on become tedious. The story stalls and doesn't recover.

It became a chore to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of paper","review":"I had heard how wonderful the musical based on this book was so I bought the book to read on vacation. I kept reading it hoping it would improve and finished it for the same reason one finishes a bad movie on cable-you're this far in,might as well see it through.

The best thing I can say about this book was that it inspired me to read L.Frank Baum's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too graphic","review":"Having listened the the Wicked Musical soundtrack I was excited to read the book. Though I was quickly drawn into the plot, I was disappointed with material I found offensive. I know that offensiveness is subjective--but within the first 50 pages Elpheba's mother has slept with 3 different men and in addition, a sexually perverse scene was described.

I stopped reading around there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time.","review":"Now that I have finished the series, I can strongly recommend that you do not waste your time reading this book. The Broadway Musical was excellent and is certainly worth your time, but this book and the series are completely other than the musical.

It takes a really inept writer, however, to squander such gold on a tirelessly unappealing novel. Instead of fleshing out the narrative of one of literature's all-time greatest villains, Macguire bogs down his plot with inconsequential details. Sixty pages into the Elphaba story, Macguire apparently grows weary of his main character and inserts uninteresting, lackluster characters and plotlines. Had he focused on his main character instead and trimmed the useless fat (including plastic characters like Boq), he could have created a fantasy novel for all time. What he has produced instead is a book with more power to induce sleep than Oz's poppy fields. Sadly, this idea fell into the hands of a writer lacking the imaginative vitality to pull it off. But who really cares? He's published AND his book is now the inspiration of a new Broadway play. Bad writing apparently does pay off in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This was very boring--not what I was expecting at all. I thought it would have more fantasy and whimsy. What it does have are very long passages discussing politics, philosophy, and ruminations about good vs evil. It was a challenge to get through. I know I am in the minority here from reading the other reviews. But I think an alternative opinion is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, pretentious, no likeable characters","review":"I bought this book because of the buzz and after reading reviews on Amazon. I feel lied to (by the reviews that I read). The most genuinely inventive aspect of this book is its premise, but that only carries one through the first few chapters. After this, there needs to be credible characterization and an interesting plot. Instead this book offers unlikeable, unsympathetic and uninteresting characters whose motivations and choices are not believable or consistent, and a tangled, overwrought plot that strains to make something complex out of the familiar fairy tale. My overall impression throughout was that the book was trying too hard and took itself too seriously. Ultimately, it was ponderous, undramatic and clever for the sake of being clever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"It is not often that a book is bad enough for me to not want to finish it, but sadly \\"Wicked\\" is one of those books. The premise of the book seemed like a good idea, but there are just too many distractions and shortcomings. I personally also like a book in which I can understand, empathize, or at least really get to know the main character. Although I like the idea of empathizing with Elphie, it just doesn't happen for me. So far I find her to be pretty dull. Maybe I am just not smart enough to read this, but I wouldn't recommend it. I wish I could get my $15 back."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"The premise for this book is SUCH agreat idea. I just wish Maguire would have given it to someone who could write. I SO wanted this to be a good book, that I too read it in a couple days, constantly expecting it to get better. It never did. In fact the ending is the most disappointing thing about the book. Maguire goes into great detail and develops numerous characters which he then abandons or fails to connect to the story in any way. Hopefully someone in Hollywood will pick this up and turn it into a decent movie; like they did with the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, Boring, Not in the least bit entertaining.","review":"I kept waiting for something intresting to happen to these characters. To see something that would keep me coming back to the book. Nothing but a dank drab picture, void of color."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good bedtime story...","review":"I bought the book Wicked on CD and could not get very far with it. I tried listening to it at night at the same time as I would ordinarily read, before bedtime. At one point, there was a description given that just thoroughly turned me off having to do with the time clock and an incestuous sexual imagining/accusation used to incite people to violence against a family. This was not an image or idea I wanted in my mind while drifting off to sleep. I saw the play awhile back and enjoyed it,and I do not recall imagery as off-putting in it as what was in the book. I think stories are often made more palatable when put into a musical format. I do think that creating an alternate story for The Wizard of Oz was a fantastic idea, and the story that the author did create in Wicked is a good one. However, I would not recommend the audiobook since I wasn't able to get to what I know is good about the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it or hate it - its very well written.","review":"Most people that have read this have loved it....but others have absolutely hated it. If you're looking for a children's fantasy - THIS IS NOT IT. If you're looking for a wonderfully brilliant book based loosely on the land of Oz that Baum created then this is it.Take a chance and read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It lacks a ball of fire","review":"After reading so many rave reviews, I found this book to be a tedious, clicheed and ponderously slow moving dissapointment. It's loaded with ponderous and clunky social commentary; even though I agreed with his opinions, I found the language and dialogue difficult to swallow. And while the Frank L. Baum books and the classic movie are enchanting, this book is a bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Being a Wizard of Oz fan, I was intrigued...","review":"But I have to say I had a hard time getting throught he entire book. Honestly if I hadn't purchased tickets to see the play I don't know that I would have made it to the end. After seeing the play I was glad that I took the time to read the book, it did give me the upper hand on others that had not read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"400 pages and a waste","review":"Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of fiction, but regardless, good fiction is engrossing with dynamic characters and a well-told story. With that said, Maguire has a strong command of language and is a great writer when you examine his technique. However, I DESPISED this story...I am familiar with the original Wizard of Oz story, and the potential of turning a classic on its head was alluring to me in addition to all of the attention that the musical is getting. In spite of my better judgment after the first 100 pages, I kept reading. I hated this book. It is one of the worst stories I have read in years. I am so mad that I paid for this. Even worse, I wish that I had not given it a chance and saved myself 400 pages of a warped, pretentious story that attempts to question the nature of good and evil. It fails miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a mess!","review":"I loved reading this book, but kept waiting for something wonderful, as promised by the blurbs on the back.Instead, I got a conceited mess, nothing but a practice exercise by a creative writing instructor with time on his hands.Where is the conflict? Some of it starts half way through, but it never delivers in either threat or release.Yes, I liked the character of Elphalba, but, um, WHY does she have an affair with that guy? and WHY exactly does she feel the need to be forgiven? Her character has no development, but rather changes with new section.I feel ripped off, and it is shameful that writers like this get to ride the coattails of great writers like Rowling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for children","review":"Despite the apparent connection to the Wizard of Oz, this is definitely not a book for children! I was not expecting so much sex, explicit and implicit. Although some of that material is relevant for the plot, much is not. More importantly, because it was billed as a retelling of the Oz story from the perspective of the Witch, I did not pick up this particular book expecting to read about these issues. I did manage to read the entire book (with some effort) and was rewarded in places by some very funny dialog, but by the end of the book, I felt more pity than sympath for the Witch. I also felt that Dorothy and Toto were definitely NOT in Oz anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully Sllllooooowwwww","review":"This book utilizes NONE of the magic from the Merry Old Land of Oz. It spends what feels like HOURS brow-beating us with Oz politics...and is littered with inappropriate sex scenes. Was it REALLY necessary to add alcoholic perverts to OZ???? I had gotten the book because I had heard of the musical,which is playing locally next month and had planned to take my teen-aged daughter to see it. I thought the premise of Glinda and the Wicked Witch of the West as kids was a delightful idea! As die-hard Wizard of Oz fans, we were really looking forward to another chapter in the story! But this book isn't another chapter, it's a horse of a different color. It's so disappointing! UGH! I'm approximately 1/3 of the way through the book and am as bored as I am disgusted. I'm not going to bother to finish it nor am I wasting the money or time to go see the musical. What a World! What a world we live in that this sort of trash is celebrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supposedly full of trash","review":"I bought this book for my wife, because she really wanted to read the story. Once it came and I gave it to her as a Christmas present, friends and other family members one after another told her or warned her that there was a lot of unnecessary filth in the book and to not waste her time reading it. Everyone said the exact same thing about it. She decided not to read it-wasn't worth it. Why waste time filling your mind with trash? So now it's in the middle of being sent back for a refund. Who knows what or how much garbage there really is, but better just ditching the whole thing. Author must have felt he had to compensate for something. I hear the play is great though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"why all the hype?","review":"Wicked was one of our book club selections. It was fairly poorly recieved. Our group felt it was hard to sympathize with or relate to any of the characters. We also felt the authors writing style wasn't consistent throughout the book. For example, early in the book the conversations between characters are formal and somewhat stilted. Later on while characters are discussing the unfortunate death of Glinda the prose is rather ribald. We also felt that it seemed somewhat incongruous for negative and nasty Elphaba to 'carry the torch' for the Animals cause. We are not planning on reading the sequel. We could care less..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Clever By Far","review":"I was greatly disappointed by this book.Gregory Maguire clearly wants to make us think, and has written a complex and deeply-thought out book. His mistake was placing it in the context of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". More generally, placing it in the genre of fantasy.The fantasy genre is the dive bar of literature: The inhabitants are rough around the edges, unpretentious, and not the highest-functioning people. Gregory Maguire's book is not like that. His book stands out like a gentleman dressed for the opera mingling with a bunch of drunken truck drivers.I read fantasy because I want to enjoy it. I don't want someone to try to impress me with how well he writes or what deep points he's trying to make. Stephen King writes well and is unpretentious about it. Gregory Maguire merely writes well.I suspect that people who are enthusiastic about this book don't read much fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Even Bother!","review":"The first chapter was well written, wonderfully imaginative, for the next 390 pages I continued to sighed heavily... when were we going to get to the point? I really wanted to quit 1/2 way through but I forced myself to finish... perhaps there was something of value I could take away from all of the unnecessary plot, confusing history, and inner struggle with religion. If you really want to know \\"what happens\\" read the first chapter and the last 10 pages -- then you can expereince excitment and disappointment at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissappointed. Don't buy the book.","review":"Based on several reviews and the reviews of the musical I bought this book for my teenaged daughter. I browsed the book to whet my own appetite for the fun this book promised, but was soon horrified by the content. The book is filled with vulgarity, and very crude sexual content throughout. It doesn't even qualify as a good book for adults and I'm disappointed that it's being marketed to kids. I'd give it a negative star if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"There's a reason the vast majority of people rate this book so well. It's not about \\"something happening\\" and it's certainly better than anything Rowling has ever done. This book is about exploring the complexity of people and as a character study of that nature, it succeeds very well. For people looking for a story with a clearly defined beginning, middle, and end, with lots of black and white characters, pass up this book. Instead, Macguire is trying to take the reader into the conflicts and self doubt of a character that has been perceived as the apotheosis of evil. Macguire shows us that evil is relative and in the eye of the beholder. Following the Witch from birth to death is a wonderful glimpse into the psyche of someone who has followed a meandering path to where she is. This book will leave you thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely disgusting sexuality","review":"While the plot was mediocore and somewhat interesting, although slow, what disgusted me were the random, unneccisary sexual scenes. They were outlandishly weird and I wish I could get the imaginary images out of my head. I pressed through the first few scenes of them, thinking that they were just flukes, but I finally had to give up and throw the book away because I didn't want to leave any more of the perverse images in my head. I bought the book like most others, because I love the musical, but was sorely dissappointed. I'm going to make a point to tell people NOT to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Classic...","review":"This was one of the most amazing books I've ever read. Maguire has written a masterpiece. The main character, Elphaba, is a smart, firey, misunderstood, green girl who grows to be the infamous Wicked Witch of the West. We all know her, from \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", but why was she wicked? Why was she green? Maguire answers these questions through an amazing story about the Land of Oz. This book is about her life before Dorothy, her childhood, parents, friends, and her few sucesses and many failures. This book challenged my views of Oz, evil, and what \\"Wicked\\" truly means. There is also a musical based on this book, but the storyline is quite different, and if you have seen it, I highly recommend that you read this book. This book is suitable for most people over 13 years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Seldom Does Something This Wickedly Fun Come Our Way!","review":"Fantastic! I had expected this book to be of the 8th grade level, or perhaps maybe even younger. I was misgiven and for that I must apologize to the author. This book has wit, charm and full of agravating speed. Meaning that you fly faster through this book than the witch does on her broomstick and I found myself wishing I knew her on a personal level. It is by far very clever and definatley shows that there ARE two sides to every story. I found myself deeply sadend that it came to an end so I've come back to buy his latest book. I can only hope it's half as wonderful as Wicked was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised","review":"I originally picked up the book because I thought it'd be good to read to my young daughter. In the first few pages I realized that was not going to happen. I was surprised by the mentions of sex and the curse words used throughout. I did however enjoy the book and would definately recommend it...for adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, great musical - but different","review":"The only thing that makes this a \\"musical tie-in edition\\" is that there are pictures of the Broadway musical with the original cast members. The story remains the same.The book spends the bulk of its time detailing the political machines of Oz, while telling the story of Elphaba, one day to be known as the Wicked Witch of the West. The book has some graphic scenes which make it PG-13 (and R in some places). The story of Glinda and Elphaba isn't fleshed out as it is in the musical, but you get a better understanding of the characters.The musical, on the other hand, focuses on Glinda and Elphaba, confining its story to their arc from foes to friends. The political theme, so prevalent in the book, becomes one-note (no pun intended) in the musical. Obviously, many details had to be dropped and a happier ending is given.Both are wonderful stories, but very different tales."},{"rating":"1","title":"You go away or I - I'll bite you myself!","review":"I wish I would have said that to this book. I rue the day I spent the money to buy it and most of all I rue the time I wasted trying to read it.I was so excited at the concept of the book and 110% ready to love it. I was incredibly disappointed that I couldn't even like it a little. It was boring and disjointed and did not hold my attention at all. It was actually painful to read.Reminds me of a quote from the Wizard of Oz:'You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death, sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.' I think the Wizard said that about time spent reading 'Wicked'."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I didn't read the ending","review":"This book was okay up until the \\"sexual scene\\" which I really can't remember much of because of how random and confusing it was. Eventually I got to a point in the book where I put it down and didn't finish it until a few months later when I decided I had to get it over with. Very disappointing ending. I wish I hadn't read the whole thing, so I could just think up a better ending. The book never got anywhere, and the whole book pretty much had no point. This idea really could've been so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to love it - but it just WASN'T enjoyable!","review":"After reading all the great reviews about this book I was excited to read it. I love to read and have NEVER quit a book before I was finished. Let me tell you, with this one I was tempted.It just did not pull me in. I didn't feel the magic of the book at all. I did appreciate what the book was trying to do and at points I guess you could say it succeeded it but it was just SO slow. I felt like I was waiting for something to happen the entire time.I wouldn't reccomend this one. Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring I couldn't finish it","review":"I don't really have much to add, as the other reviewiers who gave this book 1 star have really said it all. I'll only add that this is only the second book (in the last 15 years if not my whole life) that I put down without finishing (the other one was Patricia Cornwall's analysis on the identity of Jack the Ripper). It felt like such a chore to slog through this book, that I finally decided I didn't want to or have to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only good thing that came out of this book was the musical.","review":"I'd heard the musical was really good, so I decided to read this before seeing it. I shouldn't have. It was 30 or 40 pages until Elphie was even born, and random small characters are suddenly given huge parts. The end of her time at the Emerld City was abrupt. Just watch the musical, but definately don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why???????","review":"I can't believe how highly this book has been rated. What a waste of perfectly good stars! I drudged through the book hoping at some point that it would become good or interesting or both. It didn't. It was poorly written and hard to follow. I was totally turned off and disgusted by the approach and content of the story. The idea of this book and his other books are very clever yet Mr. Maguire was not able to pull off anything that came close to clever. Needless to say, this was a very disappointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still trying...","review":"I have started this book twice. The first time I got to about page 60 and gave up. The second time I got to the middle of the book and gave up again. I really could care less about any of the characters. Nothing in the book really makes me want to turn to the next page. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me hanging","review":"I don't know if the book suffered in my opinion for just having finished The Lord of the Rings series by Tolkien. This seemed immature or raw in some way, just left me asking is this it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed Opportunity","review":"After seeing the new Broadway musical version (loosely stated), I was excited to read Maguire's book...which came highly recommended by several friends. I couldn't have been more disappointed. The musical's script is a vast improvement over this aimless sprawl of a novel by bestowing the characters with MOTIVATION. In the novel, I found the characters poorly defined and the plot ill-focused. It's a shame, because Maguire's prose isn't without merit...he's just given us a real, real mess of a book. He starts so many threads without direction, and without wrapping them up. It is not a page-turner, and has no narrative sweep. If this is the \\"prequil\\" to The Wizard of Oz, it certainly wouldn't make anyone want to read Baum's classic.Anyone who wants to see a GOOD story inspired by Maguire's characters and a few of his ideas would do well to credit Winnie Holzman, who wrote the script to the new Broadway musical Wicked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!","review":"I could not believe how boring this book was! It was nothing like I thought it would've been. The storyline is very dull, I didn't make much sense out of it, and I thought about throwing it in the dumpster! I am really glad I did not buy this book, luckily i borrowed it from a friend!You can't imagine how disappointed I was with this book! I thought it would be the coolest thing to find out about Thee Wicked Witch of the West! But it was boring, and I thought most of it didn't revolve around her anyway. The book could've been made so much better.... why wasn't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting; lousy ending","review":"I like the Wizard of Oz, but after reading this book I realized that I liked it the way I remembered it, pure and unadulterated. I didn't need, or even want, the \\"back story\\" of the Wicked Witch. Her story is maybe just not worth telling.Though the story was sort of interesting, I thought the ending was inconclusive and didn't answer half of the questions I had. I finished the book feeling that it was still unresolved; certain issues were never \\"wrapped up\\" as well as I would have liked, in order for me to feel satisfied. Maybe I just didn't *get* it.UPDATE!! After getting to know the Broadway musical (which has a completely different ending) and then re-reading the book, I found I appreciated the book much more. On second reading, I feel like I GOT it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating trip through revisionist history","review":"Even in fairy tales, it is the victorious who write the history books, so this is a wonderful 'revolutionary's' view of the Wizard of Oz stories. You must have an open mind when you pick up this book, but if you can hold open the door to your thinking, the story will soon grab hold of your imagination and take you to places and viewpoints you never dreamed possible from the Baum books or the MGM movie. Maguire's writing makes Oz and the characters come alive in a way that is so different and yet so 'right' ... Since first stumbling across this book in 1997, I have recommended this book to so many friends that I had to buy another copy! Just find a big comfy chair, grab a large cup of tea, and let yourself move on down the yellow brick road -- you may think you've been to Oz, but believe me -- you're not in Kansas anymore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a book that tries my patience","review":"I picked this book to read while waiting for my flight in \\"January\\" and I haven't finshed with it yet. I normally don't take much time to read one book. But this book just tries my patience. I'm still trying to finish it sheerly out of my tenacity and I'm almost there.I don't understand what the author is trying to say. Creating a good adult fairy tale? Well, I have had far better ones. Giving satirical version of current politics? Real-world affairs on TV are more informative. Basically I can't take away anything from this book.I first blamed my ignorace for failing to grasp the meaning, if any, of this book but reading other reviews here, I felt relieved that it wasn't just me. I will definitely not recommend this book to others. Just go and watch the play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not live up to the reviews...","review":"I'm really trying to finish this book, but it just doesn't keep my attention. As a child, I detested the Wizard of Oz movie and books. I thought this might give me a different view of this particular fantasy world, but the book is just not compelling enough for me to concentrate on. I find myself mired in the author's writing style, wishing I could rewrite passages to make them flow more smoothly. As a wiccan I've read plenty of books that turn the notions of good and evil on their head, so that is nothing new.Disappointed...A"},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie was okay, but the book...","review":"I never have completely favored the wizard of Oz. It was a pretty good movie. I think the book is okay, but worse than the movie. The crudity and detailed descriptions of sex make me want to throw up on the book and chunck it down a industrial strength diposal. Really why don't they just label the book as perverted, and title it 'how many ways can a witch do it'. This is not a book I would give to my friends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Wicked\\"","review":"I am very disappointed with the service from this bookseller. I ordered this book in early March.

But, my credit card has been billed already...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed and a bit disgusted","review":"Okay, I bought the book because of the cover and the title, I know you're not supposed to do that, but come on, it looked interesting. WICKED could have been good, it has a great subject, but Maguire confuses the reader by introducing wild amounts of new characters and settings that it becomes alienating. Not the OZ we all know and love. He not only seemed determined to change Oz but destroy it forever. I would like to think that the word ... is not a part of the Oz vocabulary. With all the sexual tones it may seem the Maguire is trying to prove a point about Oz and it's citizens, he is not sucessful. Please, if you are looking for worthwile addition to the world of Oz, DON'T READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stymied","review":"I am amazed at all the five star reviews this book has received. Did you people read the same book I read? A root canal with no anesthesia would have been more pleasurable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West","review":"This book departs dramatically from the original story. It doesn't even dovetail into the original story. The book is filled with degenerate scenes of little social value. It's not fresh, not creative, not noir but raunchy, a waste of time to read. Disappointing and definitely not recommended for under 17 crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the most disgusting book i've ever read.","review":"The witch's mother is so promiscious, she reminds me of lenina from brave new world, her whole character reminded me of lenina's behaviour. There are really graphic scenes described."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not what I expected","review":"I thought this book would be a great book, from what I heard of from the play. It was a good story, I just don't know how sex has anything to do with oz. I only got throught the first part. It was not easy reading and did not keep my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was amazing.","review":"Very rarely do I dive into fiction of this nature, but this book was exceptional. Seeing things from the witch's point of view was not only amusing but endearing, and the introduction of all these subplots and charaters is nothing short of extraordinary. This book not only complements but also enhances this classic tale. Maguire does everything right in this story and hopefully will continue writing exceptional fiction of this nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzz....","review":"This book, is a book I head so much about and that it was so good you have to read it. Plus, I live 35 minutes away from the city, so everybody around here is telling me that the play is fantastic. WELL, I think the book sucked, and there is no way I'm going to go to see that play. The book drags on and on and on, and every time it starts to get interesting, it comes to an abrupt halt, and you zoom past like 5 years of Elphaba's life, to something leaving you confused. This book, is not a big deal at all. It reminded me of those books teachers would require students to read in high school, its boring, and dumb. I felt like beating myself with this book, it was so stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West","review":"I was very disappointed with the book. I felt that Gregory McGuire could have shown a little restraint in his descriptions of different scenes in the \\"life of the wicked witch\\" For instance, he could have just told us that her mother was adulturous instead of describing in detail(seriously) every sexcapade that she had!!! I felt this was more than any audience would want to know. I was looking for a charming story like the Wizard of Oz and instead I got treated to a description of body parts and sex. I would not recommend this book for anyone and I would hesitate to read any of his other books based on what I have read in this one. I was very excited to get this book and now I feel like all I can do with it is trash it because I won't allow anyone that I know to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as fabulous as all that...","review":"I'm sorry, maybe it's just me, but I didn't even finish this book, and that's unusual for me. I made my self read about one quarter of the way through it and then got so bored I stopped. I've been reading fantasy for years, and this just didn't do it for me. Give me a good deLint novel any day. Sorry Maguire, try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the CRAP","review":"This is one of those books that you are hesitant to buy because you don't know if it will be any good. I checked it out from my local library instead. Boy, I'm sure glad I did! I couldn't even stomach the book after the second chapter.I read the one chapter where the clock makes the puppets have a threesome. Yeah, a PUPPET threesome. Ugh. This book is awful. I don't even want to get into the actual writing style. It's written on a level that cannot be comprehended unless you have a PHd. It's a shame the author couldn't write this book because I found the idea of telling about the wicked witch to be a good idea.Don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West","review":"Hate the book, just can't get into it. I read a lot and I wouldnot recommend this book, just doesn't hold my interest. Waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book","review":"I bought this book because of the musical and because it was about OZ before Dorothy arrived. It is a terrible book. Very hard to hold my attention. Chapters go on and on for no reason other than to have Mr McGuire show off his vocabulary and ability to stretch ideas on and on.One section is a long account of Elphaba and Fiyero's illicet love affair. He is,after all,married with three children.Elphaba (wicked witch of the west) has no morals. She is a completely unsympathetic central character. Most of the characters are unlikable. There are weird sexual encounters such as a naked man tied under a tiger in a compromising position for the entertainment of onlookers.One of the most disterbing Another aspects of the book is the mocking of religion. Another is that the Wizard of Oz is a really horribly person.If you enjoy perverted stories and unpleasant main characters and a complete perversion of OZ, then you might enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like this book at all.","review":"By the time I got to page 40, I had a sick feeling in my stomach. I understand that the reason for the book was to explain how the wicked witch got that way, but reading all that sickening sexual and violent stuff was more than I could take. I did something I thought I would never do. I threw the book in the trash! No way would I recommend this kind of reading to anyone for any reason. Incest, adultery and perversion are not entertainment - they are sick and sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all like the play","review":"Hard to believe you could write a wonderful screenplay from this book. The play is awsaome and the book is so dark and twisted. Never got past the first chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining!","review":"Though Maguire is not likely to win the Pulitzer for thispiece, as a Wizard of Oz fan I found this book a good. I thoroughlyrecommend this book to anyone, even if you're not a big fan of the movie, the book, or fantasy in general. It tells a truer story than the L. Frank Baum or the Warner Bros. versions. The Wicked Witch of the West is called Elphaba and she is not really wicked after all. She's not even much of a witch. She is a misunderstood green skinned woman who had been competing for her father's love all her life. The famed shoes were made for her sister as a token of the father's love. That's why she wanted them so badly. Maguire shatters the cruel immpression that we normally think of the WWW as. She's a likeable lady who's allergic to water (which is why she wears a hat with such a big brim), falls in love, and has abnormally green skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"I can't believe the reviews this book has gotten. I am an avid reader, and I have not been this disappointed with a book in a long time. I had the hardest time even finishing it! This book was way too slow, very drawn out, and I found myself constantly wondering what the author was smoking at the time he was writing it! This book was very strange, and definately not something I would recommend anyone buy, unless they are looking for a political, cockeyed view of the once charming Wizard of Oz story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book I will always cherish","review":"this book was very well written. It has changed a lot on my point of view for some things. Comical,romantic,dramatic, sad,philsophical, and a mystery to some. It has all the wonders and more to a great book. Kudos to Mr. Greogry Maguire. I recommend this book to anybody who wants to know the true meaning of evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Impression of the Wicked Witch of the West","review":"This book has truly impressed me as has Elphaba. The future 'green meanie' known to us all in The Wizard of Oz. \\"Fabala\\", \\"Elphie\\", \\"Faye\\", as she is known by her family, friends and lover, is truly captivating and someone you just may want to know yourself. She is smart, compassionate, and simply misunderstood! I have been recommending this book to everyone I speak with these days and its been touch to put it down. Bonus: Did you know that \\"Elphie\\" and Galinda, aka: Glinda went to college together? Or that \\"Elphie\\" had a son? Get reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised!!!","review":"I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed this book. I highly recommend it to anyone who grew up watching the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" on TV. What a wonderful twist to the story. I can't wait to read Gregory Maguire's other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start.... character appeal.","review":"This book has a slow start... I would say it REALLY begins on page 105 or so... but once there, it reads fast. The characters are endearing and the reader is enticed by them into their world as the pages turn. If one looks deeper than the storyline (which is quite good)...there is a very cutting critique of society... from the Holocaust to the civil war. Insightful analysis done here. The humor is dry, but keen -- if you catch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKED...such a disappointment!!","review":"I agree 100% w/Equipro. That review was spot-on, and took much more care than I would have to spell out the many ways this book sucked. I would've just said it sucked! I was so disappointed in these. I was very excited to read them. The concept was great - a reimagining of classic stories/characters - right up my alley! I expected to adore this series! I was so sure I'd like them that I read the first and second books and part of the third before I finally admitted to myself that I HATED them! I don't like his writing style at all, and I agree that his execution of this literary concept was sooooooo boring! I do not understand what all the hype is about w/these books. I strongly recommend skipping this writer for someone better. There's a lot of great stuff out there that deserves the attention more than this guy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A 'Wickedly' Good Read","review":"There was so much to this book. It would be redundant of me to comment on the specifics of this book - it was however very entertaining and enjoyable to read. The main character, The Wicked Witch of the West, was thought provoking in her thoughts, words and deeds.Plan on staying up late a few nights!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the good stuff?","review":"While the premise for this book is fantastic, the execution is dull and extremely poor. It seems like every time the book builds towards a big event, there is a chapter break, several years elapse, and we get what should have been a highlight of the book presented in unimpressive flashbacks. I read this book with my wife and there were many times when we would say to each other, \\"Finally, something is going to happen,\\" only to be disappointed. Sadly, Maguire's writing style is as uninspired as his choice of which events to depict. If you're interested in the Wicked Witch, watch the musical version of _Wicked_. It presents a quite different (but more compelling) story and develops more interesting characters in a few hours than Maguire manages get across in 400 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wickedly disappointed ...","review":"I had read so many positive reviews of this book, however, after my own reading of it I was VERY disappointed. When I began, I was under the impression of such a wonderful story that had so much potential but as I progressed I was engrossed in garbled language that made the the plot difficult to understand. Not only the creation of a unfamiliar language but the multiple twisted sexual exploits of numerous creatures lost my interest almost immediately.Considering that this story was derived from childrens' fairytale, evil or otherwise, at what point would these characters actually be exposed to and use curse words from the writer's own native tongue, why weren't those words made up?"},{"rating":"1","title":"All that was clever about the play...is not in the book.","review":"All that was clever about the play...is not in the book. I wish it was possible to give 0 stars. I so loved the show, and was eager to read the book it was based upon. So disappointing. All the clever elements of the play, which have one questioning the concepts of good and evil, of preconceived notions and prejudices -- not in the book.Please save your money. Truly a waste. Kudos to whoever wrote the play's script, they are the real genius. Gregory Mcguire should send them all the proceeds from this book from everyone who was 'tricked' into buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I heard a lot of hype about this book, so I ordered it. I was so disappointed. I wish I's known about the graphic sexual situations (that really had nothing to do with the plot) I'd never have bought it. This is the first book in a long time I've thrown away without finishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the Play","review":"After 6 months of attempting to read \\"Wicked\\", I never made it past the 2nd Chapter. Not my cup of tea but, the stage adaption was phenomenal!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasantly Surprised! (spoiler)","review":"I was fascinated with the idea of back-story for the Wizard of Oz (which I neglected to read in the Frank Baum original). However, I would rather have read an poorly-written historical political tract set in a drearily depressing Eastern European country, which this experience resembled closely. The tone was almost Kafka-esque in its dark ugliness, with characters that were shallow evil go-alongers or tragic dupes.I did appreciate the circularity in Elphie's fate at the hands of Dorothy. Forgiveness is the elusive Holy Grail forever beyond reach of the second half of this book, and it ends with death: execution-style, by torture, or by, you guessed it, a fatal bucket of water. I wasted way too much time on this novel, and I wish I had it back. Want a copy? Have mine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it gets better after 110 pages?","review":"I really tried to give it a fair chance, I read 110 pages.It's terrible. The first 75 are about the witches adulterous mother, yawn, nothing interesting.If you consider this book good, then let me suggest you read other books, that are well written. You will be amazed, there is a whole world out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want the story from the play, this ain't it","review":"We love the songs from \\"Wicked\\" (the play), so I bought this book, expecting a similar storyline. I flipped through the book before my 15 year old daughter read it, to check for content.What I found was sexual depravity (bedhopping and worse), borderline bestiality (what's with the tiger and naked people?), incestuous tendencies (sexual ecstacy giving rescue breathing to 'son' Liir?), pubic hair color, warm feeling in a child's crotch, and not much of a coherent storyline.If these things give you a 'charge', then go for it and read this thing.If not, then either do not buy it or have your tome join mine in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!","review":"If your going to read this book based off the musical beware they are 2 complete different stories. This book is more in depth and its not so bubble gumish to say the least like the musical. It requires imagination and some intelligence to read. YOu get to see a very different side wicked witch, you'll fall in love with her and the characters. You probably won't even consider her wicked at all. You'll see a whole new side to the Emerald City and The Wizard. YOu'll never look at the Wizard of oz the same!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked is really wicked","review":"I was so excited to read this book but was sorely disappointed. This was not what I expected in a trip to OZ. The cussing is uncalled for and gross description of the sexual encounters was shocking. It was definetly more dark than I expected. I did not finish the book and plan on trying to sell it back. This was just not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I love, love, love this read!!!! I am not sure who thought this book was an exploration of \\"evil\\"? i found it to be socially charged.. a great trip looking from someone elses perspective on the same set of events! WOW.. I think its genius!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not continue series","review":"I had mixed expectations for this book. I was intrigued by the story, but was told it was hard to read. It was definitly a hard read. I forced myself to continue reading through the first third of the book. The story of Elphaba's early years was disconnected and unclear. I enjoyed the story of her middle years and dealings in the Emerald City. The end once again becomes disjointed. It seems there is no clear direction. From the time Dorothy arrives in Oz, the book hits another gear and everything seems in a hurry to wrap up. The ending is abrupt and confusing. I will not continue the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"Maguire's prose makes you want to read the book out loud. Fascinating premise for a storyline. I felt like I had an insider's secret knowledge the next time I read or watched \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". I do wonder, though, why Maguire has such a penchant for adding gratuitous and sordid storylines to his novels. Their unnecessary tangents leave me going, \\"What the...?!\\" Still, an outstanding read - good enough that you'll remember it 20 books later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting reading.","review":"This book was different than what I had expected. It was highly theological and political. I thought that it might be a little more fairytale-like when I bought it. It was very interesting reading. It's neat hearing the story from the villain's perspective. I felt sorry for her throughout the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Oz","review":"As a fan of the world of Oz, Maguire's version is magnificent. The details of Oz and the humanity afforded the Witch are awe inspiring. It's so cleanly written, the descriptions leap brilliantly to life in your mind and the hours sweep past unnoticed while reading this book. Maguire is a genius storyteller, taking classic fairytales and giving them real meat and bones. Any adult who loved the original fairytales should read Maguire's versions, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Delivers What You Are Waiting For...","review":"Not a great book, just a descent read. It never quite delivers what you are hoping it will deliver. Skips around a lot in the plot and with the scenes. Gives sketchy character introductions and weak development. What a shame. Reading it, it seems to have so much potential, but that potential is never realized. Ends leaving you wanting much more explanation and development."},{"rating":"2","title":"The item was as I expected!","review":"I got fast service at a great price! The book arrived in great condition!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Details!","review":"If you want to know every detail about the witch, it's great. Half way through and it all is background info. Warped, interesting and kinky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting and deep.","review":"Luv this book! Gregory Maguire has a wonderful imagination. I can't wait to read the other book books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Interest","review":"I lost interest in this book and struggled to finish it. I lovedthemusical but was not impressed with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too impressed","review":"I would actually give this 2.5 stars if that were an option. I'm not sure why this series of books became so popular. One one level, the idea of reconstructing the world of Oz is interesting. Beyond that, I didn't feel this novel created a meaningful or cohesive narrative. The protagonist's character seemed to be inconsistent, two-dimensional much of the time, and unsympathetic through most of the story. Relationships with other characters rarely developed in a meaningful way, and those that seemed promising lost cohesion after awhile. It was very difficult to get a grasp of the motivations or inner workings of the protagonist's mind throughout much of the book. She actually seemed very uninterested in herself, which made it hard to invest in her. I found by the end that I still didn't care about the characters or the story itself. Disappointing, given the hype!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the sequel?","review":"I absolutely loved this book, but readers should be warned that if you don't like getting lost in imagination, this is not for you. After reading Wicked, I immediately read Maguire's other books, but didn't find any of them nearly as wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Step Aside Dorothy, She's Not Your Movie Wicked Witch...","review":"If you read this book thinking it's like the movie, you will miss out on Maguire's world of Oz as one with people (and a/Animals) with real issues.In this book, Elphaba--the Wicked Witch of the West--was fleshed out more as a person. You find out about her past and the experiences that affected her future decisions. Although a somewhat difficult person sometimes, I found her witty, smart and independent. I'd also like to note Douglas Smith's gorgeous illustrations. Forget green skin! After reading this, I'd rather be the Wicked Witch than Glinda anyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious beyond belief","review":"My sister gave this to me because it was a best-seller and she assumed that meant the author knew how to tell a story in such a way as to keep the attention of the reader. She was unaware that the best-seller lists are infested with the works of authors who simply cannot tell a story well. She shouldn't have bothered. I slogged through the first half of the book more out of a sense of obligation to my sister, then I threw it to the \\"later\\" pile.It was crass and dull and utterly without joy or wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was anyone disturbed?","review":"I've read many of the reviews of this book and not one person mentioned the scene where 10-year old Nor is sexually aroused by the soldiers and wanting to seduce them. That bordered on kiddie porn to me and was absolutely unnecessary, especially considering that nothing came of the event except that Elphaba learned her broom could fly. I'd thought the book rather boring and pointless until then, but that just really went over the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"loved the idea, hated the execution","review":"I really like the authors' premise of diving into the back story of OZ. However for me it just never seemed to come together. I often had the impression that the author had a momentary flash of inspiration that as he continued to develop just ran out of steam and eventually trailed off into pointlessness. In my mind this is especially evident in the last few pages when the author simply tries to wrap things up by simply writing charecters and events off as a complete mystery. As I say in the title... loved the idea, hated the execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt like I was studying a textbook, not enjoying a read","review":"I know I am in the distinct minority, but this book just didn't do it for me. My typical literary fare is not light stuff, so I don't think I was being too ambitious to undertake this book. However, it turned out to be a laborious and heavy handed read. I have nothing against metaphor and allegory, and I enjoy works that cause me to think. But this one just wasn't the enjoyable read I had expected based on its popularity and hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tornado of Confusion","review":"While the book definitely had a few highlights, there were too many unanswered questions and loose ends that were never tied up. Though Maguire has many creative ideas, they get lost in a sea of unnecessary events (e.g. Boq's extremely long attempt at wooing Galinda/Glinda) and superficial explanations for events in the classic version of the Witch's tale (e.g. how the flying monkeys came to be). Overall, there are too many plotlines/details that never tie together in a cohesive way, making Wicked a mediocre read, at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Hot","review":"As someone who read all of the original Oz books as a kid, I thought this new side of the story would be good. I was wrong. Maguire did not do his research into the land of Oz. He repeatedly confuses locations and facts about characters and environments. The blatent mistreatment of L. Frank Baum's creations is not my only fault with this book. The writing is somewhat shallow, and slightly unfocused. Also, he doesn't seem to be focused so much on his characters as his message, making the characters seem slightly two-dimensional. One thing this book has going for it...it wasn't nearly as bad as it's sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"detached","review":"Hey, it doesn't take a lot to move me emotionally. I mean, I cry frequently when I read the newspaper in the morning. But this book didn't get me in any way. I didn't feel much of anything for any character--good or bad. There is no in-depth characterization. Seems like everybody is pretty much on the bad side, though Elphaba is supposedly standing up for the animals (a pretty weak stance). I just can't muster any emotion for anybody and that's a pretty bad thing to say for a novel. I think the concept--a prequel to a story everybody already knows--was probably enough to sell the idea. A decent writer in terms of verbiage, but please give me a character I can feel something for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wickedly evil book","review":"This book intrigues me--I really like the whole twisting the Wizard into an evil despot and Elphaba into an Animal rights activist. There were certainly parts that were well worth reading. But the plot is disjointed and has too much just hanging there. I HATED the whole Philosophy Club part. I'd never read bestiality before, nor did I intend to, and there it was. How did it further the plot? Why was it even in there? How did Elphaba know to tell Glinda not to go in there? And what was it about the whole Ama funeral followed by the men's trip to the Philosophy Club that made Elphaba decide that she needed to go there and then to see the Wizard? And why did the result of that interview convince her to leave school? I just didn't get it. The connections weren't there for me. I feel guilty for having read the whole of it. I don't want my copy of the book any more, but I'm ashamed to give it to any one I care about."},{"rating":"1","title":"I struggled to keep reading it","review":"I recieved this book as a gift, along with tickets to see Wicked. I was so excited to start reading the book, until I actually started to read it. There was just way too many charecters to keep track of. When one of them died, I had to page back in the book to jog my memory on who in the heck it was. It took me 4 months to get through the book. I just found it rambling on & on. So needless to say, I was not excited to see the show after reading the book, but I was surprised. The show was great, the book sucked. If you are going to write a spinoff from one of the most loved movies of all time, thing should really be a little more accurate. I watched the Wizard of Oz again, and the book is inconsistant with the movie. It's a shame because I think this book had tons of potential but fell really flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward interface with original","review":"Maguire's lack of success in fitting his story, with the original Wizard of Oz story, condem this book to mediocrity. Its a strong compelling story until the moment Dorothy arrives. The pace changes, the narrative gets crisper, and the story carry forward to the witch's death with far less of the depth and texture than was in the previous pages. I would have much preferred if Maguire had not tried to be so true to the original story and resolved the witches life on his own. The scene where Dorothy kills the witch is just very inadequate - reads almost like a newspaper report. So I, like several others who reviewed here, was disappointed. I suggest either reading to where Dorothy arrives and stop, or begin when she arrives. In either case you will probably enjoy Mr. Maguire's book. Just don't read both."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was good.","review":"I enjoyed this book, but it is definitely an adult book. I would say that it is good to read with the perspective of it being a look at different political systems, much like the original Wizard of Oz book."},{"rating":"1","title":"They made a broadway musical out of this??","review":"I am halfway through this book, and was told its a little slow, yet so far it has not grasped me the way other similar fantasy books have. More to the point, how did they make a Broadway Musical out of this book? I guess I just don't get it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise, terrible execution.","review":"The only reason I even gave this book 1 star, let alone 2, is that it was the basis for the very charming and enjoyable Broadway play. Otherwise the book is just terrible. Maguire has created a wonderful plot line but he bogs it down with so much political detail that it just makes for a boring book to read. I managed to get through the first section and then gave up because I just didn't care anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offers Nothing","review":"The main character here is doomed from the start by a character flaw which is still present at the end, resulting in her insane death. One would hope to see some form of redemption (as in \\"A Spell for Chameleon\\", where the \\"evil magician\\" ultimately becomes the good king), but none is offered. Or perhaps some moral lesson to make the trip worthwhile, but I left feeling very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoping Against Hope","review":"And that's the summation of this book. I should start off by saying that truthfully I did really want to like this book. I'm not dogging on it just for the sake of ruffling a few feathers. It has an incredible concept and the plot is so inspired, as are the characters.However (and this is a big however) I find Maguire's writing completely lackluster. It's not sparse in some styleistic way, nor blunt in any sort of impacting way. It's just blah. And the times that he does try to put a little more 'oomph' into the writing at emotional and pivotal moments, it is just so clunky and stiff.As a result I really didn't care that much about the characers, and as inspired the plot points, I wasn't on the edge of my seat trying to find out what was next.I understand that there were some important themes to get across, I mean alienation, the question of predestination and all that which Maguire deals with in a pretty deft manner.But the writing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it.","review":"i loved the book. a bit of an abrupt ending, however, it does follow through with the original ending of the wicked witch of the west. despite that, the author really has transformed her into a great leading lady and you fall in love with her anyway.i would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost between a great idea and smut","review":"I bought this book with high hopes. I really wanted to enjoy it. At first I did! The birth narrative was humorous and exciting. Shortly after, however, the book fell apart. My main problem with this book is that is was not well written. The characters were shallow and unlikable. The plot was rushed and barely comprehensible at times. I was expecting a book which explored the depths of the characters of Glinda, Elphaba, etc. What I got instead was a writer who couldn't decide if he wanted to write a trashy romance novel or a semi-interesting action book. What he eventually turned out is a book which only teases to get better, but only gets worse with each sentence.I got it because I wanted to love it. Now, I would never recommend it to anyone unless you are really interested in an ankle deep approach to the land of Oz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bad Bad","review":"Simply the worst book I ever read. Many other reviewers detail the many reasons this book was a complete disappointment. I hated it from the beginning on but plugged thru the whole thing hoping it would redeem itself in the end. It didn't. What a waste. Wish I could give it ZERO stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a page turner","review":"I really had some great expectations with this book. What a great concept. What a mess. This book is a trainwreck. A mangled mess of characteration, plot (if one can be found) and storytelling. Where's the fantasy? Where's the magic?How can the Wicked Witch of the West be turned into the most boring villian in literary history? All the secondary characters are forgetable, only because they are never developed. That's the one thing I can say about the author, he's consistent. There are a lot of plot-holes, and unanswered questions. This book just doesn't have the ability to make you care, or to feel anything but relief that the last page has arrived... finally."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant concept fails in execution","review":"The idea of telling the story from the witch's point of view is genius. The first half of the novel kept my interest and made me even more curious about how the second half of the novel could possibly create a sensible explanation of the events in The Wizard of Oz. Instead, the second half gets muddled down in a listless plot that fails to provide a satisfactory relationship to either the 1939 movie or Baum's original novel.I'm glad that I read a synopsis of the musical after reading the novel. I think the plot from the musical is a far more interesting answer to the question of who the Wicked Witch of the West was."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but not great","review":"I really, really, really, wanted to read this book for some time. The premise is fascinating and the possibility is tantalizing. I finished and enjoyed the book, but it wasn't what I had anticipated. Elphaba definitely got a bum rap as the wicked witch. I enjoyed her college days and felt like just when things would be getting good, the story coursed off in another direction and I was kind of left wanting more. I love the fact that she had a lover and a child and there was so much more that could have been developed, but alas, it wasn't.The political manipulation of it all (Oz, the wizard, the witches, etc) could very well be from the pages of US today....I recommend it, but it still didn't meet my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"I'm still reading the book, I'm half way through and I'm surprised it's so bad...Actually I have to say it's boring. Very boring...YAWN!....I can't get myself to pick it up and continue. I really had high hopes for it but the right now I'm in the college years and I'm yet to get to the peak or close to the peak of the story.I think this book is riding on the success of THE WIZARD OF OZ story otherwise the storytelling is very poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blew me away","review":"I had no idea what I was going to be reading when I got this book, just heard it was good and picked it up.I read it, and I was just blown away, it's an amazing book, and really fills in all the blanks of the life of the wicked witch of the west, You almost feel part of her when your done reading it and definitely feel different about anything to do with the movie wizard of oz..It's graphic, funny, scary and sometimes just morbid, but just a darn good book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is a wonderful book. It breathes life into the cardboard world that we are all so used to seeing in The Wizard of Oz. Just great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever!","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is a definite must read, especially before watching the Broadway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just wasn't my cup of tea.","review":"One of the people in our book club wanted to read this. I found the book hard to read and spread thin on story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Climactic","review":"I was really intrigued when I picked up this book, eager to hear \\"the other side of the story.\\" I kept reading and reading and reading and then it was over. I had no clue what I had just read because I kept waiting for something to happen. The author seems like he's building up to some fantastic resolution or some \\"a-ha!\\" moment, but it never happens. As for the characters, not only could I not identify with any of their motivations, but I really didn't care about them. Were we supposed to feel pity or sympathy for Elphaba because I certainly didn't. I was tired of her surly, over-analytical meandering thoughts. I kept reading this because I thought I should and because I thought I was supposed to like it, but I was so relieved to be able to close this book and finally move on with my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but took it too, too far!","review":"The idea for the book was great, but the book was way too long, although the ending wasn't quite long enough. You shouldn't read this book until your 16 or 17, at least. It was way too confusing for me. Some parts of the book were more intersting than the others, and it was interesting to see into her life, but definately not a book to put on a young adults list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why trash up what could be a great story?","review":"My only real complaint about this book is the trashiness. Why do authors, screenwriters, etc., find it necessary to trash up what otherwise could be great stories? Now that it's been read, I will delete it from my Kindle library so my young readers won't accidentally start reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, boring, boring","review":"Don't know how they got the nerve to make a play out of this awful book, I found it so boring I couldn't finish.

The climax was at the end though and it felt like the story was going a little slow until the middle. After the middle of the book, it just keeps better and better! I have a hard time finishing books because I lose interest easily, but not for Wicked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I read this book to get the backstory of The Wizard of Oz. While the explicitness of the language did put me off a bit, I did enjoy reading it, but didn't quite even realize I was enjoying it until I came to the end of the story when Elphaba meets Dorothy. Once Elphaba met her own end, I was surprisingly disappointed. I was now so invested in the story, I didn't want it to end. (I continued with \\"Son of a Witch\\") The entirety of the story is wonderfully weaved, you don't condemn Elphaba for being a witch, you understand how she came to be. It was the only way she knew..."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is always 2 sides to a story","review":"I adored this book! I couldn't put it down. I chose it because I heard the musical was up for a Tony or two and I was looking for a new book to read. Since this book was referring to The Wizard of Oz and someone made a musical out of it I was expecting a light-hearted story with humor scattered about like peanut shells at a steak house. But it is not. I was pleasantly surprised by it's deep story...love, betrayal, jealously, friendship, racism, politics and sex...oh-la-la! It could be a soap opera. I loved it! I couldn't help but imagine the characters as they look in Fleming's movie, especially towards the ill fated end. It is a strange feeling changing your allegiance from one team to another...i.e. Glinda is now bad to me, Dorothy a pawn and don't get me started on the Wizard! :) I just bought Son of a Witch yesterday and can't wait to see what happens in the land of Oz!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who isn't a little \\"Wicked\\"?","review":"Who in this world has not at least heard of the \\"Wizard of Oz\\"? We all know all about Dorothy and her side of the journey but what about the Wicked Witch of the West? Gregory Maguire has done a terrific job of introducing us to the story of the Wicked Witch and her not so wicked ways. This story is not a happy one though; it is full of the burdens of a troubled outcast and the eventual death of this person. It's a story of a woman who refuses to conform, let go of her morals and give up her beliefs in a corrupt society. This book tells you to fight for what you want and believe in even if it kills you. This book is for people who understand that not every story can have a happily ever after."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked Cool","review":"This book captured my attention from the beginning with it's wonderful concept. I had very low expectations, having been very disappointed with another twist on the Oz story, WAS, which I found so poorly written, I couldn't finish it. This book was very different. I am grateful that McGuire's prose was complex and interesting, his characters three-dimensional and realistic (even the Goat with his lack of opposable thumbs and a PhD), and a HEROINE (not a hero). Not only is she a heroine, she's a fabulously intelligent, self-sufficient, sexy and original one. I loved that. I was disapointed to come to th end, wanting to spend a few more generations in the land of Oz. This book is a good, fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love it or hate it??","review":"I know that some people really enjoyed the book, but I was not a fan. I can honestly say that I never hated a book until I read this one. It was incredibly slow, had a lot of GRAPHIC and equally DISTURBING content, and there was no resolution. I agree with an earlier review that I felt absolutely no connection to the characters, and didn't care what happened to them. I didn't know if I was supposed to feel sorry for Elphaba, or if he meant for me to hate her, but at the end, I just hated everyone in the book. No endearing qualities for anyone in Oz, apparently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've ever read","review":"This is the worst book that I've ever read!!! I received it as a gift and felt bad the person wasted their money on it. Not to mention my waste of time reading this. I kept waiting for it to get interesting, but it was just awful. If you are a fan of the Wizard of Oz, this will be a BIG disapointment. This book is now in a landfill where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"This book is a very slow read, and half of the time the story does not focus on the main character. The story drifts from the plot in several places and does not stay true to the real story of OZ. When the book reaches the points with Dorothy and her group the story changes to fit the book and not stay true to the movie (which came first by the way). If you are a fan of the movie then DO NOT read this book, you are in for a big disapointment. This was a big waste of my time and my money. Wicked is nothing more than a piece of published fan-fiction, and Gregory Maguire should be ashamed for making money off of someone elses work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Ado about nothing","review":"I cannot believe this book was so popular. It was slow, boring, and ridiculously arrogant. The author took a wonderful premise and completely dissected it until there was nothing left but a few interesting crumbs which were quickly swept away. This could have been a beautiful dark story but Maguire weighed it down with misguided political and philosophical banter and turned a fabled icon into a sex starved coed working for the Oz equivalent of PETA. Don't pay for this book. If you're curious, rent it from your local library and save yourself 15 dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointing","review":"I was very intrigued by this book and then very disapointed. I think it was a great idea to explore the life and times of the wicked witch. It was a great idea but I found the characters fell flat. It was a disapointing and painful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what we expected","review":"My husband and I bought this book (in fact, the author's other similar books as well) and we were very disappointed. We felt like the descriptions of this book were misleading: this is NOT a funny or light-hearted book by any means. As another reviewer wrote, there is too much unnecessary sex and vulgarity and the plot is very slow. We sent all of these books back to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreeing with the very first review!","review":"This was a horrible book for such a great idea. I thought this book was going to be so good and I couldn't wait to get it when I ordered it from the library. I read about half and had to skip to a few pages at the end just to say I gave it a chance. I could not read anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"How soon we forget","review":"Macquire exercises writers' license in assuming an interpretation totally out of character with L. Frank Baum's original writing. Most others refer to the film of the Wizard of Oz when making a link; few have read the unabridged original writing when making their comparison. Baum's purpose was to write children's fantasy without the nightmarish potions that Macguire stirs up. As another reader said, \\"This isn't even fit for adults.\\" Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musical to Book, Book to Musical","review":"I was very disappointed with this book for the following reasons. First, I must admit I saw the musical before reading the book and therefore I kept expecting events which took place in the musical to occur in the book, they did not. Second, the author I felt did not develop the relationships between characters and therefore I did not care about what happened to them. Third, after seeing the musical I expected a fun light read, this book is not, it is very dark and graphic. Fourth, the musical is appropriate for middle school children and older, the book on the other hand I don't feel is appropriate do to the sex, affairs and other events narrated in graphic detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"Nice idea, horrible read. This is a disjointed story at best. None of the family and friends who have read the book this summer liked it. We all thought the story was too fragmented, bits and pieces, but either poorly or not connected together at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"I am over 60 years old, have read thousands of books and this is one of 5 books I gave myself permission to stop reading. It is gibberish! Waste of time! The worse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked","review":"How such a delightful play was created from this disgusting novel is beyond me. If you like perversion, this book is for you. Please don't let this sordid book keep you from seeing this magnificent play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly Dirty","review":"After seeing the amazing stage production of the same name, we bought this book and were excited to read more about it. We were shocked by the opening chapters to be reading such filth! Why were such dirty details necessary--the musical didn't need them in order to be successful! We kept reading for a bit to see if it cleaned up to get on with the story, but unfortunately it did not. It was sad to have to put it away, unfinished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, bad book","review":"When I first heard of the premise of this book, I thought, \\"Wow, what a great idea!\\" I still think it is a great idea for a book, however, this book was incredibly disappointing! Too many odd names and places which makes it difficult to follow. After reading 1/2 of this book, I took it to a used book store and made $1.50 off of it. I was tired of wasting my time reading it each night hoping the story would hook me. It never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"Maguire takes an excellent idea, the Wicked Witch of the West's story from her perspective, and proceeds to tell a tale of brutish, drunken, evil, louts who bore the reader almost from the very first page. No one in this over long and boring tale earns a modicum of sympathy from the reader, and this one only kept reading in hope that it would somehow change its tone. It never did. Avoid this unless you are a sadist."},{"rating":"1","title":"B O R I N G","review":"One of those, I am glad I read it, but will tell you the story so you don't waste your money or TIME!Could have been 200 pages shorter.Could have not lost my interest every other page.Could have saved myself money.Whoever read this book and said this would be a great play, has to be a genius. This book was SOOO BORING! It took me over a week to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"a brilliant exercise in wordsmithing","review":"ok. loved it. just loved it. you'd never think that you'd find yourself sympathetic to the wicked witch. wait, sympathetic isn't quite right. you actually find yourself rooting for her.what's so ironic, is that you know how it's all going to end. yet somehow you find yourself trying to figure out ways that the ending will change and something else will happen. such an odd feeling. and delightful.read this book. even if it didn't tie into a beloved classic, it would be considered an excellent piece of story telling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wickedly Boring","review":"I was disappointed in this book! It reminded me of the semester at Indiana University in which we spent the entire class discussing James Joyce's ULYSSES--and nothing else!This book seems forced and overly thematic. The struggle between good and evil is inflated, and I finished the book with heavy lids. Not recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish there was an option for zero stars!","review":"I read this book after seeing the amazing musical. They are so different that it's hard to believe this book inspired the musical. It took me at least a year to read it. It was not only boring in parts, but the subject line became inappropriate, for young/sensitive readers, I was disgusted by some of it. This book was the biggest literary disaapointment I have ever read. I only kept reading, because I had hope that it would get better. It didn't. I now recommend that people see the musical and avoid the book, if they are looking for an uplifting story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than mediocre.","review":"I once heard a teenage box office salesman describe Chekov's Three Sisters as \\"three hours about not going to Moscow.\\" That's pretty much how I feel about this crap novel. Maguire creates setup after setup that have no payoff. The characters are static and thin, the weak drama makes daytime TV seem edgy...I just can't overstate my distaste for this novel. Maguire seems to have tried something that's way beyond his reach. I can't believe he's built a career exploiting L. Frank Baum's fictional universe. Carpet baggery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother: see the play instead","review":"If I had read this weird book first, I never would have gone to see the play. Fortunately for me, I saw the play first. The play is great; the book is awful.The play is based only loosely on the book, taking only its concept and telling a much better and enjoyable story.But the book is weird and perverted and no fun. The ending makes no sense: after hundreds of pages of character development, the conclusion is both non-sequitur and non-sense.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book needed years more of work","review":"Having just finished Wicked, I find consolation in the 1-star reviews. The author, with all his noble intentions, fails - like the poor Elphaba -in all of them. So much promise, and such an annoying and depressing result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The book is completely different than the musical - loved the musical, hated the book. The book was very racy and hard to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am an avid reader and I HATED this book!!!","review":"This book is a HUGE waste of time. I do not understand what the POSITIVE hype is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Wicked\\" is only one word to describe this book . . .","review":"Other more appropriate words are heinous, terrible, awful and atrocious. Around the third disk I found myself fighting back the urge to scream \\"make it stop\\"! If you are a fan of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" you will NOT be a fan of this book. From the incestuous sex of puppets to the constant insinuation that the Wicked Witch of the West was born a hermaphrodite you will be asking yourself \\"why?\\" Why did the author turn something so beautiful and magical into such a dark and ugly place? Maguire even goes as far as to make the Munchkins into lawless, over -sexed freaks. Save your money and time. This was four hours of my life I will never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"I loved the Wizard of Oz. I saw the musical Wicked on Broadway and loved it. But I can't say the same for the book. This is one that I really struggled with to finish. It's a dark story that has no relation to the plot of the musical. It's hard to follow and at points down right confusing. Maybe it just not my cup of tea. This is not a book that I could recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked is deplorable!!!","review":"I typically don't read this genre, but I'm going to see the musical, and was told to read the book beforehand. What a waste of time!I don't think I can expand on the criticism already posted. There is so much potential to weave a great story, however the author truly missed the mark time and time again. Pointless, wordy meandering seems to best describe the storyline.Skip the book. Hopefully the musical is worthy of praise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choppy and incomplete","review":"After hearing all the excitement over the broadway musical, I thought I would read the book. I was very disappointed. I found there to be a LOT of sexual references that were not needed and detracted from the story! There was also occasional profanity that seemed to come from no where. Take out all the uncessary filler and the book would be about 1/3 the size, but then it would be the story of the wicked witch of the west. I think I would have been drawn more into her life if there weren't so many distractions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I heard so much about this book, thought it would be great. So this was quite disappointing. The original series of OZ stories are so much better. They are not always happy either. This book borrows a lot from them, but with less originality. Decidedly not a children's book, parts are offensive. The concept is good, but execution not so hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever?","review":"Can't believe it's able get published. I read about 90 pages hoping it would get better. By far the worst reading ever. Waste of time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberal Agenda?","review":"The story of Alphaba, Wicked Witch of the West, was quite interesting. However the liberal agenda used in Maguires' writing was overpowering. Where else can one find political corruption, equal rights for all, animal rights, sexuality than in the liberal arena. What is Maguire trying to promote in the book; the story of the Wicked Witch or his ideals?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible execution of a terrific idea","review":"I chose this book for my book club without having read it first. Biggest mistake EVER! This book is a MESS. The author lacks any real focus. He needed an editor badly. The story needed to be stripped down to its essence and then written in a straight-forward way. I felt no closer to knowing what really made the Wicked Witch of the West who she was. Also, I have to agree with many others that the sexual content was not only completely unnecessary, but overly gratuitous and revolting. I purchased this book and rather than loan it out, or give it away, I am throwing it away (something I have NEVER done before)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply dreadful!","review":"I heard this book was very in, it was even made into a certain musical comedy. I was expecting ointments on how to turn your skin green, be extra wicked, attach wings to small and fairly frightening monkeys ect. but all I got was a boring story about talking animals and a very in a popular girl. They made this Galinda character apeear more in and popular than I, which entirely untrue. When I read about the big clock, I was appalled because big clocks are entirly not in, and therefore out. Rubbish. Don't buy this book. It is an out book. Therefore, it is NOT in! The part where she has an affair is kind of in though. After all, I'm having one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked- The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West","review":"I rate this book so low because of the vulgar topics reviewed in the book. Topics involving things that should never be written about. I do not recommend this book to anyone who uphold high morals of language and propriety."},{"rating":"1","title":"True story of the wicked witch?","review":"The concept certainly had potential. But this author simply couldn't pull it off. There is no plot. The story rambles and digresses. Characters and places with unpronounceable names come and go. The author's attempts at sexual content come off as simply lurid. There are no characters to whom one is drawn, especially not the protagonist, Elphaba, who is self-absorbed and hateful. I \\"read\\" the unabridged CD version. I picked up the book to give me background before going to see the musical, Wicked. I wish I hadn't. The book is dark and depressing where the musical is light and fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"So what!","review":"This book was recommended by a close friend and I was intrigued by the concept. I couldn't get past page 31. It was so forced and so \\"clever\\" I couldn't stand it and stopped reading. Thank heaven I had only borrowed the book. I'm sure it will please amd amuse some. I'm not 'some'."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a total waste of time... a lot of time","review":"What a long drawn out unbelievably boring book. I was so ready for an intellegent analytical look at what could possibly make a person become a witch, and instead I got this unanalyzed jumble of characters book which left me with no further understanding and time that I can't get back. This book was really bad.... there was not a single character that I liked, looked up to or even understood. This is saying a lot because there were so many characters it was hard to keep up with all of them and remember their relation to one another, but as the book moved from character to character there was not a single time when I wished he would go back and write more about any one of them. There are so much better books out there, don't even waste your time with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"phew","review":"This book is one of the rare ones that I find unenjoyable, unreadable and boring. Read about 30 pages and threw it away. Will not recommend it. The transaction was acceptable but the product wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid, Ghastly Waste of Time","review":"I want my $10 and several hours of my time back! This is one of the most boring, poorly written books I have ever read! He is overly wordy but not at all descriptive kind of like Victor Hugo without adding to the story. The characters are not at all compelling or interesting. I literally bleed for the poor junior editor that had to work on this. Honestly I'd rather re-read Beowolf before this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked","review":"I'd been hearing great things about Wicked and Confessions of an Ugly Step-Sister for quite awhile, so I finally read Wicked. And I was blown away. It's a book that you can't put down. Maguire's Oz is a far cry from the original Oz, but it's presented with such radiant clarity and so dynamic that you instantly feel part of the setting. The characters are beautifully developed, despite my fears that Maguire would rest most of their personality traits on what the reader remembered from the movie or from the original books. An amazing twist on a classical story, Maguire's portrayal of the Wicked Witch of the West (aka Elphaba) gives a new face to evil, a new persepective on what we normally take at face value. An enjoyable yet thoughtful read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new favorite","review":"i thought this book was one of the best that i have read yet and the comparison of life in Oz to the real world was well done. It makes y ou realize that the characters you see in stories are not what they always seem to be. In the original Wizard of Oz and in the movie, the Witch is portrayed as horribly evil, but in Wicked, you find out the Elphaba is just a regular person. But to understand the story you have to reach a bit under the surface, not just critisize everything in it... Can't wait to read Gregory Maguire's other books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, Dull Book","review":"If only a really special and interesting author had had the idea that Gregory Maguire had, to write a novel about the early years of the Wicked Witch of the West. Alas, the idea was had by Gregory Maguire, who seems to have a lot of really good ideas but no real idea of what to do with them.There are a lot of interesting ideas in Wicked, from recasting the Wizard of Oz as a Hitlerian Machiavellian political schemer and tyrant to having Glinda and the Wicked Witch be childhood pals. Unfortunately, the ideas remain ideas, and Maguire never makes the book take off into anything special or memorable.If Angela Carter had written this, it would have been an unforgettable adventure into fantasy, terrible and beautiful. Gregory Maguire takes a dazzling idea and makes it dull as dishwater. Quite simply, an ordinary novel about extraordinary events and characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"I'm seeing a lot of high-and-mighty reviews here. The truth is, this book isn't only readable by \\"intellectuals.\\" The writing is fairly good, though his other books are better. The main problem with this book, though, is the unnecessary sex. I don't want to quibble with the amount - is it too vulgar? - but nevertheless, graphic sex in a book is supposed to serve a purpose, and in this book it doesn't. It doesn't help the story along at all, though the plot idea is pretty interesting.The musical, on the other hand, is amazing! Though it hardly follows the book, the plot is more creative, and the story is beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning this book is NOT for young teens!","review":"Warning! This book is not for young teens! The words \\"hermaphrodite\\" and \\"castration\\" appear in the first pages. There are graphic, hardcore sexual references made repeatedly throughout the story including a representation of a man leaving his marital bed, sprouting a second set of genitalia and copulating with a widow and her daughter at the same time. This book is a dark, warped social commentary on politics and ignorance, it is not a happy elaboration on the fantasy world of Baum. I have read other books by Gregory Maguire and enjoyed them, but this book is a shocker - and not in a good way. The musical Wicked recommends that the play is not for children under 8. The book should not be recommended to anyone under 17. This is rough stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Premise... Nothing More!","review":"I can't believe the good reviews this book has pulled in. Inconsistent and poorely writen, I never once found my imagination roaming the enchanted world of OZ. It was as if the author thought he was being clever in showing the true events (behind the scenes). Even when the author recants the point which Dorothy acquires the ruby shoes, he does so without the Wicked Witch being pressent... that's not how I remember it. Come on Gregory, at least do your homework!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don,t bother","review":"Wicked was the worst book I have ever stopped reading. It is very poorly written. The author contiually uses unnecesary $10 words I guess to try to fill the page. Way overdone. It is no wonder they had to remake the play otherwise no one would ever go see it. I really hate that I PAID for this book. Yuck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice companion piece","review":"Having seen the show, it's kind of nice to see the book \\"tied-in\\" to the musical. It's the same thing as the original book's publsihing, but this version has a few nice, quailty pictures added in. The story of the musical and the book itself differs so don't buy this book expecting the story of the musical. If you're a theatre fan, and would like a different cover, then by all means buy it and add it to your collection. I myself have my copy of the book, in its original form, signed and bought this copy to re-read without ruining my orignial :) Don't buy this book with the big expectation that it's completely different from its original publishing. Buy this book for its incredible story and depth, and buy whatever cover you fancy...in my opinion, both designs are wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept waiting for it to get better...","review":"I was relieved to read the other reviews here who felt the same way I did about this book. I ended up struggling through the first half which took weeks (normally I read a GOOD book of this length in a few days at most). I kept expecting it to get better - it didn't. I don't remember the last time I didn't finish a book. I do know a couple of people who loved it. If you decide to read it, borrow it - and good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of unifinished threads. very disappointing","review":"This had so much promise and is written in a nice style. However, throughout the book story lines are started and never brought to conclusion. The ending seems forced and is altogether unsatisfying. A continuity master certainly would have helped. In a final analysis it seems the author had a great idea and some skill but could not deliver. This is an altogether depressing and unlikeable work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbled, tangled, meandering, not an enjoyable read","review":"I kept reading and reading this book page by page, waiting and waiting for it to make some kind of sense and it never did. I got to the end and was more disappointed by any book I've been in a long time. The language and ideas were just too garbled most of the time and it was hard to keep track of it all. I won't read anything by this author again, just not my cup of tea. I feel like asking for my money back on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love OZ, you'll HATE this book","review":"Other then stealing the names and geography you'll find nothing of Baum's Oz in this book. This Oz is filled with prejudice, hatred, sex, religious intolerance, politics, backstabbing, adultery, and every other low disgusting behavior ever exhibited by humans. Not one character is noble or even particularly likeable.If you have not done much reading of serious literature you may find Macguires themes on the nature of evil interesting. But Shakespeare and Shelly did them already. If you are a reader, I doubt you'll find anything new.I admit this is all dressed up in well-written prose. And if you enjoy verbose introspection, by all means try the book out. But if you have fond memories of Baum's originals you'll probably find this betrayal of Oz too painful too enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked: Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West","review":"This was truly a weird book. None of the characters were endearing and I did not like the bestiality or heavy politics. I kept reading it, hoping it would get better, but it never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Hope","review":"The premise of this book is a great idea. I've seen the musical version three times and absolutely love it and so, I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, those hopes were dashed. As with other reviewers, about half way through I began to question the intent. I kept the hope alive however, because, having seen the musical, I had an idea of where this story could go. All I can say is that I was sorely disappointed. I recommend reading several reviews before purchasing this item as others will have differing opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long With No Development!","review":"Honestly, I was disappointed, but not in the way I expected. I thought the book would be silly, but instead of silly it was...boring. Maguire seems to have a lot of different axes he wants to grind, with the end result being that nothing really gets the notice it deserves. It's like he wanted to have everything, and he did: but nothing got really looked into.The extended review of this blog is available at [...]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not everyone's cup of tea","review":"If you're a fan of the old Oz stories, you may be quite disappointed like me. Going into this, I was not expecting or hoping for cursing and sexual vulgarities, and after a while it became annoying. There's too much of it, and the storytelling is not exactly engrossing. There's the musical, which I'm sure is delightful in its own way, but far too much of this book and the musical have to do with the \\"Let's sparkle! Let's be dramatic!\\" state of mind. If you're into that, you will probably like this. But if you watched Return to Oz and thought \\"now THIS is how Oz stories should be\\", then I'd suggest giving it a miss.For the record, this is not folk-lore for Oz. The author is not the same man who wrote the originals, which I think it stands to question: \\"Why don't you create your own fictional world?\\" This just encourages the use of remaking things.So not my cup of tea. Possibly not yours. It's just a warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I wanted to like this book, I really did, but I just couldn't. The only characters who are in the least bit sympathetic all have terrible things happen to them. There is no real plot to speak of--just a drawn-out narrative of the life (and times) of a fictional character. This, combined with random scenes of bizarre sexuality (a man has an affair with a woman AND her husband, Tiger on human sex, etc.), made this book painful to plod through.Maguire is trying to delve into issues of government oppression, race, prejudice, etc., but he fails. He does accomplish one rare feat--to be grotesquely bizarre and mind-numbingly boring at the same time. Unless you like Darker and Edgier adaptations that serve no purpose other than to be Dark and Edgy (and bizarre and boring), I would pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Veeerryyyyy boring....","review":"I was extremely excited to read this book, but unfortunately is was a huge let down. Very, very boring...The author did a very poor job of living up to the expectations he had set..which he made me feel like the book was going to be dark, and exciting and have a rare look into the Witch's life by the way he described this book on the back cover. I found this book very hard to read by the wording he chose to use... I think he was flattering himself by using such uncomprehendable words for the general public.. And also he likes to say s*** and piss a lot for no relative reason... There's honestly so much negative stuff I have to say about this book that there just wouldn't be enough time. My hopes are that some other author will remake this book into what it is supposed to be! Please! That would be awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand how anyone could love this book.","review":"I was drawn to this book because I loved The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. This book got me reading through almost half of it until it became unbearable. I really had to force myself to read it. I hate starting a book and not finishing, but this is just a waste of time. The lack of descriptions give you no choice but to just make assumptions, and it's just so bland and confusing. I know this is an allegorical book, so I guess that's why Maguire had to force in some parts that just don't go with the rest of the story, just so he could give it depth. Personally, I hated it. I am writing this review because I don't want anybody else to waste their precious time and money on a book that's not worth it. I heard the musical was very different BTW. PARENTS BE WARNED: This is not a children's book. There are lots of parts detailing sex (even bestiality)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Start but Wonderful Read-","review":"I admit I started this book twice before finishing it however once I made it past around the first 100 pages of the book I LOVED it. I did attempt to read this book once and did not make it very far at all before losing interest and putting it down. I decided to see the touring production of the show when it came to town and at that point loved the story and loved Elphaba. After seeing the show I decided to attempt to finish the book, I started back at the beginning, again the beginning bored me soo much but I was determined to finish this book. Once making it 100 pages or so into the book I could not put it down. The book does differ greatly from the show and has a darker theme however I was sucked into the world of OZ and was sad for it to end. I will be reading Son of a Witch shortly but at this point I'm not sure that Wicked can be beat with a follow up. I will never look at the Wizard of Oz the same way again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmm...","review":"...just wanted to say: Anybody expecting the fun, light-hearted story that is shown in the broadway show Wicked, will not be satisfied with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book was highly recommended to me and I see that most of the other reviews are very good but I don't get it. I found the book incredibly uninteresting and dull to read. My sister read it at the same time and had the same opinion.I was expecting the book to have a lot of clever tie-ins and twists relating back to the L. Frank Baum novels. Instead, I found a story that barely had anything to do with the original works, either in tone or substance. The new story just didn't interest me at all. Maybe I missed something but I could barely get through the book so couldn't recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing close to a fun read","review":"This is the kind of thing you need a degree in literture to appreciate. The characters just sort of wander from here to there purposelessly to no real impact on the world around them. Sex is rampant, but brings little happiness. Family ties are burdensome and intrusive. There is no fidelity. Religion is constantly referenced, but resolves nothing. Mysterious dwarfs and hags lurk in the fringes, affecting people in subtle ways. Are they working towards evil or good? It doesn't seem to really matter either way. Opression, environmental destruction, fascism, nihlism and terrorism topped off with heaping dollops of enui. I kept reading waiting for something to make me care or feel for the title charector, or any charactor for that matter, but in the end, I felt like I wasted $20 at the airport."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Depressing. Do yourself a favor and see the Musical!","review":"I loved the musical \\"Wicked\\" so I bought the book. The book is a total downer and just keeps dragging on. I just didn't see the depth appreciated by other readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I have read everyday for 10 years waiting for a book this good! Entertaining, thiught provoking, and simply wonderful. On a whimsical premise, this book quickly scooped me up and preoccupied me for months after finishing. It was suprisingly wonderful. If you enjoyed this, you probably grew up with The Neverending Story, Chronicles of Narnia and were secretly hoping for an adult version. Read this! And a similar and equaly wonderful book: The Life of Pi. Afterall, you have nothing to lose except a few afternoons....."},{"rating":"1","title":"takes the fun out of OZ","review":"This book is a real downer. It is way too adult for teens. It's more about government and religion than the witch. The only reason I finished it was because I had it on CD and I was driving a long distance. I kept waiting for it to resemble the movie in some way. The only way it did was the characters names.This book isn't funny or fun and really isn't even fantasy. It's more of a soap.I've yet to read the original OZ book the movie is based on but if it is like this, I won't be reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"audiobook","review":"like it a lot. sounds good works great.it did skip a little at first but I cleaned it and it works great now.Deborah"},{"rating":"2","title":"great discussion book","review":"This book was extremely interesting and entertaining. Besides the subject being so unique and humorous, this complex story is full of satire and intelligent humor. I could definitley see myself reading this book more than once and would recommend it to anyone. I also think this is a perfect book for more than one person to read and discuss, there are even discussion topics in the last pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal...","review":"I just loved the approach the author took with this story, making a formerly completely unsympathetic evil into a woman with dreams and hopes for a better world. Wow. I loved the politicization of the land of Oz, the simplification of the wicked witch's arch-nemesis Galinda/Glinda, and the glimpses into the complicated person that she was. I guess there are truly two sides to every story and this time the other side was magically captured. If you like intrigue, politics, powerful women, magic with a logical explanation and lastly, if you like to look at stories you THINK you know in a whole new light, this is the one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Embracing the Crone","review":"With all the cross-cultural juxtaposition and social commentary this turns out to be a fine read. I was expecting something more similar to his Stepsister tale, but this was, in my opinion, even better.Although the diamond-patterned prince was pretty hot, I would like to have seen a little more of Elphaba's conscious embracing of her power, proud and unashamed. Can't a girl ever get away with being un-pretty and un-pleasing and un-charming? Perhaps portraying her strength would clash with his hopes of making her a sympathetic character. Also, the author seemed to be thinking out loud about his views on religion...did he ever make up his mind?"},{"rating":"2","title":"How creative!","review":"All I can say is Gregory Maguire has a wonderful imagination and is a stunning writer. I love the concept of taking a story and writing it from a different point of view. The main reason I loved this book is that it is so completely different from all of the other books on the market today. My book group read it a few years ago and we ALL were completely captivated by it. A great \\"escape\\" book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Endorsed by an Oz Fanatic!","review":"I grew up reading the whole series of Oz books by Frank Baum, and lesser sequels by other authors. Wicked is completely true to the fantasy and integrity of the Land of Oz created by Baum, and brings even more dimension to that fantastic land. You will believe in Oz when you read this, and you will never look at the Wicked Witch of the West the same again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a great book, but he needs to make a sequel!!!!","review":"I loved the book, it showed Oz and innocent little Dorothy from a different point of view. You got to learn what made 'The Wicked Witch' wicked. But it leaves you hanging. What ever happened to the shoes? What happened to Nor and Liir? He definitly needs to make a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"spellbinding!","review":"It gave me a new outlook on good and evil, and showed me that you have to know both sides of a story to evaluate it properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"More political propaganda than character development","review":"This book could have been so good, but it isn't. If it really would have told the \\"true\\" story of the Wicked Witch of the West, it would have been a wonderful story, but it focuses way more on the political atmosphere of Oz, in a preachy way, than on the life of Elphaba (the Wicked Witch of the West)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book! Couldn't put it down","review":"I loved this book for so many reasons. Not only does it give a great spin on the already unforgetable characters it also introduces some great new ones. I really loved this book because the 'ugly girl' was the one I cheered for, which i also loved in confessions of an ugly stepsister. Although the end was rushed and left me with a few questions, i always recommend this book to my friends and i recommend it as a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste Of Time","review":"I am a huge Wizard of Oz fan and thought I would enjoy this book. I was so disappointed. This author rambles on so much that I found my mind wondering while I was reading. The story was a great idea but someone else could probably tell it better (and in 100 less pages)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"This book was disqusting, it was nothing like i thought it would be. In the first chapter there was graphic sex and as i flipped through the rest of the book it continued on. I would not have bought this book if I had known the nature of it. The reviews from previous readers said what a great book it was but anyone with any sort of a moral compass should avoid this book! I actually threw this book away after reading the first chapter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and your time","review":"This is book is impossible to read and the author loves talking down to the readers with hundreds of words that most people don't know. Save your money and don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"AdamAppleby is right...this book sucks!","review":"AdamAppleby had it right, and everyone who disagreed is an idiot.How can you like this book? It's not even entertaining? None of you probably even read it, you just like to have it in your bookcase because it's trendy.And for the guy who thinks it's \\"silly\\" to buy a sequel prior to reading the original.....you obviously aren't an optimist. And you don't think logically. When Amazon offers free shipping for orders over $25, doesn't it make sense to go ahead and order the series? Yeah, I thought so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Excuse For Evil","review":"While loving the music from the show..The book is symbolic of what is wrong with our culture today...the philosophy that 'other people cause people to be evil'..Excuses give one persmission to fail and or to do wrong..There are countless examples of people who overcame troubling youth..Of course the cruel father was a 'minister'..I know many ministers and none of them are like that..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love is Irregular","review":"It's a good book if you have the patience.

It's called Love is Irrregular: Fairy Tales without the Moral Fiber. go to www.loveisirregular.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Really Bad","review":"I'm afraid I can't even spend enough time writing an in depth review of this book because I am just so glad to be done with it. I just wanted to add my vote to the one star side of the amazon spectrum. I can't believe the hype this book got away with. ah well. I was so disappointed, I wanted it to be a good book, but it was a horrible, unintelligible collection of drivel. boo. My sister kept advising that I quit trying to finish it. \\"The ending isn't any better than the rest of it\\" she kept telling me. And she was right. I didn't like any of the characters, they never meant anything to me. The plot was so disjointed and random, I have serious concerns about the author and his mental health. I am so happy that my life can now go on, and I can focus on new reading material. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry - No L. Frank Baum is MaGuire","review":"Despite the hype, this simply is not a good book in any way. It plodded along, failed to engage into the characters, had a convoluted and improbable plot, considering the source material, and simply ran out of plot gas. What is the adoration? The musical ain't much better (not one decent song). Such be the power of hype - and L. Frank Baum is spinning in his grave. Look was has been done to beautiful and wondrous Oz by this piker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, badly executed","review":"Given all the great reviews and my general interest in the whole \\"good/evil\\" question I was really expecting a great read. He starts off great, but as the story wears on it seems to lack direction, as if the author doesn't seem to know where it's going himself. This is especially true towards the end when Dorothy appears and the episodes seem somewhat contrived to fit Maguire's original storyline.All in all it's a great idea, but it could have been better written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked","review":"I bought the book before I saw the play. Thank God I didn't read it first. After seeing the play, I started reading the book...it's hard to tell where they got their material for the play; they're not really similar. The book is very dark and a hard read. It was a stuggle to get through the book. I'm going to see the play two more times because I absolutely loved it, but would recommend to anyone who is going to see the play--don't read the book before or after!!!! Just enjoy your memories of the play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch","review":"This book is dreadful. It takes forever to get going, the storyline is unintelligable. Skip this \\"story\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear 12 year olds, DONT READ THIS!","review":"I am actually a mature 12 year old, but this book was NOT something I should have read. Although I knew what was going on, it was much to detailed. I am into young adult books, but this book was too much. Really, a book is normally more than just sex. Well this book is not. Save it for when you are older."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West","review":"I bought this book expecting a delightful fantasy book, geared towards teenagers, but entertaining to adults as well. Boy, was I wrong. I was uncomfortable at the beginning in Gregory Maguire's explicit details of Elphaba's mother's adultrous affairs, but I got through it expecting the story to only have one way to go and that's to get better. Wrong again!! When I got to the part of the symbolic orgy involving a tiger, a drugged university student and a woman, I slammed the book shut in horror as I was reading it in public. I didn't want anyone I knew to see me reading that book. I came home, warned all of my friends about the book, and then promptly threw it in the trash. That's all that this book is good for--trash. If I could give the book 0 stars, I would. I will never buy another book by Gregory Maguire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, boring and disturbing","review":"My wife and I bought the unabridged audio CD set of this book, hoping to enjoy a nice engaging story on our drive to a vacation getaway. Boy, were we in for a surprise! At 43 years of age, we've heard a lot of inappropriate language on TV and in movies, but the use of language by the characters in \\"Wicked\\" seemed more than inappropriate. Combine that with the disturbing descriptions of sexual thoughts/activities in the book and we began to wonder about the pedophilic tendencies of the author. We quit listening to the CDs and debated throwing them away because we couldn't think of any of our friends or family with whom we would want to share this stuff.This book is not for Christians, old people, young people or any combination thereof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very vulgar","review":"For a book that I thought that would be like the musical very family oriented. In the first few pages I just thought it was horridly vulgar. Not a book I would recomend to any friends or family."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was ----TOTALLY AWFUL!!!","review":"I can't believe readers are giving this book FIVE stars! I belong to a book club and this book was chosen as one of our 'reads' because of the reviews it received and because, by the description, it sounded like it would be an amusing read. Six out of seven of us thought it was one of the worst books we've ever read. Don't waste your money or your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Young Adults or Kids","review":"I was shocked at the most pornographical scene I have ever read. This was a scene acted out by wooden puppets, of a married man with a widow and her daughter at the same time. I was so angry to come across such filth that I stopped reading right there on page 13. I had been so excited to read it but it was not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked the concept of the book","review":"I liked the concept of the book, and I did find a lot of the ideas to be interesting. But frankly, I got lost in all the religious jargon. I could have lived without half of it. There was more description and detail in the 4 (were there only 4?) religions than the rest of the story. There were so many things that could have been expanded on but he spent soooo much time on the religions. I was so glad to finally be finished with the book. I just wanted it over. I can't even say now if I enjoyed it or not. It was ok, but it could have been a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"There hasn't been a book I couldn't read all the way through in a long time. I felt that the auther came up with all the topics that make people uncomfortable (religion, politics, sex, etc.) and then put the most controversial aspects of each into this story. I agree that the plot of this book was intriguing, but even with such an original idea, when I realized that I was avoiding reading (and I never do that) I finally put it down for good, and I gave it away as fast as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really tried to care...","review":"The whole time I was reading this book I had to struggle to maintain even a small amount of concern for the main character, the future Wicked Witch of the West. The various sections of the book which depicted different portions of her life seemed contrived and disjointed. None of the supporting characters were even remotely interesting, except possibly her sister. The constant sexual innuendo, while sometimes humerous, seemed rather randomly injected.Also, much to my surprise, there is very little similarities to the original story of Oz. And while The Wizard of Oz was a childhood classic, this book is not at all appropriate for children. Besides the sex, kids would be bored silly with all the political, religious, and philosophical discussions. All the hype for this title seems strange because despite the great concept, I found the book dull and mostly uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Must Avoid","review":"As a fan of Broadway musicals, I wanted to read the book before seeing the show (never heard of the book prior to the musical). There were several points while reading WICKED that I wanted to put it down and not finish it I was so offended and appalled at Maguire's writing.My wife also read it and had a difficult time with it. Recently we were talking with some other theater buffs who read the book and they threw the copy out they had purchased (fortunately, we only borrowed ours from the local library). The musical is only loosely based upon the book and the book seems to have very little relation, if any, to the original Oz. This is a book we could have done without."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I love to read a wide variety of books, and I loved the Wizard of Oz. I was told this book was great, and I was so anxious to get my hands on it and start reading. What a disapointment! This book was boring and moved too slowly. I tried to force myself to finish reading it, but just couldn't. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"2-1/2 stars, really.","review":"This book is not for everyone. I read it about a year ago; I recall mostly that I tremendously enjoyed the bawdy humor contained in the first half of the book. It took an unfortunate downhill turn after that...I put it down for a few days (hoping that I just wasn't in the mood for it that day). I returned to it because the premise of the book was SO promising that I thought it would build into a whopper. I felt I'd be missing a great literary trick if I didn't complete it. Sadly enough, I either completely missed the trick, or it just wasn't there to be had. It fell far short of what it could have been.The person I recycled the book to couldn't get interested enough to endure past 25 pages or so.Let's just say I WANTED to enjoy this book but, in truth, I didn't. I wanted it to be something...else."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute masterpiece!","review":"I'm surprised to see so many poor reviews. \\"Wicked\\" is possibly the best book I've ever read. Gregory Maquire's characters are fantastic and deep. He's created a fantasy world which is just possible enough to be believable and a bit frightening. I'm impressed with his ability to make female characters so real, too. The only problem with this book is that it's so hard to put down; I had a lot of really late nights when reading it. I did not find it difficult to follow at all, although I suspect it isn't an ideal book for someone who doesn't want to do a bit of thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't what society says it is.","review":"This is just one more book, although creative, that was given good reviews by a few well-known individuals and suddenly the entire world rants and raves about it, as if it's a stimulating drug, when in all reality it's crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked Wasted My Week","review":"Wow was I disappointed in this book!!! Had heard great things about it and thought the concept would be interesting. It was the furthest thing from interesting and in fact was the worst book I've read since high school.The plot rambles with most of the book irrelevant to the \\"story\\". Characters come and go with no direction. They pop up, seem interesting, then they go away without much explanation.I am no author, but I think Maguire really missed out on creating a truly interesting story. Would be nice if someone else took a real crack at creating somthing intriguing.Luckily I just borrowed the book from my sister. Don't waste your hard earned cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corruption Of A Classic","review":"As a child the Wizard of Oz was one of my favorite movies. It stimulated my imagination. If you are going to rework a classic you need an original concept. The idea of the Wicked Witch being misunderstood, and not truly wicked, intrigued me. In my opinion this book fell far short of it's potential. Everything that was magical in the Wizard of Oz was made mundane in this book. Fantasy was replaced with sexuality, which bored me. I felt no empathy towards any of the characters. There was nothing new and original to compare with talking trees or flying monkeys. By the end I realized what had made the original so great was how scary the Wicked Witch was. Making the witch good and the wizard evil is like rewriting the Lord of the Rings to make Sauron good and Gandalf evil. It just didn't work for me. Please Mr. Maguire, stay away from corrupting any more classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly written and terribly boring","review":"I tried to give this book a go. But it's just so BAD. The story is totally weak and tiring. Just as you think the author is getting somewhere, he stops completely and jumps to something else or jumps ahead 10 years. It's completely annoying and makes you feel exhausted. The story just isn't something you can get into. A friend of mine had read this and stopped reading it. I felt I should give it a go - it's a popular book right? But no, I actually put it down to - and when I checked with my friend - turns out we stopped around the same time. There's only so much you can put up with before you just give up. This is a terrible, terrible book, and I'll never understand it's popularity with the masses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Frustrating--Spoiler","review":"I read, and I read and I read and kept waiting to like the characters but none are likeable. I am told that so and so likes so and so but I didn't feel this in any of the characterizations. There are so many political items going on and analogies to political items I some times feel the author was venting about the injustices of the world. This book just rattled on and on and jumped around and you had to guess what happened to some of the characters. I waited for the ending and it ended. I actually felt sorry fo Elsiba. When Dorothy came in at the end of the book I probably would have felt the same way she did after all she had been through. It makes you think the Wonderful Wizard of Oz HA!!!! It ruined it for me. Needless to say this is not something I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the big deal????","review":"I had been wanting to read this book and was so excited to receive it as a Christmas gift last year. What a total disappointment...it took me months to get through it and I finally gave up and didn't finish it. What's the big deal??? I don't get it the huge popularity of this book and the Broadway show AT ALL. BOR-ING!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Story, a true classic","review":"As a huge fan of the Wizard of Oz movie (my all-time favorite), I was curious to read this rendition of the witch's side to the story. I will never view the Wizard of Oz movie the same ever, ever again.Its amazing that this book was first published in 1995 (therefore written 1993? 1994?) and yet the underlying theme of nationalism and terrorism is remarkably current. Elphaba's fight for Animal (and animal) rights is not what you would expect of someone leading a legion of flying monkeys; everything about her is exciting and deep and never expected.This is an absolute classic, and believe those who are quoted as saying it belongs on the shelf next to The Hobbit. McGuire's fluid prose and deeply saturated detail of life and landscape are reminiscent of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and Hobbit fantasies.Even knowing her ultimate doom, I was saddened still to see her go; I have begun 'Son of a Witch' with the hopes of learning more about Elphaba (if possible)."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the play, hard to get through","review":"I've heard such great things about the play, that I purchased the book and a few other titles by this author. I've been trying to read this book for a few months now but it is very difficult for me to get into. I am truly surprised by all of the positive reviews. I made it to about the middle and I think I've finally given up and accepted that I wasted my money. If you have a chance to flip through the book in the bookstore before buying, I'd highly recommend that. Maybe it's for you, but if you are like me, you'll realize that the way this author writes is not very appealing. Wish I hadn't wasted the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't be bothered to finish","review":"I had high hopes for this book, as I had heard so many good things about it. However, having gotten 100 pages into it (just about a quarter of the way through, as it was 406 long) and having absolutely no connection to any of the characters or concepts presented, I decided that I would rather spend my time reading something that I would actually enjoy.I can't entirely put my finger on what turned me off about the book, but I will say that the first portion - detailing the birth and infancy of Elphalba - honestly bored me to tears. It is well written to be sure, it just... wasn't... very... interesting.Perhaps it's because I really don't care too much for the Wizard of Oz in general - I somewhat doubt this, as the first two chunks of book that I read only tangentially dealt with anything I remember from the book/movie that inspired this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked","review":"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West (Harper Fiction)I did not like the book at all. I made myself read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Novel will change your perspective of \\"OZ\\"","review":"I became enthralled by the characters Elphaba, Glinda, Nessa and many others throughout the novel. Many issues are brought to light including Animal cruelty, spirituality, inter-racial relationships, good vs. evil and political themes.This story is a detailed (very long) yet interesting novel and one that will change my perspective of \\"OZ\\" forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twist","review":"Although a little slow starting, I loved how this tale gave us the wicked witch's story and twisted OZ proving the old saying is true: There is a side to every story."},{"rating":"2","title":"What does it mean to be wicked?","review":"I second all of the comments by readers who point out the magic of the questions raised in this new telling of the old story. It really makes me wonder how many stories we have heard that were never, ever the whole story, no matter how much we thought we saw and knew. I want to add that anyone who reads this book is cheating him or herself if he or she does not follow through with the entire series. There is so much fun in this series, with the references to the familiar stories and the humor. Like any great fantasy story, the real magic is in how much we see ourselves and our own society in a world far different than our own; and these have been the very best ways to ask the most stirring questions.Far more serious and dark than the Broadway play, too. And that is a wonderful thing!I think I relate more to Elphaba than to any other literary character. What a world, what a world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!! (there are a few curse words and adult themes in this book, not for young children)","review":"Just finished this book, it's Great!! I have ALL of the books now! Can't wait to read the next one! It arrved on time and in good condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome ending","review":"I really enjoyed the first part of this book, it was exciting and new. The second part meandered a lot. I almost stopped reading it because of how depressing and heavily philosophical it got. I don't really understand philosophy anyway because it seems to run in circles. But the end was just perfect. It was hilarious and tragic but a better end to a book I've never seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unmagical book","review":"I've spent a week trying to plod through the first hundred pages! I loved the Oz books and was really looking forward to reading \\"Wicked.\\" It's very contrived and I'm having a very hard time staying with it. Let's face it....I'm bored. Caveat emptor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I still regret the time I lost reading this book...","review":"This book had such potential. The plot was intriguing. The character was complex, and full of potential. However, the author spent so much time over-analyzing every detail, and commenting on society and its follies, that it was the most boring book I have read in a long time. I kept reading, hoping it would get better. It didn't. My main fault with the book is that instead of giving us a story with situations and characters that let us infer his thoughts about society and evil, etc., the author chose to verbalize and discuss those points over and over again. I find these kind of books patronizing and insulting. If I had wanted a political commentary I would have watched CNN or something. I wanted a book to challenge my mind and my views on reality (or just a good storyline) and all I got was a good sleeping aid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, not at all like the musical","review":"I had heard from a friend that the musical Wicked was amazing, so I bought tickets for the show right away. As I was waiting for show day to arrive I decided to read the book to get a better idea of what the musical was about.I started reading the book believing it would be amazing, but as I got through the first chapter I started doubting whether I could finish it. The book is immensly boring. I'm not going to lie, the book almost put me to sleep a coulple of times. The dialouge is overly formal and nothing like the fun movie \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" that I had grown to love. I had to force myself to finish the book, which was a feat in itself.Now I started dreading going to the musical which I was sure to be extremely boring. But the musical is the very opposite, the music is amazing especially \\"Defying Gravity\\" which is one of the best scenes I have ever seen on broadway.My advice is to skip the book and go straight to the musical, you wont be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I' ve ever labored through","review":"1000's of books I have loved and cherished... this crap left me wanting that piece of my life back. Flat, depressing garbage is all you'll find here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing and not fun to read","review":"After reading Wicked, I took months off from reading because I was so disappointed and betrayed by this book. It is violent and pointless. While I will give none of the plot away - - I will leave you with this - find another book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother reading this one...","review":"It should be called AWFUL, not Wicked. I was EXTREMELY disappointed by this book and wish I could get my money back. While the writing was fair, and the plot could have been good if it had been edited well, it includes awful pornographic imagery that does not build upon the characters' descriptions. It leaves the reader to wonder at the author's mental perversity and wonder what has affected him so despicably to wish to convey this pile of rubbish to his readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read me a bedtime story, Mommy.","review":"First, I find it very refreshing to see such a broad range of reviews for a particular book or movie. Usually everyone loves it or hates it.There is only one reason to read Gregory Maguire's novel, \\"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West\\", and that is to see how they were able to make a Masterpiece as The Broadway Musical \\"Wicked\\" from one of the most boring books this reviewer has every read. I was fortunate to witness the London Showing of \\"Wicked\\".About the book: Oh, all your favorite characters and places are there, Elphaba, Nessarose, Galinda/Glinda, Fiyero, Boq, Madame Morrible, Doctor Dillamond. The Wizard, Shiz University and the Emerald City. But they weren't quite the same. This is definitely not a children's book. Full of four letter words and sex was widely enjoyed, especially by Elphaba. The characters were all forgettable and story too long and I repeat, boring.5 stars for the musical.1 Star for the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich, thoughtful look at Oz through the Wicked Witch's eyes","review":"This new novel set in the Land of Oz resembles nothing written by Oz creator L. Frank Baum. Elphaba and Nessarose Thropp were both born with rather unusual qualities, Elphaba being green and her sister Nessarose armless, but both attended Shiz University and became rulers of their respective kingdoms of Winkie Country and Munchkinland. Elphaba, eventually known as the Witch of the West, is a well-constructed and engaging character. One might expect a revisionist tale to turn Dorothy and her companions into villains, but Maguire is too good a writer to do this. Instead, he lets the reader see the meeting between Dorothy and the Wicked Witch from Elphaba's point of view, with its tragic, but somehow inevitable, consequences. The Baum contingent may disagree, but I could quite comfortably put \\"Wicked\\" on the same shelf with the original Oz books"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for Oz fans...","review":"Heartbreaking back story on Elphiba, The Wicked Witch of the West and her friendship with Glynda, The Good Witch, from childhood to maturity. This is far different from the Broadway script and a very deep and rich story that every fan of Oz must read. You'll be so glad you did."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],B={key:0},C={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",C,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const j=d(D,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-13d9103f"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/16.md","filePath":"guide/16.md"}'),H={name:"guide/16.md"},L=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
