They say they are loose through the seat and thigh, and they used to be before 2011. Now they are tight through the seat and thigh and straight from there. I don't have stick legs.

I bought another pair of Levi's 569 jeans about a month earlier at a department store (Kohl's), and they fit perfectly. Even though the jeans that arrived in the mail from Amazon had the same style and size printed on the label, they definitely fit different. More like a 559 style, much tighter around the hips and upper legs.I don't care where you buy your jeans from, but ordering them online isn't worth the convenience.

I have beeen using 569s for in excess of 15 years and never had an issue with the fit until recently. I wish someone could explain what the heck has gone wrong with levis. There is nothing loose and straight about these jeans now that you have cut off half the material and given purchasers tights with flare bottoms. To make things worse the already low waist has been brought even lower. I had to return the purchase.I would have been happy to know before that the jeans are an entirely different fit now. Not loose like it use to be. I won't be buying them anymore. I have several pairs of 569s.

I also compared measurements them with my old 569s and they've taken off an inch from the legs widths. I hope they aren't using the trendy slim look excuse for this dumb decision. I bought these before because they were loose straight leg and now they aren't so I'm switching to Dickies brand loose straight that are not only the correct measurements but thicker and cheaper in price.

These are not the same 569's that I had been buying for years. I ordered a couple of pairs of these just recently. They fit completely different from the two pairs I already had here (same size). They ride lower on the waist, and are tighter in the thighs. The \\"older\\" version are very comfortable jeans (2009 version). These new ones are very uncomfortable, to me.I emailed Levis to complain (I Suggest others to do the same). They dismissed my complaint, basically saying that they make changes to styles from time to time to keep up with current styles. I think it is bad business. If they want to change the style, they should issue a new style number.

Working men don't need stretch jeans. Plus the legs are slim around the knee area resembling a 517 bootcut. The material is thin, and feels nothing like the older 569s.

I am both disappointed that the jeans were changed, but also that there was no communication at all of the change. I believe this is an example of very poor marketing and change management. The new version of the 569 should not have been called 569, since there are significantly different (tighter fit and totally different waist).

I myself read this book during my lunch-hour one day and can say that I didn't come away with anything new. But, I think that the critics are missing the point. Mr. Cooper's intention was not to reveal some profound secret, but to provoke though on the topic of self-defense. In this respect the book is very good.

The main female character, Jane Love, was one of the people who climbed onto a train headed for the \\"promise land\\" where jobs and a new start were guaranteed.The historical descriptions of the land and the events were interesting and very well written, but I found the characters a bit plastic. Overall the book was an entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quick Read and Enjoyable","review":"Really enjoyed this book. Hard not to like these characters. I laughed, cried, and could not put this book down. The chemistry between Jane and T.C. was great. My first book by this author. I look forward to reading others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just a Simple Love Story","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was not just a simple love story, but it was a mystery until the very end. Usually, I can figure these things out right away and then I'm bored, but this one kept me wondering.I loved the spunk of Jane Love, and I also loved the gentleness of TC Kilkenny. They made a great pair. There were other love storied involved and they made for a good read also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm and fuzzy","review":"I literally just finished this book about ten minutes ago, and now I am here browsing through Garlock's other books because The Listening Sky was so good! She really had a nack for describing a love that I think everybody would want - a love that is so perfect. The characters are all well described, and you really find yourself getting attached to all of them. The trials that the two characters go through is enough to keep anybody hooked to the plot, and to watch the way that their love is displayed to each other through thick and thin just makes you feel so good. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet","review":"It was simple yet illuminative writing which led me to nearly read this book in one sitting. I thoroughly enjoyed the story.

Missing and wrong text throughout the entire story.","review":"Let me just say first that I read this in paperback years ago, and loved it. Dorothy Garlock at her best. Initially super excited to get it on my Kindle to read again.Huge let down.I must assume that all the other 5 star reviews are regarding the paperback version because I have never read a story with so many typos, misspellings, and missing text. If I hadn't read this before, and basically didn't already know what was going to happen, I would have been so confused. As it is, I am dissapointed and somewhat pissed off! An immediate review needs to be done on this Kindle version of The Listening Sky, and a free update should be provided to those who TRUSTED that they were getting a properly edited ebook.To those thinking of purchasing this, don't bother. At least not until it has been fixed.What could've been a 4 or 5 star rating, has turned into a 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"go to moab","review":"I found this book extremely informative and for a guide it provide history and wonderful stories of the moab area.

Honestly, I would have enjoyed this a lot better if there was not a distracting static or scratching noise in the background. I found myself paying more attention to that than the music.

I guess, I should have read the reviews before selecting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"This Chopin Album is nice music but the heavy breathing on it ruins it for me, making it impossible to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is ALOT of music--long playing","review":"We have given this CD set to several friends after we liked ours so much. You can just leave these wonderful nocturnes playing for hours and not feel like you are listening again and again. It is WONDERFUL MUSIC that lasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The master version of Nocturnes","review":"I agree with our friend that considers Arrau an underrated interpreter of Chopin. And this CD is for everyone a strong argument. Just listen the first Nocturne and enjoy the profound and self accomplished spirit that it discovers. The inner logic and the beauty of playing has no match on any other recorded version. Chopin was no composer for the bal halls yet an agile explorer of the soul and moods. And that's why Ashkenazy would never be but a medium size interpreter of Chopin. The great musical insight of Arrau manages to walk on the roads that led to the creation of these Nocturnes and this is the best reason I can give you for buying and above all listening to these recordings. Every Nocturne is a masterpiece in itsself and the chlean master reveals all of their power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality recording","review":"This album was a great disappointment. There is this strange scratchy/hiss noise that occurs randomly through out the recording. It completely detracts from the music. Also, it sounded like it was recorded in some high-school gym. The acoustics were awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"oh just lovely","review":"i'd been searching for the complete set of nocturnes on disc for a while now so I was going to buy this regardless of other reviews. It is very nice, however it's always infuriating when you've heard better versions and expect to hear a certain song a certain way. The pianist tends personalise the tracks with quite a lot of rubato, which is ok i suppose but it makes it feel a little jerky at times. And yes you do become aware of the breathing. Overall though it's lovely stuff. x x x"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very fine-tuned playing","review":"I also own the CD \\"The Romantic Pianist\\" by EMI, which has Nocturnes 13, 20 and 21. \\"The Romantic Pianist\\" sounds so much better than this one by Arrau."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrau's Nocturnes live up to Chopin'd expectations...","review":"This was the first complete collection of Chopin's Nocturnes I was fortunate enough to purchase. I have heard various interpretations since, and I find Arrau's to be the most \\"nocturnal.\\" The tenderness that Arrau displays, is perfect. His sedate performance is lush with Chopin's uninhibited dreaminess; it takes the listener to an ideal fantasy land. Other interpretations of these Nocturnes always seem to be played slightly quicker by other pianists, whereas Arrau appropiately slowed bown a notch to accentuate Chopin's intended arpeggio style. The only tiff I have is with the recording. At higher volumes, the sound of Arrau's breathing is definately audible. Oh well. This is still the best interpretation I've ever heard--despite the cheaper than normal price! A must have for novices and Chopiniholics alike (I'm somewhere in the middle)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Low-quality recording","review":"While I love the music and the performer himself, and I'm sure I would have been enthralled to listen in-person, the quality of this digital recording itself is very poor. Songs start with and have a continuous hum of ambient noise, the microphone seems overloaded frequently, and the depth of the piano is totally missing. Listening to these songs, I keep wanting to adjust my speakers or look for a bad connection. There is no bad connection, however -- the songs are just badly recorded.I suggest you move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to my taste","review":"Sorry to disagree with the majority here, but as much as I love Arrau overall--he's one of my all-time favorite pianists--I find these nocturne performances slow, laborious, waterlogged, overly thick in texture, with an awkward and self-conscious rubato. I never liked these when I first heard them years ago on lp, and I don't care for them now. Nevertheless, I've heard Arrau play the Chopin etudes well, and he is indeed superb in Beethoven, Liszt and Schumann... I consider him the greatest Schumann player in the world but, ironically, he is now known more for this version of his stodgy Chopin nocturnes than his brilliant Schumann. I would take Moravec's or Vasary's performances over these any day and wish that Arrau had gotten his fingering moving more on these sluggishly performed nocturnes; it sounds like he ate a heavy German meal before he sat down at the piano rather than Crpe Suzette."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent culture building exercise and a fascinating side road in the Humanx system...","review":"This is a very interesting tale of two scientists who take a boat journey up a giant river in an interestingly populated world. There are actually three sentient species in the world, and they all occupy different ecological niches. ADF crams in a lot of culture and world building in to a rather small book, and at times the novel can read like an ethnographical study. I didn't mind this at all, as I found the species quite interesting. The main tale itself if pretty good, and the ending comes out of nowhere, catching you quite off guard.I believe the book is out of print, but is well worth picking up if you are an Alan Dean Foster fan. I've read it 3-4 times over the last 25 years, and each time enjoyed it a little more. I felt that the book was a set up for a sequel, but if it was, I never found the sequel or he never wrote it. Anyway, very fun, and worth seeking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, Thought Provoking Novel","review":"Breakheart Hill is the story of Kelli Troy, the new high school student from Baltimore, whose badly beaten and battered body is found on Breakheart Hill in Choctaw, Alabama. This is an amazing story, told in a series of flashbacks by the town doctor, Ben Wade, of how the lives of Kelli's friends and acquaintances were changed forever, by this incident. The writing both eloquent and riveting pulls you into the story and never lets you go. The characters are beautifully drawn and developed and the scenes, so vivid, they jump off the page. This is a powerful, compelling story of love, loss and betrayal with an unexpected climax and ending that will keep you thinking about this novel for a long, long time. Breakheart Hill is a masterpiece of suspenseful storytelling. Read it...you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"incredibly bad book--so much potential","review":"I was enthraled by this book. This was the first of this author that I had read. I could hardly put it down, the writing was incredible.And then the ending came and it was as if all the air went out of the balloon. Lame, weak, stupid, words fail me.This guy writes well but someone needs to supply him with a plot that works.

When my wife finished it, she immediately picking it up an re-read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very long read that leads to an unintelligible ending.","review":"This is a very long, static and redundant tale that comes to an abrupt conclusion that could cause mental whiplash. I am curious that the other reader/reviewers who have made entires here find the story and its sudden, odd and unlikely ending so fascinating. I re-read the last four pages several times with the hope that the meaning would dawn on me. I get the facts of the finale, just not the context in which they fit into this story. I consider myself an avid reader (and one who grasps the plots and nuances of writing) but this one makes absolutely no sense to me whatsoever. (I welcome comments from any reader who can clear up the matter in a private e-mail; I have written to Mr. Cook to ask for an explanation.). Definitely not worth the effort for me; move on to the next book on your list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book! A MUST read!!!","review":"This is my first Thomas Cook novel, and I was floored! This was a fabulous story with twists and turns and you never know quite what's going to happen...then the end! Oh my goodness, I was astounded by the twist. I have since gone out and purchased two more of Thomas Cook's books, and I'm going to get started immediately. You must get this book and read it. You won't be able to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A captivating mystery.....","review":"I thought this book was generally interesting, but there were parts that lulled on, and parts where nothing really happened. The only reason i give it 4 stars is because of the slow parts. The book took me in a completely different direction, and made me believe that something other than what happened happened to this young girl. The way Thomas Cook describes everything so vividly paints a dark picture in my mind, and this is a story I won't forget anytime soon. It gave me a passion for the characters, and I really admire an author who can do that for the reader. So if you're looking for a \\"get into it\\" kind of book, and willing to have some patience, i suggest this book for you. Especially if you like an unexpected ending. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"huh????","review":"This is my 3rd. ok by Cook. I love the way he writes. This book was going along fine..suspense building...foreshadowing all over the place....then the end came and i was like WTF?????I have no idea what this ending means.Skip this and read a David Wiltse book. Like Edge of SleepSadly I will not be buying anymore of Cook's books after this."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great literary mystery","review":"It's virtually impossible to give this book the review it deserves without providing rampant spoilers. So I'll just say that I started the first few chapters believing (foolishly) that I knew where the story was headed, that I knew whodunnit and why. And I ended up reading the last chapter with my mouth hanging open, catching flies and not caring, because the truth was much more shocking, much more tragic, than I would ever have let myself believe.This is a truly great literary mystery. Written with poetical prose, it lyrically reveals people in both their most debased and noblest lights. Thomas H. Cook is now officially on my \\"must-read\\" list.Hope you enjoy this as much as I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"weird and depressing","review":"The ending was deeply disturbing.

AT $50, a good buy, but the two that I received did not work, even though I was careful follow all of the manufacturer's instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't go wrong","review":"This winder is very nice and worth every penny. Solid construction (plastic) and even has a magnetic door.

It has 2 motors instead of one (like most dual winders)although a single control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I bought this winder because it was affordable (but nowhere near cheap at several hundred dollars). It arrived today and the wood finish is immaculate. This thing looks like a nice piece of furniture - on the outside. The construction is a little shoddy though. The left door isn't hung straight and the drawer won't open because the cheap fabric lining binds the drawer. The rotations are pre-set but one of the four winders moves at half the speed of the other three. Lastly, the winders themselves pop out of the back of the box because they are just stuck in with friction.Overall, it looks nice but the construction is definitely not top notch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asian Made Junk, AA Store Customer Service a ZERO!","review":"First, even at maximum speed, watches would not stay wound. That was while it was working OK. Then, the two winders on the felt side started spinning notably slower than the two on the right, even though they were set at the same speed. The top left winder then started making a very noticeable noise. All this within the first month. This product appears to be made in China. Regardless, it is pure junk. Tried calling the customer service number, all you get is a recorder, nobody ever calls back.

Philips puts us right inside Heinrich Schiff's sumptuous 1711 Stradivarius. Its moody chocolate-toned bass is ravishing. I've always loved the youthful abandon of Jacqueline Du Pre's recording with her husband Daniel Barenboim (EMI), a reading unique in its emotional charge. Schiff and pianist Gerhard Oppitz don't reach that intensity, but they are far from the cool customers Yo-Yo Ma and Emmanuel Ax prove to be, in two performances for RCA and Sony. The present duo strike a middle course, and thanks to their superb musicianship and the fine sonics, I'd rate this my second choice, for times when I don't want to be totally wrung out by Du Pre.."},{"rating":"2","title":"good guitar tuner for the money","review":"Back in the 70s, Korg had a great chromatic tuner (would tune anything for several octaves - like a piano) that cost about $30. Alas, that was too good to continue and the electronic tuner market began to be divided up between instrument ranges.For guitar or bass guitar, this one is very good and costs little enough. To put it simply: this thing works well right out of the box. The best part is that it shuts off when you forget to do so.

I did have a bit of trouble tuning a couple of strings, sometimes it would read sharp, then flat, then perfect, then flat again, but I bet that's my guitar and not a problem with the tuner. Overall it's a great deal for the price, and it works marvelously!Edit (after using quite a bit): You can't tune to a dropped-D tuning on bass unless you tune it to an E double flat (which involves changing the settings, and then you have to change it back again to tune other strings). Because of this, I'm lowering my rating to 4.5/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SO GOOD DEAL","review":"it works good and it even has a sound mode where it is audible.

Not only does it do worse (tunes off-key) but you can only tune into standard, (which I can do without a tuner) meaning that you can't tune into anything other then Standard, dropped D. In other words, no B, C, D, F, E sharp, Open A, Open C, Open D, Open F, Cross Note C, Cross Note D, anything that requires you tune a string to C or F.To put a simply, no experimenting, which is pretty much the only reason I can think of to buy a tuner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"Easy to use for a beginner.

Although it focuses on Firefighters who have appeared on television, the way the book is written will thrill at least three segments of our society. For the screenwriter/TV Writer, this book is a look inside at what it took to get an idea from paper to the screen. In this case, it's ideas that deal with firefighters. Those mentioned include lendary producers/writers/directors such as Jack Webb and Tom Fontana along with most of the major studios. For the firefighting buff, there are specs for uniforms, helmets, and fire apparatus from here in the U.S. and AROUND THE WORLD. Finally, for the collector, there is a look at toys, memorabilia, and other relics relating to the profession. A complete guide to TV Firefighters role in the world of firefighting?

The book covers everything - cast and crew of different shows, behind the scenes stories, old shows to current series, even firehouse recipes (and the ones that I tried making were great!) This would make a perfect \\"thank you\\" gift for your favorite firefighter! I know I'll be giving a few of these this holiday season.

Anyone who enjoys TV shows like Hill Street Blues will recognise the debt owed to McBain.Eight Black Horses sees an old foe of the 87th, the Deaf Man, sending a series of bizarre messages to the cops, who must decipher the clues before... well, they don't know what he's going to do. The gradually mounting tension is offset with plenty of humour, much of it black; the climax is an object lesson in combining suspense with comedy.To paraphrase the Stephen King quote they stick on Elmore Leonard books, \\"After I read Eight Black Horses, I went out and bought every Ed McBain book I could find\\". True! These are ideal for a quick, light read. Try one instead of going to the cinema to see a mediocre thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Lot Worth Celebrating, Apparently","review":"I own hundreds of science fiction and fantasy books, yet only two (Timothy Zahn's Blackcollar books) are published by Daw.

Where there is actual text, most of it consists of no more than one or two sentences. This book literally took me about three minutes to read.If you are interested in the art of the Japanese bath, there are many books about Japan in general that cover the topic in at least as much detail as this book, if not more."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the niche audience","review":"Short and well illustrated, a good primer but definitely overpriced.Look for used if possible or else borrow a copy and read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very thin book","review":"I found this book to be very thin physically and in content.

If you have a friend who is interested in things Japanese it would make an inexpensive gift, but I was disappointed in it overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Overdue","review":"Joe Keenan is the master of the modern farce. His clever twisting plotlines have managed to make Claire, Gilbert, and Philip the modern equivalent of Noel Coward's trio in 'Design for Living'. The first two books are hysterical, and have an ageless appeal, so it was nice to get my hands on this long awaited new chapter in the lives of our gay blades and their gal pal.A closeted movie star, an ambitious writer, sex scandals, and blackmail. There were plot points that felt more Jackie Collins, than Keenan, however there's no denying he's a master at tying a twisted plot that releases a torrent of laughs, and some of the wittiest one liners you're likely to see since repeats of 'Frasier'."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comic hyperrealistic romp","review":"I found this book irresistible like the previous two, with two reserves: One, I found the actuals description of a sex act a bit out of place-couldn't JK leave it to the reader's imagination, like he did before? Two, deja vus of Putting on The Ritz plot continued to flash (on the double crossing part and the malicious and/or unwitting use of recording devices. What I l loved, anyway, was the glorious piling up of the most improbable and funny mishaps and plots twists I've ever seen. Wodehouse meets Rabelais here, as unfortunate blunders made by our anti-heros, Philip and Gilbert, lead to still more sorry mistakes, and horrific consequences are staved of at the last minute.And the Oscar Myth receives a treatment much less gory, much more sexy,than it gets on Ben Elton's Popcorn, but equally funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the first two","review":"In this third outing Philip and Claire go to Hollywood where Gilbert has set up shop. He has gotten them a job writing a screenplay but things naturally go out of control. Closeted Hollywood actors, aging actresses, blackmail, sex, call boys...this one has it all. Also Moira from the first book rears her ugly head. However this is not as good as the first two. It's still funny and reads quickly but seems needlessly convoluted and Moira is REAL mean here. Also her fate is never told at the end and her and Gilbert (who starts all the trouble) seem to get off far too lightly at the end. I wouldn't mind a fourth book but Keenan should lighten up a little, give Philip a break and let Gilbert and Moira get what they deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Blue Heaven ... but worth it anyways","review":"didnt have the sort of 'straightforward complexity' of blue heaven but that's not to say that this isnt a really good novel. its like an ant farm that you can look at for hours and then suddenly it all makes sense and when it does its hilariousanyway if you liked keenans earlier books and have been waiting for this one then i can tell you it was worth the wait. enjoy it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big difference from the first two books","review":"I really loved the first two books in the series. Like those, I liked the plot & writing in this book, however, the sex scenes were a turn-off and I felt the descriptions of them were unnecessary. Having them in the book was fine for the plot but there was too much writing about them for me. I would have liked to recommend this last book in the series to my teenage kids but I won't because there were too many gratuitous sex details. The first two books did not have such graphic sex scenes and I felt they were better for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fat Beats Galore!","review":"I absolutely love this album.

A chain is simply a sequence of cards which share a color or symbol between any pair.If you've played Crazy Eights or Uno, you know what a sequence looks like: red 3, red 5, green 5, blue 5, blue 7, etc. In Linx, the sequence doesn't come from the two players - you build the longest one you can in your own hand, and the two end cards have to be any two of the four cards on the table. It's an easy-to-learn, fun game that doesn't require huge amoumts of concentration, so it's a great change ofpace for the Uno crowd who might wnat something new once in a while.The cards themselves are very nice and colorful and the reflective tin is not just beautiful, but it stores the cards and can't tear like a paper box."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree.

Singer, wind listener and storyteller, she shares lots of sensory experiences with all her grandchildren. Like many other multi-generation relationship books, Grandmother is wise and wonderful. When Gran is gone, Louis misses her very much, especially when she seems to have forgotten him. I really empathized with the feelings that Louis must have had at the loss of such a close and powerful relationship and at his grandmother's seeming abandonment. How painful to a young-without defenses boy.The artwork, bright, naive, folk-style paintings is pretty and gives a southern feeling to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prepare for a rocky \\"switch-over\\" process","review":"This is the second time I've renewed my Cingular 2 yr contract thru Amazon.

It was a story told through the eyes of thirteen year old Darrius. The good thing about this is that it gave adults a chance to hear how their actions impact the lives of their child.

Her brilliant use of strings suggests a sophistication not commonly found elsewhere by artists of similar stylings. A beautiful, thick as molasses, down tempo groove.

If you dig the down tempo vibe and move in the ethereal plane, then this album is a must for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable . . .","review":"During the first listen, this album is a complete blur of bass and blips.

Aside from having an insanely bizarre error of flipping the computer screen 90 degrees (easily fixed), the units on the field look cartoonish... like those kids toys in which there's no torso, only oversized head, hands, and feet. That's exactly how the units look. The game functions are overly simplified of \\"get gold, build units, kill enemy\\" with absolutely no impressive fighting effects or anything even remotely impressive in appearance. Outdated graphics cannot be blamed for this--it is simply poor, visiblyHistorical accuracy aside, the game seems quite shallow of just moving from mission to mission with your troops mindlessly going around killing enemies at your control.

If I knew this, I wouldn't have purchased this. My children are 2 and 4.Secondly, the book is pretty sporadic. For example, chapter 28 talks about finding out you are pregnant, and the previous chapter talks about getting to the hospital to give birth.

It's sickening.Peter Fonda is portrayed as being virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to Brooke Shields, and her character is mostly the one that pursues the relationship. He tries to shoo her away at first but eventually he gives in and they drive off as a happy, loving couple. It's revolting.I don't see how this movie could appeal to anyone except pedophiles."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Gift","review":"I love this cd!

Since then I have recommended them to many from beginning seeker to long time student. Pema Chodron teaches mind training in a warm and humorous way to help us learn to become compassionate toward ourselves and others.I sent these tapes to my brother. They were intercepted by my mother who had had a difficult life. She listened to them night and day until the day she died.

She teaches others how to awaken compassion within themselves. The people in the audience are bitter and want to know why they should have compassion for somebody that gets on their nerves. They want to know how that will benefit them. Chodron does her best to teach her students that it is the exercise of having compassion for others that makes us stronger and most importantly makes the world more peaceful. That is basically the entire message of the endless seminar. On the tape is one exercise where you practice breathing out peace for a person you may hate and breathing in the bad energy into yourself.This was a redundant mess and I don't suggest you buy it unless you are a huge fan of Chodron and Buddhism. The message was good but I wouldn't spend over $3 on it."},{"rating":"2","title":".","review":"Yeah, this a pretty good ol' cheesy fangoria/sci-fi flick. Don't listen to that other dude.

Not having seen all the episodes when they were on television, I cannot make any comment regarding whether or not some of the episodes were out of order and if any were from season three. I enjoyed each and every episode from season two. Televison writers today need to learn from the writers of the eighties. You can have quality entertainment that isn't sprinkled with violence, excessive profanity, bathroom humor or sexual situations. I found the episode where Benson pretends to be the governor when Gretchen's best friend comes to call to be espcially entertaining. Plus, the lessons that can be learned are priceless. Benson speaks his mind without being condescending to others. Also, seeing Ted Danson and Dana Elcar in their roles added to the programs. If any more seasons of Benson are to be produced, I would definitely purchase them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, great dvd, more seasons please","review":"As a show Benson holds up remarkably well. Perhaps because it was ahead of its time in content and dialogue, it surpasses shows from the era like Family Ties and Different Strokes.

I find it easier to watch a sequel movie if they bring back the characters and actors from the previous film. But in this case........ what the hell were they thinking or smoking when they made this embarrassment. It's almost like the studio was taking bets on who would actually see this and like it. Jolene Blalok, was the hot spot on Star Trek, Enterprise, but was luke warm and forgettable in this mess. Casper Van Dien was hurtin in this film in trying to revive Johnny Rico. This film proved things can get worse as the story goes, leaving the viewers to fast forward to find a part that's not to painful to watch. Let's hope they put this franchise out of it's misery and ours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretend this movie wasn't made","review":"So you enjoyed the first movie? It was good acting, good cg, and well, just plain good. Then the second Starship Troopers came out... Starting going downhill fast with a shoddy attempt at a horror movie. Then this abomination of a movie was made.Music: Almost thought it was a musical rather than an action flick...Acting: BadCG: BADStory: REALLY BADGore: think scifi original B movie bad-Minor Spoiler-Everything you enjoyed of the original movie is gone, and it's replaced with, well, Jesus (yes, Jesus)/bad cg/bad acting. The director decided everyone needed to find Jesus to kill the bugs. And there is even a bug \\"God\\" as well, but since he's a false idol, well you know how that goes. I watched this on Netflix first, I am glad I didn't pay money for it. I'm livid that I wasted my time to watching it. So I figured I'd warn all others out there hoping for something good and tell you it's rubbish. Pretend 2 and 3 were never made and stick with the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story had potential","review":"If you watch SciFi you know that aliens can take over human's minds. This is the worst execution of this plot line I have ever seen. The dialog could have been written by a teenager. None of the interactions between the characters seemed natural. And where do you find a stewardess assigned to a military starship! The 30 seconds of nudity in the movie seems totally misplaced, and does not do anything for the story. Some of the special effects are amateurish at best while some are good. A lot of time was taken to make good effects of exploding body parts with lots of blood splashing around. The only good part of this movie was the bugs, probably because they did not have any dialogue. You can watch this movie for free on Crackle, it is not worth owning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low budget campy. fun!","review":"Very low budget B. Still a good story though and if you saw the first 2 you really have to see this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"I loved the original starship troopers and the animated series but when they made direct to video releases they looked interesting from the trailers. I finally checked this one out, the story is bad! charectors you don't care about, special effects in night scenes looks alright but in day time looks like fake cgi. best part is the fight at the end. nothing really is that memorable except for the lame song the guy keeps singing through out the entire movie which is annoying along with the cringe worthy dialogue. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Money, Wasted Time","review":"A Christian message wrapped in blood, gore and nudity? Um, OK. I loved the first movie (even though it had very little to do with the book). I would not have minded this movie if they just gave me mindless dialog, mediocre special effects and a weak story. But when you add Jesus, you go too far. You have to ask for forgiveness and accept Jesus in order to stop the Bugs?? WTF??

Overall, it is not a good movie. If you must watch it, you would be better off renting it-not buying it. It reminded me of a high school play. The acting is poor and the plot predictable. Really, the film is just plain silly. Having seen it once, I don't ever need to see it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not better than Starship Troopers 2","review":"Okay, Starship Troopers 2 didn't follow the mold created by #1, but it was watchable. Marauder is only worth watching to have said you've seen it. It is totally humorless, the nudity is not believable, entirely gratuitous, except to give it an R rating, and badly done. Worst, it doesn't include Ms. Blalock. In Marauder, the Marauders are shown almost as an afterthought, and are not particularly well done. The giant brain bug is shown as occupying a portion of the planet, but is utterly unconvincing. The role of religion is taken seriously and even respected. Yes, maybe the bugs do deserve to win... The coup de graceless was having the destruction of the planet blocked by the unlikely wedding embrace. No, this movie, while truer to #1 in action, was worse than Hero of the Federation. This is strictly a rent and return; don't waste your money unless you can spare it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Science fiction movie","review":"The worst of the three. Even Jolen Blalock could not carry this movie.It was very poorly written. The special effects were less than they should have been.

The story falls short with weak concept and was forced to again show the John Rico character. The Maurader program has little to do with the movie. Writing is poor, story development is poor, but at least it is better than Starship Troopers 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Entertainment","review":"First let me say that the rating system of 5 stars does not really allow for the wide spectrum of movies being made. Most people, (myself included), tend to give five stars to movies we like. What about the movies we love, or movie classics. On a fair rating system I would only give STARSHIP TROOPERS 3 a three star rating, but to do that when I really enjoyed watching it seems wrong. So here I am giving a good movie four stars when it really fits in to the middle group of acceptable SF films out there. But is it fun? Yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Direct to Video For a Reason","review":"I had high hopes for this 2nd sequel attempt. There were a few good moments but unfortunately they were all in the (almost) satirical news and recruitment inserts. A limited budget and second-rate acting and scripting is painfully apparent. If you, like me, have a guilty pleasure in liking the original, than your best bet is to ignore the 2 uninspired sequels and find instead 'Roughnecks - The Starship Troopers Chronicles - The Complete Campaigns' which is available for purchase on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"In short, it is worth renting and watching 1 time. Purchasing this movie? My vote is no. I was hoping to finally see the power suits (as described in the book) finally used. Only about the last 5 to 10 minutes show the suits, so you will be disappointed in the duration. They are cool to watch though.It was not as gory as the first movie which I thought was overdone. Seeing Caspar Van Dien back was neat, but he could have been more incorporated into the story. The story does tend to wander. I got tired of the whole use of God and religion in the story. It got rather stupid after a while.Rent it and watch it if you are a Starship Troopers fan. After that, you decide if it is worth buying. For me, I am taking it back to the Red Box kiosk and bid it farewell."},{"rating":"2","title":"movie","review":"Product was as described. I forgot what a lame movie it was.

However, the blatent sexism, religious intolerance, fundamentalist Xtian propaganda, and contemporary Iraqi War politics was a little bit too much to take. I am really really really really glad I did not pay anywhere near full price.On the plus side, I am glad that they finally got back to the original concept of the Mobile Infantry, Drop Ships, and Powered Armored Fighting Suits.And by the way-having been in a real navy, the Federation Naval Damage Control System really sucks.

The script is mostly ludicrious, but it does strive to rise above being just a mindless pure action story. The military angle is especially unrealistic.

Casper Van Dien is back along with Jolene Blalock joining the team. I mean how bad could it be, right? Wrong! It was BAD.The effects were so bad, it looked like they were done on a home computer. The 'bugs' were vacant of any charicter, realism or symetry. They looked and acted like 3D stick figures.You could tell even Casper didn't buy into it. It was obvious he was struggling to mouth his lines.Jolene Blalock was not much better. She looked strikingly like Angelina Joilee in the beginning of the movie with the big lips and all. Yet midway through the movie, her lips got smaller. I'm not kidding. I guess the botox wore off.The first movie was a huge success and was light years ahead of the last two sequels.

The only reseaon this movie is not for anyone who knows little about the Professor Layton series is because most of the characters are from the Professor Layton video game series, with some new characters.

What we need is to balance our lives with a focus on giving, not just receiving; serving, not self promotion; and, loving others, not just pleasing ourselves.

My blow out came out smoother and shiner and less frizzy than when I used John Frieda 3 -day straight. The only bad things: it smells pretty strong, like vinegar, and may make your eyes water. But, the smell doesn't last on your hair for more than a couple of hours at most. It also may make your hair seem greasy if you use too much.

It doesn't thin out the soap but it does help it stretch. The smell is wonderful and leaves the hubby sniffing me all day. It cleans and exfoliates, as promised, without drying my skin out.P.S.

The poetry in this book is top class with beautifully crafted pieces from renowned poets such as Wordsworth for example. Most of the poetry and photos date from the 1800s to the 1930s. There are a couple of moving modern pieces too. Its one of the rare books so far that has truly helped me in my grief.

The tour that followed was his last before his throat surgery, and the last before he split with his wife Rachel Hunter. The result is a terrific performance from a man with charisma, style and of course, that voice. Don't expect much in the way of info about the songs though, Rod has never been able to talk about his lyrics so it's just Rod sharing a few drinks and tunes with his audience. He also had a fantastic backing band on this tour as well. After listening to him do just passable versions of classic standards for the past two years, this concert reminds you what Rod Stewart should still be doing. It's also reasonably priced. A happy occasion for all......Pass on his standards CDs and buy this DVD OR the Faces terrific new box set, \\"Five Guys Walk Into a Bar.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Voice; Lousy DVD","review":"A lame, wheelchair concert where geriatric Rod can't seem to get any juice going.

Even if VH1 tries to use it as a way of showing how \\"laid back\\" this \\"session\\" was.Look at Rod's lame version of \\"Hot Legs\\" in the Extras section - he just ain't got the chops at this time to cover the vocalese. That being said: he does one incredible song, that I can't find anywhere, ostensibly from a group called, \\"Primal Scream\\": Get Your Rocks Off. It is a blistering rocker, well in Rod's vocal range for this period, and, probably worth the price of admission. Now: does anyone know where I can find it?I love Rod.

I love Child's Reacher books, but this one didn't cut it for me. It dragged on and on. Maybe if you are military and liked reading about endless boring descriptions of clothing, equipment and scene details you might like it. I found myself skipping over pages of descriptions just to get to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad research, bad book","review":"I have enjoyed reading Reacher novels and I've read almost all of them. There has always been a real disconnect with the presentation of the military aspects of Reacher's life. This book is the worst. For all the reasearch Childs has done on armaments, he hasn't done spit when it comes to military life and procedures. An earlier review calls it the Fantasy Army and that it is. Having spent 18 years in the Army CID, I can tell you that this book bears no resemblance to real life in military organizations - traveling around in HMMWVs: traveling, eating and hotel stays on \\"vouchers\\". What nonsense! I had a hard time staying with the plot because of the gross inaccuracies in all aspects of military life. Many of his actions would have lead to a general court-martial and he would have done hard time in Leavenworth. I'm really disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traits of classic \\"whodunnit/\\"","review":"Classic whodunnit qualities abound in this novel which is based on contemporary events. The failure of the Soviet Union and fall of communism could not fail to also have effects on the U.S. Army's planning, resulting in a change in the relative power of distinct branches of the service. Such decisions are the paths to advancement. (I recall an Intell unit researching elephant right of ways in a small nation) Credible premises and an effective opening series of suspicious but accidental events are entangled to generate the plot. If there is a problem, the middle drags a bit until Reacher and brother fly off to visit their dying mother in Paris. From that point on thenovel drives to a conclusion. Like classic whodunnits, there is a mix of misdirection but also enough in the way of clues to make for a believable ending. This is a great one or two night, sit by the fire and sip a brandy read. Have fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very nicely as a prequel","review":"After the previous Reacher novels which refer to his MP background, this is a very welcome look at the character in that phase of his life, and one can clearly see why he didn't remain in the service.I also liked the matter-of-fact handlng of the inter-racial relationship between Reacher and Summers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much of a Reach","review":"The story just doesn't hold together. At one point Reacher goes out to arrest a murder suspect who is heavily armed. Rather than take back-up he goes out alone. Well, that's stupid, but it's the only way that Child can give us his slam-bang fight-to-the-death ending. Pretty boring if a squad of MP's surround the guy and he quietly gives up. Another unlikely bit is his arrest of the wrong person who committed a crime, yes, but not one Reacher wants to prosecute. Still it's a pretty serious one. Why wouldn't some other MP pick up the same pieces Reacher did and find out that Reacher let someone go for a gruesome crime (although maybe justified)? That sort of thing is understandable, even excusable from the vagrant vigilante Reacher, but not the MP Major.It is interesting to get the background on Reacher, and some of the characters do show up in a later novel, but it could have held together a lot better than it did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder -Conspiracy -Coverup High Up In The U.S. Army","review":"This was my first full length novel read by the author. Previously I was introduced to him by his short story Ten Keys which was included in The Cocaine Chronicles. It has been pointed out by some reviewers that the author was not correct with some of the facts about the military in this book. Nevertheless,to me, the plot moved right along at page turning speed and seemed plausible. Jack Reacher was indeed a true action hero. I very much enjoyed the character of MP investigator Lt. Summer. Hopefully she'll return in a future adventure. Basically the story was in late 1989 early 1990 as the military faced downsizing in the post cold war era. Certain key tank brass were concerned that they might be phased out or cut down more or less as were battleships in the past. They took steps to keep their power. Murdered were a two-star general, his wife and several experienced Delta Force members. Toss in some gay sex and you have a very exciting story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner for Jack Reacher","review":"Jack Reacher fans should like this addition to the series just fine. It's a flashback to Reacher's days as a Military Police major. Surprisingly, our hero relies less on physical mayhem and more on brainpower to solve this mystery. He gets a lot of help from his hastily drafted assistant, Lt. Summers, a sharp and energetic little MP, whom Reacher picks up in the mess hall on a moment's notice when he needs a woman to accompany him on a death notification. The story moves briskly through a series of murders seeming to have some connection to the transfers of several officers, all on the same day and for no apparent reason, and to the missing agenda for a conference that was to take place at a California army base. It turns out that the fall of the Soviet Union is at the bottom of it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Sure His Other Books Are Better","review":"This is the only book by this author that I have read.

Service was good and quick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blazing faster than a pager burner on high octane","review":"Reading a Lee Child novel is more than an addiction and grater than a calling as it actually becomes an event that not only consumes you but leaves you both incredibly satisfied and yet experiencing an immediate craving for more of Jack Reacher whose enigmatic character is extremely well written and crafted. the big plus in this novel was going back in time to his military career and having various insight into the character's personel family relationships with his brother and mother reveled. simply put Jack Reacher's character is a masterpiece of art whose intricate canvas is yet to be fully reveled, may the journey into Jack's past continue in earnest in future novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political statements off base","review":"Half way reading this book, I began to understand Lee Child has some very pointed views about the American military and they are not good. I found this very ironic, especially considering that he is NOT an American; but, a British citizen, one of whom is not in favor of current American military policies. I was even more irate, when I discovered he has never served in any type of military whatsoever. He is a wannabe, and does not understand what is like to serve, have served, or see your buddy in a body bag. Therefore, I am never reading any of his books again, and suggest others read between the lines of his stories and come to your own conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"The wrong vechicle for this yarn","review":"Child writes in in interesting manner and creates an appropriate amount of suspense, however, he should not have chosen the US Army for his vechicle -- because his knowledge of such is extremly superficial at best. He creatates a main character who exists in a fictictious unit in an Army of which he has no basic understanding of its mores, organization, operations, rules & regulations, nor traditions.He should have consulted a career officer before he went to press.Why I take such umbrage with this novel is that that the portrayal is such a distorted picture of how the Army operates, the uninitiated will take it is as legitimate and feel that they now know what can go on within its structure.As an aside, like Patricia Cornwell, he seems to have a homosectual acceptance agenda woven into his novel that becomes an unnecessary distraction.I certainly will not try his work again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I said, he said, she said, we said...","review":"I couldn't get past the first 10 pages of this book - the author has the worst writing style I have ever encountered. The fact that this book got published, let alone is the eighth in the series amazes me...Apart from the clumsy writing in general, what stands out most is his use of the word 'said'. The author uses it after nearly every line of dialog - it is enough to drive you mad. Even a primary school child mixes it up a bit, and the English language has a vast array of descriptive terms to choose from. The other big gripe I have is that the book seems to be written entirely in the first person, a style that I find very irritating to read.Now I only read the first chapeter (it was sent to me as a 'sampler') but I didn't even finish that. So perhaps it gets better but I really really doubt it.Do yourself a favor and find a better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lot's of fighting and killing....","review":"These are well written books; however, the amount of killing and maiming done by the main character outside of the law/as a vigilante was enough to turn me off from the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE ENEMY","review":"To be honest I read 15% of this 8th book & stopped.

I was expecting for something to happen till the last page, the end was very dissapointing and it doesn't meet with the writer's standards.I guess everyone has his ups and downs, his next book was surely a big come-back so i'm not holding a grudge on the author.If i had to pick just ONE of Child's books to read, i'd certainly wouldn't pick \\"The enemy\\"He's written a lot of much better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reacher as Expected","review":"This is a typical Lee child. He has a standard formula and each book is gripping, and unputdownable. The characters are well drawn out. There is practically no sex; if there is it is cursory. Reacher is unbelievable but you want more of him. Big, strong, bright, imaginative, compassionate to the oppress3d and a vengeful tiger to the oppressors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with this one","review":"I am a hugh Jack Reacher fan and read all his books.

This book has way too many descriptions of which road he is going to take and directions. Who cares! It is mired in useless details of the roads. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best of the series so far","review":"Since this is the first in the series that has delved directly into Reacher's military time it has become very obvious that the author has done very little research into actual military life. Constantly mixing up various branch terms throughout the book. Besides that it has been the hardest plot to really get excited about and I'm not as anxious to read it through as I have been with the first seven."},{"rating":"1","title":"more on the enemy","review":"As a Reacher fan I was very disappointed in the Enemy.It was boring, had little action and was unrealistic in the lengths gone to by the baddies for the relatively minor gain.There was a gap waiting to be filled in the Reacher story but this didn't fill it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets boring in the middle...","review":"Starts interestingly enough, but then gets boring almost till the end. Too many procedural details - I felt like I was watching a 3-hour episode of CSI, and not a good one. This was my 3rd Reacher's novel - I totally enjoyed 61 Hours and Killing Floor which were unstoppable fun, and I was completely surprised how lame The Enemy was. If I started the series with it, I would have probably ended with it. However, I know that Lee Child can do better, so I'll try a couple more novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy Jack Reacher Entry","review":"I'm hooked on the Reacher series and have been compulsively reading them straight through. Most I have thoroughly enjoyed...but, when Child is coasting it is painfully obvious. In fact, this is the third out of eight that I've found myself continuing to read simply because I couldn't believe how awful it was and/or there was still enough of a hook in some part of the story that I wanted to find out how he would resolve. In this particular novel, he took us 80% through the novel to have Jack stumble across what anyone paying attention to the actual story....and not getting all tangled up in looking for a yogurt cup or the usual page after page of details about armaments.....knew from almost the beginning about who was doing the killing and the big secret about the first dead guy. Anyway....buyer beware.....Lee is really cheating his readers on this one and should be ashamed of himmself."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent, Gripping Read","review":"I picked up Lee Child's The Enemy based on a number of recommendations, but not really knowing what the novel would be all about. The Enemy is an excellent thriller/mystery and I can see why Child's Jack Reacher series has so many followers (but don't understand why there aren't more). This is an excellent, well-written novel, with enough plot twists to keep you interested, some out of left field, some you may figure out on your own, but none that will disappoint. The novel opens on New Years' Eve 1989. Jack Reacher is an MP who has just been reassigned to an army base in North Carolina, and investigates the death of a general in a motel nearby. It looks like a heart attack, but things aren't adding up. Other, seemingly unrelated deaths and Reacher's got to figure it all out. The ending is both satisfying and plausible. Very well done. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Reacher book I didn't like...","review":"... and I read Reacher 1-7 (and 16 by mistake) beforehand and loved them all. This one just gets too complicated with differering military groups, names, ranks, responsibilities etc. So much so that they get in the way of what is basically a very inventive tale, as all Child's books are. Skip this one if you are doing them in order. I am even going \\"off Reacher\\" for a while before I pick up on this series again, which I nonetheless am certain will not dissapoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Enemy","review":"I just love all the twists and turns in Lee Child's books. You never know what's around the next corner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Military Malfunction","review":"I like Jack Reacher, but not when he is in the army chasing the murder of a two star general with staff working against him, he going AWOL facing court martial. For the female readers like me the entrenched reading of army details gets very tiresome, and on many pages I find myself bored. What is the twentieth century's signature sound? Lee Child asks. I know the answer, because I was a child in WWii Germany, it's definitely the slow drone of an aero engine in the sky. No, he says, it's the squeal and clatter of tanks tracking on pavements. Not to my knowledge, but what do I know about military life? The language is good but the endless attempts to ferret out who swung the custom made crow bar and why? I am on page 317 now and still clueless. 76 pages more to go in a malfunctioning military environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I could not finish reading this book. I heard good things about the Jack Reacher series but the writing in this installment is abysmal. Perhaps I should have started with a different book in the series. I can live with the military inaccuracies, but the book was painful to read. Also, if you don't know much about the military, don't describe it in such detail. Set up the scene and move on with the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"huge miscalculation","review":"Despite being a Brit, Lee Child has created a quintessential American hero in Jack Reacher, in the Mike Hammer class, if not Marlowe or McGee. Somtimes he gets details wrong that no American male would make (in his latest, \\"One Shot\\" a far superior book to this one, he refers to \\"striped umpire uniforms\\" rather than referee).However, the whole premise of this book is so wrong. (SPOILER ALERT!!!!!) the idea that American generals would be killing each other off because there are fewer spots to be promoted to during military downsizing, is ludicrous. Maybe in 19th Century Russia, or Saddam's Iraq, or even Pakistan, but it's silly in the extreme. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you know anything about the Army, don't read this book!","review":"This is the worst researched book that I have ever read. Just about everything about the Army is wrong. The procedures are wrong. The places are wrong. The descriptions are wrong, The attitudes are wrong. Even the slang is wrong. The only way that you can portray the US Army this way is if you have complete contempt for it. This will be the last Lee Child book that I ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lee Child you blew it on this one!!!","review":"I have never been so bored in my life.

There are two things which make this book important to the Reacher legacy, the time he spends with his brother and mother and the career decision he makes at the end.The time spent with Joe, magnifies the differences in their personality and allowed me to better understand the comments he makes in previous books regarding their relationship. The book also introduces his mother and gives further insight to Reachers childhood, for me the best part was finding out that his mother always referred to him as 'Reacher'.Regarding the Career choice ill let you find that out for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising Plot","review":"Gives one an insight into how the US army posts and MP's operates.

Mr. Child why not use your incredible writing tallent for good instead of absurdity. I have read all of the Jack Reacher novels to date. Each time I get to the end I feel cheated.

So the author isn't up on USA military history and protocol, and pulled a couple of real bloopers like the location of Fort Irwin. But he makes up for it with great characters and some great comments (like the difference between what happens if you run your HumVee over unexploded ordinance versus a desert tortoise).Most \\"thriller\\" stories require that the reader suspend belief if you know anything at all about the specialized subject matter; novels with techie subjects like computers are almost always full of awful mistakes. So what if this one blew the military stuff here and there, it's still a great story about one of the best characters in thriller fiction today. I loved it, and even found myself \\"page turning\\" at 3am on a second read a month later. Anyone who loves Reacher has got to love this \\"prequel\\" to the Reacher series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Enemy","review":"All I've got to say is, \\"WOW\\"! Child has really gone and written a superb thriller with this one. You feel as though you are living in Reacher's body as he wallows in the various different lives he connects with. He's compulsive, yet tender, with his aide as they travel (nearly) the world in search of clues that will relieve him of extraordinary pressures.

If a review holds just ONE critical comment it's pushed down by the extreme fanatics here. I love Callas and Sutherland but I'm ASHAMED to see what is going on here. Fanatism is horrible and serves no one. Justice does. I own four Lucias with Sutherland and six with Callas. I love them.

I read up until 20 pages or so from the end and then just skimmed to finish it. I can't believe someone actually recommended this book to me as a contemporary romance! There's no romance in this book whatsoever! There's just the self-indulgent ramblings on the part of the author about philosophy, religion and literature, some weak plot, and a lot of feeling sorry for oneself. The ramblings add zero to the plot or character development. They're boring. The book was a waste of my time.

I haven't read a book like this in so long, it had no cliches, no tiresome plot devices, just a funny, sad, sweet, well thought out story. Kimmel brings the characters together in a perfectly believeable way, it always rings true.

I really don't like giving up on books, but I just can't put myself through this one any longer. It is so disappointing because there is a really good story hidden amongst the philisophical ramblings, religious references, pretentious characters and unbelievable conversations. But I simply cannot bear witness to another one of Langston's temper tantrums or Amos' inability to write a sermon (isn't that what ministers do?) I just cannot relate to any of the characters, and I feel more irritation towards them than anything else. Several of Kimmel's other books look interesting, so I won't write her off yet. However, this one's going back to the library today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming!","review":"I loved this little book. In the back Kimmel says that it's really a book about ideas, but thank goodness all of the academic philosophies which you have to wade through in the reading were summed up in the preface as \\"a fool's thoughts\\". The plot bore that out--you don't have to subscribe or even care about them to see how they crumble to dust under the weight of things that are real. The title is deliciously ironic: the solace of leaving early is the comfortable habit of both protagonists, and you get to see how, in the end, there's something mercifully more compelling than the promised solace of insulating yourself from relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a treasure","review":"I am a committed Haven Kimmel fan after reading this very well-written book by an obviously erudite, well-read author. Once I had read a few chapters, I was hooked on Langston, her family, and Amos' relationship(s). This is a novel to be savored because each paragraph holds unexpected nuggets. I found the literary references to be thought-provoking, the details of each person's life to be exquisitely crafted and the humor to be sharp. I felt as if I knew this small town in Indiana quite intimately by the time Langston met daily with Alice's daughters. I majored in English at Indiana University, so I also appreciated Langston's observations of the academics who reign in their own narrow world. I cannot wait to read \\"A Girl Named Zippy\\" and anything else written by this very talented author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go back to the drawing board, Ms. Kimmel!","review":"This book is in such stark contrast to Haven Kimmel's delightful novel \\"A Girl Named Zippy\\" that I am finding it a chore to get through it. I am still not through it, but I think that I may have to say enough is enough and move on to a more rewarding piece of literature. I loved \\"A Girl Named Zippy\\" - the simplicity, the elegance of the sparseness of her words, Ms. Kimmel's humorous recollections of her childhood and life in a small town. This novel also takes place in a small town, but it's as if Ms. Kimmel is saying \\"I'm grown up now, so my first novel will be in a grown-up style\\" with lots of references to philosophers, religion, heavy literature, etc. Please Ms. Kimmel, go back to your roots and draw from what works for you - understatement."},{"rating":"1","title":"The solace of finishing something dull","review":"I wholeheartedly agree with Bruce's and Customer's reviews. The book is painfully dull with unbelievable dialogue, especially between the protagonist and the girls. The Marian apparitions didn't even have that much to do with the story. It was mostly about the protagonist's unhappiness with small-town life We learn that she had an affair with a cad whilst at graduate school. She walked out of her exams because she couldn't stand to see the cad with his new woman, married and pregnant. It took me forever to finish this book. Do yourself a favor and skip this book. You're not missing much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and Intrusive","review":"Some books' writing flows effortlessly into your mind. This book's writing is intrusive - I find myself thinking more about the writing style and what I don't like about it, than I do about the characters and the plot. Never a good sign. The author seems to be reaching (too hard) for the kind of lyrical and haunting prose that a few other writers have acheived.The author's depiction of the relationship between the main character and her mother is overwrought and contrived.If you want a really good book, try \\"Fall on Your Knees\\" by Ann-Marie MacDonald!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Solace of Leaving Early","review":"Well I've read some of the other reviews and don't wish to just reiterate what they said. However I would like to comment on the ending without giving it away - it came from out of the blue and was really quite preposterous. I can think of a half dozen endings that would have been better, would have been more believable - actually I have seen X-Files episodes that were more likely. Or for that matter, it was nearly as preposterous as the story lines in the new series \\"Boomtown\\" and \\"Without a Trace\\" this season. Since when did fiction become \\"stranger than fact?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"this book was so mediocre....sigh","review":"The best thing about this book is the title. It's a beautiful sentiment and one that was expressed well in one little vignette. Otherwise this book was so mediocre...OMG. It was bad. Simplistic. Saccharine. It was like reading the work of someone still in the first year grad writing program, as the main character reflects. Not only could you see the plot wrap-up a mile away, I sort of felt like I needed to take a shower afterwards lest I get attacked by a swarm of bees coming for the sticky sweetness.This book is a major pass unless you typically enjoy the recommendations of USA Today."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Ancient Art","review":"The surprise of Haven Kimmel's The Solace of Leaving Early is not that it made me think and brood and cry, it was that a novel about philosophy, religion, social dysfunction and horrific loss could make me laugh so often.Langston,the heroine, has a dog named Germane - as in \\"relevant\\". Her descriptions of the faculty archetypes in her novel are scandalous - and perfect. The residents of the town of Haddington are a riot and joyously real.Kimmel has worked a kind of poetic alchemy where the monotony of mid-western America, the brutality of death and all it's associated guilt and trauma, and the labor of existential crisis are made molten with the beauty of her characters and prose and formed into a tale so precious and rare that, though you now own it, you covet it long after you've set it down.I look forward to reading it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"OPERA AT ITS FINEST!!!","review":"I LOVE ANDREA BOCELLI AND HIS AMAZING VOICE. EVERYTIME I HEAR HIS VOICE I WANT TO CRY. HIS VOICE IS LIKE AN ANGEL'S. I OWN ALL OF HIS CD'S AND HOPE TO SEE HIM IN CONCERT VERY SOON. I RECOMMEND THIS CD TO EVERYONE AND ALONG WITH ALL HIS OTHER CD'S ESPECIALLY \\"SOGNO.\\" IF HE WEREN'T MARRIED ALREADY I WOULD LOVE TO MARRY HIM!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Andrea Bocelli Hits a Triple!","review":"Viaggio Italiano is not quite as exciting a production as the earlier CD, Romanza, but it has its own charm. This collection of operatic arias and Neapolitan songs, some in their original dialect, are carefully performed, if very traditionally arranged. Signor Bocelli demonstrates his fine vocal qualities and his skill in the recording studio once again. This artist's development in a brief period of time is a remarkable and precious event for crossover fans. I throughly enjoyed this collection and recommend it to all of my friends who love the fine, clear sound of a lyric tenor with a great vocal gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"HYPE","review":"Please note some great opera tenors as follows:Björling (God's gift to singing), Gigli, De Stefano, Gedda, Caruso, Pavarotti, Domingo, Corelli (HE did NOT need microphones...), Bergonzi, Martinelli, Wunderlich, Simeneau, Monaco, Volpi...Just wanted to give them some attention before they drown in the tidal wave hype called Bocelli."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Marvelous Performance of Adeste Fideles","review":"Andrea Bocelli sings magnificently on this CD. Never have I heard Adeste Fidelis sung with such energy, joy, and understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"This cd is a complete disappointment. Talk about hype! I though that Pavorotti had his adoring fans, but this is rediculous. If you want to listen to pop, perhaps Bocelli will do. But, please, not Opera. The young Pavorotti is still the best tenor today."},{"rating":"1","title":"The tradeoff between quality and publicity","review":"Bravo, Sarah Bryan Miller! It is amazing how patheticlly we have been victimized with publicity, to the degree that this awful record has been a success in the music stores. The only plus that I find is that people that have never heard opera are listening for the first time to some of the most fascinating arias. The problem is that there are Jörlings, young Pavarottis and Carreras or di Stefanos that can really take us to the marvelous world of opera, who contrast with this good effort that will never become a big one."},{"rating":"2","title":"My heart would not stop pumping...","review":"...for the attractiveness of this really handsome hunk. (Yet he's only a person.) Sure, I like opera, but not to a great extent. As a 16-year-old teenage girl \\"in love\\" with a 41-year-old Italian tenor who's unfortunately married, you might say that's a big first. Viaggio Italiano (Italian Journey) is an overall interesting look at the music of Italian emigration in the world. Okay, Andrea's just a mortal. His Romanza, like I recently said, was by far the best of his recordings. When will his new one come out? Dios sabe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than anyone?","review":"Talk about legions of fans. Bocelli's \\"Sogno\\" album ranks number \\"9\\" among ALL of amazon.com cd sales. It had 175 reviews within about a month's time. Almost all rave reviews at that. That is almost scary. A want to be opera singer reaching populary that no other opera singers before him had even dreamed to achieve. In a way, this is good for opera, all those non classical music listeners all of a sudden fans of opera. But on the other hand, all those better tenors being ignored because of his amazing popularity. Well, from listening to his voice, he won't last long. A nice voice with no special qualities at all. Well, I dare not leave my email for fear of being attacked with hundreds of hate mail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate voice for the repertoire","review":"This is worse than Romanza for the reason that Bocelli's voice simply doesn't have the amplitude, sheen, sap and quality for many of the songs in this album, in particular those operatic arias, and I consider anything drummed up in the studio to be fake. The effect is not dissimilar to a pop singer attempting to sing opera, even though Bocelli's voice is much better schooled than most pop singers. Nevertheless, it's a disappointing album and I hope that Bocelli can be wise enough to refrain from tackling music which he just can't cope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty torpid stuff","review":"Sorry, but even though I love Andrea Bocelli like a maniac, I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone who'd rather hear Luciano Pavarotti at age 30-something. 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE PITS","review":"Andrea Bocelli cannot sing opera, with or without a mike. While more bearable than Michael Bolton or Sara Brightman, Bocelli simply does not have the voice to sing opera. He should stick to singing sirupy love ballads, and leave the opera to the pros. I have lost all respect for Denyce Graves when I heard she will disgrace herself to join him in Michigan Opera Theater's Werther..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Tour of Italy","review":"Take a trip to Italy by listening to this wonderful collection of Italian classics. The soaring \\"Nessun Dorma,\\" the passionate \\"O Sole Mio,\\" the nostalgic \\"Santa Lucia luntana,\\" the uplifting \\"Ave Maria\\" are all here, plus many more.With his beautiful tenor voice, Andrea Bocelli is the guide as we traverse the barriers of time and space and are transported to this far away, romantic country.This is an hour of escape, of beauty and romance, of traveling the musical landscape of Italy. It is an hour of being exposed to the passion, emotion, and spirit of the Italian people, brought to us by a singer who represents them, but who is also able to cross over to other cultures, other languages, and people of all persuasions, because, as always, he sings from the heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANDREA BOCELLI VIAGGIO ITALIANO","review":"THIS IS ONE BEAUTIFUL ALBUM OF ONE OF THE MOST LOVELY TENORS OF OUR TIME. I COULD LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM OVER AND OVER. BOCELLI HAS THE MOST WONDERFUL WAY OF EXPRESSING EACH PIECE. I ESPECIALLY LIKED \\"CORE N'GRATO\\" AND \\"MARINARELLO\\" . HE HAS A VERY STRONG VOICE BETTER THAN ANYONE I EVER HEARD BEFORE INCLUDING PAVAROTTI! YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT HIM NOT BEING CLASSICALLY TRAINED, BUT GUESS WHAT, HE SOUNDS BETTER THAN MOST CLASSICALLY TRAINED TENORS I HAVE HEARD. IF YOU WANT TO REALLY BE MESMERIZED JUST BUY AND LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM. YOU WON'T BE SORRY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath taking voice control","review":"I can only tell you that once you listen to Andrea you will certainly be aware of his ability to extract these rare emotions that will more than likely surprise you. I am always amazed at his voice control no matter how often I listen to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice from heaven","review":"I was so touched by Andrea Bocelli the first time I saw his concert on public TV. His voice is so pure and he sings with his heart. I remembered the other time I have this feeling is when I was in Pavoretti live concert. I have bought all his CDs that I can find. SBM, please give us a break!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Appalled","review":"I am truly amazed by the people who insist on tearing apart what I consider one of the best singers I have heard in a long time. Bocelli has made a classical singing fan out of a confirmed opera hater. For shame! . He has a very soulful voice in my opinion. One that has struck a chord with most people I share his CDs with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the Best Tenor Today","review":"I am certainly not an expert on opera, but to accuse Bocelli of not being technically perfect is like criticizing Wayne Gretzky or Michael Jordan for not always playing by the book. I like Bocelli more than any other tenor. His voice is more clear than Pavarotti's, and I feel an instant connection to his signing. That he achieved such world-wide popularity, being blind and all, and is raising a family, too, says something important about him. Anyway, this is one of the best opera albums ever, and unlike many albums in the genre, this one is not intrusive or overwhelming--Bocelli's voice flows softly, while maintaining some distance from the listener and not getting under his skin. Buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"x=superb","review":"love the music and especially Mr. Bocelli, but I would appreciate a translation of the words.

The sound either gets \\"tinny\\" or fades out. Worse yet, the remote stops working during the course of using it and to add insult to injury, the only way to turn off the unit is to unplug it.

My remedy is to use external sound system. Since I have connected VCR/DVD and cable box to my stereo, I no longer use the monitor for audio. I also use my cable box to change channels, so I don't use the remote either except for turning monitor on and off. Another suggestion is not to use wireless network with this monitor or near it.

Anyhoo, I honestly thought this book was one of Triple Crown's Publishing company's latest books, because of the grittiness & street flair it has. I read this entire book on my way back home to South Carolina. A few other women who also came along on this chartered bus ride purchased her book & is enjoying is as well.

Doesn't deserve even ONE star.","review":"This book was horrible. I couldn't even finish it! I hate a book that cannot keep my attention. I figured at first that it was slow starting out but a FEW chapters into it, it was still as dull and boring as the first page. This was a waste of time even attempting to read when I could have been reading something better. Luckily I just borrowed this book from a friend and didn't buy it myself because I would have been very pissed that I wasted my hard earned money on it.Usually if and when I do I review I'll tell a little about the characters and the plot but this doesn't even deserve a well-written review.DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK.

I noticed in the begining that is was starting off slow.I gave it a chance and it never really picked up. The whole story really got on my nerves because every chapter was about Kira getting played by her husband, running her mouth about it, but staying with him. The story lacked drama or suspense. Kira hardly even stood up for herself against all these women who were messing with her man which would be hardly unlikely in real life. The ending was not all that great either and the reader could kind of figure out that she would get played in the end. You can read this book to kill time as I did but please borrow it from a friend don't waste the money.You can get a way better read out of books like Sheisty, Still Sheisty, Blinded or Grimey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When I read the back of the book I became very excited to read.

Third of all, by sleeping with Russ was truly dumb move, and any real woman would have never snitch depsite what her husband is doing....Rule 1 of the hood manual- NEVER SNITCH!!!!

And those were great productions. That said, this DVD, \\"Secrets of UFOs: Kecksburg UFO Crash\\" is absolutely horrible.This DVD was obviously produced on a very low budget; this is evident through poor quality of the re-enactment scenes and the bad acting. Nonetheless, I can live with a low budget production, provided that they have their facts strait, and are presenting them in a way that would let a viewed make up their own mind.This DVD offers no new facts, but what is worse is that it tries to imply many things that are not factual. Productions like this DVD detract from legitimate UFO documentaries.Don't waste your money or time with this DVD... even at $7, it's a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Performance!","review":"I got this CD from the library and fell in love with it!

Although it was a good idea, this book fails miserably at its task. First, the lectures are too simple for an honors chemistry class at a technical university. By the time I reached my freshman chemistry class, I'd already had 2 full years of chemistry and a semester of organic chemistry. I don't need a review on units.

I was enarmored with him during that first encounter on the wharf, and cheering for him every second afterward.

I have 3 other books by Michelle Coxon, all lift the flap and all with the same stunning illustrations. Our daughter is 1 year old but loves listening to us tell the story (simple language) and lift the flaps to try and help the mother cat find the kitten. The flaps are so well done that they blend into the background picture. You will see what looks like a kitten's tail poking out from a cupboard.. only to find it is a toy and instead the kitten is under the bed playing with a ball. Our daughter loves lift the flap books as she is able to intereact with the book but she especially loves this book as she now knows wheres to look for the kitten, behind which flaps. It is a quick page turner and the pictures are beautiful. I am a real fan, as is our daughter.

I can't figure out how to get to other higher limit tables.

I, like one or two other reviewers, was puzzled by the number of pictures of quite obviously steroidal athletes, considering how anti-drug Vince was in his views. That said, he tells it to you straight, and years before anyone subscribed to higher fat, and high protein diets, Vince was out there advocating the consumption of whole eggs, cream and other saturated fats to gain lean muscle mass. He also leaves nothing to chance on the range and number of exercises listed, most of which I wouldn't use, but that's just a personal preference. Not quite worth the money, but Vince had interesting views and was years ahead of his time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unreliable","review":"After having had a temperature fork, which worked great and was very reliable for many years, we purchased this fork in December 2012.

She plays with it for less than a minute and moves on to just about anything else. She already knows all the animals and they are dificult to chew or play with. It seems more exciting or interactive then what it really is. Its really pretty huge as far as pretend toys go- Its been stored for months now. We only take out once in a blue moon, it just doesnt get played with, even though we have the tractor too. Have to say everything works ok, the sounds and movement its just my daughter finds it really dull. She actually polays with the Little People Farm toy way more And that doesnt even have sounds. Hope it helps"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weeble Farm","review":"Well our daughter does like this toy. We like the weebles because it teaches her the different animals and she loves to drop the weebles down the top so they slide and land in the little space on the left. However, the spinning thing doesn't seem to work well at all. We aren't sure if we have a defective one or if they are all this way.

This one thing that doesn't do anything, I don't know if it is suppose to make them bob up and down, or spin.

Well thank goodness because Heifetz's interpretations leave me cold in their technical bravura. While his technique may have been perfect, his recordings miss some of the passion. Chung's Tchaikovsky is full of feeling and passion, not to mention incredible bravura. Particularly in the final movement she dazzles and completely overwhelms you with her artistry. I prefer this version to her earlier version Tchaikovsky with Andre Previn. Charles Dutoit and the Montreal Orchestra are sensitive not to overpower Chung, yet the full, rich sound we have come to expect from them are there when needed. It is too bad she has disappeared from the recording scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I bought this at a recommendation of a person in charge of a classical music section.

It turned out to be defective. Returned it for another one, which was also defective. Ambient Designs likes to claim that their products \\"work right out of the box.\\" In my case, nothing could be further from the truth. Just look at the troubleshooting guide on the company's web site -- it's a mile long. (Yes, I followed the guide -- to no avail.) Obviously the company is aware of many bugs involved with the weather beacon. It would seem that they rushed out a product that is great in theory but very unreliable in reality. Don't even think of giving one of these as a gift, unless you want the recipient to face endless hassles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"The weather beacon is advertised as being able to convey \\"your weather.\\" Well, the truth is that the free service only gives weather in select regions. If you don't live near the originating city for that region how does that do you any good? Is it any value to get the weather for a city possibly hundreds of miles away? Also, my unit was defective in that it would only display one color. Ambient said that they knew there were problems with quite a few units. However in 3 weeks, they never offered a solution. You can pay to get weather in your area but for $179 I feel this should be included with the product. Finally, the temperature that is indicated by color is rather difficult to decipher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work if you're outside a major city.","review":"I purchased the Weather Beacon as a gift after reading the product description, which implied it would receive a signal essentially anywhere in the country, although perhaps not one that had the most local info. The recipient of the unit tells me it doesn't work at all at their rural location (50 miles from a major US city) and it also doesn't work when within 20 miles of the city. This was after going through the online setup procedure as recommended in the instructions.So... I strongly recommend not purchasing the Weather Beacon unless there is some way to be sure it will actually be able to receive the required signal at the intended location. The manufacturer should provide a link to a web page that shows the geographical locations where it would function. Otherwise, it's a very expensive doorstop.

Musically, its probably not going to impress anyone who isn't already a Shai Hulud fan. Most of the recordings are pretty crappy, and several of the tracks don't even have vocals.

Flanagan has immersed himself in contemporary scholarship about the Scriptures, and specifically the Gospel of Mark, but his primarily concern, arising from his work as a pastor, is to communicate to his readership the central meaning of Mark according to its original audience and its significance for contemporary Christians.

I can't wait to get Season II."},{"rating":"2","title":"First in the series","review":"Everyone else has described the gist of the story so well that anything else I add would be totally superfluous,except to say that the costuming and make up are first rate and once you get over your initial shock at all of the exposed, even flaunted genitalia ( such as the sex slave sent as a gift to a very respectable Roman matron with his VERY large penis wrapped in twined gold ribbon), you quite soon get used to it all and take it for granted. I liked the idea of the Romans of all classes talking in what would be their proper accents, by the British actors, rather than some fancied up pseudo accent which was formerly used in sword and sandal movies years ago. Having a reasonable knowledge of the history of that era, I found it easy to follow the machinations of Pompey and Ceasar and their various cronies and thoroughly enjoyed this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show","review":"Ok ... This is a really great series. Interesting characters you care about in an fascinating time. War, politics, sex, friendship, and occasionally love. It is hard to describe the historical aspects. The depiction of day to day life during the late republic and early Roman empire is very accurate. Some of the historical characterizations are also accurate (like Cicero). The primary historical events are also accurate. But this is fiction and the writers did use poetic license with respect to most of the main historical figures. More than worth watching -- gives you a real sense of what it was like to live in Rome at the time -- both as a noble and commoner! And it is a lot of fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rome Season 1","review":"I never received the video on my IPad or Kindle Fire. Where is it???? I did not think the transaction went through.

Rome deftly mixes historical figures with semi-fictional and fictional characters in this historical drama. Kevin McKidd and Ray Stevenson are outstanding as the semi-fictional, Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo, the two soldiers who find their lives intertwined with key historical events. Ciarán Hinds as Julius Caesar, Polly Walker as Atia of the Julii, Max Pirkis as young Octavian, and James Purefoy as Mark Antony are excellent, as is the rest of the cast in this fine and exciting historical drama. This is well done, exciting, and entertaining drama at its highest level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive!","review":"I never got a chance to see this series on HBO, so I decided recently to buy this set of the first season. Let me tell you this show is simply addictve I watched one episode on a sunday afternoon and I could not stop watching. It is not totally historically accurate, but it is very entertaining, it tells the story of the Caesar-Pompey feud for control of Rome. It has fine casting and performaces and all the lust,sexy, greed and power of ancient Rome. I think Polly Walker steals the show as Atia, a character you will love and love to hate, as well as lust after. I'm already planning to buy season 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROME ROCKS!","review":"To enjoy all of the excitement once again is a thrill! I am so sad that HBO took this series off the air.

Seriously.","review":"It's hard to make one of the most written about, pondered about, and studied periods of histories new. But HBO does just that.This isn't really a story about Caesar and Antony and Cleopatra or Octavian, at least not yet. This is really a story of two members of the tenth legion, who get caught up in all this history.The new characters are amongst the most memorable television characters of all time, and the casting is superb, with Cleopatra being the only exception.This is gorgeous to watch, fun, and educational all at the same time. Every episode is a work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"HBO does it again...I wish I could give it 10 stars","review":"First of all let me give kudos to HBO for another quality program. In my opinion, this series is the best historical fiction in television history (even better than Upstairs, Downstairs). This should be required viewing for college level students of ancient history. I am now utterly fascinated with Roman and Egyptian history. The set design and costumes are impeccable. The casting and acting are unbelievable. I intend to purchase both seasons of this series, along with all 5 seasons of Six Feet Under. This is the best of what TV has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO NEGATIVE AND POLITICALLY CORRECT.","review":"I disagree with the positive reviewers. This is far too negative an account of an admittedly brutal time of our ancient heritage. A wise person - Winston Churchill stated \\"without Rome there would be no western civilization.\\" The script was predictable and petty, the acting bordered on constant hysteria. To get ratings which this series apparently did'nt. They exaggerated the sex and violence to appeal to our baser selves.

The series certainly tries to get some of the details right but the writers often fudge the facts in order to create interesting plots (like a common centurian fathering the child of Cleopatra).The sex and the violence is more than a little gratuitous. In other words you dont need these extended scenes to propel the story -- its eye-candy designed by HBO for those who like that stuff.This HBO series is entertaining and there's some great crisp writing and excellent ensemble acting. Some episodes are MUCH better written than others, but that holds true of any good TV series.Just dont think this is 100% real history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close caption defective on screen","review":"I dont kno what is up with this dvd!!!

All of the sexually explicit content in the series was not necessary and it takes away from the historical element of the series. I was hoping Rome would be a great series to show my students, but due to all of the garbage it is not. I wish they would have showed some battle scenes and not just allude to them. I hope some producer comes along and does a better job.This was nothing more than another soap-opera with lots of violence with some historical elements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great television!","review":"I think this is one of the best portraits of roman life-style on TV.For my taste a bit too much focus on orgies and sex-life of some non-leading personae, but probably quite realistic that way.Excellent performance of the Julius Cesar character (forgot the name of the actor).Not very believable picture of Augustus/Octavian though ( a bit exaggerated smart-a..), still , worth every penny!I loved the first season and am looking very much forward to watch the second season soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"An HBO sleeping giant!","review":"The series, Rome, was very quiet, unintteresting and univolving through much of the first four disks. By disk number 5, Rome grabs you and won't let go. I couldn't stop being involed with characters such as Julius Ceasar, Antony, a very interesting Cleopatra, plus a very evil pair, Atia and Sevilla.The last two disks raise Rome to tagic levels that totally took me by surprise. I am sure season two will rise to a 5 star season. Joe Tucci"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great drama, but history rewritten","review":"Although director Bruno Heller touts that he and the other makers have kept as close to historical facts as possible, I don't think they did. History typically gets written by the victor, which for the period depicted was Octavian (August Caesar). As a result, Marc Anthony has been presented to us as a hard-nosed drug addict, and Cleopatra as a prostitute, neither remotely capable of doing their jobs or of motivating their people with anything but violence and vice. Heller accepted that without a bit of sepsis and probably even added to it. Additionally, when Pompey is not pompous and Brutus is not brute (but a somewhat likable weakling instead), you know that somebody has not been paying attention - and I'm sure it was Heller.Other than that, the series makes for great entertainment, and it does a great job in sketching how life in ancient Rome might have been the same as and different from ours."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the authenticity and the history of this show!","review":"Great job casting, and the story line is right on.

After watching I, Claudius again this puffed up, hammy, over-produced series demonstrates the low state of acting and playwriting today. Don't waste your time - or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"First I don't expect many viewers in USA, to understand Rome. The series itself will attract the intelligencia, not your typical john doe. It is probably the best historical series I've ever seen. The second to last episode where, Titus Pulo screams \\"13!\\" brings you to tears!It is just sad that HBO decided to stop at Season 2!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Except for the \\"Pilot\\" episode, this series was all hype. I'm amazed at how many people got into this. The history wasn't even close, even giving artistic license. It became drudgery to sit through it. I will grant you I sat down to the whole affair, so I could be more in tune to the weakness of the subsequent episodes. I SOLD my copy, and was happy to get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very inspiring","review":"I wasn't expecting something as vulgar as this series. Too many sex scenes, which only detract from what could have been a great series. I am sure somewhere in the old school of directing there is advice given to directors about sometimes \\"less is more\\". HBO seems to be in the business of shocking people now adays. It's a shame, for the same company who bought out Band of Brothers, you can see that there is talent there, but it seems misdirected in the Rome series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say what? Sex is still the number one seller","review":"It's all here. The breasts, the penises, the inane dialogue between the two main characters. Incest, rape, men with men, women with women, pedophiles, and all the blood and gore you can wallow in to your heart's content. They even say \\" Say what?\\" in the series to make you feel right at home. In between the swinging penises and breasts, the fall of Rome is told in all it's gory demise. Why did I watch it you ask? Because I paid for it and now I'll pass it on for someone else to enjoy or not. I'm now in the process of watching the second series. Because I paid for that set too. Somewhere, there must be a good book or movie about the fall of Rome without having a breast or penis flung in my face every 10 or 15 minutes. I know that these incidents did happen and they still are today but I don't feel that constantly showing them throughout the series had anything to do with the fall of Rome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical continuity or inaccuracies aside...","review":"This series is terrific solely for the central relationship of soldiers Titus Pullo and Lucius Vorenus, played by the absolutely fabulous Ray Stevenson and Kevin McKidd. Their evolving friendship is what kept me glued to HBO throughout the series (the historical soap opera aspects were entertaining as well, but still), and they're what will bring me back to season 2 in 2007. I love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Real You Can Almost Smell It!!!","review":"This series provides an incredible and realistic view into ancient Roman life. Extremely high production values combined with great writing and acting make for a thoroughly enjoyable experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly not for everyone.","review":"The acting, character development, historical accuracy and the story are all 5 star, the best I have ever seen. The sex and violence caught me off guard more than once, and while not excessive or purient, the viewer should be mature. Maybe this grandma is over-reacting, but I'd not let young people view this without supervision. I say that, but the entire series is so excellent and true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not recommended for children","review":"While I loved watching this series, I do wish there were a child-friendly version of this series that I could watch with the kids to introduce them to ancient Roman civilization. I do think that HBO could offer such a version without the sex scenes without losing too much of the flavor of the uncut version. Just a suggestion ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm glad this is a series.","review":"The mini-series \\"Rome\\" could well have been a feature length movie but much of the storyline would have ended up on the cutting room floor due to time constraints. I have studied enough history to know this series is reasonably accurate and well presented. I viewed this with a friend over the course of several weeks and we thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Addictive Series","review":"While it's true the series gets off to a relatively slow start and its treatment of Roman private life (that in particular of Vorenus and Niobe) smacks a little too much of the soap-operatic, it gets into full stride, even becoming addictive, in the scenes of conflict between Pompey and his rival Caesar. Both in dialogue and acting, these sequences are supreme, with Ciaran Hinds (Caesar) giving nothing less than acting lessons every time he appears on screen. Since both Pompey and Caesar are dead by the end of Season One, however, this viewer hopes the writers will find a way, in dealing with politics and public life, to have the Second Season equal the First."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Television of 2006","review":"I do not subscribe to HBO, but a friend recommended this series to me. I rented the DVDs from Blockbuster when they became available. I enjoyed the series so much I bought a set for myself and a set as a Christmas present. I have loaned my set to friends who liked the series as much as I did.The series focuses on the period between Julius Caesar crossing the Rubicon and his assassination, a period of about 5 years (49 BCE to 44 BCE). Although the series focuses on historically significant figures, including Caesar, Mark Antony, Brutus, Octavius (Augustus), Caesar's niece, and Brutus's mother, it also takes up the story of two soldiers.The series evokes a wonderful feeling for the period in the authentic settings and costumes.I am looking forward to future installments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it, loved it, loved it!!!","review":"This is one of the best tv on dvd that I have ever seen. At first, it didn't really draw me in and I thought it might not be so good. However, I gave the second show a chance and from there, I was hooked! All in all, I would say it was quite remarkable.

But it is ridiculous that HBO requires that I watch an ad for all their other shows and listen to a Tracy Chapman song before watching ROME. I paid for the DVD I want to see ROME, not an ad for Soparanos, or any other show. I wonder who the jerk is at HBO who decided to put that at the begining of the disk. Then there is the fact that HBO Dvds don't have a play all feature. Almost every other show has that tech, if you can call it tech. As a result you have to scroll through menus after each show instead of just being able to let it run. TWO stars, but would have been Five for content alone. Make better DVDs HBO."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninteresting characters locked in this historical piecce","review":"Sorry- Episode 1 wasn't worth the rental fee at all.The characters were vicious and unendearingly one dimensional- so who would care to watch them connive and knife each other? Nero himself would care more for these folks.Great costumes, scenes- everything else was top notch.. but the viewing audience is left with little more than the spectacle and remembrance of famous historical names from ancient Rome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite tv series of all time","review":"This is one of my favorite tv series of all time. The scenery and costumes are superb. Its just overall well done. I really like the acting, the directing, the soundtrack, the scripts. I'm really into history, and this sparked an interest in Julius Casesar and I started reading his biography by Phillip Freeman. Life was just so different back then, and dangerous, and the series makes it very realistic. For example, getting away with murder was much easier, and men had the right to kill their wives, children and slaves without consequence. While most of the back story with Varenus and Pullo is fictional, most of the major events of Caesar's life and his documented interactions are in the series. As I was reading the biography, I found myself saying, yes that was actually in the show, I didn't know that was true. The story of Julius Caesar and the end of the republic is a great story and this show captures it in an entertaining and captivating way."},{"rating":"2","title":"good season","review":"An interesting look at Roman life, war, and political ambitions, well acted and at times raw in intensity.

For all the sex and gore, it's astonishingly dull and historically inaccurate to boot. A Roman centurion, with eight years experience in Gaul, who blanches at breaking a non-citizen's arm? Centurions were the thugs who kept the thugs in line. Caesar humiliated by graffiti that said he had inappropriate liaisons with Roman matrons? The matron might have committed suicide, but it wouldn't have harmed Caesar's reputation. Cicero stupid? Sure, he's long-winded and a pain to translate... but not stupid. The whole thing seems tainted by the writers' notions, perhaps borrowed from George Bernard Shaw, of Caesar as Nietzchean Superman.

Boy, it's not hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys here, is it? Sadly, Keillor has abandoned all objectivity in favor of a simplistic rant that is as unfair as it is inaccurate. The one good thing about this book is that it's not rife with the vulgarity and sexual hijinks that littered his last book. What we are left with here is a talented American writer reduced to cornfed Michael Mooreisms. Tsk. Tsk."},{"rating":"1","title":"It figures","review":"I stopped having anything to do with Garrison Keillor after he used his early morning poets corner on NPR to share vulgarities with Amarica's commuters. I didn't know if he was a Democrat or a Republican or neither. However, after almost driving my kindergartner off the road in a mad effort to save my baby from this man's coarse expressions, I needn't have waited for the title of this book to direct me to his political leanings. It figures!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've bought several of these to give away","review":"A small book with a big message.... Easy for friends and family to read and a good gift around election time, to make sure the grandkids know why they are voting Democratic. It's up to us to do the teaching, as they don't know our history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A breath of fresh air","review":"After spending the last two decades being treated as if I had some kind of terrible social disease because I am a liberal Democrat, Keillor's book is a wonderful breath of fresh air.What a joy to find a book celebrating what it means to be a Democrat! What a joy to find the true essence of liberal/progressive philosophy described in Keillor's incomparable style!Every teacher should read the \\"Democrats are diehard teachers\\" in the chapter \\"The Good Democrat,\\" and every Democrat should be proud of the rest of that chapter as Keillor describes so very well what we stand for.Buy this book to share with your friends, with teachers and other Democrats and undecideds. It's time to feel good about ourselves and what we believe in again.And remember what Keillor said on the last page quoting Dante: \\"The hottest place in hell is reserved for those who in time of crisis remain neutral.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The title fits the book","review":"Garrison writes just as he talks, so don't be surprised when some of his sentences span pages. That being said, his argument for the democratic party is eloquent and agreeable. I am desperately trying to get my parents, who are conservative Christians from Minnesota, to read this book, as it comes from their point of view, and might actually have a chance at changing their political opinions. Garrison doesn't whine or tell you what to think in this political manifesto of sorts; he gives a quiet opinion, that is hardly recognizable as an opinion, about the way the American government is run. A great, quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with D. Busch","review":"A friend loaned this to me and within the first few pages I was really disappointed. I kept expecting the tone to change from a rosy eyed remembrance of how things used to be in the good old days, glorification of homogenous MN culture (with PC nods to communities such as the Hmong) and cheap shot generalizations of those with opposing political beliefs. GK sings the praises of personal responsibility (for oneself and community) while at the same time espousing the need for a 'benevolent' government to decide what is in all of our best interests.A terrible disappointment and I expected more from this author. This type of one sided good guys / bad buys viewpoint is what is really wrong with the political structure in US today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOSPEL OF LIBERALISM FOR PREACHERS AND OTHERS","review":"This is an incredible book that explains in a very serious--but often humorous--way what a good Christian perspective on politics is and ought to be. The religious right has been king-on-the-hill far too long. This is a must-read for anyone claiming to preach the gospel. Our politics should incorporate the parable of the Good Samaritan and much more. Here is Keillor: \\"This is Democratic bedrock: we don't let people lie in the ditch and drive past and pretend not to see them dying.\\" If I were still teaching my seminary courses (\\"My Calvin Seminary Story\\"), I would include this book on a reading list----especially before the 2008 election. This book is still as fresh as it was the day it was published. Buy up copies and pass them out to your religious-right friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Gift to Fellow Progressives!","review":"While I'm sure there are some who will be offended by Garrison Keillor's portrayal of Republicans, for those of us so committed to the notion of a \\"social contract\\" as being fundamental to our democracy, this collection of CD's is a delight! I've already given two sets as gifts to liberal friends...and they have loved them as well. For me, Garrison really \\"gets it\\" and sheds considerable light on just why so many \\"live and let live\\" Minnesotans (and others from the more open-minded areas of the US heartland) are proud to identity themselves as Democrats. Although these recordings were done during the second Bush presidency, the sentiments and values Garrison expresses I found to be even more relevant to our current politically polarized environment now in 2012. Listeners will also enjoy learning about Garrison's university days and early life as a writer. Lots of humor, wisdom, and insight from this master American storyteller."},{"rating":"2","title":"A voice in the wilderness...","review":"A nice little book on values and America. It was nice to read a book that did not have the rabid nonsense of either the \\"sky is falling\\" liberal intellectual run amok or God-laced preaching right-wing wackos. I didn't agree with all of it, but much of it rang true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Set - Good Price","review":"I love Farberware and when I can get a good price, it's even better.

Sturdy, cooks evenly, very good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even the basics","review":"You get what you pay for. I was unimpressed with the sizes of the pans. They are either way to small or way to large. you either have a pan to cook for one or a pan to cook for 10. You have to go out and get other pans to suppliment the missing sizes. Neither non-stck pan is big enought to cook more than one grilled cheese, and bacon has to be cut in half to fit in the frying pan. I bought two sets (one as a gift) and wish I had known how difficult it was to cook in these pans before i got rid of my old pans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure-Junk-not worth the money.","review":"I have bought 2 of them and neither one worked.1st one remote did not work.Second one played one DVD then stopped playing.Product is no good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for DVD-R","review":"This player plays any DVD-R you can throw at it. The remote is a little wierd but you get used to it. Unbeatable price especially for progressve scan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Far Short","review":"The price was right, it looked good coming out of the box. The problem was it wouldn't play DVDs very well, if at all. I tried five different DVDs in the player and only one would play. The others got a couple of minutes into the program and the player stopped - just freeze frame. No matter what the cost, I wouldn't use this if it was given to me free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 8 months","review":"I had the same problem that many other people had.I bought this DVD player about 8 months ago and it died.The warranty is for parts only and you have to pay for shipping back to them and pay $40 for labor.I will not be buying anything from Cyberhome ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junkie","review":"With the good reviews at Amazon.com bought this piece of cr*p. It worked well for a few hours, after that, it just froze. Initially thought that it was my DVD, so bought a brand new DVD. It would read the menu and again it would freeze. This piece of junkie is already packed to be returned. So, Good Luck in believing the good reviews in here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived \\"Broken\\"","review":"This unit was 19 days in transit from Amazon (who was surprisingly uncaring about it) arrived nearly non-functional. The remote would turn it on, and illuminate the OPEN and CLOSE words on the display. No other functions worked. The DVD tray never moved. And the on-cabinet controlls did nothing. No open/close, not even on/off. It may be cheap, but it is also cheaply made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"I brought this unit after reading the other great reviews on this product. I am so impressed the overall functionality of this unit, it was a good buy. Cyber Home has produce a good product at and affordable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP PRICE/ CHEAP PRODUCT","review":"I agree with the other negative reviews. The picture and sound quality are good on this machine WHEN IT'S WORKING. Many times it does not accept new DVD's (Bad Disc message). It's a Catch 22 though. Not worth paying shipping and possible upgrade charges to send it in for repairs because it was so cheap. I think I'll just cut my losses and move on. Anyone interested in a used Cyberhome DVD player that works half the time?"},{"rating":"1","title":"P-Scan Recall Issue","review":"Bad news... These players aparently suffer from a hardware flaw involving the Progressive Scan. Many users report problems involving video quality issues after activating the progressive scan feature (including myself). To solve please go to CyberHome's website and click on support to RMA your player. Unfortunately a firmware upgrade will not help this."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Months Old and it died!","review":"Bought this 3 months ago, thought it was a good deal. Now 3 months later it's been in the shop twice and this last time I was told there's no hope. Not only that, but I have to pay them to dismantle it to remove a rental disc. *sigh*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Multisystem? yes and no.","review":"Great value for the money! (I even see that now it's even cheaper than when I bought it a month ago). We were mislead by Circuit City that these DVD player are multisystem in the sense that they translate PAL into NTSC. They do not. They are multisystem in the sense that you can play the different formats but you still have to have the corresponding (or multisystem) TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good midrange DVD player","review":"I think CyberHome CH-DVD 500 Progressive-Scan DVD Player is very good. Its not you $30 basic payer. It has progressive scan and outputs, but sold for a reasonable $50. Pretty good so far"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this Played","review":"My Cyberhome CH-500 worked great for about three months. Now it refuses to properly mix audio on certain DVDs, typically leaving out the center channel, so no voices! This problem manifests itself no matter how the audio is connected-amplifier, receiver, or directly to tv. Not to mention that the player has the habit of switching on sub-titles by default.There's FAR too MANY reviews here on the CH-500 malfunctioning after your 30 day warranty expires. Consider this player to have the plague: Avoid it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK while it lasted","review":"I had this for about a year and I was satisfied with it. I liked the MP3 player interface compared to my old Apex player.Last week, it just stopped reading my DVDs. It could still play any CD format (VCD,SVCD,MP3 CD). I tried to contact Cyberhome several times through their website and I never got a response back so I would caution those who are thinking of buying any of their products about Cyberhome's poor customer support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same as others - 9 month life span","review":"Worked wonderful for 9 months. Well 8.75 months. Then some screen lag and synch errors with the sound for a week before dying. Dead Dead and Dead. The cost of repair is more then the value of the unit, under their warranty. I'd advise against getting this unit unless you don't need one that lasts for some reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks, feels and works GREAT. . . for a few months!","review":"I experienced the same as many previous reviewers. And just like one of them, I bought two of these units. One quit working after about 6 months of VERY LIGHT USE. I'll bet I played less than 15 movies with it. It said \\"Bad Disk\\" with any disk I loaded.The other lasted a bit longer but after having a baby we used it less than the first one. Now this one turns on, but there is no response from the buttons on the bezel or the remote.I bought these after reading great reviews. Don't make the same mistake! Check out the reviews on their other products. Do not buy ANYTHING from this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"died after 11 months","review":"Died after 11 months of service :(didn't expect that for today's electronic products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected....","review":"I read so many reviews about Cyberhome and thought I'll jump on the deal, but I'm not impressed at all. Seems it doesn't read the disc too well or makes my DVDs skip alot. I watch my movies on the Sony DVD player and it's fine! Also, the disc tray is a bit slow on opening.I'm gonna jump in on the Norcent DP-302v and see how that goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Crap","review":"I bought this a year ago, probably used for 25 hrs max (since I had another DVD player also). This is broken already.I don't advice people to buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I choose you","review":"Your player only plays one type of dvd that I have. I brought it here to Belize thinking that it was a good player..I won't advise anyone to purchase one. Please correct your scanner to be capable to scan any dvd disc. Jacqui"},{"rating":"1","title":"God-Awful","review":"I bought this dvd player based only on the reviews I read here. I wouldn't be surprised if it turned out those reviews were planted by Cyberhome. This dvd player locked up and froze one or more times with EVERY dvd I tried to play. This might very well explain the low price. Suggestions: (1) Spend a few more bucks and get a dvd player that works; and/or (2) if, like me, you've already bought this turkey, wrap it up and give it to your mother-in-law for Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not play DVD -/+R","review":"I bought CyberHome CH-DVD 200 Progressive-Scan DVD Player. It is good DVD player for $29.00. This model does not play DVD +/- R you can not burn MP3 songs or video or JPEGs in to DVD +/- R and play in this player. The buttons on the player have to be pressed hard to function.It is JUST OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality is not that good.","review":"I have this player for about one year. It playsall kind of DVD/VCD/CD disks, and it can be made region free.However, The player started to overheat and frozen recently , and it has problems reading some disks. I cleaned the player with a lens cleaner disk, but it did not help.Looks like it is dying. My Old Pioneer player still works after more than 3 years.It was a nice machine, but it did not last."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke within the first 6 months","review":"That about says it all - it broke within 6 months of purchase. I'm definitely not happy about that. Cyberhome charges for labor for any services after 3 months, so it might just be cheaper for me to get another player from a more reputed manufacturer (probably should've done that in the first place).I don't think I mistreated the player in any particular way. I did often pause DVDs mid-way and leave the player on. Not sure if this should've caused any damage."},{"rating":"2","title":"... but they won't last forever.","review":"Hi folks,I notice a lot of the reviews for the region freeplayers are old and, while reading them, wondered whatkind of experiences buyers have had with their players aftersome time has passed. As a fan of asian cinema I do comeacross the occassional need for region-free capability,so these players are a must. I bought a cyberhome 500player back in 2002 and it worked until about halfwaythrough 2005, at which point it rapidly faded until it wasuseless. While it worked it was GREAT, but thesewonderfully cheap players should 'not' be expected to lastfor the long haul. Having said that, and considering how'cheap' the players are, you're more or less getting yourmoney's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's in the trash","review":"I bought one two years ago and it went out of service 13 months later. I could see only 15 DVDs. It was impossible to find any spare part of that player. So, I lost all I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub Woofer channel","review":"I've used this player off and on for about a year and have no complaints other than the sub woofer channel apprears not to work. Tried every possibility and after reading these reviews, I think it is the player. If anyone has had a similar problem, please contact me. I'll probably buy another player and see if the problem corrects itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine player at an excellent price!","review":"Progressive scan, DTS, Dolby 5.1, Auto PAL or NTSC, region free (set it to Region 0 via the remote), component video output, selectable aspect ratio (4:3 or 16:9), composite video and audio cables included.Put in any disc from any country and it plays.

The remote buttons are small and poorly placed.I would like to get my money back for this piece of junk but I did not take it out of the box and discover its shortcomings until after 30 days ;-(I would avoid this product at any price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic piece of hardware","review":"I've had this DVD player for over a year. I have upgraded the BIOS twice. I have it set as region 0 (in other words, region free). There are tutorials on the internet on what you need to do to make it region 0. It's just in a hidden menu.I play this thing to death, and have only ever had one problem with it. The problem was with \\"Anger Management,\\" but I flashed the BIOS the the new version, and everything was perfection again.The new BIOS is available from Cyberhome's official web site. All you need to do is download the ISO (disc image), use an ISO burning program (nearly every popular CD burning program will do this) to burn the CD, put it in your DVD player, follow some instructions, and there you go, BIOS flashed. Easy.The only complaint I could have with this is the lack of DVD-A support. But, it came out before that was available.I play US DVDs, imported Asian and European DVDs, mp3 CD-Rs, audio CDs / CD-Rs, VCDs, xVCDs, SVCDs, xSVCDs; all of them play beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality product","review":"I have had this DVD player for about 8 months and it died.

I am currently running with an ATI Radeon 9800 with DVI to this LCD. When stationary, the picture looks great, however the 20ms response time makes Counter Strike unpleasant, and Far Cry nauseating to play. Turning around inside or outside becomes a blur. The walls on either side of a cooridor becomes a blur when running through. Watching DVDs is very do-able, but during fast sequences, especially when the background is spinning quickly you can't make out anything.Those who reviewed this monitor and said the response time was un-noticable when using the DVI input were wrong. It truly boggles me how they came to this conclusion. This is old technology, and should not be purchased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works great for storage","review":"I like the bankers boxes because I can slap a label on them and they utilize space well in my garage or storage closet.

That means that when you jerk opposite corners to open the flat box, the bottom forms from extensions of the sides/ends that unfold, overlap, and \\"lock\\" together. Very fast and easy to assemble(and knock down).These are just fine for normal storage. (Pack it, stash it, only rarely need the contents.)I have LOTS of books and little space. Using banker boxes I can fit the contents of several book cases into the space of only one. The problem is that books are heavy and I am always shuffling the boxes (whatever I want is usually at the bottom). Snap-Lock bottoms will not stand up to this kind of usage (frequent lifting of heavy weight). In my experience, by the time I've moved a box about a dozen times, the Snap-Lock bottom is failing.If I had known these were Snap-Lock style boxes I would not have bought them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy Box.

I was intrigued by the sound of the Tindersticks when the movie \\"Nenette Et Boni\\" was reviewed on NPR -- they played a haunting Tindersticks instrumental from the movie in the background. I tried in vain to find the soundtrack, and could only find this CD by them. So I gave it a try.Uggh, if there is lousier, more discordant, non-sensical, pretentious CD out there I don't want to hear it. While they do seem to know how to play their respective instruments quite competantly, they don't seem to have any interest in fusing their meandering playing styles into anything discernable. Perhaps they're under the influence of different hallucinogenics.I would have given it 0 stars if possible, but track # 5 is so awful it gets a good laugh out of me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass","review":"I got the spanish cuts.

The only problem I have is that if I try to balance the phone on my ear and shoulder, my chin hits the talk button, causing it to hang up. I have gotten better about balancing, and if you hit the talk button right away it usually doesn't hang up, but it was a little frustrating at first, and I hung up on people.

The young hip-hop impresario awed many with his blazing summer '00 single \`Poly'n' (backed with \`Chinese Arithmetic') & has now dropped his freshman release in 2001. Features thirteen hot, stylin', original joints, including the first single 'Paradise Life', the perfect summertime track (which also has an accompanying video), plus it's B-side 'The Anthem' & much more.

DVD+RW works but you cannot set recording speed and leave it like VHS. You have to go into fuctions and program the managment each time you use it or it records in XP ( 1 hour only ). I have yet to get a full 6 hours of recording as promised, probably due to the formating of disk by the unit. Like most Panasonic operating instructions be prepared to call tech support. You need the remote to operate the machine. VHS works well on Analog broadcast. Except for being so slow the tuner is good for both Analog and DTV.

(So how do I get to the topmost bolt on the starter that I can't even see? Do I need to go ahead and yank the exhaust manifold off or what?)There are no wiring diagrams, no detailed information on body works (info on power windows, sun roof, etc...) and little to no detailed info on the drive line.

Moore clearly idolizes Green and the way he reinterprets these pieces could have resulted in too much \\"we are not worthy\\" posturing.

This album made me smirk stupidly while driving home after a hard day's work (and on the eve of a week-long vacation!). Superb production, excellent performances, ace songs.

Gary Moore has blazed a trail through the years like very few rock and blues guitarists can claim, but here Gary does a fine job of evoking the spirit of Peter Green's early work with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers as well as his work with his own Fleetwood Mac, music he himself experienced first hand as a teenager and later more closely sharing the bill with the Mac, and even getting the opportunity to purchase Peter Green's prized '59 Les Paul.

Now, I don't have to worry about having my iPod fully charged just because I am leaving my computer for several hours or days at a time. The cigarette lighter charger just stays in the car with the retractable cable - which I love - and the wall charger is convenient to pack and take along on a trip. The price was perfect too!The only reason I am rating 4 stars, instead of 5, is because the wall charger was not working when I first received the kit. I contacted the seller though, and I was sent a new wall charger without any kind of hassle at all.

The wall charger will work if you don't move it and find the perfect position to leave your IPOD. But if a gentle breeze shifts it slightly, it will go back to killing your battery. Listen to the negative reviews. If not, please use this on an IPOD that is under warranty so you can get a new one when it wrecks your IPOD.OH! and the USB adapter will work, for a few days.

(most of the time)I do NOT recommend this item, I bought for $0.01 and paid $3.99 shipping and handling. It is not worth anything to send back since I will have to pay to send it back and for what??

However, last night I plugged the new Ipod in and the screen stated something to the effect \\"Will not charge with unsupported device.\\" Unfortunately for me, that means that this accessory does not fulfill the only purpose for which I bought it. I am not sure if that means that all 3 parts to this package won't work --- wall charger, car charger and USB cord --- but I plan to try them later today. I just wanted anyone searching the same way that I did for a good deal on an accessory to be aware that it doesn't appear to work as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all impressed!","review":"This product looked like a great deal, but the car charger does not work at all.

It freed us from using a PC/Laptop to charge the iPod.The sync cable on it's own though sometimes acted funny when being used for sync. I presume this is being caused by some loose connection.

Some will work and others may destroy your iPod and it isn't worth the risk to save a few bucks. I plugged one end of the charger to a iPod classic and plugged the adapter into a wall socket. The adapter began making sizzling and popping sounds so I immediately unplugged it from the wall. But it got worse. There was no way to remove the connection from the iPod by hand and I eventually had to resort to using a pair of channel locks to disconnect it. This literally destroyed the charger but at least the iPod still worked. So I never did try the auto charger because I figured that would set off every engine light on the dashboard.

As such the units I have are on no value.Make certain you see the size and get written demonsions of unit when ordering. If you have to spend the money to return it to the Manufacucter it will most likely cost more than you paid for the unit in the first place.My recommendation is do not buy.

The hotsync cable doesn't sync, and triggers a warning that the iPod is an unknown device. I wound up throwing everything in the trash can.Don't waste your time or risk damaging your iPod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not measuring up","review":"This product at first seems awesome. it has a retractable cord which makes it easy to carry around, it comes with a car adaptter and a wall outlet. However I have ordered this product twice before, because the USB cable itself broke. Over time, the coating on the cord begins to separate from either end. And once the coating has seperated, the actual wires begin to break. And then when you connect your ipod, no charge. So as much of a deal you might get with this product, the cord itself will break in about 6 months or less.The wall adapter...a piece broke off after my second time plugging it into the wall.No complaints for the car adapter.

When I recieved the product it did not work...I plugged it in and the little red light flickered for a while and was not charging my ipod at all. They sent me a defective product. When I wrote to them to see if I could get my money back they told me to send the product back to them and they would refund me the money. The only problem is that I already had to pay to ship it to myself and then they wanted me to pay to ship it back. The combined shipping cost was more than the cost of the product itself. In the end I will never purchase something from this company again, it was a complete waste of my money and I will be aware of inexpensive products advertised on this website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Very, very poor quality.

The retractable USB cable doesn't connect to my 3rd gen. I was sent a replacement cable and it doesn't work either. The LED on the car charger lights up, but it doesn't charge the device. So, basically you're paying a few bucks for a wall charger, which is pretty handy. Even better, it's dual voltage; so if you're abroad, you can charge it without hassle.Overall, it's worth buying if you know that you're only getting a wall charger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Fine","review":"The first shipment contained items that didn't work at all.

I tried a few combination's with the devices to test if they worked,...1 I tried plugging my PS3 remote to charge it, it didn't work2 I tried plugging it into a different outlet3 I tried the extension cable in my computer to charge the iPod, and found the retractable cable didn't work eitherMy initial thought was that one of the devices didn't work, but it came as a surprise to me that two of the devices that came in this package didn't work properly. Needless to say I didn't even try the Car charger, I packed them back up and sent them back the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the price and convenience, it works!","review":"I was first taken back by the price, to think that it's not constructed well.

Don't use the car charger plug.","review":"A word of caution, this is a low priced item because corners have been cut and the quality control isn't very good.I've purchased 5 or 6 of these items now and for the most part everything has been fine. I've never had an issue with the USB cord or the wall adapter but I've had a few problems with the car charger. A couple of the sets have refused to charge my phone. Which isn't to bad for something this cheap but recently we had something a little more concerning happen. I gave a set to my mother-in-law to use for her car. Before she realized what it was she had fried the fuses in two separate cars when trying to use the charger.So if you want a cheap USB cord and wall charger then this is a decent cheap set. Don't buy this for the car charger, its not worth damaging you car or device to save a couple bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not order from this company","review":"Ordered the universal apple ipod back in April.

In part of the description it says iPhone but in the main description it says iPod so it's a little confusing in the description as to what will charge. The retractable cable doesn't charge my phone. I really was just looking for a lighter adapter so it kinda did what I wanted it to do. I tossed the junk cable in the trash and used the lighter & wall charger w/ a different cable.

The cigarette lighter attachment works sometimes. You have to move it around a lot in the outlet to get it to start charging. The outlet adapter is pretty much the same, it works sometimes. This could be because of the piece that fits into you apple product. I had an iPhone 3G and it fit VERY tightly; I was almost afraid to plug it in. Then sometimes it wouldn't work.

Hopefully, this faucet being all plastic, it will not corrode and will be very easy to remove when the time comes. It operates very much like a certain name brand faucet. It will probably not be possible to obtain repair parts for this faucet when it needs repair. However, the cost of the faucet is not currently much more than some faucets' repair kits. I am glad I purchased this faucet. It does come with a plastic pop-up assembly, which can cost $7 at some close-out stores. The visible parts of the pop-up are chrome plated.UPDATE 1/10/2012 - The cold water side has started leaking and will not cut all the way off. Sometimes it is a steady stream, sometimes a quick drip.

The high impact sound recorded in the early digital era is impressive but the massed strings sound a bit glaring in the upper register.

I am amazed to think that this was his first stab at a feature length film as the quality exceeds all expectations. He keeps us interested in the plot and characters from start to finish and allows you to delve right into the story. The characters are strong and the story is driven through them - and you immediately start sympathising and relating to them.

The writers did a good job melding different plot lines to keep the story moving. For a first time director, he showed a steady hand at the helm. This is definitely worth a watch, especially if you like substance over flash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Movie","review":"In these difficult times a thoughtful movie with an inspirational message is more than welcome. PJ delivers on both fronts. Howard Nash and John Heard's characters are both in search of solace and solutions and in the setting of a mental facility both struggle to find their individual paths. John Heard portrayal of Dr Shearson is a well crafted and believable performance. Howard Nash's PJ is a conflicted portrayal of man searching for meaning. Patrica Ray is masterful as \\"PJ's\\" girl friend. Vincent Pastore adds a comical spin and lightness to the darker portions of the movie. Neal Argo's music ties the elements of the film with a superb musical talent. Finally, Russ Emanuel's direction brings it all together with a fine touch for young director with great promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and buy a kong and stuff it with goodies","review":"If your dog likes to chew or is pretty hard on the toys this is not the toy you want to get.

Have a 14 week old Cairn (weighs 6 lbs.) that is a very active chewer & he'd probably try to swallow this thing whole. It would take him longer to chew his dog food than it would one of the rawhide rings. I know dog toys aren't cheap (if you're buying them all the time) but the price for this size bone ($7.73) is ridiculous to me. Especially when you add to that the cost of the refills. This toy would have been great for my Pom when she was a baby: she weighed 2 lbs. at 3 months. But for a \\"small\\" dog? Guess my idea of small is way different.

She didn't lose interest in it but she ended up eating the bones on either side of the toy before finishing the treats. She only weighs 9 pounds so if anything this could be used for a Chihuahua. My dog never chews up any of her toys so this one wasn't very good. We used it for about a week before throwing it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China","review":"Although my dog was very attracted to this toy, I chose to stop purchasing the replacement disks once I realized they were made in China. I just don't trust the quality of the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some concern....","review":"As an owner of 2 Doxie \\"toyminators\\" I was looking for a \\"chew toy\\" that would actually help them. This product was recommended but I have to warn you. Even without a treat attached, like mine, the boy chewed to the point that the stem cracked and the whole \\"bone edge\\" was in his mouth. Thankfully I was there and he didn't try to swallow it:) I'm not sure there really is a non-destructable toy out there but if ANYONE has a recommendation I welcome it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good toy so far","review":"What saves this toy is that the rubber ball can come out for a game of fetch and does seem quite durable. My dachshund-mix enjoys chewing the plastic bones, but they quickly became very worn and ragged with lots of sharp edges. My other issue is with how quickly he devours the round rawhide treats (but he is a super-chewer so that didn't surprise me much). This toy is not on the same level as \\"squirrel dude\\" (also by busy buddy and the best dog toy EVER) but it's still a decent, well-priced toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two paws up from our pugs!","review":"This is our pugs' favorite toy.

Buy lots of refills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too easy","review":"This toy provided very little mental stimulation to my dog. The treat is so exposed and extremely easy to eat off, and the bone so hard and ball so heavy he wanted nothing to do with it after the treat was gone. We have a heavy chewer, but unless you have a small dog with a small light bite that takes time eating it, I just can't imagine it would be worth the price of buying their own hides to attach. I would suggest a nylabone first to make sure your dog is interested in chewing on the bone part even when there isn't treats attached."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Samoyed only interested on the treats, and not on the bouncy bone","review":"Once the inserted jerky treats have gone, my 11 month Samoyed soon left the bone alone and never touching it again.

After all he is new to toys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep away from your dog","review":"I purchased these based on the \\"good\\" reviews that it had received. I have a Shiba Inu who loves to chew and thought this would be the perfect answer. I did not know that the \\"Gnawhide treats\\" were so EASY to choke on. After my dog finished his treat, he was choking excessively and threw up everything. I recommend you stay away from this product. FYI, my dog is medium size and I got the so called medium sized treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Junk","review":"My Vizsla puppy was given this toy and had absolutely no interest in it. But that is not even why this Toy is junk.One afternoon in an attempt to get him to play with it, I tossed it towards him and the bone literally smashed into pieces. The only part salvaged from this toy was the rubber ball center. Which I now occasionally fill with peanut butter and he really love that. What a complete waste of money, it lasted one week. And he never even played with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"never received item","review":"The item was damaged in transit and was returned to the sender by the USPS. I had to drive 30 miles to the nearest store to purchase the product on Christmas Eve day."},{"rating":"2","title":"my dog's FAVORITE","review":"My dog (a 30 pound wire hair fox terrier and corgi mix) absolutely LOVES this toy!!! I originally got it so that he could have something to do while I was gone and he was in his crate, and was very disappointed to find that he pulled the circular rawhides off in a matter of minutes...at first I thought, \\"well there goes 10 bucks down the drain!\\". But after that, it became his FAVORITE bone. He just loves throwing it around and chewing on the bone ends. It lasted about 6 months before he chewed both ends off (note: he is a very very intense chewer), and even after that, he still loves playing with the purple ball that came in the middle. I bought him a new bone for christmas and again, he can't get enough of it. My roommates dog has the same feelings for these bones, and we have affectionately started calling them their \\"crack\\" bones because we don't know why they are completely obsessed with them! I would highly highly recommend!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps my dog busy","review":"There's nothing earth-shattering about this particular toy. It does what it is supposed to do, which is to keep my dog busy chewing out the rawhide pieces. She has it down to about twenty minutes. It does keep her busy, and when I go to refill it, she gets excited. The main problem is that it does become expensive to upkeep, since the little rawhide disks are like $8 a pack, and she goes through them pretty quickly. But the toy itself is tough, doesn't splinter, and stands up to her chewing (This is a 40 pound New Guinea Singing Dog mix). I'd recommend it, certainly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy","review":"My dogs love this toy! They can stay distracted for a good hour trying to get the rawhide. One thing that I would recommend for owners of multiple dogs is to invest in more than one toy. My dogs will fight over this bone because they love it so much (they usually aren't aggressive about food items)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great toy, size large is HEAVY DUTY","review":"i had a medium sized one for a couple months, and decided to order a large and it is BIG. this thing is really heavy duty. one difference i noticed is the treats on the medium sized bones peeled off easily, but the treats on the size large bone actually go almost underneath the ball so when its screwed together it cannot be pulled out easily, my dog has treats still left on his bone and cannot get the last bit off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for my dog","review":"Purchased this because of all of the great reviews, but this just isn't for my dog. I have a pit bull who is an enthusiastic power chewer. On its own, she wasn't really interested in it. I put a bit of peanut butter between the gnawhide discs and the rubber ball and she finally got it. It took her a good 20 - 30 minutes to get both of the treats off, after which she started chewing on the hard plastic bone ends. Unfortunately, she started gnawing little chunks off of the ends - besides the little pieces of plastic that were coming off, the chewing also peppered the texture of the hard white plastic with sharp little pieces that were cutting the inside of her mouth and gums - there was blood all over the ends of the toy. I had to take it away from her, because, while she likes the toy, she's also destroying her mouth with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not long lasting","review":"The small is really really small. I purchased this with two refill packs. I have a miniature schnouzer and he never destroys things. This product is not durable and I put it up each time each time he has finised the treat so it will last longer. The two packages of treats I purchased are nearly gone and this will hit the trash soon after."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids will love this!","review":"We saw this group at the Central PA Festival of the Arts in 2002.

This book was a good book, but at the very end, it kind of got off the whole subject and left me wondering what the next book in the series could possibly be about. The book was about a young man named Luke who was a hidden third child. In this book Luke is given a fake I.D. so he can go to Hendriks, a school for boys, where he is told to blend in.

I still think there should have been more info about Jason and Nina.( Why were they doing that anyway???) And Mr. Hendricks showed up way too suddenly, without much information.

He is still an accident waiting to happen, but he's getting a grip. The action again takes place during winter in Michigan's Upper Peninsula right on Lake Superior. The author can and does give us a whole new definition of cold.The story line is a stretch at times, and some things are never satisfactorily explained. It is more than surreal to meet a cultivated Russian gentleman in an ice shack in the wilds of upper Michigan. We are never told how and why he is there. Mr. Hamilton is a very good writer and paces the story well. There are no \\"dead\\" spots where nothing happens and the story stagnates. The reader's interest is engaged at all times with the interesting characters, Alex's actions and reactions, and the descriptive passages. What I needed is a more coherent plot that doesn't fall flat at the end.I'm looking forward to Steve Hamilton's future efforts. He is too good a writer to disappoint us."},{"rating":"2","title":"winter of the wolf moon","review":"Having just finished A Cold Day In Paradise, I was anxious to see if Hamilton could equal the quality of his first effort.

Well, since you're just out of the hospital with a collapsed lung, why not drive on up there for a showdown? To be really clever, let your moron partner give you zero information before you go in for the confrontation.And then ultimately, the plot in these McKnight books is so obvious, material for one book is stretched over three, McKnight bumbles around and then has a gestalt in the last few pages and everthing is so formulaic. Gee, I wonder if Alex and police chief Maven (hey, another clever name) will end up with a grudging respect for each other?

Hamilton asks us to suspend disbelief just a little too far. The work is full of unbelievable incidents, not the least of which is the presence of (anti)hero,Alex McKnight. The author gives us nothing on which to build a belief in the characters or the scenario of the book. Raymond Chandler should sleep soundly. A random piecemeal work, not given to luring the unsuspecting reader into the mistake of expecting drama, excitement or a finely honed, masterfully crafted mystery.

But, then perhaps I read these stories with a different mindset -- I like to identify with the hero, and this is one that I want no part of.

It was ready for use Tuesday. It worked Tuesday no problems, Wednesday some of the Caller ID numbers wouldn't show up. Thursday while at work...none of the calls I got were registered by caller id. I had 2 messages and it wouldn't erase the one and kept playing it. Thursday night, the phone wouldn't charge. The light kept flashing on and off. Friday morning, no lights...no charging...no answering maching...the power was dead. Called Motorola...and they said take it to the store...they wouldn't help me as it was under 30 days. Needless to say...I will be shipping it back! Not a great phone...not a great value!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great looks, poor Quality","review":"The phone looks great. That is the best thing I can say about it. You can barely hear the person on the other line. The reception is TERRIBLE. There is constant static, no matter how many times I change the channel. Answering machine is also very low in sound quality. Sadly, I am taking it back right now..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Answering machine does not work properly","review":"My boyfriend and I bought this phone at Target about one month ago. We liked the look, the price,the fact that it was cordless, from a great brand, and that it had an answering machine. It was easy to start using it. The battery last long but the ringing tones are way too low. It works well by the microwave although we get some static. We were shocked when we started to get messages we could not hear. The voice on the machine goes up and down so badly that it is impossible to determine who was on the phone and what they were saying. We are about to go back to Target to return it. Thank God we have the receipt!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to take a sledge hammer to this phone","review":"If you've seen the movie \\"Office Space\\" and remember what they did to the copy machine, that is what I want to do to this phone. If I walk 10 feet away from the base, this phone gets static. I can barely hear people on the other end, even with the volume all the way up. The recordings on the voicemail are almost impossible to understand - they go in and out. The rubber grips on the side of the phone smell like tires, and leave the smell on my fingers after use. This is the worst phone I have ever used in my entire life, literally."},{"rating":"1","title":"This phone is not good for a Motorola","review":"I really dislike this phone!! We bought it becasue it was a Motorola and figured that would assure us a higher quality - wrong!! It cuts out a lot of the time, the caller ID function has a lot of quirks compared to other phones I have used. The phone also sounds \\"tinny\\" a lot of the time. Everyone who comes over and uses it, comments on its bad sound quality. I would NOT recomend. WE are currently searching for a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"This is the fourth cordless phone I've tried since the one I had died. This was the best of the four but still is not a winner. The really only good part is the rubber grip on the side of the handset so its easy to hold on to. The voice fades while your talking to someone and its hard to find just the right spot to put your ear so you can hear well."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreliable","review":"I bought this phone because I wanted one that had a ringer off switch. It also has one of the best rings of any phone I have owned. However, an important component of this phone is the answering machine and it is very unreliable. It will inexplicably replay deleted messages as new ones. This is a very puzzling problem and one that is serious, especially if you are a job seeker or are awaiting important news. If you don't care about the answering machine then it is an okay phone, otherwise skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad day for Motorola Fans","review":"I too like other reviews purchased this phone because of the Motorola brandname. One thing I found immediately is that it had the same menu system as the G.E. phone (since I hated the G.E. too sounds like Motorola contracted out instead of building it in-house) that this replaced-a menu system not known for features. Let me start with the answering machine-the sensitivity is poor so sometimes you will get half way through leaving a message and it disconnects on you. It doesn't have battery back up so if your power goes out or you unplug the unit, say bye bye to the clock settings.The handset it fine with a comfortable grip but the screen poor and the audio quality is poor-I constantly have to keep asking my wife to 'speak up' because the microphone is poor and the audio just isn't loud enough so we find ourselves putting our ears stuck to the phone.The price is NOT worth the hassle this phone has caused us and highly suggest buying a corded phone over this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad but there is better","review":"At the time of purchase (nearly a year ago), it seemed like the prudent choice. The hand set feels balanced and well shaped and the grippable sides are a big plus. A major caveat is that there is no toll-saver feature for the answering machine. Nor fast forward or rewind. You can only skip or repeat the entire message. As for the headset, there is a volume control, but the other party hears a break in the signal as the volume is being switched. A not-so-minor thing on a business call. Also the switch to turn off the ringer is difficult to work. It seems jammed on the case or something. I've had the phone for almost a year and just recently the head-set jack has failed (I tried a couple of different head-sets). Over-all a less than satisfactory experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This is the second one I have had. The first one didn't last 2 months. This one and it won't dial the numbers right. The keyboard back light is gone. And the caller id was always hard to read. But there are some nice features. I have Parkinson's and the grips on the sides make it easy to grip. I have never had a problem with static. One problem is kind of unique.......when I am working in the basement with my iTunes on and a get a call it shuts off my iTunes.........at least I know that I have a call coming in and i don't have to run to the computer to turn the sound down. If these pnones wouldn't break they are just what I like because I don't need a lot of features."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish there was a \\"0 Star\\" option","review":"This is the worst phone ever!

My spouse has a broken ankle so main reason I ordered this model was for remote answer function and wall mount capability. Remote answer works fine but the package did not include wall mount.

I would not recommend this phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cordless Phone","review":"I originally bought this phone as a gift for a friend and fell in love with it -- so I bought one for myself too! It's a great value for the money (mine was less than half of the first one I bought). If you live in a 10-digit-dialing area (you have to dial the area code before the number) you won't be able to dial from the caller ID feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"handset is junk","review":"The predecessor to this model (MA350) has what appears to be the same handset. We had the phone for a little over a year (just beyond warranty) and the buttons started malfunctioning -- which is maddening! I thought Motorola would be a good quality brand, but now I must add it to the list of companies whom I don't buy phones from: Panasonic, Motorola."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound on the answering machine","review":"We bought this phone less than a year ago. The phone itself is ok, it picks up some interference from our wireless network but it's ok for a 2.4 GHz. The answering machine didn't have the clearest sound quality when we bought it but the messages left were understandable so we kept the system. Now, less than a year later the sound quality when playing back messages has degraded to the point that you can not understand the messages at all. I thought it might be the speaker phone but ruled that out since the sound quality is perfect when checking the date and time. It's a digital recorder so I'm not sure what would be causing the poor quality on playback but guess that it must have something to do with the recording device. Final analysis, you can get better quality for your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T JUDGE A PHONE BY ITS BRANDNAME","review":"I brought this phone because I had someone who gave it the highest praise. After using this phone I am not sure if this person was just crazy or maybe they just don't know any better. There are only 2 ringer settings on the phone and that is low &amp; lower! Sometimes the phone just cuts off mid-conversation and I dare not go out in front of my house. I can not walk around without the phone giving me serious static and to change the channel is USELESS. The best feature on the phone is the answering machine. Don't be fooled this phone is NOT WORTH IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All the right features","review":"This phone had all the right features that I was needing in a cordless phone with a digital answering machine. The sound clarity was clear and the volume on the handset is excellent. The backlit LCD display is handy when you have a call while you are asleep at night so as you can see who is calling you if you have caller ID service. I even tested this phone by turning on the microwave and standing right beside it while talking and there was no interference. I highly recommend this phone for it's quality and reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Be Better","review":"Being given the ability to access the answering machine from the handset makes this design a nice idea, and the sound quality from the handset isn't bad, but that is the extent of my praise.I do not care for the answering machine as it has very limited features; no fast forward, rewind, etc. The quality of sound is very poor, and most of my messages are not clear enough to be understood.The worst problem I've had is the phone's battery \\"dies\\" all too often! I've had the phone in the base for 48 hours, and after a 5 minute phone call it will give a low battery warning, and soon die out.I've not been satisfied with this phone, and after two months of use am looking for a replacement. Save your money and look for something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"POS","review":"this phone looks cool, I'll give it that. I also like the rubber siding which gives it a great feel in your hand.BUT the sound is not good. It is kinda soft when listening to the other person, and it really amplifies your own voice (and ambient noise) and pipes it to your ear which is annoying. And this phone, like some others, for some crazy reason, gives out a loud beep (heard by you and the other person) whenever you switch the volume during a call. WHY????? Then the other person says 'what the hell was that?' and you have to explain. But that is a small detail, basically the sound is bad and therefore I am returning it without even trying the answering machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great phone except...","review":"I like the phone for everything it offers. Ease of use, great reception, etc. However, there is a problem that I can't stand. The quality of the answering machine is horrible. To record an outgoing message, I have to speak loudly right into the base otherwise it is very difficult to hear the message. And the incoming messages are very difficult to understand. I've had many hard times trying to decipher the phone numbers left by callers. And in order to review the message, it has to be replayed in its entirety; so I spend a lot of time having to replay the messages over and over again in order to understand what's being said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Given another chance I would not buy this phone","review":"The problems:You cannot retrieve messages away from home -- although the specs read you can.After one year the battery is dying.

We live in an area of high density housing and we were forever having problems with crosstalk from our neighbors and couldn't find a clear channel.This phone solved all those problems, we can get clear channels, it's easy to setup and use. I can listen to my answering machine messages and change options from the handset, and with a volume control on the handset I can adjust the phone so I can hear whomever I'm talking to.The only complaint I can find with it, is that the center talk button is big enough for my 1 year old to shut off the phone if I'm not looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of...","review":"What a piece of junk.

How hard is it to make a phone that dials out?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this phone!","review":"I am on my second phone, the first was returned to Motorola. Both phones exhibit the same problem, extremely poor reception (severe static begins only 20 feet from the base unit). Also, I cannot consistently retrieve messages from a remote phone, even though the unit is designed to permit remote message listening. Motorola would not provide a refund after the second phone performed the same as the first phone. I did not want to waste any more money on shipping the phone to Motorola so I pitched the second replacement model in the trash! I strongly recommend avoiding this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst phone out there!","review":"This phone does not even deserve one star. The answering machine will sometimes play one of my messages that a friend or family member left as my \\"hello I am not here\\" message!

Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Mom","review":"I bought this phone for my mom when her VTech died. She likes a phone that has balance. This phone is well balanced and has user friendly features. She didn't need the answering part and we were able to shut it off. After a couple days I called her to see how it was working. She absolutely loves it. She said she hasn't noticed any of the noise problems I had told her other people wrote about.

I will stick w/ Panasonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good phone...","review":"First of all, I couldn't even hear mine ringing. I set it up, called it from my cell, and could barely hear either the ring on the base unit or the handset.My hearing is just fine, but the ring on this model is pathetically quiet. If you aren't physically in the same room with the phone, good luck hearing the little electronic bleeps that signal an incoming call.Also, no matter what channel I set it on, mine had some static or &quot;white noise&quot; coming through the handset during a conversation. Not crystal clear, like you would expect from a 2.4 gig phone.Finally, the handset isn't very big, and feels awkward in your hand. I got mine as a gift, and after a few days, exchanged it.There are other phones in the price range, this one isn't a winner.

Still, the 480p output via composite produced an excellent picture, but unfortunately the player would freeze and skip from time to time, even on brand new DVDs, so I had to return it. After doing some research on the internet, I found that others have also experienced freezing and skipping problems with Samsung DVD players, so rather than exchanging it for another Samsung that might do the same thing, I got a Sony instead--so far it plays smoothly and flawlessly, with an equally excellent picture. Sound quality on the Samsung was excellent. The remote was rather complicated and not really very responsive."},{"rating":"2","title":"What do you expect it to do?","review":"This is a DVD player, and while some may have let you turn off the power and then resume where you left off, or skipping through the FBI warnings really has nothing to do with the quality or performance of the player. All these negative reviews because of a missing feature are unfair to the product. You want more bells and whistles go buy them. If you want an excellent picture at a great price, get this player. It is a matter of priorities and the rating of the product should be hurt because you put more weight on a menu feature than on the picture. We buy DVD's and HD t.v. because we like the picture.

I couldn't believe it when I found out that it didn't do multi-channel out in surround sound. So, you can only listen to DVD-Audio and Super Audio CD's in stereo, which is just a waste, in my opinion. What's just as confusing is that the unit actually has the analog output for surround. Why it has it when it doesn't use it is beyond me. As far as picture goes, it's great. But when you're looking for a player to play high-end audio at a low price, you're better off with going with the Pioneer DV-578A.

For those that don't know, the DVI connection mangles dark blacks into a single color, rendering darker scenes nearly impossible to distinguish. I viewed the Return of the King when Frodo was in Shelob's lair and nothing was discernible. Even in Shrek 2, a colorful movie, the backgrounds were so dark that all you could see at some points was the characters themselves. Both movies were viewd on a Sony 42\\" lcd projection tv. The component outputs work fine, but you might as well by a regular progressive scan if you intend to use those. Basically, for what this player is intended to do, it fails. For a much better unit, for a cheaper price, try the Toshiba SD-5970. It upconverts through HDMI, but I bought a HDMI-DVI converter for $30, it works great, and it's still cheaper than the Samsung 841.

The extended warranty is probably not on both a credit and a debit card. It depends on the contract your bank has made. There are different sets of benefits. In general, it seems the debit cards have this, but not credit cards, so be sure to pay with the correct one.In the case of Master Card at least, it is very difficult to tell because the benefits brochures do not distinguish between credit and debit cards. Check with your bank. Even then, the person you get on the phone may not know what you're talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"warranty problem","review":"when i purchased this plan it was for a tv between $1000 and 1499.99.new contract claims that my purchase had to be under $1000 so they will NOT honor it. this means i do not have an extended warranty.i either want this warranty for the price that was agreed upon or a full refund.i'm happy i found out about this problem before i needed the warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"This book is amazing!

Taking the Wheel is a great recording as well, but I much prefer the other CD. David's voice is, as usual, amazing, but there is just something lacking in the choice of songs. While some tracks are particularly memorable (the title song is my favorites), others seem to just be there. It is a wonderful CD overall though - I would recommend it, but if you're familiar with Yesterday is Now, be prepared for a little disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grateful for the pleasure","review":"David Campbell is one of the best talents Australia has unleashed on the world. Those of us lucky enough to have seen him act in his early career knew there was an exceptional talent in the making--when we heard him sing--WOW! \\"Taking the wheel\\" is a much more contemporary CD than the first, the addition of pure adult pop like Don Walker's \\"It will always be you\\" has added an extra bow to this remarkable singer's repetoire(any one has seen him live recently will know a bit of rock is now thrown in as well)and his versions of \\"yard sale\\" and \\"bridge over troubled water\\" are outstanding. If only the full story to \\"Grateful\\" could be included on the album notes, as its also a wonderful song & story. When one remembers that this guy is only in his mid-twenties, all we can say is that he will be with us for a long time, and hope that he won't be lost to Australia completely.

Campbell's got a thin, reedy voice, and his interpretations are rather run-of-the-mill. All I get is a kid who can't decide whether he wants to be a pop-rock star or a classic crooner.

My idea may be good, but this map is terrible. At best, it shows Central Austin, but calling it an Austin map is wrong. If you know anything about Austin, consider this: It shows nothing north of 45th street and Camp Mabry. On the east side it stops around Pleasant Valley and Berkman. Going south, it stops at Zilker Park. (Almost nothing south of the river is shown.) Going west, it does show Rollingwood and Westlake Hills. The downtown detail map on the back is o.k., but it's already out of date. The \\"Area Map\\" on the back only goes to Pflugerville (north), Decker Lake but not Manor (east), the airport (south), and Sunset Valley (west). Don't buy this map!

Divided into categories are many letters which on occasion appall but always hold our interest as we read the answers Mr. Cohen has written. There is much fodder for discussion here as of course the reader will not always agree with the author.

After all, it was on sale. I didn't care what it looked like.Cute appearance aside, this is a terrific little phone. The sound quality is excellent, with a volume control switch. The ring tones are too much fun and, it just looks fun! I also love the very compact size, including the base. It will fit in small places. There has never been static of any kind and I've never had to change the channel. Clear, crisp reception.The only TINY drawback is that if you hold the phone between your cheek and shoulder, you may disconnect your caller. Other than that, a great little phone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Design","review":"Let me first say, I love the look and idea behind this phone...I am a big Disney addict, BUT whoever designed this phone should be fired!

If you even press the phone into your ear too hard while holding on to it, it will hang up! And, the caller id feature is horrible also. It constantly misses calls. I do not use this phone anymore!

I even take it to the neighbors house with me. The phone has really good volume too, and you can adjust the volume easily while on the phone. The caller ID works really good and quick. Its a very cute phone, and every one loves the ringtones.The only bad thing though, is that the Talk button is right by your cheek and it shuts off if you lean on it. This happens to my husband and 8 yr old all the time. Luckily, you can turn it right back on and the people are still there (as long as they didnt hang up).I recommend this phone (especially if you like Disney)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the thought behind it, but bad design!!","review":"This phone is cute and I loved the ringer sounds and the thought behind the design, but the people who designed this obviously never really tested it. You can not do ANYTHING while you are on this phone...you hang up on people constantly. I am a very busy mother of 3 and it is soooo embrassing to have to call people back and apologize for hanging up on them. I do not have a time where my hands can just sit and hold a phone to my ear. I am constantly resting the phone between my shoulder and ear, this phone is not made properly to allow you to do that. I highly recommend against purchasing this phone!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most poorly designed phone I've ever seen","review":"Whoever designed this phone obviously never talked on one. The hang up button is squarely in the middle of the receiver. If you rest the phone on your shoulder to write something down or do ANYTHING, the phone hangs up. And forget about having the kids talk on it! As soon as they put it to their ear, it hangs up! The joy you might get from hearing the pager is immediately erased by the fact that the phone is truly unusable unless you very carefully hold it and do NOTHING else when you talk on the phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phones don't last long","review":"My family has owned two of these phones now. The first one simply stopped working - the handset would turn on, but was unable to make a signal connection with the base.The second one worked for much longer (nearly a year) before the Talk button on the handset started to require obscene amounts of pressure to turn the phone on.

The format of this book is similar to the \\"48 laws of power\\", except not as elaborate, and its examples not as detailed. I agree with other reviewers that some of the examples are a stretch.

This group of techniques derive from ancient military experience but can be applied to levels of human interaction including disputes,conflicts, court cases, business development and competition, and general interpersonal relations. While Sun Tzu did not compile these, he often has the most cogent rendering of a technique in his Art of War. This book applies the strategems to business - marketing, competition, etc. That is its strength. One annoying weakness is that the 36 Strategies are not presented in their customary order. This makes this book less easy to interface with other books on the strategems. Still, its a useful book, bringing business world knowledge into contact with this remarkable assembly strategies."},{"rating":"1","title":"dragon Tee","review":"The design is completely kick ass and I liked it, so did my boyfriend..

I was never so disappointed in a Wagner record in all my life.

All in all the project struck me as Decca's figuring \\"Wagner Ring excerpts + Vienna Philharmonic + Solti = instant $$$\\" The recorded sound may be state-of-the-art, but as music making, it is seriously lacking heart.

It took them over a week to replace it and they did not expedite the order although I'm suppose to get 2nd day air through amazon at no charge. Overall experience with this vendor was poor. Think twice before getting this particular product...think even longer if your purchasing from this vendor. Poor customer service skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best in IDM","review":"I can't believe this guy doesn't receive the accolades he deserves. His music is so inspiring.. beautiful. Let's just say that Aphex Twin (Richard D. James) was the pioneer, and Clark is the perfectionist.Any true fan of IDM will absolutely fall in love with his work (post Clarence Park). I'm not Saying Clarence Park is bad, because it's not. When I first heard CP, I thought it was a cute little album, but didn't really expect too much from Chris going forward.. then I heard \\"Empty The Bones Of You\\", which completely obliterated my soul.Boddy Riddle is a really nice follow-up album to ETBOY, however it doesn't quite measure up in my opinion. It doesn't flow like the former album does. That's really unfair, however, because I believe ETBOY is true perfection.All I can say is that I hope Chris either never retires, or is cloned in his sleep. If he stops making music, I fear I will become deaf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid album","review":"Clark Body Riddle isn't much different from what AFX was already doing 8-10 years ago, but that's not a bad thing. I like most of the songs on this album. Some decent, thicker hip-hop beats mixed into various songs. You can't go wrong with most of the stuff put out by WARP."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best electronica","review":"Warp Records continues to set the pace, obliterating the bar, and Clark is beyond the best-of-the-best. There are no comparisons to the pantheon of electronica greats: Clark surpasses them all with this brilliant album.Yes. Music is supposed to be this superlative."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back!","review":"I started reading this and had to stop. By page three there was already a place where a phone call starts, but there are no indicators.Then this 'backroom' line is ridiculous. This woman is a supervisor, and she allows a conversation about sex with a chicken go on? You have to be kidding me.I was annoyed from the start. This was sold to me as literary fiction and it was garbage. If I have a chance, I will burn this book and dance around it's ashes. If I believed in banning book, this one should be banned because it's horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate Jerrica","review":"This book really caused me hunger pains. i mean I could'nt feed myself cause i was so wrapped up into the \\"what's gonna happen to these hood queens next!

Hope theres a sequel cause my my my these folk sound like real characters i wonder if there is anything these backstabbing muts won't discuss. Probably disturb the dead with this gossiping and lying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Astounding First Novel","review":"You don't expect a first novel to have the intense depth of characterization that you find here. It's difficult to imagine that a character of Howard Kapostash's complexity springs to the page as complete as it does here. And that of his high school girlfriend Sylvia equally scarred. The story seems almost perfect for a movie: the damaged Viet Vet, Sylvia who all but dumps her nine year old son Ryan on Howard when she goes into drug rehab.It would have been easy for such characters to get trapped in so much sugar water that they could never get out. But that doesn't happen. In the hands of Mr. King the characters become human, they become people we want to know, they are certainly people we don't want to lose at the end of the book.Highly recommended. This may be Mr. King's first novel, but it certainly won't be his last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone Should Read This!","review":"Although the author says the characters are fictitous, I feel that having an autistic brother influenced his characterizations. Movie rights have been picked up. I can hardly wait. High school students should read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice first novel","review":"I thought this was a unique story of finding one's life in spite of hardship.Howard is likeable and a bit scary at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone is given second chances","review":"Howard Kapostash has been suffering a war injury, in which he can no longer speak and can barely read, ever since the Vietnam War. His own home is taken care of by Laurel, a Vietnamese woman from Texas, and his only job worth doing is being a lawn mower for a convent. Then, his ex-girlfriend comes along and asks if he can take care of her nine-year old son, Ryan, so she can get through her drug rehabilitation. What follows now is a heartwarming (but not too sentimental) story of family, friendship, love, and seeing a fresh light rather than an outdated one.These characters are three-dimensional: there doesn't seem to be one single villain, except maybe Raymond. Even the minor characters are unforgettable. Tension is high when things go horribly wrong in the third act, and that's a good thing to feel if you dislike bland novels.This is an extraordinary debut from Dave King, and I hope he writes more novels so I can read them without any distraction whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching, Raw & Emotional","review":"What is so touching about this book is revealed in the power of quiet observation. Taking your protagonist and rendering him mute as well as unable to write leaves him with one of the most in depth and incredible inner monologues I thinkI've ever read.Howard Kapostash has found a way to quietly communicate after a war head wound leaves him unable to speak or write. His old flame Sylvia is forced to enter drug rahab and asks Howard if while she's gone he will care for her nine year old mixed race son. The boy comes to live with Howard and his theree boarders: A Vietnemese caterer, and two younger guys who are house painters. The genius of the book is how Howard manages to convey the myriad of emotions he goes through, as this surrogate family is created and slowly begins to heal a number of physical and emotional bruises. It is real, unapologetic and honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three cheers for Howie and friends!","review":"Whenever I finish a first novel that I really like, I want all of my friends to read it. I also secretly wish it were my first novel. This one deals with all the themes and obsessions dear to my heart and frustrating to my sense of moral justice: single parenting, addiction, and the challenges of living as a war veteran. I believe the rhythm of this book is perfect. The attention to the day-to-day details is stunning. More than once I was reminded that parenting is also in the details, and that friendship is often the sum of shared moments. Finally, in a world that is too often exploitive, cynical and pessimistic, I want to believe that all of us can overcome our apparent diabilities and shortcomings so that our lives represent the triumph of hope and love. Three cheers for Howie and friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ha Ha by Dave King","review":"Great Book--for once I was unable to figure out how the story would end--and it was very well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ha Ha .....am I funny? Do I amuse you?","review":"Yes, No, Maybe so! Exceptionally appealing on levels both evident and unfathomable. Memorable without being pithy, yet enduring and also fully encompassing of human emotions held dear to all and by all. Oh my what a lovely book, explanations are unalterably insufficient to describe the love and depth of character, the mesmerizing plot, the shocking and elegant ending. It's like drinking in an amazing melodramatic enticement....am I drunk yet? No....are you? Ha Ha!! Read this one, I think you'll agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exposition Overload","review":"This book never grabbed a hold of me. It's premise is a good one, but the writing style of exposition only bogged me down and forced me to skim a lot in the middle. I didn't miss a thing.I think this book suffers from trying too hard to be meaningful, and so instead of being meaningful and engaging, it just grinds. This would have been a much much better book if we were shown the interesting beginning part of Howard's recovery, instead of only recieving hints and glimpses from where he now stands, embittered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romanza","review":"THE TITLE SAYS IT ALL, A WONDERFUL ROMANTIC ALBUM AND A GREAT CHANGE OF PACE FROM MOST OF TODAYS MUSIC, I LISTEN TO IT DAILY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bias I Confess","review":"I confess to loving Italian music and opera in addition to Rock & Roll, Country and music in general.This music is good when you want to relax or have a lady over 40 you want to entertain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing magical music","review":"This is my first Andrea Bocelli, but not my last...his music fills my soul. It is soothing but challenging. I like that the lyrics are written in both Italian and English. The power and passion in his music is fantastic. My favorites are Vivere and Vivo Per Lei. I can listen at work as well at home. Perfect for my hectic life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Bliss","review":"The first time I heard Andrea Bocelli. I nearly fell out of my chair. There's nothing like his voice. When I listen to this album/cd I put it on continuous play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Start & End - Bad Middle","review":"The first and last songs are incredibly beautiful and moving and nearly worth the price. However, the euro-pop fluff in between is very difficult to listen to. He has such an incredible voice and it is completely wasted on these selections. Bocelli's \\"Sacred Arias\\" is a much better buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and Poorly Recorded","review":"If you're the type of person who likes to watch movies while having a cheesecloth draped over your face, then you'll love this CD. On the majority of the tracks, both Bocelli and the background music sound horribly muffled. The music seems like it was recorded with synthesizers even though the credits purport that actual instruments were used. Track 15 featuring Sarah Brightman and Bocelli is the only decently recorded song that has CD quality sound. No, it's not as bad as a 1 star CD, but someone needs to drag the ratings down to a realistic level."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOCKED","review":"I am shocked. I read all these negative reviews before I listened to some songs on the cd. I could not believe what they had to say. I mean how could they disparage an album which has been a phenomenal seller? Well, after listening to some of the other songs on the CD, you'll understand their comments and mine too. \\"Con te partiro\\" is beautiful. It's a 10 on a scale of 1-10. But that's it folks. Listen to the other songs. They are so manufactured, so thin. They are noisy! They are jumbled. They are awful!!!!!!! If you think it's worth it to get this cd because of that song, then get it. But if you want a complete album which is even mostly attractive, stay away from this one. Is it a one star? Well, probably not, but like some other reviewer said, \\"someone needs to bring the ratings down\\" on this one. It's probably about a 2 star. VERY DISAPPOINTING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush and romantic","review":"Try not to be intimidated or put off by the legions of fans claiming Bocelli is the voice of God, or some such nonsense. He is, though, an impressive singer with a marvellous range. \\"Con te partiro\\", \\"Caruso\\", \\"Romanza\\"; this album has many great songs that feel like classical opera in their passionate intensity yet are performed in the bounds and with the musical instruments of the \\"pop\\" genre. It is not nearly as good as \\"The Opera Album\\", but \\"Romanza\\" is still a worthy addition to any musical library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Music","review":"I started to get interested in Bocelli, Giorgia, the Coors, The Chieftains, etc. while listening to the \\"Pavarotti and Friends\\" series of concerts and albums. Bocelli shines in this album. I originally got it for my Mom, but I have listened to it recently. I can't understand the words, but his emotion and range of voice - it brings tears to my eyes. I love his duet with Giorgia (she is something else by the way, get her CD) and his rendition of Caruso. I now plan to buy Sogno and his other albums. I have acquired a lot of new music recently which lies unopened - I listen to Romanza!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Andrea Bocelli is magnificent!! He's the best!!!","review":"I would definitely recommend his music to anyone who thinks classical music is boring!! I just saw his Tuscany concert on T.V. last night and was moved to tears.

Definitely the best! Bocelli delivers not only the voice but the moving force behind its captivating melodic notes. A MUST HAVE CD!!! Worth every penny the price you pay for it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Man and This Album Are So...REMARKABLE!","review":"The power...the passion...the emotion...the seductive authencity...the musical gifts which God bestowed upon him...when I listened to this album, I became so haunted by the intensity of Andrea Bocelli's sexy voice. He is so hermoso, too, he gives me a heart attack! Sorry, but to actually \\"feel\\" the true vibrations of music, no matter what type, appears to be a challenge within itself. With this album, I have felt just that. I can rave nonstop about Andrea's sexy voice. This is the first and best of his albums I bought so far, and my mother loves him as well. To hell with the critics who think he doesn't know how to sing! God put him on this planet for a reason, so let's give him a chance for once in his life! My suggestion for those who want a \\"real\\" voice: This is IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, folks: Bocelli is only a lightweight.","review":"I WANTED to like this album, really I did. The problem is that Bocelli simply doesn't have the depth-of-voice that other popular singers (like Domingo, Carreras & Pavarotti) have. If you're looking for soft background music to dinner, this CD is okay. If you're interested in serious musicianship, stick with REAL voices."},{"rating":"2","title":"amatuer reveiw","review":"this is probably the greatest recording i have by andrea bocelli and i have all of his recordings sold publicly. i am not a clssical music person though i do like some, but he crosses over between pop and classical i get chills at some of his songs and comfort from most of them. he has a beautiful voice , a gift and i am glad he has shared it with others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appropriately Titled","review":"Yes, of course this is an extremely romantic CD. It's kind 3 male/female duets (Sarah B. and others); one male/male duet (Zucherro); and the rest is all Andrea. Slow, soaring, relaxing, not in a hurry kind of music. In my opinion, this was his signature depature into this new classical/pop genere. The translations are included to English (which is wonderful). The CD is entirely Italian. His voice is phenomanal. There is also a songbook that goes with this CD, by the way, for the singers and pianists out there. This CD is heavy, not light nor for the unromantic hearted. If you are new to Andrea, it may not seem romantic at first, but continue listening, as I find those of us in the states who are new to this genre may need a little bit of adapting to the music, much like learning to appreicate fine wine. AH--Romanza and wine! I'm off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Goosebumps...","review":"Every time... and I have heard it many times... but he always gives me goosebumps. In Miserere his voice absolutely SOARS... I bought this CD because I saw he and Sarah Brightman perform Con Te Partiro on a video at the mall... my jaw hung for the duration of the song and I knew I had to hear more from him... the other songs do not disappoint. Though some may say he lacks technical ability he more than makes up for it with sheer BEAUTY. This CD is simply phenomenal."},{"rating":"2","title":"No, no, no!","review":"No, no, no! This is not opera! This is pop, but it is quite good pop music all the same. And it is certainly much more accessible than traditional tenor arias. But please, don't try to state that Bocelli exists on a higher artistic plain than Pavarotti or Domingo. You might like this CD better than theirs, but that is perfectly understandable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most beautiful music in the world","review":"Romanza contains music pleasing to everyone, young and old. Just listening to it when I get home from work erases any stress from the day. It's very soothing. I've got hundreds of CD's, but this is by far my favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I am very moved by Andrea's voice..I loved every cut on Romanza..bought his arias also..am looking for his sacred music cd..I want more, more, more..I am generally one solid goose bump when listening to him..God Bless You Mr. Boccelli..Long life to you!!!!Thank you, Thank you....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has 3 good songs!","review":"I liked 3 songs on this CD!No.1, Por Ti Volare (Con Te Partiro)No.8, Vivo Per Ella (Per Lei)No.14, MiserereNo.15, Time to Say Goodbye (Con Te Partiro)No.1 & 15 are pretty much the same song ..

I feel excited! After being overwhelmed by \\"Sogno\\"...I dreamt of everything Italian and decided to buy this earlier release by the sensitively powerful Andrea Bocelli. On \\"Romanza\\" we are again treated to non-traditonal, yet, exquisite operatic music. Melodies and lyrics of the sort that make ones heart soar. Even people who do not like opera, like Bocelli.The first thing I did after bringing this treasure home, was fill the tub with steamy water and bubbles, light some candles, poured a large glass of crisp white wine and indulged in an afternoon of utter decadence.Mesmerizing mixtures of Italian, French, and Spanish influences within these tracks had me in a fantasyland of adornment. I found the duets delightful....but when the water turned as cold as the wine, it was, well, \\"Time To Say Good-Bye\\".A suberb CD in every way. Listen and become enchanted.*Grazi* for your interest & comments--CDS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"Andrea Bocelli's voice is quite an enigma. He keeps the equipoise between his operatic yet pop voice in such a subtle manner it is almost worthy of a whole new genre of its own.Con te Partiro is the perfect example of this. The emotion in the song is so solid you could cut it with a knife. People say he has a thin voice and could not sing over an orchestra. I disagree. HE could easily sing over the loudest orchestra without any amplification. But less is more, and that is what he does. He draws you in, with his ability to sing high notes pianissimo as well as forte, the former the greater feat.Great album.Absolute magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Es Simplemente Unico","review":"El haber escuchado este CD, me hiso comprender el sentimiento y la pasion de Andrea Bocelli. Me ha hecho entender lo que la musica de opera significa. Me llena de sentimiento y cada vez que lo escucho me apasiona mas y mas.

Bought it immediately and love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointment","review":"I am absolutely, madly in love with this guy's talent and voice! However, this is the worst CD I have in my possession. I will probably not even carry it around in my car much less ever listen to it again. More than dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh! Please!","review":"The worst recording I have ever listen to. The only two pieces worth listening are the first and the last songs. And they are the same song. There is a song with very good recording, and it's the last one. But that is a song from Sarah Brightman's recording. I think that tells a lot about this CD. I have no idea why people think Andrea Bocelli is that great. If I like ConTe Partiro, it's because the composer did a good job, not the singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please...","review":"Please listen to the other tenors. It is the hype that drove people to Andrea Bocelli and that is it. Go listen to a recording of Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti, Jose Cura etc and hear how real tenor and PROPER singing can do for you; if even Andrea Bocelli can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the real thing","review":"While this is a pleasant enough album of easy listening, Bocelli's voice is actually small and the tone can be a bit dry. He's definitely not a true operatic tenor and presumably needs to rely on studio technology in order to sing some of the songs convincingly. While he does possess some vocal technique, it's still far from satisfactory and he can only be regarded as a recording phenomenan rather than a genuine performer of distinction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real disappointment!","review":"I agree completely with the review from \\"Seattle music fan.\\" Just not up to speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"there is more legato in a snare drum than in this voice","review":"I am a singer studying opera, so I buy about every CD I can get my hands on to study, and to listen to.

I found it very disappointing. The scores were not blended well and were WAY too synthesized and electric. When Bocelli's voice is good it is very good, but too much of the music on this CD does not capitalize on his voice - the music is almost \\"pop\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"So soothing, I swooned!","review":"My mother had gotten the CD with Italian/Spanish selections and when I returned to college this fall, I was on a quest to find this particular CD at all, anywhere. I must say that not only is it wonderful music to study to, but that Bochelli's voice is so powerful, so tender, so moving that I nearly collapse from the sheer beauty. My roommates heard me talk about him and did not believe me, but since I've played this CD for them, they won't let me remove it from the stereo. I recommend this CD to anyone. Everyone should have such an exprience."},{"rating":"2","title":"It moved me to tears.","review":"After listening to the first song on Andrea Bocelli's Romanza, I was moved to tears. It took me about two seconds of the introduction to get hooked. I ordered the CD a few days later, and after recieving it, I can say, honestly, that I listened to that song 3 times, crying by the third time. The song is perfection and is pure emotion. Con Te Partiro is moving, touching and truthfully, it moved me to tears. If this song is any indication of the rest of the album, then I consider myself lucky to have it.Don't write me off as a fan, because, trust me, I was never into opera music (if this could be defined as such) but I was truly floored by the sincerity and sweetness coupled with the power and pure perfection in his voice. Andrea Bocelli is the epitome of musical talent and also my delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"This man has been given a magnificent gift...","review":"...and I'm glad he is sharing it. Having no musical ability of my own I can really appreciate the talents of others. This man has a voice that reaches down into your soul. My mother gave me this CD as a gift recently. She wanted me to enjoy it as much as she does. Everytime she listens to Andrea, she ends up melting all over the floor. This will certainly get many people introduced to the world of opera, the way Rosie O'Donnell got people interested in Broadway. I consider this CD to be more of Italian love songs than opera, but the love of opera does sneak up on me! This is a CD you can really give yourself up to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bocelli is magnificent!","review":"I first remember hearing the magnificent Italian music at the Bellagio Resort in Las Vegas. They have a beautiful water show there accompanied by music. I recently went to the Phoenix library in search of some Italian music that I thought might be from the Bellagio. One of the CD's was Andrea Bocelli's. It was beautiful. Then, on July 6th, I watched the American Dream: Andrea Bocelli's Statue of Liberty Concert on PBS. His singing just blew me away. His duet Con Te Partiro with Sarah Brightman was trememendous. It moved me to tears. I just kept replaying the piece on my VCR. He also dedicated and performed his song Sogno (on his new CD) to his father who just recently passed away. It was truly touching. Buy this CD, and you will love it. And watch for a re-broadcast of the PBS concert! What is even more touching is the fact that Andrea Bocelli lost his sight at a very young age. What he has done with his gift is just so inspiring to the rest of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romancing the listeners","review":"What a voice, it soars with the arias and bops with the more contemporary.

Turn this one up with the top down and let it sing you home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-Hyped and Poor in Quality","review":"Sorry music fans, but this doesn't cut it. The sound is weird and Andrea's voice is overrated. It may sound nice at first but then it gets raspy and sore-sounding, like Andrea had throat infection. At first I liked \\" Time To Say Goodbuy\\" but then I found it to be over produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"wants this craze to end...","review":"Although it's hard to criticize a blind man, I'll do it anyway. If I have to hear this song just one more time, I swear I will stab a long screwdriver into my ears until they bleed and are unable to function. Sure, it's a beautiful song, but the rest of the album is junk. So he's an italian opera one-hit-wonder. Enough already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudo-Pavarotti For The Tone-Deaf","review":"In all honesty and without trying to be funny, this is one of the worst albums I have ever heard. While some of the material isn't bad, the singer has serious intonation problems. Being a musician with perfect pitch, listening to this guy is torture! Every other note he sings is out of tune, and the feeling and interpretation he puts forth doesn't remotely make up for his vocal inadequasies. But if you have no ear for music and mediocre musical taste, then this CD is for You! As for myself I'm asking for a refund!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Absolute Mess!","review":"I can't stand that album. My sister makes me listen to it everyday.

I think one of Bocelli's best. The only caution I would give someone, is I bought a used copy that was supposed to be in very good condition and to say the least it was not.

I saw him on a TV special with Celine Dion. When I heard him sing, my heart pounded. His voice is so pure, yet at the same time sexy.

I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfull must have","review":"I just happened upon Andrea one evening flipping through the channels on my Tv. It was a concert he gave with Sarah Brightman. He blew me away with Con Te Partiro. I went and bought Romanza the next day. I think he has a lot of talent and he is only going to get better with time.I have just started collecting his CDs.

The flashbacks are deftly handled and never confusing, which shows clever use of craft. That said, the book could use more scenes and less summary throughout. There were places where the prose got just a touch melodramatic, but it stayed mostly grounded.

I just can't get enough of her books. My mother-in-law and I have read 5 different books that she has written and her sermons give us much to think about, especially what a wonderful God and Savior we have. I also check out the Scriptures and while she may say something occasionally that I do not agree with, I would say that most of the time I have been drawn to think more about God and what the Scriptures are saying. She brings out the story and that is what I end up meditating on....the stories fill my mind and draw me closer to Him. I highly recommend her. I usually read one sermon a day and then the passage from Scriptures. It becomes much more meaningful to me because it connects me directly to the word of God and not just a person's words or viewpoint. I like to check it out for myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Single Parent Families, too....","review":"This book is great for single parent families, too. It reinforces my belief that life can be happy and full of adventure and love even if there is only one parent in a child's life.

This book was more like a Danielle Steel fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense (in a good way)...","review":"At times and take \\"a breather\\" because you will find yourself blown away by the intensity of the story. Kalogridis, with this single book, makes a name for herself in the historical fiction genre. Focus on something that fascinates all of us--witches and witchtrials in history--the background is flawlessly researched. The ending is one of thos amazing bits of writing that makes you go, \\"how did the author think of THAT?\\" A joy to read, thanks to masterful use of language and images and a crisply-moving plot. You'll care about the characters, too. This is one you will read and re-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A missed opportunity","review":"I was hoping to read a historical novel on the inquisition, but it is just a vague and overambitious attempt to embrace too many subjects (battles, pestilences, monastic life, paganism, inquisition, magic etc.). The flow of the narration is continuosly interrupted by dreams and flash-backs and the \\"final surprise\\" can be guessed almost at the beginning of the book for you know from the start the real nature of certain characters. The idea was good, but this book is definitely a missed opportunity. The author seems only too eager to imitate the more mature and complex narrative by Marion Zimmer Bradley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down","review":"I was somewhat disappointed in this book. I was expecting something more informative in terms of historical reference and contemporary lives, attitudes, beliefs, etc. I found the writing increasingly simplistic and annoying and by the final few chapters was skimming rather than reading the novel, simply to get to the end. If the rituals and practices described in this book were properly researched and accurately described, fine and good, but as something that was supposed to be a picture of 14th Century France, I got no sense of that. It could've been written about any period of history. Not something I'd recommend to other readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lion has roared- Amos 3:8","review":"If you like a \\"neat and tidy\\" God, this book is not for you. Then again, neither would be the Bible. Using the Minor Prophets, Dr. Melon raises some serious questions about the role of God in 9/11. Dr. Melon very well may be a \\"voice crying in the wilderness\\" to an evangelical church that has either lost its moral compass (the liberals) or baptized the current Bush administration's global agenda (the conservatives)to the level of divine decree. I hope this first work by Dr. Melon is not his last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure pop","review":"If the Eighties are back, then the Nineties can't be far behind. Erasure, who straddled the end of the Eighties and the beginning of the Nineties, should be a logical candidate to lead a new charge into another decade's revival.The pair has a knack for crafting pop songs that revel in unabashed cliché (unlike the Pet Shop Boys). But that is not a fault. Actually, in an age of posers smitten with irony, Erasure's defiant smattering of the sweet, the melancholy, the honesty, is refreshing in the extreme. If you're looking for vintage--no, pure--Erasure, then this latest album should reconnect you deeper, by way of the superficial, to the 90s."},{"rating":"2","title":"breathing is simple but powerful","review":"a stunning single that proves awesome in the effective way that it plays on words (It's bitter without you - I can't live without you) and drives along to a steady beat. Like an audible zen koan, the words transform in your brain as the bass tones gently, but profoundly, work their magic on your neurons. One could perceive it as uni-dimensional and repetitive, but therein lies its power. The moody, haunting sounds deftly emulate the themes of addiction and love/hate components of relationships.This single, on one hand, is simple and straightforward, yet complex and riddled with delightful ambiguity. Erasure has evolved within a framework that annoys certain magazine and newspaper reviewers who cannot seem to understand that lasting electronic music coalesces the simple within the complex; and that Erasure has mastered this formula."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Remix single","review":"The Remixes on this CD are great. I really liked the album version and I bought the remix because I was hoping for a faster version. I was not disspointed. All the remixes are great, but the bonus songs are kind of lame.I think the remixes to \\"Here I go Impossible Again\\" are much better. But I was not disspointed with this CD at all. Definetely worth checking out, especially if you dig the song to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I have never felt the urge to write a review before, but this is so badly written I threw it out after struggling through about 90 pages It reads like it was written in Japanese and translated to English by a Japanese speaker.

I chatted with him and picked up a copy of Operation Poppy. The reviews on the back cover, all by military personnel, heaped praise on the book. I bought it. As I read the first 50 or so pages, I was constantly finding grammatical errors, changes in tense, lack of punctuation, and meaningless sentences. I could not concentrate on the story as these distractions soon had my whole attention. I kept reading only because I thought that somehow things would have to get better. I am now on page 164 of 261. I had to stop to see if anyone had written a review for the Internet. I found one here titled \\"unreadable\\" and I must say \\"amen.\\" It is tragic/sad that Capt.

My mother lives in another country, I have no sisters and nobody to talk to about being pregnant, giving birth or raising kids. Because of this, I was forced to go out and buy many books on the subject of motherhood. This book was not what I was looking for. The book does not cover certain topics about pregnancy or delivery in depth, I thought the book left alot of useful information out. I didn't think alot of the information was up to date and I was not impressed by any of it. Feeling desperate and not knowing what to expect, I turned to other books, which I really learned alot from. I will not recommend this book to anyone, but I will say that the following books educated me and were very useful, educational and inspirational to a new mom like me.

Wodehouse and inhabitated by the most delightful loonies in the English language is one so rarified that it cannot be re-created. Ames tries valiantly with an updated Bertie and Wooster, and he manages to echo the arch voice of the master. But his comic novel is no more than that: an echo that fails to deliver the deliciously eccentric language or the wildly unlikely people and plotting. In fact, the characters, in residence at an artists' colony in Saratoga, become bogged in very unlikely (and mainly tiresome) situations that are rectified only by running away."},{"rating":"2","title":"very funny","review":"funny and clever, sort of pg wodehouse for the 21st Century, probably ames best book, you're not sure where reality and fantasy intersect."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT!","review":"If you enjoy SMART and CREATIVE stream of conscious writing!

The plot is compact. The language is superb. The ending works. I laughed out loud a number of times and when I finished I groped around for anything else Ames had written and read that. The other stuff was good; this is his best so far. Something about his brand of humor hit me right in the funny bone. Another novel that struck me the same way was Michael Frayn's Headlong. Both are two of the best comic novels I've ever read, and I read a lot.I can't wait until Ames comes out with his next novel.

There are a few exceptions. Jim Carrey mugging, a stupid sight gag on Blue Collar TV, my reflection in the mirror when I'm trying to convince myself I still have my looks. But, I never laughed out loud when I read a book. That is, until I read \\"Wake up, Sir!\\" by Jonathan Ames. Ames' writing is warm, irreverent and a little absurd-qualities I embrace and look for in my leisure time activities. Without giving much away, the story centers around a hard drinking writer, with a man servant, living in his uncle's house in New Jersey. Many inebriated and slightly humiliating trials take the reader through this often hysterical and tender tome of a neurotic soul looking for approval and love in a hostile world. My guess is that fans of both \\"Get a Life\\"(Chris Elliot) and the Marx Brothers will have fun with this book. Hats off to Jonathan Ames and I look forwardto devouring his next brilliant offering.

Always delicious, silly, heartwrenching delights, Ames' stories take you on adventures you'd never have the guts to go on yourself, usually ending in zany disaster. Yet, he is more than an entertaining storyteller. His ability to convey the deep desire we all share to be loved, to be known, to connect with one another and to survive the often painful process of being alive is what makes him a true artist.I saved this book for a beach vacation and devoured it in two days.

Coming back to the real things I find myself looking through different eyes!If you like this type of reading, be sure to look for 'The Lighthouse Stevensons' by Bella Bathurst (HarperCollins, 1999) and 'St Peter's' by Keith Miller (Profile Books, 2007)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book before you go to Firenze!","review":"I often give a copy of this book to friends planning a trip to Italy... A quick read and a marvelous story about the intrigue...everything about renaissance Italy was an intrigue!... and history surrounding the building of the dome for il Duomo...I could almost feel Brunellschi climbing the stairs to the top dome with me...This, and \\"Michaelangelo, The Popes Ceiling\\" also by Ross King, ought to be required reading for any student of history or anyone going to Italia... they breath life into Italian history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"This book is clearly written and is a enjoyable read. While I was reading it, I was really caught up in the drama and intrigue surrounding the character Filippo. But after finishing the book I had the time to reflect back on it and judge it from the distance. Considering that this project took over a quarter of a century, a few major setbacks should naturally have been expected. Parts of this book reads like a college essay - full of excessive details, footnotes and unnecessary and boring information thrown in to increase the volume of the contents. Although I did find the parts on the building design somewhat interesting, but was kind of distracted by the enormous number of 'scandals' the author referred to. I would say it is more enjoyable as a light read rather than a academic work. Nonetheless I found it enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"Several reviewers have commented that the book does not really explain how the dome was constructed without a wooden framework to support the bricks while the mortar bonding them together set and cured. I would endorse these comments. The author writes about the \\"herring-bone\\" configuration of the brickwork (same as everyone else) but I was not able to understand how this would support bricks whose bedding plane lies at a steep angle to the horizontal. One feels that a good diagram would do the trick, but the only diagrams in this book are archaic ones made by Brunelleschi's contemporaries, and are mostly of his hoisting machines. I was especially disappointed by this book because it was referenced in a teaching course as THE EXPLANATION, which it most definitely is not. In my experience, when an author is unable to adequately explain something, it means that he does not really understand it himself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too bad there isnt a \\"0 star\\" rating","review":"This book was absolutely terrible. A real snoozer. My 10th grade history teacher made us read this over summer vacation. Maybe if you are into books that are so confusing that you have to read each page three times or books that have no plot and cannot possibly be followed. Then this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings Florence's Dome to life, with gusto!","review":"This is the story of genius, sweat, and emotion that went into the construction of the dome of Il Duomo, Florence's most visible landmark. If you've been to Florence, you will especially enjoy this history of the construction of and the creative genius behind the building of one of the architectural triumphs of the world. King brings the reader back to the time of its construction, with vivid details of the design, the political intrigue over the commissioning of the design, the technical skills of then artisans, and the lifestyles of the common workers. Using primitive raw materials and more artistry than science, Brunelleschi demonstrated a capacity to improvise, adapt, and break through old methods to solve an almost impossible physical challenge.If you've not been to Florence, reading \\"Dome\\" might just convince you that it is time to go and well worth the visit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising, but unfocused and poorly researched","review":"By all means borrow this book and read it, but don't waste your money to buy it. Mr. King frequently hints at interesting avenues which would further explain Brunelleschi, the driving forces behind the building of the dome, and Brunelleschis' technical accomplishments. Unfortunately, either for lack of research ability, interest, sources, or some combination thereof, he only scratches the surface of his subject.Look at Galileo's Daughter for an example of what this book could have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise and interesting story","review":"Don't let the title put you off. This is not a dry bit of engineering history as much as it is a detailed (and focused) picture of 15th century Florence. Using the building of the dome as a fulcrum, Mr. King touches upon everyday life in Florence, church and city politics, guilds and workers, quirky Florentine personalities, and, above all, Brunelleschi's creative genius. The black and white drawings that fill in the gaps when imagination might falter are well suited to the concisely told story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brunelleschi's Dome","review":"A remarkably well-researched, well-written and fascinating book yielding great insight into the man, his time, and the environment and culture within which he lived and worked. A treatise which makes a doctoral dissertation look like child's play. Read it, take notes, learn from it, enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Una excelente experincia a lo Lerner!","review":"Tal vez muchos no saben lo maravilloso y prolifero que este artista, es poco conocido, pero no poco reconocido, respetado por muchos es compositor de muchas canciones que otros artistas interpretan.

Lo recomiendo enormemente."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!","review":"In the beginning I thought it was the best thing since sliced bread, color coded, easy to set up and a good starter HT System with ok sound. But that soon changed. Three or four months after I had the unit, CD's & DVD's wouldn't load. I would open/eject a few times and they would eventually load. But then it just stopped loading altogether and it would display \\"disk error\\". I called support and was told that it must be the quality of the CD or DVD. I was told to get a disk cleaner. I sent them the unit and now we are going back and forth that it's now not under warranty!This product is a LEMON! I wish I had seen all the other reviews out there telling of this major issue! Samsung should recall this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality","review":"I bought this and had to return it because the sound quality is so incredibly poor. True, it's an inexpensive system, so I wasn't expecting anything outstanding, but this is barely one step above portable stereo quality.On the bright side it has all the features one could ask for, including progressive scan picture, five disc capacity, ability to play slideshows from picture CDs, play MP3s, the list goes on.I knew I was in trouble when I had the sound level really low and still got distortion with some of the sound field settings. And there is almost no fine tuning of the sound. No equalizer or tone controls and barely adequate fade and balance controls. Forget about cranking it up. The distortion and hollow base from the subwoofer make the system useless for those action adventure films I got the system for. You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Informative Reiki Book","review":"When I began reading this book I was amazed at how it seemed to answer questions that would pop up in my mind. Just turn the page and there it would be. You are not left wondering well, what does that mean,,,or,,,what do you do with that.It is all there.The everything Reiki Book is one that goes beyond the Reiki teaching and includes subjects that are not usually taught.I will recommend this to all Reiki Practitioners and a must for those just begining thier search.

Each page is covered with a large ego; there is no news here, no insights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a different book!","review":"As a h.s. football official, I buy EVERY book on officiating or by an official that comes out. In the case of \\"Meat Grinder,\\" I wish I'd made an exception.It is written in 3rd person by someone who'd have a hard time writing a decent 5-page h.s. English paper. I was literally bored of the book by the third page and THREW IT OUT!The copy I bought was taken OUT of the collection of a library...that should've tipped me off. Trust me, this book is TERRIBLE."},{"rating":"2","title":"ON THE FIELD FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE","review":"I enjoyed this book because it gave me (a woman) a different view of the game. I was unaware of the time officials are away from their families and the preparation involved with being a football official. It was also informative to know of the many \\"conversations\\" that take place between the players and the players and officials.I particularly enjoyed the round table discussion which included one of the great officials of our time Mr. Red Cashion.I believe Mr. Brown and Mr. Eisenstock have done an exceptional job of enlightening its readers on events that go unoticed in the NFL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent content, Football what a sport!!!","review":"Mr Brown,Thank you. The information you have provided, in this well crafted chronicle of life as an NFL Official, is well documented and expresses your true love and passion for the game. As a former collegete player and current High school official this is a must read for ALL students of the game. I would urge coaches, players and parents to add this book to there educational libary. If players could see the game as officials see the game (officials that have competed in this sport) it would add years to there career. To suceed in football you must be a STUDENT of the game and Chad Brown has surpassed that level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok","review":"This book features very interesting information about football officiating and NFL football in general. I enjoyed reading the book, however it was written in a rather meandering style.The language is rated R, but if you can handle it, I would recommend this book for hardcore NFL and referee fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"I first heard this record in South Africa.

I also ordered the chrome covers for the screws (Cruiser Accessories 82030 Screw Covers, Chrome) that I was already using, and, altogether, it looks great, and is exactly the look I was going for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice...","review":"I first purchased these for my new 2008 Honda Accord EX-L to complement the chrome on the car and though they looked nice I eventually ordered the 20130 version of the Cruiser chrome frame for the wider border."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT Fit California Plates","review":"It's close, but overall I'd summarize this as the typical \\"you get what you pay for\\". Maybe some of them fit, but mine didn't. And the holes don't line up perfectly either. Manufacturing tolerances of this product clearly aren't top notch. If you care about your car, I recommend that you don't skimp out even on a license plate bracket. Pay an extra 5-20 bucks to get something of higher quality and better fit and finish. For what it is and what it costs, I suppose the product is OK (2 stars), but hopefully this review will help set your expectations low."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Small for Washington Plates","review":"The frame is the exact same size as my Washington state plates so you could see the actual plates around the border of the frame. I went to O'Reilly's and purchased their \\"Custom Frames\\" frame that was similar in appearance. The frames I purchased from O'Reilly's were $8/each but were of much higher quality.

It is hosted by C-3PO and R2-D2 who narrate and explain each of the movies in 10 minute segments, showing highlights from each movie (except Episode 3 which hadn't been released yet).

Now they are telling me they will provide the part and labor, but I have to pay the mileage. And since they do not have a repairman within the area where the TV is, the mileage fee is $185. Obviously, I have refused to pay the $185 for a $500 TV. They are not honoring their warranty. DO NOT BUY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basically satisfied","review":"The TV and VCR part worked fine upon opening. The DVD did not read the DVD disk. I have called the manufacturer and they are arranging a service call to repair the DVD. The color was a little orange in the facial tones, but this is adjustible.

Make sure your stereo does not only accept fiber optic inputs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this unit at Sears, and they will not help resolve the problem. Within 6 months of purchase, the VCR will not stop or eject, and the TV powers down every time it is turned on. So even the TV will not work Sears wants $90 to come see the problem. Funai(manufacturer) says the VCR will never work properly and gave me instructions to unplug the TV for 45 minutes, then trick the VCR into ejecting by pressing fast forward and eject. Tried this over the course of 3-4 hours, with no results. Manually got the tape out of the VCR and the TV still won't come on. My wife and I put the whole thing in the trash. I am not spending another dime on it.

On day 32, this unit quit working - would not power up. Best Buy would not exchange it and suggested that I talk to Sylvania. Sylvania gave me the name of an authorized service center. I carried the TV to the shop. 1 day after the service center \\"fixed\\" the TV, it quit working. I carried it back to the shop. When I brought the item home, it would not work that day. I carried it back to the shop (3rd time). 10 days after bringiing it home, it quit working again. During this entire ordeal, I called Sylvania twice - each time they were not willing to refund my money nor exchange the product. If it breaks again, I will likely file a lawsuit in civil court to get my money back.

Similar sets from Sony, Toshiba, etc give you 9 points to adjust.4) Ghost streaks appeared to the right of bright objects in high contrast situations.This being said, the RCA generally produced a \\"good\\" picture, and who really watches the edge of the screen anyway, right? ;-)Bottom line - this set is available at a discount price, but it also delivers discount quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warranty service","review":"This unit has not worked properly since new.

I have also seen that it is a serious fire hazard because of this same problem, although I was fortunate enough not to have my set catch on fire. I had purchased a 3-year extended warranty from The Brick, but their service center says that they have tried with no avail to obtain the needed parts from Thomson/RCA.

Sent it to be repaired and found out the HO Transformer is defective. After another 8 months after the repair the same problem occurred with the transformer.

Four weeks now and earliest delivery date is still 2 weeks away.

One of the glass panes had broken where it goes into a groove of black plastic and had fallen out of the lantern and tiny glass pieces were in the box. It was a small part, so it was possible to glue it into the groove.2. The pot metal frame that this is made from was very cheap and a corner of it was broken. I used jb weld for it. I find it very inconvenient to return something, especially by mail, so I will normally find a way to repair it before going that route and that is what I did in this instance.

For a more heart-on-your-sleeve interpretation, I go for Ashkenazys youthful (but sadly out of print) recording of 1960 on the Meloydia label.With either, you just can't go wrong. The famous etude in thirds is just one of many highlights in this recording. After all, he learned it at the age of 10! It has a sense of ease and fluffiness in tone which is just amazing.

This book was nothing but complete drudgery. I stuck with it, assuming it would get better. But it never did. Interesting premise, but never delivered. There is little to say other than the main character was extremely flat and not at all likable or sympathetic. I'm done with Alice Hoffman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I usually enjoy Hoffman's books.

But, it didn't draw me in quite the way some of her other books have."},{"rating":"1","title":"As exciting as watching ice melt.","review":"I am a big Alice Hoffman fan, but I just did not connect with this one. I found the main character too self-pitying and self-centered. I made it halfway through and then realized I just didn't care enough about any of the characters to force myself to finish. If you are new to Hoffman, I recommend trying one of her other novels first, such as Practical Magic, Here on Earth, or River King."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to my Alice?","review":"I could not believe that Alice Hoffman wrote this book - it was graceless, dark and depressing -- and just plain weird. The main character was one-dimensional and the plot was deadly boring. There was way too much strange stuff going on that does not deserve to be called \\"magic realism\\", for which she is famous. And it rambled on and on......I have been a fan of this author's since forever, it seems, and read every book of hers. I have not loved every one, but none have disappointed me as much as this one. I had to struggle to finish it.Oh, well, I guess she cannot please me all the time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ice Queen","review":"I am a Hoffman fan, but not of this.

I was bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kritters Ramblings","review":"A book that flowed like a stream consciousness - which unfortunately I wasn't a fan of. The story overall was intriguing, but because of the writing style, it wasn't my favorite.The use of strong adverbs made me fall in love with her descriptions of the \\"effects\\" of lightning strike survivors. I adored the relationship between the brother and sister and how the early death of their mother affected the both of them in two totally different ways. But through these likes, I still had a hard time reading and enjoying this one.I would only recommend this book to those who love things that are artsy. Imagery and visualization would be key when reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak book....","review":"Honestly, I am shocked by all the positive reviews! The main, lame character has so many epiphanies...that the book was anti-climactic at best. Pure fantasy....which is OK...but it was DUMB fantasy. Glad I bought it at a thrift store because it was only worth the quarter I spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my thing....","review":"Too predictable and unrealistic and to make matters worse, it's \\"Danielle Steele lite.\\" Was shocked to read the interview in the back pages where Alice Hoffman says she is very analytical in real life but does not write that way. I wish she would write that way. I don't know how she can write differently than she is. But ... I guess she writes what she knows will sell and her readers seem to love her. Not for me, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ice Queen","review":"I have loved all of Alice Hoffman's books until I tried to read this one. It failed to keep my intrest and was so confusing.

It took me 3 weeks because I kept putting it down after a few pages. Boringville. This was my first Alice Hoffman book and more than likely, my last. I could not stand the main character. She deserved to get hit by lightning just because of all the whining about what she thought she did to her mother. The whole sexual thing with Lazurus wasn't erotic either. It was just \\"icky\\" and uninteresting. The only interesting person in this story was Ned's wife. So, to all you fellow reviewers who didn't like it, I'm right there with you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Written, But Bland and Boring","review":"This is not a horrible book, but I felt that for all its worth it was pretty bland and boring. The plot is nothing new or original. The whole fire and ice metaphor is just sooo cliche. And I felt that the main problem with the book was the main character! Beautiful language can't cover or hide the fact that the character was soo one-dimensional that she didn't seem like a character at all, at least not an interesting one. I heard that Alice Hoffman was an excellent writer; unfortunately, if you read this book out of her many others, you might wonder what all the hype is about because you can't really see her full potential here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreakingly beautiful","review":"I couldn't put this one down.

I think she had an original idea for the book, but it never felt fully developed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiration piece!","review":"This was an excellent book- entertaining and easy to follow. However, Hip Home Ec left much to be desired. It's kinda hard to explain. If you are already remotely crafty, the recommendations are relatively dull.

It may be amazing and really helpful, but I really need the pictures!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must buy book! Everyone needs to get crafty ....","review":"This an EXCELLENT book, well written (that is not a term I use loosely). I really like how she examines why so many women are embracing crafting. She delves in the background of how she found her crafts and reclaimed her life. She also explores the benefits of this lifestyle and provides uplifting stories of how crafting changed certain individuals lives in a positive way.

Intelligently and creatively written, the main character, a Baratan exile, (Felix Nogara) draws you in to his plight. I couldn't put this book down. While reading this book I kept making analogies between the ficititious island of Barata and Cuba. Mr. Medina obviously has a solid grasp of Cuban history and uses it as the foundation for this compelling story. The chapter that tells the story of El Campion's death is well worth the price of the book!

Don't count on it working very long or with much of a range. Your gauge better be close to the house, because the wireless transmission won't go far. The manual is darn near useless, not because you can't understand it, but because the buttons will gradually lose some of their functions until you can no longer reset the total rainfall, can no longer access some functions, etc. The gauge itself is somewhat poorly constructed as well, making changing the batteries a real chore that requires a jewelers screwdriver and disassembling the entire device. Two stars only because it will work (for a while) right out of the box. Eventually, it will become a one star product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on by","review":"I absolutely loved Stephen McCauley's books, \\"The Object of My Affection\\" and \\"The Easy Way Out.\\" They were exquisitely written with engaging characters and stories. I fell in love with both of those books. On the other hand, I was half-way through reading \\"Alternatives to Sex\\" when I realized that I couldn't remember the main characters name!

This book was a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decitful!","review":"I plucked this book from the shelf of my local library because it sounded funny and intriguing. Nowhere NOWHERE in the book blurb did it state that the book was about a gay man! NOWHERE!!!!!!! I figured what the heck I'll try reading it anyhow. Well, after about 30 pages I gave up. Why? It wasn't funny. I selected the book because it was supposed to be funny - nope. Not a giggle, not a chuckle - nana. I still wonder why they hid the fact that the main character was gay. I'd never heard of the author so how could I know? Well, I know the name now and sure won't bother picking up another boring book by him - gay character or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oddly, I borrowed this book...","review":"right along with De Beauvoir's \\"The Mandarins\\".

I thought that it would be more substantial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I absolutely adore Stephen McCauley's early work. The Easy Way Out still makes me laugh out loud, so I eagerly awaited the release of this most recent work. I was in a word -disappointed.

It did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Celibacy\\" and its allure","review":"\\"Celibacy\\" is first and foremost the unmarried state, particularly the state you're in when you've vowed never to marry. If you're honoring the vow, the presumption is that you are not having sex. Hence the common misunderstanding that \\"celibacy\\" means abstinence from sex. (And we all know how often that presumption can be wrong.)Stephen McCauley is a talented writer who, presumably, writes books that bring profits to his publisher. You would therefore think he would merit an editor capable of substituting \\"abstinence\\" for \\"celibacy.\\" (A global search and replace would do.)Otherwise, I agree with many other reviewers: this book is not up to McCauley's previous books. Read one of the latter if you're new to McCauley; otherwise, be prepared for disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty Gay Fiction","review":"If you are gay and looking for fiction that will be intriguing, interesting, and perhaps tastefully sexy, then Alternatives to Sex: A Novel by Stephen McCauley is definitely the book for you.This book definitely has universal appeal, and can be comprehended by the young or old, the rich or poor, and the gay or straight.

One broke after just a few months but the other eventually did too .. cheap plastic. Also the seat caved in long before our son reached 30 pounds.The 'first years' booster we own is much older and none of the clips on it have ever failed so it isn't us. It's this seat and its poor materials."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great yet hard to clean","review":"I got this as a gift from my germ phobic sister. I thought the idea was great, since your child is not hanging off the side of the table. I never was afraid that he would fall out or slip off the table - plus the wait staff were a little more receptive to it, since they were not hunting down a booster or highchair and they didn't have to store a random chair. The straps were super easy to adjust for each chair. My only complaint is that it's a little hard to clean, since babies can be messy eaters and you can only surface clean. We used it a lot more than I thought we would and not just going out to eat. It was used at family and friends houses without little ones. Very light, very easy to transport; it has now been passed down to the newest baby in the family to get many more months of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"great portable seat!","review":"This is a wonderful portable seat or even a great booster for the dining table.

It's sturdy and handy. It doesn't wipe clean, so I wouldn't recommend it as a primary seat. My guy didn't sit until after 7 months, and it took another 2 months for him to be comfortable with it. Restaurant highchairs were no good for him (neither were shopping carts). This kept him supported and sitting up when his sitting was still emerging, after he outgrew his infant carrier. I keep it in my trunk, so I never have to worry about whether there'll be a highchair available. (You do need to strap it to a chair, obviously, not a booth.) There's even a little pouch to keep table toppers and bibs. It's not looking too good these days, with food smears on it, but it doesn't smell, so who cares? I once used it in the back of a shopping cart, when I had my neice in the cart seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"great seat, great company","review":"This seat is very comfortable for my almost 2 year old and was perfect for when she decided she no longer wanted a high chair but a real chair like the adults.

They even sent me a \\"gift\\" of one of their other products to compensate me for having to ship the old one back to them. The material is a bit difficult to clean but it is super easy to fold up and carry out with us.

I pried the unit apart just to the point of breaking it and backed off in fear of watching some spring or gizmo shoot across the room.

However, they use poor materials and are overpriced. For only 2, 30 min. segments, $30 is ridiculous! New, professionally made movies are not that expensive! Taking advantage of educators like this is beyond belief. I own several of these and the material used to make them is very low grade. For this price you would expect better quality DVDs. My copy of Puerto Rico families was only played 2x. When I went to clean the disk it cracked down the middle.

The English captives were made to march in the winter well over 300 miles to Canada. Many of those that couldn't keep up or were troublesome were killed so not to slow down the rest of the people.Mercy Carter was one of the English taken into captivity by the Mohawk.

I personally think that Schiff plays better than Gould. An eccentric person, Gould mainly does what he wants. In some pieces, he plays them extroadinarily, but most pieces, they are a mess of complete rushing and absolutely no dynamics. In almost every song he plays, Schiff shows a perfection that no one else could have. I enjoy listening to him and learn a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but why so careful and boring?","review":"Many will surely find Schiffs playing to be delightful, and it is, but he seems to be embellishing things to the point when things starts to either fall apart or be plainly boring. These minatures should, to my liking, be played more straightforward, but still keep a springloaded driving momentum they way Gould masters it. Schiff is nevertheless great and does a better job than for instance Hewitt, Sebestyen, Peter Serkin and Martins. Buy both GG and Schiff and you'll have much fun. Try Inventions 5,7,13, 15 and Sinfonias 8, 11, 14 and 15."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schiff falls short this time","review":"His 2 and 3-part interpretations sound thin and mechanical. I'd caution anyone to buy it, and at least listen to Glenn Gould or Angela Hewitt before. Schiff generally is an excellent Bach:ist, but his inventions and symphonias are not up to the same level as much of his other work. The best recording all categories for these works on piano is Gould's. For Harpsichord, I like Van Asperen a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chromatic fantasy is the biggest disappointment","review":"I will return to the inventions later. Returning later: the more I listen to it, the more I get disappointed: it lacks emotions. It is my general impression of Schiff's playing Bach - unemotional. I'm done with him and moving on to other interpreters.My biggest disappointment is the way he plays the last piece - Chromatic Fantasy and fugue. The fantasy has an improvisatory character which is missing in his playing completely. All the suspense and half of the pauses are gone, especially bad is the fist half of it. Compare Schiff's interpretation with, e.g., Edwin Fischer. I still yet to find more modern as much satisfying interpretation.

Rondo, She belongs to me (Bob Dylan's song), and Azrial are some of my favorites because they emanate lots of happy energy. America is a very beautiful song that absolutely captures the birth of prog rock, fusing clasical and rock music. The Thoughts of Emerlist Davjack is passionate and inspiring. Hang on to a Dream is absolutely beautiful with its gentle and fragile beginning developing into more upbeat jazzy part. It shows off Emerson's keyboard mastery.Based on the is CD, I can see the similarity between The Nice and ELP, but that shoulf not be disappointing or surprising since the leading figure in both groups is Keith Emerson.

Claudia seemed to be jealous of stacey spending too much time with robert though and kept questioning their friendship and they got into a fight. The baby sitters also came briefly for the trip and they made costumes for the fourth of july parade but it was a disaster and meanwhile stacey is getting all tangled up in her lies, but she's not the only one who lied, her dad was up to something too and keeping it from stacey.

The original of \\"Wholesome\\" is as pop as blips can go, but her lyrics seem rather wan. Sure, the lady has pipes, but the mix sounds a bit heavy on the treble side, to where her voice can get hurt-y. Filewile strips out most everything in their mix except for the voice, the beat and an electro bass (the Electric Blanket Remix takes the same tack, though they add a melodic line). Elsewhere, Plaid adds in some steel drums for a slightly twitchier mix -- not quite up to their mix of her \\"No Government\\" years earlier. G. Rina offers a more interest time with \\"Groovy,\\" sending the Simon & Garfunkel song into a twisty space journey, while \\"Stars\\" has some dreamy breaks to back it up.

The author wants to blame the church for the incidents of child abuse, while praising the homosexual clergy who perpetrated 90% of the abuse! (That statistic is a fact - check any major news source.) People like the author are themselves abusing the Church - by using the church as a forum for their own extreme and un-Christian views.

Overall, an embarrassment to the author and her cause."},{"rating":"2","title":"90 Percent True","review":"I am a lifelong Catholic and was never indoctrinated into the Church as so many people have been, so I can say with absolute certainty that Jane Kelly is right about 90% of what she says. With regards to institutional organization, the Church is a slowly evolving dinosaur, one that needs to change in order to survive. However, her attacks on some of the longstanding traditions of the Church are completely unwarranted.

Stick with Weber BBQ's you can get parts at any store."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have just loved this movie since I first saw it!!!","review":"This is a foreign film but it's in English.

Some reviewers criticize this as having some weaker stuff and annoying guest appearances, but I think that's just a function of having a bigger album. Some stuff inevitably will not be as good as the rest. And I think the guest appearances are fine. Lil Kim spews off a foul mouth on one track, but that's what she does in her own stuff. Anyway, there's lots of great raps on her. The album's a bit slicker and more produced, lacking some of the edge of Ready to Die, but I think things as a whole work very well. While maybe not quite as awesome, on a song by song basis, as Ready to Die, this album definitely has enough quality material for the 5 stars.

You have the smooth rnb grooves of I Love The Dough, Missing U, Sky the Limit.. You have B.I.G spitting rapid-fire rhymes with Bone Thugs N Haromony on Notorious Thugs.. It also show maybe the direction he was heading in to with his style of rap.. But if you havent own this in your collection You should own it .."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been better","review":"Biggie did improve himself on this album lyircly. But I still would not put him in the same ranks as Nas, Prodigy of Mobb Deep or the late great Tupac. One thing that's missing on this double cd is Biggie's rawness. He doesn't hit you with that stuff like he did with his previous songs (\\"who Shot Ya?\\" \\"Dreams of #$%*ing an R&B B*tch,\\" or \\"The What\\". Biggie was obviously all about the flossing and glossing on this album which really upset me. Some of the songs I felt that were too sweet for my taste were \\"Miss U\\" and \\"Sky's the Limit\\" I also was not feeling B.I.G on \\"Nasty Boy\\" I mean picture B.I.G as a Nasty Boy...ugggghhh.

So you will not be too disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true artiste.","review":"I think because of his \\"thug image\\", and the lyrics and lifestyle his songs embue, many people dismiss him. But for people who are willing to consider the fact that all types of music (even \\"hard\\" music and lyrics such as this) can be artistic, and who actually listen to this CD with OPEN ears, they will recognize that Biggie was a true artist. The way he incorporates little things into his songs (like the authentic sounding phone conversations, complete with music sometimes playing in the background) is very clever. Track # 8 on disc two would have to be my favorite song. The opening intros are beautiful, and very effective, and the beat in this song is AWESOME. To me, Biggie is one of the most artistic rappers we've seen to date, if not THE most artistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"G.O.A.T.","review":"I only review the albums I think deserve to get reviewed.

Also, Puffy sounds a bit funky yelling.The entire album is a classic, some of my favs are: Somebody's Gotta Die, N*ggaz Bleed, Miss U, Going Back To Cali, Ten Crack Commandments, You're Nobody (Til Somebody Kills you)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biggie","review":"Nice!

There is a slight tingling sensation, but if you have used a lip plumper before you know this is normal. It actually doesn't hurt at all. It makes your lips really soft and its a pretty lipgloss, but it didn't do as much plumping as I expected.

Although there are other good recordings of this piece, including one from the 1990's, this recording was conducted by the composer himself, and is a collectors piece. This recording will inspire you, and the genius of Benjamin Britten will be heard in astoundingly great quality, though the master tapes are some 35 years old. If you have been fortunate enough to hear this performance live, as I have by an astounding performance by the renouned Utah Symphony conducted by Keith Lockhart, the cd recording will not dissapoint your ears. The masters of Britten, the London Symphony Orchestra and Soloists are picked up wonderfly by the masters who recorded this masterpiece.

Acquaye. The vocals by Chris Hausl are outstanding, with One Hour Of Madness the best selection.Within art, there is a constant continuum which will remain timeless. By merging two major elements, Tangerine Dream places the legacy of Syd Barrett in its proper historical perspective, while producing their own masterpiece of sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shimmering","review":"This is one of the finest recordings ever of The Firebird. Dutoit was a student of Ernest Ansermet, who made a specialty of this score. Dutoit's performance is in the same league. Throughout, there are touches of fancy that create a host of details which come through beautifully in this extremely detailed recording. The Montreal orchestra has a splendid sonority for Stravinsky, with the most ethereal pianissimi imaginable. The Firebird often is a tough score to hold together in its complete form, but there are no dull spots in Dutoit's rendition. Whether you buy this as top notch Stravinsky or a stereo showpiece, you will not be disappointed. The shorter works are done beautifully, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pass It On!","review":"I was looking for a book about the human situation that still believed there is a form of redemption we are capable of demonstrating. I was looking for a story that said hope is worth holding on to. Someone recommended \\"Pay It Forward\\" to me, and I am glad they did. This is a lovely story. It has characters I can care about - although I must admit I felt frustrated with Reuben and Arlene as they struggled in their relationship with each other, but realized they had a lot of obstacles to overcome - especially the lessons about learning to trust themselves and each other.I have recommended this book to three friends with the stipulation that they each tell three other friends about it, and so on and so on... I will recommend it to many more, including young readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare and special book that warms your heart","review":"Run, don't walk, to read \\"Pay It Forward\\" if you want a vision of hope for our sad but beautiful world.

Be among the first to \\"discover\\" it (but not the last) - the movie will release in 2000 with Kevin Spacey, Helen Hunt and Haley Joel Osment (the boy from \\"The Sixth Sense\\") starring. And, Oprah -- pick this one, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Something Else Instead!!","review":"\\"Pay it Forward\\" wasn't very good. The story was saccharine sweet and had very unrealistic dialogue. A great example of the horrible dialogue was when Trevor referred to Chelsea Clinton as a \\"major babe\\". I'm sorry, but I just don't believe that most 13-year-old boys think of Chelsea Clinton as a \\"major babe\\". Oh, and every other word out of Trevor's mouth was \\"cool\\". My teacher is cool, my project is cool, Bill Clinton is cool, and every damn thing is cool.Another problem with this book was the love story between two of the main characters. They just didn't seem like they were really in love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three by three we can change the world","review":"This book was recommended by a good friend and I am very glad I listened! I was so touched by the story and its innate premise and the potential to change the world, that I cried through most of it. I gave a copy to the minister of my church, who then based a sermon on it.

What I found inside was an equally beautiful story about life and all of it's ups and downs. How sometimes what we see as the truth is not the truth, and how we can change the world with some very simple changes in our dealings with others, both those who are familiar to us and those we would consider strangers. I LOVED THIS BOOK AND RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorite Novels","review":"'Pay It Forward' is one of my favorite novels. Author Catherine Ryan Hyde does an excellent job of establishing the locale and the desolation surrounding the city of Atascadero, and the characters react to their environment in a way that I would consider authentic.Arlene, Trevor's mother, is a little bit rough around the edges, and wonderfully written. Without spoiling the plot, let me just say that this is an exquisite story with a deeper meaning than one would find in most popular fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Beef?","review":"I had two problems when reading this book. First, several methods of dialogue were terribly inaccurate. At one point, the author attempted to create authentic gangster dialogue for an interview. The word choice was that of a forties gangster, not a 90's gangsta. Several other times word selection reminded me of my mom trying to be \\"hip.\\" The other problem I had with this book was the description. On more than one occasion the writer would build up to a non-existent climax by failing to give the reader sufficient detail. The television broadcast was one of many examples. The ending helped but couldn't salvage this struggling novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as corny as it sounds... very entertaining!","review":"I read the dust jacket of this novel in the bookstore several times and several weeks before finally buying it. The protagonist being a 12 year old scared me off a bit, I think. (Reading the other reviews here is what convinced me to get it). This is a book filled with adult storylines (almost like several shortstories intertwined). It is interesting and if you have to put it down, you find yourself looking forward all day to being able to pick it up again. The characters are well-developed and believable. I do not have my head in the clouds so high that I believe this book will change the world, but I do believe it will make most of us think about others (which is a step in the right direction). I have given it to my teenage daughter to read (very CLEAN book), and I look forward to passing it along to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking!","review":"Paying It Forward is one of the best books I have read for a great while! It was interesting, kept you guessing how all of the people Trevor helped (with the condition they \\"pay it forward\\") would pay their dept forward. It also made you think about how a small act of kindness can have long lasting effects, far past the originator's eyes. I would recommend this book to everyone. Not only is it a good story, but the underlying request to DO SOMETHING leaves you thinking about the book long after the last page is read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and inspiring","review":"I just read Pay it Forward in two days. It will be my Christmas gift book this year for all my book loving friends who don't discover it themselves before December. It is a beautiful story about a regular 13 yr old boy with a simple vision on how he can improve the world, never realising at the onset how far reaching his plan would be and how many people's lives it would touch and forever change. This novel is nowhere near as syrupy as it sounds but you know someone out there is going to make a movie of Pay it Forward eventually - let's hope they can do it justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Concept as \\"Magnificent Obsession\\" by Lloyd C Douglas","review":"Good idea for a plotline, but enjoyed the concept more in Douglas' \\"Magnificent Obsession\\" (1929?) in which old Doc Hudson bestowed favors on people with the condition that it remain a secret and they, in turn, must do something for someone else. Douhglas' sequel, \\"Dr Hudson's Secret Journal\\" expands on the concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"I read \\"Pay it Forward\\" last week. I ADORED IT! I am an avid book reader, so when I saw this, I checked it out. I was hooked by the first few pages. The detail was outstanding. Ms. Hyde's characters were very animated, from Trevor, to Mrs. Greenberg. Each had an individual personality that shined. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves reading stories from the heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sketchy","review":"Sketchy and predictable are the first words that come to mind after reading this novel. It's perfect for Hollywood, reads like a screen play. The idea is wonderful! Bravo- but the characters never really get developed in an interesting way, and you can predict what the characters will do before you even turn the page. There are no real fresh surprises here, except the concept, may it take root and thrive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cynical Romantics","review":"Catherine Ryan Hyde has painted a picture both compelling and emotional. \\"Pay it Forward\\" presents true human nature at it's best and worst.Hyde's characters are skillfully written. Empathy for them was imeadiately felt by this reader. I wanted to know them, and Hyde made it happen with realism and solid story telling.The idea of Paying it Forward springs from the heart of an altruistic boy, however, the characters who particapate, and those that are affected, are regular people. In \\"Pay it Forward\\", (much like life) there are few true heroes, but what power they have over the rest of us.Hyde takes the reader deep into the hearts and minds of her characters while evoking the feeling that it could happen. The world could be changed, if we wanted it to be, if we made an effort in our own little worlds.The best thing about this book is the way Hyde has confronted the cynical, and unmasked the romantics to find they are one in the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"More hype than a good book!","review":"It's no surprise that books sell for many different reasons. In the case of Pay it Forward it may be sheer curiosity by the public as it was in my case. While I imagine many will view this book in the same light as another cult favorite from many years ago, Jonathan Livingston Seagull, I will not be recommending this book to too many people. I did think the premise of paying forward good deeds sounds wonderful and there is a nice love story within the pages of the book, but my opinion is that the book wasn't well written and became predictable after only a few pages. Even the ending which should have evoked some emotion from sentimental me did almost nothing - only provided me with a bit of happiness that the book was finally over.Bottom line - wait for the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Writing Kills Story","review":"Pay It Foward could have been a decent book. It really could have. Unfortunately, the only people that enjoy it now are people that aren't completely literate.The writing is bad. There is no other way to say it. Anyone that passed high school english could formulate more coherent sentences. It seems like the author wrote one draft, put it on the fridge for a few days, and had it published. It is poorly put together, the characterization is weak, and even the plot is all over the place.You can tell the people that made the movie thought so too because they changed around the entire story so it would make some sense.Don't bother with the book. It is a waste of paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three more copies!","review":"I was so thrilled with this book, I went back and bought three more copies for others.

Thank you to Catherine Ryan Hyde!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The message of the book is what shouldn't be missed.","review":"My mother, if you met her, you would be impressed that she is tough and tough minded, can't finish the book, because she keeps crying (why she can't bear what she thinks will be the ending, I finally found out.)It starts with a boy named Trevor. If you think a boy couldn't think up an idea like this, maybe you will have a problem (and you don't know how genius works.) But I know enough kids and geniuses, I know this is possible. It might take a mathematician to write the formula, but just that kind of kid to say, \\"if you want to pay me back, do three good deeds, and ask them to do the same thing.\\" Yes, there is daring in the good deeds, and unexpected characters are touched.Anyone who thinks this book is too saccharine, I dare them to read Funerals for Horses. They both have the same point of view, faith in the human spirit, if unexpected, and they are both pure Catherine Ryan Hyde."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be mandatory in schools","review":"This book deals with so many issues in out society: poverty, tolerance, racism, class inequality, the importance of education and the old adage \\"Don't judge a book by its cover.\\" Well, you actually CAN judge this book by its cover! Simple yet worthy of attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful story","review":"What a great story that shows what simplicity is all about. A kid is given an extra credit assignment:to create an idea to improve the world.

The characters became unbelievably real to me and the story is absolutely realistic. This book will touch every reader's heart and soul. I predict this to become a best seller in no time and if presented just like the book reads, it has all of the potential to become the next \\"Forrest Gump-ish\\" movie - only THIS story is completely believable. You will wish this was based on a true story - and then wish it could be! Please read the editorials and the author's comments, but trust my enthusiasm to GET THIS BOOK! I need to end this so I can read it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful book!","review":"This is the most uplifting book that I have read in a long time, and I really needed an uplifting book for a change. Too many books out there are cynical and depressing. There are a lot of good people in our world, and this book talks about three of them -- Trevor, Arlene, and Reuben. And further more, the author explores the possibility for good that is in all of us -- given the right motivation. Too many books concentrate on the possibility of evil in everyone. But this story does the opposite. The book is not long, but her characters were well-crafted and lived on the page. I also loved the way she told the story, in bits and pieces from different points of view and from different angles of time. This increased the suspense of the story. Read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I just can't bring myself to finish it!!!","review":"The movie is great! The idea is great! The book is... not so great.I bought the book because the community where I live participated in the One Book program, where the entire community is encouraged to read one book. Events were planned, even a lecture and book signing by Ms. Hyde. I was excited.I started reading the book and waited for the author to get into a groove. I waited for the writing to smooth out a little but it didn't happen. I got to chapter four and I just couldn't take it any more. I see why the screenplay writers changed the story so much. The book takes an absolutely fabulous idea and packages it in an unrealistic, contrived, poorly written package.I wanted to give it 5-stars, I wanted it to be 5-star material but it just isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasure to Read","review":"It is so nice to read a book Ican pass on to my granddaughter.I made the mistake of seeingthe movie first.

Sorry, Ms. Hyde and those readers who liked it, but this is memorable only in the fact that it's really bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Tripe\\" may be too strong a word for this book, but","review":"There is one thing to like about this book. The characterization of the scarred teacher is well done, and only HIS thoughts and actions seem probable throughout the book - until the ending. Unfortunately for the reader, the author abuses her position as a fiction writer to preach a social activist agenda through this teacher's mouth. He deserved better. I liked this guy and would invite him to dinner (the character, definitely not the author).The book is already out-dated (in only ten years), partly by the author's naive embrace of Bill Clinton as an idealist and ideal president. The author also perpetuates a world in which characters are motivated by formless altruism. The author's perspective in my opinion is purely socialist.No thanks, I'll take the real world with all its flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Tapes - Not for Children","review":"The audio version of this story is filled with four-letter expletives, discussions of sloppy birth control practices, and the like. These are unnecessary and do not add to the story.Perhaps my understanding of the intended audience was incorrect. This is an \\"R\\" rated audio, not appropriate for children's ears.Yet, the message has such appeal. It is a shame that it cannot be shared with our children.Perhaps the book is better. I am returing the tapes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this book.","review":"Pay it Forward is about a pansy 12-year-old kid named Trevor that came up with a stupid idea to change the world: Pay it Forward. Now I can't hear those three words without cringing. The whole book is filled with one-dimensional characters, lots of smoking, and boring dialogue. Most of the sentences are broken up into fragments. The only thing I learned from this book is that there's such a thing as being too helpful, which affects Trevor greatly towards the end of the book which is also the best part. I'm not gonna give away the outcome, but the only reason to pick up this book is to see what happens to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tacky trash","review":"The premise of the book is intriguing, that we should do good deeds and have others pass it on. Unfortunately the author incorportes a number of morally wrong situations including pre-marital sex and an underage boy who gets beat up because he acts like a girl and does not have the sense to get psychological help. There is also some graphic violence. The writing is broken up into various voices which is confusing. The inclusion of Bill Clinton as a character dates the book and underlines the author's liberal agenda.

The range of songs is very wide.

If you want a descent clock radio, keep looking. The self setting clock is fantastic and the dual alarm feature is nice. However the radio is absolutely terrible. It is difficult to tune because the tuning knob is tiny and it is impossible to to see the few station frequency numbers that are printed in tiny numbers on the dial. So you have to guess what station it is on and wait for the station to say its call letters. For some reason the radio will not stay in tune, so every two or three days I have to re tune it. The latest issue is the volume control which is cutting in and out so it is about to go.Life it too short to use something so aggravating so I'm going to replace this with a Sangean WR-2.Also, the sound quality of the Emerson is poor, but I expected that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jerry","review":"This is the second \\"atomic\\" clock I have had and there is none better for the working person.

His research on Indian costumes is highly respected. Unfortnately, Cordry's mask book, published postumously,is a testament to how even a knowledgible collector can be duped by unscrupulous dealers. Many of the masks represented in the book doubtless are genuine. But many are not. It's a pity, but some of the most skillfully carved and creative masks are, in essence, fake. The state museum of Arizona bought more than 500 of Cordry's masks shortly before his death -- again proving that even the experts can be fooled. This is a gorgeous book.

For some bizarre reason, nearly every movement is very \\"angular\\" and clipped. It almost sounds as if the chorus has the hiccups! If you like your \\"Messiah\\" in the style of a military march this is the one for you! I suspect Solti was trying to achieve a light, bouncy effect but instead the performance comes off sounding very \\"mechanical\\". There are also some very mannered dynamics which are clear not in the original score and only particular to to Solti (i.e. there are a lot of \\"subito pianos\\" here and there).I advise you to have a listen BEFORE you spend your hard earned cash on this one.My personal favorite after 20 years is still J.E. Gardiner with the English Baroque Soloists."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst ones ever","review":"Unfortunately, this recording can stay on the shelf. The orchestra isn't particularly good, and the soloists leave much to be desired, especially the contralto who has a vibrato that can take paint off of your walls. The chorus, however is quite good.

He immediately finds friends and allies. There is not enough struggle to survive that you would find, if this happened to you. Even his adaptation to his new world is easy and quick.But the last quarter of the book was very interesting. But you have to wade through bad fantasy to find it.

With Cut Chemist gone, and their hip-hop farmed out, the results are uneven (only the title song escapes unharmed). Ozo don't change song styles mid-tune as often as they once did, transforming with audible effort from hip-hop to cumbia to jazz in a four minute track. Here, then, it's the traditional (for them) Afro-Latin songs that are most enjoyable - the scorching opener \\"Pá Lante\\", the salsa romp \\"Guerrillero\\", the swinging \\"Sueños en Realidad\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ozomatli excels! online concert, too...","review":"This album is fantastic.

Haven't been to a concert in years but I had to see them. AND THEY BLEW ME AWAY! Awesome! This new CD is a little different from the first CD...not as many tempo changes within the songs but the songs themselves have a more complex, cohesive musicality. And I love it. You can't go wrong with any Ozo CD. As for those that think Ozo is not the same without Chali 2na, they miss the whole point of Ozomatli. Their strength comes from the melding of their diverse talents, backgrounds and styles, not on one individual. Please, let's not pidgeon-hole such a great band.

Just saw them in concert April 27 04 and they were fantastic. They jumped into the crowd and played right next to us for the last 30 min. Very rarely do you hear a group who's live performance is exactly the quality of the CD. You won't need to understand Spanish to groove to the heated explicit lyrics.

This is an excellent choice for a music collection. I just wish The Hebrides was added to this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solti in the classics is cautious and dull, with spurts of energy","review":"Solti recorded everything in the orchestral repertoire, basically, and where his fiery style didn't apply, he was mostly lost. That's certainly true in these Mendelssohn readings, which replace grace and charm with cautious, routine conducting. There are spurts of fire, as in the finale of the Scotthish, but that, too, misses the mark. There is such lovely Mendelssohn from Karajan, Bernstein, Abbado, and many others that i would skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good CD","review":"Song's 13 - 15 by Bobbie Miller are of note.

The only way he could have told us the things he did was if he was truly in communication with my mother, and I have no doubts that she was there.... George Anderson has reaffirmed my belief that there is more to this world and that there is indeed an afterlife.

He said the deceased son was holding white roses and wishing a \\"Happy Anniversary.\\" When there was no response, he said the son is holding roses for a belated Mother's Day - lucky guess? -- not.

It's the man on the street in Riyadh and Jakarta who scares me more than Saddam does.Sure, Moslems are people, just like anyone else.

It primarily features the part of Episode III when Obi-Wan Kenobi faces General Grievous on Utapai. The young reader may be a bit disoriented to read that author Jane Mason tinkered with some of the plot details, so there are minor discrepancies when compared to both the film and Matthew Woodring Stover's novel. Perhaps being the only \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" book in the Jedi Readers that is not composed of film stills, Tommy Lee Edwards' original illustrations are beautiful. After combing through extensive Star Wars literature, I believe that this title features the only visualization of what General Grievous looked like before his cyborg surgery. To realize that Grievous looked scarier before his operation is by itself worth the $3.99 retail cost!

My biggest complaint with this is that I just dug this out of the box to set up this year and it won't work. The fan works fine, but no mist. The instructions were of no help, neither was the Holmes website. Of course, this has a warranty of only 1 year!11/19/12 - I need to provide an update for the previous review. I plugged in the humidifier and just let it sit for an hour or so, and when I went back into the room later, it was actually working! It continued to work well all last winter.

I liked the product. I decided to purchase this humidifier despite the number of negative revues. Unfortunately, I had a similar problem to others who claimed large amounts of water leaked out. Twice mine leaked much of the water in the tank onto the furniture and floor out of the lower back air inlet. It is not obvious what causes this to happen. I suspect the interior spring valve sometimes sticks.In addition, I agree with the many others who complained about the shape of the top of the tank that MAKES FILLING IT VERY DIFFICULT. This is one of those stupid designs made by marketing for its looks. There is no reason the tank could not be made to stand solid while being filled. I strongly recommend not buying it. Maybe they will get the message eventually."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"I purchased one of these from a store (not Amazon). It works just fine....except that it spews the micromist straight out of the top of the machine which means you need it on a low table or your cieling will get a washing! We had it on a dresser in our bedroom which placed its top at approximately 4 feet fromt the ceiling. You could see the mist hitting the ceiling from that level! My other \\"con\\" with this model is the closure of the tank. It is a wide mouth opening, but the top only screws in about 1/10 of a turn so it is BY NO MEANS secure. It feels like it will spill open at any second when you fill the tank. But it is quiet and it does last a while on low setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked for one season","review":"This humidifier woerked for 1 season, The Spring and seal deteriorated and replacement parts are not available The rubber gasket that that prevents water from flowing from the tank above into the reservoir below had dried up and crumbled away.

So muchfor ultrasonic. Unfortunately the rest of the machines is cheap.The mist output sometimes isn't constant either.Not sure what happened but it isn't worth the price.Spend the extra money and get a better brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"this humidifier is a rip off","review":"First, I didn't notice any difference in the humidity in my bedroom; a visible mist just shoots up. Then, I found it very hard to clean. There's just a small round hole at the bottom my small hand can barely fit in, to clean it, and all the water never entirely goes out, so I have work a wash cloth around the edges to dry it. The only place I can fill it, is in the bathroom since it is too tall for me to use in the kitchen sink which is closer. I can't fill it up entirely because then it would be too heavy for me to carry into the bedroom where I both sleep and also work.It looks good, but is not worth the price; the cheap one I had before did the same job (maybe better) and was a loteasier to fill and clean, despite the fact that I needed to buy filters. That was the one drawing point with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not silent as advertised","review":"I use a humidifier in my home office, where I like it to be quiet except for some slight music. I bought this unit from a store, and the box clear said \\"Silent Operation\\". That was a lie. I expect to not be able to hear something that is silent.I didn't realize until I went home that the humidifier that this was replacing was also a Holmes Ultrasonic product, although a different model. That dampers my hopes, as that one lasted for one winter, and that's it. It has grinding loud gears now. I hope this one is better.On a somewhat positive note, it puts out plenty of mist.If you don't mind the white noise it puts out, and if you don't mind the likelihood that it will work well for one winter, and then that's probably it based on prior Holmes history, then you might be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Worked well enough while it worked; although, there were still issues with it. The mist doesn't travel far so it will soak the area around it. It was difficult to seat the reservoir in the base without getting water out. You do get the white powder effect too.We were ok with dealing with the negatives but the whole thing stopped working after just a couple of years, and it was starting to spring leaks even before it stopped working. We won't be purchasing Holmes products again. Very poor quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working great so far","review":"This type of humidifier works ultrasonically, which is very quiet and puts out a lot of moisture. The vibrating membrane that creates the mist does get clogged over time with minerals if you have hard water. It can be cleaned to a point, but eventually it might stop misting. You will find a fine layer of sticky mineral gunk all over the room (on any exposed surface), unless you have soft water. There are additives you can put in the water to minimize this. Small rooms may get too humid unless it's on the lowest setting. We have been pleased with this one so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"not easy to use","review":"It is not really easy to fill and clean it; also when you move it little bit it stops giving steam, not recommend to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product","review":"I bought two different ultrasonic humidifiers at the same time ten months ago.

And, because it's such a piece of crap, of course it broke. I just tried to get a replacement tank from Holmes and was told they \\"didn't have one.\\" I'd advise anyone thinking about buying this thing to steer clear of the company all together.

There is no obstruction, the failure is a complete mystery to me.Other reviews are correct in saying that it is quiet when it does work, and also that the mist goes up and comes down, making the floor wet, even when I have it elevated from the floor by a good four feet.Pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humidifier","review":"This is one great humidifier.

It was returned to Target."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well designed","review":"Feature-wise, this is a great humidifier. However, the design throws this model out of contention.The tank must be refilled from the bottom: This makes no sense since water enters the humidifier through a valve on the bottom which is separate from the cap. This is probably to force people to pull the tank off every day and clean it, but it creates many more problems.The cap leaks: Yes, I am going to send my unit back for service, but this is an additional headache. If the cap were on top, it wouldn't matter. The design of the base means that if your cap leaks, the unit fills with water and then spills water everywhere.The tank is impossible to fill: The top of the tank is curved, so you can't just set it in the sink and fill it because it won't stand up on its own. I have to try to hold it while filling. I balance it on the faucet while filling, but it has already fallen over many times while doing that.Avoid this model!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Oder Holmes Product - Horrible Customer Support","review":"This company has horrible customer support.

To fill itthe top section must be removed and held upside down while 25 cupsof water are poured a cup at a time into the fill hole. It is tootall to fit under the tap, and will fall over unless it held becauseof the rounded top. When filled it is also quite heavy to carry backto the lower section. After just one month it just quit working, andwhen I requested service under the one year warranty I was told that another brand of ultrasonic humidifier will be shipped to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You need a tub to fill this thing","review":"Tall tank cannot be filled in any normal sink, and curved top of tank prevents setting it down while filling in the tub. Therefore, you have to lean over or get down on your knees and hold it while you fill it. I dropped the tank and it broke in the tub. No replacement parts available (the manufacturer refused to sell it), so this thing is now a piece of junk.

It was not, none of them are any good.

You definetly need a filter if you use tap water, especially where I live.I can't afford to buy distilled water. It worked 1 day, then it was some what misting,and making it's noise, the water disapeared so I assume it was doing something. My nose,throat and skin did not feel it. It is so hard to fill, no flat top to put it down on, and no handle to hold it. My fault by not researching things like I usually do. I dropped it from 4\\" and it basically shatterd in my bathtub. What now!! Can't return it, so I have this piece of junk, that I have to dispose of.So I buy another HOLMES product # 1865, one with a filter etc., Reviews are so so, but my cash flow is LOW LOW.

I cleaned it like instructed and used fresh tap water to fill it.But noticed I was having much worse allergy problems than before using it.I took it apart and found mold growing in the hard to see areas of the base. I have severe mold allergies! This unit was making me sick instead of keeping me well!!!!I also had a huge problem with scale buildup in the unit as well. We have extremely hard water where I live.I have been unable to find out from company how to remove mold and scale from unit so it will be safe to use again.They also do not know how to stop it from happening in future.I am going to have to trash it and buy a different brand all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied","review":"We had this humidifier for two weeks when it stopped working for no apparent reason and could not be fixed with any of the trouble shooting ideas that came with the humidifier. To add insult to injury, the 1-800 phone number for customer service is disconnected. I feel that we've been taken for $50 bucks. I don't recommend this product for purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well, but for a very limited time.","review":"It worked well for the first 3 months. After a couple of months back in the box I plugged it in and it only worked for 15 minutes before the ultrasonic device stopped working. It still makes noise and blows up air, but no mist. Their costumer service was not helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Awkward to Fill","review":"If you can get it filled and put the cap back on successfully, it works fairly well.But of course to fill it you need 5 hands.There is no flat surface on this thing so you could easily place it in a sink or bathtub leaving you to somehow prop it up/hold it up while trying to fill it. Then you need to somehow get one hand free to turn the water off and locate the cap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor servicability, Poor functionality","review":"Don't waste your time or money with this POS. The tank requires two-three hands to fill, whether you attempt to use a sink, bathtub, or fill with a smaller container. There are no flat sides, therefore you cannot set it down anywhere except the unit's base. Our unit stopped producing mist after about a week of use. A few slaps on the top got it working again. This behavior got worse over time, and I eventually found myself taking it apart to tighten loose screws inside. Eventually that stopped working as well. Now this piece of crap is ready for the curb, or the rifle range. I will say that when it was actually working, I was happy with the output and its quiet operation. We kept it on a low setting, and it was sufficient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Month Performance","review":"I purchased this unit for my elderly mother in a nursing home because her room is very dry, I would turn unit on at approximately 9:00 p.m and return in the a.m. at 7:a.m. and turn it off and refill and clean as needed. I did this for approximately two months or less and then it went dead. It did not fall as it was in a secure area with a \\"do not touch sign\\" I know no one touched it. Unit worked well when it worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Agree with many of the other posters -- it is extremely hard to fill this. You must fill it in the tub and with no handle, the tank can slip out of your hands easily. Once the fiberglass tank breaks, you're done. Also, you must run it with a fan behind it to actually circulate the mist around the room. The fan it comes with isn't powerful enough to do so, so it soaks the area around the humidifier. I've owned many humidifiers in the past and have never had one do this. The filter-free operation is great and it is incredibly quiet. Unfortunately, I don't see those two pluses outweighing its minuses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"I was excited when I first plugged this in...it was SO quiet on the most powerful setting! The following day, I emptied the tank and refilled it. Within about a half hour, mist stopped coming out of the top. When I went to inspect the situation, water was trickling out of the BACK of the unit where the PLUG is. That seems real safe...NOT. Emptied everything out again, filled it back up, plugged it back in (dry of course) and now it doesn't produce any mist what-so-ever...and again, water is trickling out the back. I'm returning this product of course."},{"rating":"1","title":"No customer support","review":"I bought this unit for use last winter. It performed well for the season, but the o-ring degraded over time. I also noticed the plastic near the spout was also beginning to break down and the two sections making up that area were starting to pull apart. I contacted Holmes to get a new o-ring. They told me 1) they were on backorder, 2) they had LOTS of orders for these, 3) I could not buy just the o-ring, would have to buy the \\"cap assembly\\" (mind you, the o-ring fits in to the tank, NOT the cap) and 4) they would put my name on a list to be notified when the parts were available. So, now winter is approaching and I call again and am informed that they are no longer making this o-ring (also, keep in mind this is a unique o-ring...nothing you could buy in catalogs or HI stores). I will not buy another Holmes product if I can help it. I am shocked to see they are still selling it despite not having parts for customers who will eventually need them."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Short Lived, But It's Expensive","review":"I live in a very small town. We have one variety store from which to buy things like this, and the only humidifiers they carry are Holmes. Over the past couple of years, I've bought several of these--not because I have a lot of rooms to humidify but because their products are so disposable. Either the motors go out or the 0-rings break or they spring leaks in the base. When I have had occasion to contact customer support to try to obtain a new o-ring or lid, I've been told twice that this model has been discontinued (when in fact, year after year, this piece of junk continues to appear on shelves and websites).No more Holmes products for me and I'd recommend that you steer clear as well. This is a lousy product from an apathetic company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"I have used Holmes ultrasonic humidifiers for more than 10 years.

The handle on top is great!Jay"},{"rating":"1","title":"Replacement parts no longer available","review":"I bought a Holmes HM 495 humidifier on Dec 8, 2007. In Jan, 2010 I decided to begin using it for the dry winter season. The rubber gasket that that prevents water from flowing from the tank above into the reservoir below had dried up and crumbled away. I e-mailed Holmes Service twice describing the issue, but never received a reply. I finally called the Service department to learn that they no longer make this rubber gasket. Thus the humidifier is useless, and must be disposed of.Because the humidifier is 2 years and 1 month old, Holmes would not stand by their 2 year warranty. There was no attempt on their part to recognize that the unit had only been used for 2 seasons.I recommend that readers never buy a Holmes."},{"rating":"1","title":"works but LOTS of white dust","review":"I was attracted to this product because it doesn't need a filter. I have other humidifiers - all with filters - and it's getting harder and harder to find the replacement filters.I have had the Holmes HM495 for about a month. I have a great increase in humidity, but it's produced a white dust that is on everything. It's attached itself to every TV, computer, clock, etc. I even had to take my computer in to have the inside screen professionally cleaned.I would return this product if I had kept the box. I would NOT recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"I bought this humidifier about 2 months ago and I just bought another one. It's tall and slender, rather than short and fat like most. It can be a little tricky filling the tank and then carrying over to the base. A better design would help with filling and transporting. The unit is super quit and easy to operate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not noticing much change in humidity","review":"We run this humidifer 24 hours a day on highest setting in a medium size bedroom where the door is usually closed most of the way. You can definitely see the mist coming out, but the humidity isn't even getting to 40% in the room. It is possible that our device to measure the humidity isn't accurate or something but that doesn't seem to be the case to me. You would think the room would be pretty humid running at high. I would be interested in finding out if the people that liked it actually measured the humidity or just assumed it worked well because it does put out visible mist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holmes Hunk of Junk!!!","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS HUNK OF JUNK! Mine lasted less than one month. It sprung a leak along one of the seams of the base module. That caused water to leak onto the electical cord and go all over the place. Trying to fix it was impossible. If you want to throw away money and buy something that is a complete electrical hazard, this is the one for you. Holmes sucks.....end of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atomizer failure ...

Also, design of the tank means that it cannot sit upside down -- so after it is filled, the cap must be locked on immediately, before it can be set on the floor. I have owned other (smaller) humidifiers that have never leaked, and this one seems to leak around the base on occasion. Decent for the price, but I thought it would be designed better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"I have two of these already and purchased another one for my daughter.

On second week, the operation suddenly stopped while in use. I called up Holmes and they requested me to dry the unit for 24 hours and re-start. But it never did re-start. It seems that the problem is with the transducer. Holmes replaced it with a Sunbeam SUL-2512 but which does not have the same capacity in emitting mist as the HM495-UC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last","review":"This humidifier worked well for a week. It did require some experimentation to get the control in the right place (a little past halfway) to avoid condensation on the table. However, on the eighth day I turned it off when I left for work in the morning and when I returned that night, I turned it on and nothing happened. It had not been touched while I was gone, so I have no idea what happened. After trying a few things with no results, I called customer service. I was asked a few questions and was offered a replacement, but was told it was out of stock and it was unknown when it would be available. A Sunbeam SUL2512 was offered as an alternative and I accepted. The customer service rep was courteous and didn't give me a hard time -- she just asked the sort of questions I expected. The output of this Sunbeam unit isn't as good, but it has worked for more than a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humidifer stopped working.","review":"This was a Christmas gift from my son. The humidifier worked great for about 3 weeks and then stopped putting out moisture. The fan works, but nothing comes out. I took it and cleaned it as instructed, rinsed it out again and still nothing comes out. The fan is working, but that is all."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly designed","review":"I own this humidifier, and it does its job fairly decent, but it keeps the area around it quite wet especially in the high setting, so be careful when you put it on top of your wooden furniture because it can rot. It also requires frequent maintenance. The tank does not have a handle when you turn it upside down, which is when you need it the most, when you are filling the tank. It can slip, and the fiberglass can easily break, and that is the end of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for a year","review":"Bought this last year and it worked pretty well for last winter. I didn't like that you couldn't adjust the direction the mist went, it just went straight up and fell right back down, making the floor wet around it. Went to set it up this year and it has stopped working. The fan runs, but the ultrasonic plate won't vibrate anymore. I tried cleaning it, taking it apart, everything. I really thought I'd get more than 1 season out of it. Consider this a one season humidifier."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Repair Parts Available...","review":"I have 2 units and they lasted 2 winter seasons. Now water release valves on tank are worn away and leaks water when you insert tank into base. Holmes says valve is not available. This little rubber valve must cost Holmes $1 and they could sell 10,000 of them for $3 if they would only make it available. Holmes is a marketing company and they want to sell you a new unit, not repair your current HM495. I expect these to last me 6-7 years with minor repairs. The valve is unique, you cannot use an O-ring. So both of mine go off to some landfill along with 50,000 others they have made. This is really stupid. I wish the landfill was in China !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great unit, puts out a lot of moisture","review":"This is my second Holmes HM495-UC Ultrasonic humidifier. Most modern humidifiers either use paper wicks, which get covered with calcium deposits and mold; or require heat, which burns a lot of electricity and covers the heating element with calcium deposits; or requires water filters.This unit just needs water to work, is easy to clean, easy to fill, and can put out an entire tank of water in 24 hours. After fighting with a number of other units, I was so pleased with this model I bought a second one.As will all ultrasonic units, if you have a lot of calcium in your water, it will put it up into the air, and you will get a white dust in the area. Softened or filtered water should help solve that.It doesn't turn off when you remove the tank, unlike a lot of other models, so make sure to turn it off when refilling, otherwise the area around the unit will be soaked when you get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within one year","review":"I bought this because I would not need to worry about filter changes. I was pretty happy with it last year, stored it for the summer and took it back out this week. Unfortunately, the fan works but it no longer blows mist. For $45, it should have worked for more than one winter. I will look for another brand this time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice looking product with one fatal flaw, impossible to fill easily","review":"There are other brands that are identical to this design.I purchased this humidifier because it is simple and energy efficient. However, it has one fatal product design issue. The water tank is oriented on the vertical as tall tank rather than as a square lower tank.This means that unless you have a deep deep sink (industrial) or fill the tank at the kitchen sink using the pull out hose or facet, you will not fit this tall tank under most bath or kitchen sinks to fill it.To make matters worse, even if you fill it in the kitchen, the opening to fill it is on the bottom (this is normal) but if you invert it to remove the fill cap, the top (which is now the bottom for filling) is not flat. You cannot rest it on the counter.It is just impossible to fill conveniently!I returned mine and went with a model that I could set on the counter to fill at the kitchen. It is not as pretty as this one but much easier to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"this hair dryer is a great value for the cost. i have been looking for a hair dryer with a longer cord for months now. this one is 8 ft long. i loved it so much i ordered another one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why read this book?","review":"Why would you want to subject yourself to the opinions of someone who is so easily swayed by gifts and kick backs. This book stands as testament and evidence that Mr.Knowles has terrible bias in his reviews and rates his reviews more on what freebies he gets from a film, rather than the movies true merits.

His site has become a portal of industry power through sheer luck and and shrewd, subtle marketing. His reviews are approximately 75% travelogue of his day's gripping journey from his house to the theatre, and 25% 'review'. I can't imagine any of these critiques being of any interest to anyone but his therapist, as he egomaniacly slams movies based on genre, his petty hatred of an actor, or the fact that he was tired that day.

Obviously, a little far from Laughing On Judgement Day and Behind Closed Doors; but still it shows that the band is one of the most consistent at present. Not to forget the fact that during the last 9 years, between studios, lives and compilations, Thunder released 15 albums!It's a pity that the album title is inappropriate and front cover is really ridiculous.

They required entirely too much arithmetic to be useful before the age of computers. But with computers the whole concept of fractals became something that could indeed be studied.A bit of time goes by and all of a sudden the people doing fractals begin to discover that using the right kind of mathematics can be used to produce a lot of images that begin to look like things in nature. These drawings began to look like things such as trees, mountains, clouds, explosions. And all of a sudden there was an interest beyond those of the mathematician just drawing cute geometric patterns, it's called game development.This book is not on gaming, it's on the basics of fracticals. It includes software to generate fractals, and it gives the mathematics of how these fractals are created.

Driving drums, energetic guitars, shimmering keyboards and Ms Wilde's still unpolished but beautifully urgent voice of youth are fused together in a mercifully no-nonsense production package, its simplicity making it still sound surprisingly undated and fresh as the day 25 years ago (crikey!) when I first listened to it. It easily kicks her later glossy and overproduced material into touch and as a representative of sing-along ballads and big tunes it still stands the test of time. Not an all-time classic, but if you're unembarrassed about music and like it driven and urgent it's certainly worth risking your hard-earned for it.

A must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superhuman singing","review":"Sutherland and Pavarotti and the two greatest singers of this and any century. This is their prime! This is their best work. 1966 is the year. And Dame Joan has such a fresh and clear dramatic coloratura soprano voice. And she can do anything she wants to with it. A high D here, an E there. And so many high Cs that one loses count. The coloratura and trills are stunning. At one cadenza she goes to a E above high C. And she also holds I think 5 high E flats in the opera. That's the High E flat above high C. Pavarotti has that 9 high Cs in one aria. This is the best \\"Fille\\" around. And it's recorded in great stereo sound. The best rendition of a bel canto comic opera I've got.Highest recommendations."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's all the fuss about?","review":"Once again I've made a mistake: listening to Sutherland fans praise her recordings to such heights, I thought \\"they really gotta be good!\\" Alas, this recording of Fille is absolute junk. The opera's supposed to be funny and hence vocal acting is very, very, very important. And Sutherland never, ever sang with emotions. She sounds the same no matter what she sings, and it's no different with this recording. Sutherland is so dull, it's not funny. She ruined this opera. You can sing the stuff, but what good is it if you can't act (vocally)? I recommend other recordings, such as Beverly Sills' unbeatable live recording on the Opera D'Oro label. Once you get past the \\"live sound\\", it's 10-star material. Incredible coloratura, with extra flourishes and ornamentation, and it's funny! Unlike this dull, expensive set.

What you hear is a barely recognizable Sutherland sound. The Decca cd set with Sutherland/Horne is the one to get, believe me. Sutherland and Horne were dropped dead gorgeous in their 1960's definitive Norma. If you choose to buy this set because Caballe is Adagisa, be warned that the two divas sound very boring and tired. All of Sutheland's famous high notes are completely gone, even her trill and colortura runs are inaccurate. Please, I'm Sutherland's biggest fan, that's why I'm telling you how it really is. This Norma is a disaster. Remember though, the Sutherland's earlier Norma with Marilyn Horne is a real gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this get released?","review":"Sutherland's performance in the first act was shockingly inept. It was painful to listen to her struggle vainly to reach the notes, to pronounce the text. Her desperate, ineffectual efforts to sing the role brought tears to my eyes. Could not her husband have set down his baton, given back their fees, and refused to go on? Could noone have squelched this release, out of respect for her? Caballé and Pavarotti are in good voice and Caballé makes the wimpy Adelgesa a suddenly compelling role. However, Sutherland deserves not to have been disrespected in this way. It made me furious for her. The masters should have been burned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"If you want to hear Sub Par singing in this gorgeous opera purchase this set.

Studio recording or live from La Scala. Those are ultimate Normas."},{"rating":"2","title":"20 years after her 1st recorded Norma, Joan still great","review":"Sutherland's first recording of Norma remains one of the definitive recordings of bel-canto. She was just unsurpassed by any other singers of this century, or maybe even EVERY century, I guess we'll never know. But this recording was made 20 years after the diva's first recording, and what she had lost in voice she made up with pure passion! Sutherland's technique still incredible, though the high notes are not as good as those in her prime, and the vibrato a little wide. Even past her prime, La Stupenda is still far superior to all other Normas, including Callas. Pavorotti and Caballe were excellent, but their stars are eclipsed by Sutherland's, of course."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is much less than should be expected.","review":"Unfortunately, this recording was made from behind the conductor in orchestra, rather than on stage.

I'm sure I'll get a lot of insults for telling it as it is, but she is just awful here. For a great Prima Donna to admit that she's lost it, I know it's hard, but she has definitely lost it here.

He was especially uninformed about Ulysses S. Grant, who was (to put it mildly) a pivotal player in the year 1863. Curious, I bit the bullet and bought the book. A mistake of the highest order!After reading the book, I am more convinced than ever that Stevens had no business writing this book. His interpretations of Lincoln, Grant and Hooker are amateurish and riddled with mistakes of the most elementary nature.

The second act opens with a sentry commenting on how party loyalties make it unnecessary for politicians to have any brains at all when it comes to voting; and this is followed soon after by a song about how those who govern do best when they do not meddle \\"in matters which they do not understand.\\" Good advice for bureaucrats who know how to run hospitals, schools, and private behavior. For once, you might not want to program out the dialogue...which is not given separate tracking so you could not do it anyway. A real treat for those who never heard IOLANTHE and the only recording with the complete dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Next Level","review":"New instructors in this video. Not why they switched from Tiffiny to Angel, but the instruction is still top notch. This vid was shot in a new location, and the aerials are even bigger and more impressive.I wanted to take my swing dance to the next level after watching movies like Swing Kids, but didn't know where to start. This gave me a leap start into the world of aerial dance moves. Though definitely not for beginners, Daniel and Angel break each move down, address safety concerns and make the execution easy. This series teaches to many moves, and the instruction is so in depth, I can't believe it doesn't cost more than it does. I go back from time to time to brush up on moves, or how to make them cleaner and present better. Highly suggest all the videos in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes!","review":"Dan is a favorite instructor and dancer in here Seattle and is great at explaining difficult concepts in a way that is clear for both beginning and experienced dancers.

I missed about the first 15 minutes of it, and I just had to see what happened. I think Marilyn Monroe looked stunning, and I am surprised it wasn't a phenominal success. The movie itself has a wonderful-romantic story line to it. It's one of my favorite classic movies by Miss Monroe.The Story is about a Mother and Daughter dancers. Marilyn becames, forgive me if i dont' spell it correctly the \\"Burless\\" Queen and she meets a man who falls head over heels in love with her. Marilyns Mom is worried and confronts the boy that if he wants to marry her to please discuss it with his mother, so there isn't any problems.

It's a great concept and works well, but it should not be up to the consumer to correct the quality issues as sold by the manufacturer.In short: the world's softest, crappiest screws are included in the box for installation.It was all too easy to strip the the screw heads when installing and one actually sheared itself in half when about halfway in. Yikes. Luckily I had some very high strength SPAX wood screws on hand (each good for 400lbs) that were easily used in place of the those provided.Without the poor screws I would rate this Bike Lift 4 or 5 stars but if I have to supply my own parts and move a lift to a different location because there's already a broken screw in the desired truss I'm knocking it waaaay down---particularly because quality screws are available so inexpensively.I would recommend this product as long you provide your own screws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great space saver","review":"I do not have enough space it my garage.

The brackets weigh a pound a piece and there is no easy way to install. They kept falling on my head. I tried pre drilling the holes, but how can a person try to screw in a screw while also holding this one pound bracket straight.

I would recommend measuring your ceiling to make sure your car will fit under when your bike is raised because I was surprised with our high garage ceiling how low the bike is (I can barely walk under it).

Well made, finish is great, well designed, and delivered on time. It deserves a nearly perfect score. The only problem is, there should be better instructions for the layout, AND suggestions on how to handle ceiling mounting without studs close to the desired mounting area.Fortunately I am reasonably good at pre-visualize practical clearance issues, and did well in solid geometry. Without those skills, it would have been a very difficult install. For example, how far away from a wall would they recommend mounting this, due to handlebar clearance issues? What about double mounting for 2 bikes? I had several re-mounts because I had guessed wrong on the latter.Like I said, a great product, but be sure to think out actual fitment BEFORE you start mounting this.

I wasn't able to find the studs in my ceiling so I installed 2 additional screws (for a total of 4) in each of the 2 pieces that attach to the ceiling. So far, no problems. The lift seems sturdy. The rope that's provided is very long but I have a short ceiling so I'll have more leftover rope than others. This is a very simple product with simple parts but works as intended. The instructions are not as clear as they could be but overall it was a simple installation; you just have to take your measurements carefully before you start installing the pieces to the ceiling. Some common sense is involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Okay so I am using it to hang a kayak (34 lbs) from the ceiling of my garage. Just putting the hooks into the handles on either end and i works seamlessly. I especially like the automatic locking feature on the last pulley. It makes it so easy to pull up by yourself. Super easy to lower right onto the rack on the car, and when I get back just pull right back up. No need to drag the boat out from under the house (where I used to keep it) and lug it to the driveway and have to heave it to the center of the car. (out of breath just thinking about it) Really makes me want to get on the water more because it is just so easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bike hoist for its price","review":"The hoist was easy to install and great to use. I've reclaimed all the wall space to mount cabinets and shelves (I had 6 bikes on the wall). The only complaint I have is the rubber coating on the hooks split right away, which then exposed the bare metal and can potentially scatch the handlebars (my handlebars are carbon)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not only for bikes...for kayaks too!!","review":"I bought this on sale for $19 thinking that if it didn't work for my kayak, I'd use it for my bike and there would be harm done. Well, this thing is perfect for the kayak. Sure, there aren't hydraulic lifts or anything to help you lift it so it takes some effort, but for $19, who can complain?! The only modification for lifting the kayak was turning the hooks 180 degrees so that they face outward.We installed the lift above and perpendicular to the girders so that the kayak could be flush with the ceiling.

This lift was installed in less than 30 minutes in a drywall over plaster ceiling using a combination of toggle bolts and spiral anchors and the duty rating of this particular installation far exceeds the 50lb capacity of the lift. The two mounting plates have 10 holes apiece which should give plenty of flexibility when trying to locate studs. This design allows you to hang your bike without putting any stress on the wheels as all of the wall mounted storage options seem to do. If you need an inexpensive way to protect you investment and free up some floor space this is the rack for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"This item does what it says. There is plenty of leverage to lift bikes with ease. I guess they beefed up the ropes from earlier versions cuz they seem plenty strong to me. I did mount the units on a 6\\" wide piece of pine first so I wouldn't need to worry as much about hitting studs in the roof (which is impossible to hit with every screw because the screw holes are wider than a stud.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Racor Ceiling Mounted Bike Lifts","review":"I have a garage with tall ceilings and really needed a solution to get my wife and kids' bikes out of the way. Wall space is already at a premium and hooks on the ceilings were not gonna cut it. Finding this product made my day. Plus it uses pulleys. How cool is that. The pulley is by far the coolest of the simple machines!!!! It was pretty easy and straight forward to install and the price (mine happened to have free shipping) could not be beat.

It does a very nice job of providing smooth access to my bike without taking up floor space in my garage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the way","review":"This is a product.

It completely leaves out any discussion of A-Records, MX-Records, NS-Records, and PTR-Records. Is very weak on DNS & DHCP IMPORTING of databases, and adding licenses later.

The text is consise and easy to follow. Definetly a good inorganic text book. I can not say it's better than any other inorganic textbook because I've only used this one. But if it means anything, I didn't sell this one back at the end of the year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Undergrads","review":"I would not recommend this book for undergraduate students, especially those in their first inorganic class. It is hard to understand because it is not clear & it does not define unfamiliar terms. Also, it is very math oriented and usually in first-level classes concepts rather than math are focused on. When I was taking my inorganic class I referred much more to my General Chem book than to this one. This book also does not have any answers to problem sets in the back, so it is hard to practice the concepts unless a Solutions manual is purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good...if you know what you're getting into...","review":"One must look at this book from the standpoint of the authors. This book is written from a symmetry and point-group standpoint. Having met the authors, I learned that the symmetry and point-group chapter (3?) was written first, then everything thereafter came from that. Also, this was NEVER meant to be a comprehensive textbook. It's designed to be used for a 1 semester course. What is excellent is that the basics are taught really well (the point-group stuff, and the ligand-field theory chapter) and that there are literature references to almost all topics in the book. If you feel like you don't get it, this book faciliates extended learning by pointing the reader to primary resources. If you like learning and have a good prof, this is a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book.","review":"This is a college textbook, its point which is to inform, not entertain. Also, by the time you take an inorganic chemistry course you should have, at the least, four semesters of college-level chemistry under your belt, and much of the topics are expanded upon from general chemistry. If you find this textbook too hard to read, well, I hope you never go to graduate school.The book lacks pictures and diagrams, and is rather dry, but it is meant for college juniors and seniors. I do not have any other inorganic textbooks to compare this edition to, but in my opinion, in comparison to other science and math textbooks I have used, including gen. chem. and orgo, this book is solid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gaps","review":"This is my first review of a book in Amazon. The problems in the book do not always illustrate the concepts that are presented in the chapters. Some of the concepts (and their corresponding examples) could certainly have been more elaborated with more steps and reasoning (i.e. contour maps, and radial distributions). The problems are redundant and tedious (i.e. there will be three to five problems out of forty that go over the same concept without going much in depth). And lastly, the book is oddly organized (i.e. quantum numbers are introduced at the beginning of the book and not talked about until Chapter 11, where they pop up again for multi-electron atoms). In summary, if you are an undergraduate student do not use this book as your main learning reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good Inorganic chemistry text","review":"I am a chemistry major and have used this book for both semesters of Inorganic chemistry. If you have had quantum mechanics prior to reading this book it may be more helpful. However the extensive reference to point-groups and character tables is way overdone, only because the book does a horrible job of explaining point-groups and the creation of character tables. Our prof had to constantly omit sections from the book because it often overcomplicated many concepts.This book was far more helpful the second semester inorganic where the constant reference to point groups decreased somewhat. The concepts explained in the second half were also much more readable.Needless to say this was one of the few chemistry texts I have sold back, since I know I can find other more useful texts as references."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Dense for Undergrads","review":"This textbook is a paradigm in the art of conciseness: while I admire Miessler and Tarr's ability to convey the massive amount of every chapter in so few pages, it makes for extraordinarily difficult. My professor thought this would be a useful text to cover our introductory class, as it does not waste time on basic information on periodicity, etc. However, after a few weeks of telling us what not to read (as it was far too abstruse), and resorting to other textbooks, she had to give up altogether on this one. I imagine this work's chief usefulness will come to graduate students needing a \\"refresher\\", but not to anyone else. There are too few grainy pictures, questions that rarely relate to the material in the chapter, and a text whose density rivals the Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst college chemistry book I have read","review":"This was the worst college chemistry textbook that I have encountered. I have taken gen chem, organic, analytical, physical, biochem, photochem, and inorganic. This book was poorly written and extremely bland in terms of the pages. The sections of each chapter feel like they should be their own chapter in itself because the authors go on and on and on without stopping. And once you get to the next section, its a blunt start. There's little continuity between sections. Each page has little to offer in terms of supporting diagrams and tables. In addition, the examples given are not explained and consequently do nothing to help the reader's understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brevity at the expense of clarity","review":"The answer key was often unhelpful, as it abbreviates or omits many parts that are key to understanding a solution. I found that the practice problems I could do from the textbook were limited by the answers I could actually follow. It is an exercise in understanding the authors' trains of thought, rather than the actual chemistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did you ever think you'd find a book with TOO MUCH nudity?","review":"This book is positively fascinating for about the first half. You find out about the \\"nude dance\\" craze of the Weimar Republic and the dancers/dances/movements it inspired.However, Toepfer's work is SO complete, SO intricate, it comes off more like a doctoral thesis than a book.As pure reportage, it's a fine volume. But I kept waiting for some kind of idea of what the author thought about all of this; was it fascinating or does he just think it was weird? We never really find out.Still, some of the images he leaves you with makes you wish you could transport yourself back to some of these obviously sensual and often bizarre performances to see them for yourself.If you're a fan of dance history, or a nudist, I recommend this book. But don't be surprised if you put it down long before you finish; this is definitely more than most people would really want (or need) to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as well rounded as I hoped","review":"Though I agree with other reviewers about the splendid Narnia book summaries, overall I felt this book was not written in a manner fitting a scholarly book. Nor did it provide provide the well-rounded symbolic interpreation I was hoping for. I'm not saying I could do better (and it did make me ponder several biblical sybolic ideologies) but in general, it seemed the same citations appeared throughout the book -- almost to the point of redundancy -- and book was too focused on biblical themes, not a \\"guide thorugh Narnia\\" per se. I was hoping for something with more rounded interpretation and meaning of Lewis' world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and boring","review":"I wanted to read this because, on the whole, I love the Narnia books but I could only get through about half of it and the rest I skimmed through.

It is a habit I have gotten into thanks to Sundazed reissuing lots of great albums beforehand; this isn't one of those albums.There is very little coherency to this jarbled mix of sound effects, random lyrics and horrendous singing,{if you can call it that}.

A lot of the dialogue was bland as well. There should have been more sex scenes and older women in this too. They followed a pathetic single guy around and it was boring. He gets propositioned for sex the first day that he is ther by a decent looking woman who says that she likes his penis.

Yet, this book fails to even touch upon the surface of Islamic mysticism. It rather seems like the unintelligible ramblings of someone who knows little to nothing about the path. Save your money. Better spent on other books written by true scholars and philosophers."},{"rating":"1","title":"the fragrance STINKS","review":"What a horrible representation of Sufism and Islam. It appears as if this book was written by a three year old. Absolutely NO intelligent coherence or spiritual significance AT ALL.

Thank you Amazon for having this available."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice music - very bad CD","review":"The CDs appear to have some kind of copy protection which prevents them from playing properly in all CD players. For example, they do not play correctly on my computer but they do play in my home stereo system. I have read that copy protection systems will prevent a CD from playing in computers as well as some types of car stereos and portables. I did not check to find out if it will play in my car stereo and my portable CD player.This is not acceptable to me because I often use my computer for casual listening. I also make a \\"car copy\\" of any CD that I use in my car stereo and this CD cannot be copied with my computer.Although the music is every bit as good as the others reviewers have said, I have returned this recording, and one other new London recording which had the same problems, because I do not want to be restricted in the equipment that I use for listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sutherland is horrible!!!","review":"How anyone can say Sutherland is a \\"10\\" Turandot and Nilsson an \\"8\\" Turandot is beyond me. Sutherland is anemic when compared to Nilsson. Also, Sutherland never sang the ice princess on stage. Nilsson did many times. The rest of the cast and the conductor are great. This set loses only because of the miscast soprano in the title role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Turandot on record","review":"As an retired opera singer, I must say I adore this recording. To have heard Sutherland LIVE, I must say that Sutherland had the weight of voice to sing Turandot, and of course she has a far more beautiful voice then Nilsson. She really truimphs in this legendary recording, and her supporting cast is remarkable also. There is no better Calaf than Pavorotti, and Caballe's Liu is tear jerking. Buy this NOW."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, to dismiss Nilsson like that!","review":"Saying Nilsson shows no emotions at all as Turandot is a LIE. She is ice-cold in \\"In questa reggia\\", but melts very believably in the love duet. For the role of Turandot, it matters very much if the soprano in the title role in a recording of the opera has or has not sung the role on stage. Nilsson is in a class by herself as Turandot. For her, the high tessitura is child's play. Sutherland can definitely sing in higher tessituras than that of Turandot's, but she is not the ideal Turandot. Who says that a Turandot is supposed to have a beautiful soprano voice? That is not a pre-requisite for an ideal Turandot. Nilsson's voice is just as distinctive as Sutherland's and her high C's are just as powerful. She is the best Turandot on records. Those of you who bash her in the role are just ignorant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"A super tour de force for the three superstars of opera, Pavarotti, Sutherland, Caballe. The best Turandot in a field of formitable competition. But this one is the standard by which all other Turandots will be judged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hype","review":"I do not understand all the hype about this set. No doubt the media have fueled the Pavarotti fire. However, the tenor from Modena will return to his actual size after you have listened to Franco Corelli in the EMI set. Enough said about Sutherland as Turandot -beautiful voice, but fish out of water. Caballe is at her prime here, though, raising my rating to a grand total of 2 stars instead of 1. Go get Nilsson/Molinari-Pradelli's !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrid soprano in the title role!!!","review":"Nilsson is the ultimate Turandot. Her voice is a hydrogen bomb dropping on a nuclear power plant. Sutherland's weak, anemic voice is a disgrace to all other recorded Turandots. Sutherland should take up needlepoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, why does Pavarotti do this to his career?","review":"Why would a singer that had some great, even some monumental recordings under his belt (Fille du Regiment) do something like this? Oh, I know, money.Luciano Pavarotti was blessed with a great voice, but NOT a voice for singing Calaf. If you want to know how Puccini wanted his Calaf to sound find a recording of Giacomo Lauri Volpi or one of Franco Corelli. Fleta did the opening night of this Puccini's swan song, but he was wise enough not to sing it again (no recordings of Fleta on this role are available); I wish Pavarotti and other singers would have learned a lesson from Miguel Fleta."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the ultimate performance","review":"Granted that Eva Marton and Placido Domingo are the ultimate VISUAL performance of Turandot, Sutherland/Pavarotti may be the ultimate vocal performance, particularly the last scene of ACT III.This CD is well worth buying. Indeed, don't be without it if you are a Turandot lover.JD in Washington state."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pavorotti is marvalous............","review":"Joan Sutherland gives an intensely revealing and appealing interpretation, making the icy princess far more human and sympathetic than ever before, while Pavorotti gives a performance equally imaginative, beautiful in souund, strong on detail. To set Caballe against Sutherland was a daring idea, and it works superby well; Pears as the Emperor is another imaginative choice. Mehta directs a gloriously rich and dramatic performance, superlatively recorded, still the best sounding \\"Turandot\\" on CD, while the reading also remains supreme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"This is a wonderful Ball-Hope movie that takes a serious, yet often humerous, look at relationships.

La Sutherland is incomprehensible, not a word is clear and sounds too old for Adina. The Belcore and Dulcamara are best forgotten. There are plenty of fine Elixirs, including the earlier DECCA recording with Di Stefano and Gueden. Another glorious rendition is Luigi Alva's with Serafin in EMI, which by the way has the finest Dulcamara and Belcore ever in Giuseppe Taddei and Rolando Panerai. But if you want an excellent modern recording go for Alagna's first try in ERATO, now at mid-price. Alagna pre-hype was fresh and winning, lovely voice sweet personality. But the real star of that recording is soprano Mariella Devia, the finest coloratura around.

Instead this book covers the same basic topics in any lawn book with no extra helpful advice. In fact, in many cases the information was not as detailed as other books.Several of the tips have nothing to do with being a home lawn owner. For example, one tip suggests using a certain enhancing chemical. When I looked up the chemical, it turned out it is only available to professionals and actually costs hundreds of dollars per gallon. How does that help me at home?? In another example tip given, a groundskeeper talks about re-soding after games.

I was a little disappointed in the lack of singing, and the lead singer hadn't refined his skills like he had in the other two albums. Overall it's a decent album, especially if you already like Dredg. Lechium and Yatahaze are both great songs, and make the album worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely remakable","review":"There are two things you must realize before sinking into this album... one, is that this is Dredg's debut album... and two, Dredg are young. If Dredg were 40 year olds on their 12th album, this would still impress me. Nothing is more exciting for me than to listen to this album and El Cielo (buy that too) and think about what they will bring us with their next album, and for the rest of their musical careers. To say that the music that these guys put out is impressive is a massive understatement. They have what only precious few bands have out there... restraint. They aren't about balls out rock. They are about texture, suspense, and creating something that has yet to be created. This album has both heavy parts and light parts, yet all of them are meticulously placed and well crafted. Listening to this album and El Cielo will really make you wonder where these guys are going next. Keep a close, close eye on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Auditory Orgasm Pt. 1","review":"This album is proof that MTV, and radio stations a like are left in the dark when it comes to truly brilliant, innovative, original, and wholly utopian music.

There is no bad song on this CD, each one, rather than tainting their style with obvious lyrics and simple melodies, instead incorporates seemingly raw emotion, each song takes you on a journey through emotion rather than blaring superficial tendancies into your ears; thus I highly recommend this CD to ANYONE who likes *perfect music."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd love this band even if they weren't from my hometown.","review":"Simply some of the best music around.

This album is average at best. All the songs sound shallow and fake. The guitar is repetetive and the bass player is flat out boring. Dino is decent on the drums, but by no means above average for a profesional musician.

I put this cd in expecting something really slow and indie, but was extremely pleased to find all the raw emotion that I love about my music, without all the banging and screaming. The percusions on this album are what make it. The raw emotion and power of dredg rival that of Sunny Day Real Estate. Everytime I listen to this album, I'm reminded of SDRE's \\"Diary\\". Not necessarily in the writing style or the vocals, but in the energy that is put into the music. It's obvious that these guys didn't just go into the studio and record the whole album in three days. Time was put into this album. After listening to the album you're left with the feeling that you've just listened to something greater than you thought could ever be accomplished. That's what makes this album great. This is one of my favorite albums. Highly recomended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leitmotif is a good explanation","review":"Surprising music they make! I think the album title was cleverly chosen since a Leitmotif is a pattern that is repeted. That is how their music is created too.I like the presence of the drum. Guitar is nice, especially in song \\"Movement II\\", it's like a slanging match between a man (singer) and a woman (guitar) but I find the distortion destroys it a bit. I like when they're playing with effects like in \\"Movement IV\\", cool delay there.The lost star on the rating is because of this:Singing is strange to extremes. Sometimes he screams (luckily, the mic is pretty far from singer) or it is only background noise from which you can reconized words here and there. Please don't compare his singing to Maynard James Keenan, Keenan's voice is so much more.I hate when they use distortion on the guitar. They should get away from that. It does not fit with the rest of the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOLY @#*@!!!!!","review":"A good friend of mine told me I should check out this band. I did not know what I was getting myself into. I have not even listened to the whole album yet... I cannot seem to get through the first 5 songs, I just keep playing it over and over and over. Simply amazing. This is a very raw album. Not alot of mixing or studio polish here. And that is a good thing. The band is open to express and boy do they ever. Bursting at the seams with passion and expression. This is some of the most emotionally intense music I have heard in a long time.Electric guitars strummed by masterfull fingers, it has almost a latin quality to it, very exotic riffs, with excellent drums and a lead singer who gets his point accross. I can barely understand the lyrics to the songs but I feel him anyway, its not the words but the sound of his voice. Alot of the songs merge into each other beautifully. If this album does not touch your spirit, nothing will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutly Amazing","review":"This cd is one of my favorites. the sound that comes from this band is surely not like anyone else. This band needs to be recognized"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Next Morning Never Quite Dawned","review":"The Next Morning were a Jimi Hendrix adoring band, and boy is it evident in their music. This cd contains only 8 tracks so you've got to figure at least 4 are good right? Not exactly. While I'll admit the title song kicks some serious booty as does \\"Changes Of The Mind\\", these guys were too hard rocking for their own good. All the remaining songs, while not fair to be called fillers, are sort of pointless. \\"Adelane\\" left me shaking my head and hoping for that time to come back. The vocals are nice, if too Hendrixy, and the guitar is some roaring stuff. 2 stars for the 2 songs about sums this one up, though it should be noted Sundazed, the company who reissued this, was at peak form on this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product ++++Super Price","review":"I just bought this item and really it sucks. Speakers r horrible. If u wanna waste money, GO FOR IT. I really recommend this product to those who have excess $$$$$ to spend."},{"rating":"2","title":"This recording is spellbinding.","review":"Sir Georg Solti and the Chicago Symphony are at the absolute height of their powers in this phenomenal recording from 1971. This is (no exaggeration) surely one of the most incredibly accurate and exhilirating orchestral performances put on disk, and the soloists (including masters like Lucia Popp and Arleen Auger) could not have been bettered. This is one of my most treasured disks, and it makes the piece sound like one of the great choral/orchestral works of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buffs nails, but not super high gloss shine","review":"I had gotten accosted by someone at a mall that had one of these types of buffers. It really did leave a high gloss shine on my nails, but was very expensive. I hoped to find a cheaper one and when I saw this, I thought it was it. It wasn't.The gloss isn't the super high gloss shine that I had gotten from the mall merchant. In addition, it started to shred almost upon contact with my nail when I started to buff it. I do not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like the one at the mall","review":"This buffer got the same shine on my nails as from the pushy salesman at the mall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was looking for some shine","review":"I purchased this product because it said it would make my nails shine, like other products I tried at a kiosk at a mall. I didn't do it at all, unless I buffed and buffed until my nail was on fire. If you're not looking for the natural shine look, it's a fine buffer for under nail polish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"i wanted to do an at home french manicure so i bought this. when i went to file my nail, my nail made sliced into the side of it. it did smooth the top of my nail, but i was still upset that i had to use another filer to shape my nails. i previously bought one of another brand that was much better and was dissapointed with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sherrill Milnes conquers","review":"Not even a live performance can match this one. Anything Sherrill Milnes does is perfection for me. He's one of a kind that will NEVER BE SEEN AGAIN."},{"rating":"2","title":"stellar cast","review":"Oh, my, Joan Sutherland, Luciano Pavarotti, Sherrill Milnes. What can I say? The best of the best. Sutherland is marvelous as Gilda, gorgeous tones and lots of death defying attacks of coloratura. Only problem is that, with a voice that beautiful, why would the duke choose the mezzo over her? Luciano is beyond praise. His voice is so fresh and free. It rings clear like a bell, especially when he hits those signature high notes. You, Pavarotti fans, MUST hear him as the duke. This is one of the king of tenors finest roles. Sherrill Milnes is a true rarity. He is a baritone that has no problems with the tenor tessitura. He throws a few high b flats here, and they are flawless. He really should have tried a career as a heldentenor. As a result of these three quintessential opera singers, this rigoletto is among my favorite opera recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essencial Rigoletto","review":"If someone wants to know what opera is about, then this is the first one to hear.Rigoletto is a very beautiful opera, with a wonderful story.First we have Milnes as Rigoletto. He is in top form and makes us fill his sadness and the terrible \\"Malidicione\\".Pavarotti is my favorite \\"Duca\\". The high D at the end of \\"Possente Amor\\" makes me think how can he goes so high.The point of discussion in many of the reviews is Dame Joan Sutherland's Gilda. Sutherland is a \\"big girl\\" with a supreme voice and the best technique ever, and Gilda is a delicate young girl. Of course Callas fans allways put down Sutherland, and vice-versa. So Sutherland has the voice and Callas the acting skills. I personly prefer Sutherland's Gilda over Callas, but thats only my opinion. I think them both deserve the Voice of XX century title."},{"rating":"1","title":"great music - bad CD","review":"The CDs appear to have some kind of copy protection which prevents them from playing properly in all CD players. For example, they do not play correctly on my computer but they do play in my home stereo system. I have read that copy protection systems will prevent a CD from playing in computers as well as some types of car stereos and portables. I did not check to find out if it will play in my car stereo and my portable CD player.This is not acceptable to me because I often use my computer for casual listening. I also make a \\"car copy\\" of any CD that I use in my car stereo and this CD cannot be copied with my computer.Although the music is every bit as good as the others reviewers have said, I have returned this recording, and one other new London recording which had the same problems, because I do not want to be restricted in the equipment that I use for listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quite good interpretation, but not perfect","review":"There is no doubt that this Rigoletto is a very pleasant Opera. Nevertheless, I am surprised to see that everybody put 5 stars to this recording which is described as if it were the perfect interpretation.Indeed, the performance of Callas, Gobbi, Di Stefano and Serafin is really the only one that deserves five stars. The characterisation is so deeper, the voices are such more powerful than they are in Bonynge one, sensitive and beautiful that I think that the reason why all these rewiewers put five stars is only because they have never listened to this perfect Rigoletto of 1955."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Twist on UNO","review":"Bought this game for my six year old and she absolutely loves it. We've played it every morning since christmas morning. It's a great twist to the regular UNO game. Downfall I would say is that if you go to the recommended 500 points it takes quite a while and gets to be too drawn out for little kids. Overall it is fun and helps my daughters with their adding since I make them add their points up in their hands at the end of the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Game, Hard on older eyes","review":"This is a really fun game, with a great pace. In the beginning it was difficult to distinguish the spin cards from the normal cards, but now that I know what they look like, they are easy to spot. It is a spin on the classic uno games, but seems to go a bit faster and keeps the attention span of younger children. Great game for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uno Spin","review":"Not much fun for two players...... More than two players might be more fun & exciting. Played twice, never used the spin....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great twist on a classic, but packaging disappointing","review":"Uno Spin adds a few fun twists on the original game. This makes it fresh and interesting for the whole family. My only concern is that the packaging is made to throw away. It is a plastic blister pack thingy not meant to store the toy. What I mean is that there is no box with it, and I have a hard time keeping the cards and game board together. This is unfortunate because the game is otherwise a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, But Not As Good As It Could Be--3.5 Stars","review":"I bought this for my son, age six, as a Christmas gift. We have played it a couple of times, and it is fun. However, I don't like the fact that the whole game can turn on one spin. For example, when you spin, there is a chance that you could end up having to trade all of your cards with somebody else. That's just not right. Especially when one of you has whittled down to only one or two cards and the other may have ten cards in his hand. I like the idea of this game, but some of the spins are just too goofy, and take away from the fun of the game instead of add to it.I love the original UNO game, and I think this one is okay. My son likes it more than I do, so that's why I am giving this four stars instead of three.Also, the box that it comes in is useless for game storage. That should have been designed better. Should probably take off a star for that, too."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"card-container"},R=["disabled"],H={key:0},B={key:1};function x(o,e,n,u,s,r){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",N,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(r.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[s.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",H,"See more"))],8,R)):b("",!0)])}const M=d(C,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-3a3f86b0"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/26.md","filePath":"sponsor/26.md"}'),P={name:"sponsor/26.md"},j=Object.assign(P,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(M)]))}});export{W as __pageData,j as default};
