Perhaps the information in this book can be found on the Amazon.com website as other reviewers have noted, but if so I couldn't find it and felt the $17 price tag was well worth it. The book covers many different methods of selling on Amazon.com, including auctions, zShop, and Marketplace, along with advertising, the Associates program and the Advantage program. The one glaring omission as far as I was concerned (and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) was shipping.

Truly, this is for \\"dummies\\" only.I hope this doesn't sound tongue-in-cheeck - I'm really trying to be sincere.

Most of the patterns are for the home, but there are patterns for a house coat, gown, and baby sweater.

The use of simple stitches in a variety of ways for a variety of projects is unusual in this day of overly intricate patterns.

However, there's so much going on -- the impending marriage of main character Melanie's brother and ravishing trainer Bertie (short for Alberta), the reappearance of Melanie's ex-husband, the move into judging for Aunt Peg, \\"finishing\\" Melanie's poodle's championship -- that the mystery seems more of an afterthought than the main event. Also, there's not much mystery -- the pointers to the guilty parties are pretty pointed.

An outstanding supporting cast really gives this one a boost. Floyd Crosby and Alex Phillips offer up some terrific location photography, and Alex North provides a rich musical background. Robert Parrish directs with customary skill.The DVD-R provides a nicely saturated, anamorphic presentation at the correct 1:66 to 1 ratio. The sound is 2.0 monophonic. Grain structure and image sharpening are evident, but the presentation is a fine one for a film that mostly surfaces only on TCM. There is a non-anamorphic, region-2 Spanish dvd that can now be considered obsolete. Fans of this film should be happy with this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent western","review":"Robert Mitchum is perfect for the role of the American pistolero working for a powerful Mexicanfamily. The story is a fascinating account of how an American who fled across the border returnsto find that his earlier transgression as a young boy no longer prevent him from staying in theUnited States, and serving as a Texas Ranger. However, the story is deeper than it seems becauseit is filled with different messages about love, loyalty, and discrimination. The way Mitchummouths the term \\"Gringo\\" to Gary Merrill connotes the dislike Mexicans have for ugly Americans.This is an overlooked film that requires careful attention to the rich texture of the images andcolors that divide cultures and people. It is also an engaging film in which Mitchum's actingreveals the way a man wrestles with identity, loyalty, and love before making a decision on whohe is."},{"rating":"2","title":"its Robert Mitchum","review":"Another great western by the great Robert Mitchum.

The black plastic inserts fell out immediately, no matter which way we tried to tilt it while opening, making the already-flimsy case completely useless. Less than $5 worth of supplies were inside ~ save your money and buy them separately and put them in a shoebox, it will work better and last longer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This is a huge waste of money. This set basically a few crayons (I think 8), colored poencils, white out, small scissors; just VERY basic scool supplies that you can purchase at Wal Mart for about $4.00 at back to school time. Also, this has a fancy looking organizer on the inside of the package, but when you open the box, the liners fall out, as well as the markers and crayons. You'd be better off having separate boxes of crayons, etc. which would take up much less space than this piece of junk. My kids lost interest almost immediately when it didn't stay together, the items didn't stay in their organizers, and they discovered there was NOTHING special inside this box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also disappointed","review":"I am also VERY disappointed in this case!!! My son excitedly picked this out and I thought it would be PERFECT for him to keep all his supplies together and he would be able to carry it out to use any time. Well, like everyone else has already said....the parts inside that hold all the crayons, pencils, etc, do not attach to the actual red case so every time we open and close the case everything falls out. It's so frustrating to my son that he doesn't use it anymore or just trashes it.

I figured the handy case would be easier for travel as it would contain everything he needed. Well, it stinks. The inside liner of the case falls out, the paint rounds dont stay in their plastic container at all. So you have to constantly put them back in everytime you open or close the case.

However, the black plastic inserts, and the red case it's self are made out of extremely weak plastic that doesn't hold anything together.

Then I read the reviews on Amazon and ended up giving them as gifts in an exchange. We still ended up with one, someone gave one to one of my children. The crayons, markers... all high Crayola quality. She has enjoyed using them and she uses them a lot. But the whole purpose of this is to have a nice case to hold the product and keep them nice. The plastic inserts fell out the very first time we opened it. There is no way to anchor down the scissors or paintbrush or papers. When it's time to close it all up we just situate the items as well as possible them slam it shut in hopes that it all works itself out inside. :) TERRIBLE case."},{"rating":"1","title":"shame on Crayola!","review":"This item is worthless.

Horrible rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, cheap, bad quality","review":"The whole thing just screams flaws and bad craftsmanship. The case is frustrating, when you want to close it, the inside of the top part keeps falling out, and with that come all the things in it. So my place is always flooded with the markers. The crayons you can buy at Target for 2 bucks, the coloring pencils are too small and thin for even school age kids and I could go on and on. Definitely would not recommend this set. The inner plastic broke after a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating case!","review":"My daughter received this case as a birthday present for her 5th birthday and just loved it. She is ALWAYS writing, coloring or painting, and this case had it all in one organized place, which we were both thrilled about (myself more than her). After about 2 or 3 uses, the cases (the black plastic ones inside) both fall out every time she opens or closes it, along with 6 or 7 markers, pencils and crayons. She then has to spend 10 minutes trying to clean up and put it back together. It's very frustrating to deal with because they are so cheap and flimsy.The art supplies themselves are wonderful - Crayola has great quality products, but the inside black cases just make it not worth it. I'm looking for something different for her now that won't have her supplies constantly falling out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case is Cheap and Will Break Soon","review":"I wish I had realized there are reviews at the bottom of the page! The case is made of cheap plastic and the hinges will obviously not hold up very long. Worse, the black trays inside which hold the coloring tools are made of flimsy, filmy black plastic more appropriate for disposable or packing use! We had to use tape to secure the black trays to the case just to keep them from falling out. The markers do not stay in their holder well. I wish I had used my money to buy cool crayons and bought my own case separately. This was a great organizational concept but such poor quality, it ruins the whole item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything falls out!","review":"This box is the bane of my existence. Because it's her \\"art box\\" my daughter won't let me throw it out, yet every time it's opened the plastic holder and all the supplies fall out. Plus, it's 10 times the size it needs to be for the stuff that's actually in it.The cheap plastic supplies holders don't hold all the supplies correctly and fall out. The markers fall out everytime it's opened.. If you find this box super cheap than I would rec'd getting it to replenish marker sets and things you already have. But it's not a good gift as an art supply box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Flimsy","review":"I bought this for my 3-year-old last christmas because she loves to color, draw, and paint. But the case it comes in is very flimsy on the inside. When she opens it, the two ends fall out along with all of the supplies inside, so I have to put everything back into their places every time. Closing it is really hard, because you have to do it very carefully (for a 3 year old that is almost impossible), or else everything starts to fall out of it again. I think that this christmas I am going to purchase a nice art desk for her, or something better to store everything in than to mess around with this stupid thing. However, my daughter did enjoy all of the art supplies inside so that is why I am giving it four stars in fun"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap in a Box","review":"Unit arrive w/ insides fallen apart.

For that reason my daughter doesn't really use this kit. There's also no place for the glue and pad of construction paper so that falls out too when opening.

It turns out that this thing is more annoying than anything. When you open the case, the mold that holds all the supplies unattaches from the actual case, and then it becomes a mess.

My daughter thought she secured her items in place, only to find that when she opened the case again they all came spilling out onto the floor.

Listed in the product details it says 24 fine line markers, which it does not come with...but it does come with 8 of the fatter markers (as pictured). The strange thing is, there is an empty compartment for 12 fine line markers. I thought we lost those markers in the chaos of Christmas morning, but if you read the details on the front, no where does it list the fine line markers. Go figure, I find that confusing.

I think what I didn't like about it was how mean the DA had to be in the beginning, and the unrealistic and completely unrelated line of questioning he took her through on the stand. Nothing he said had anything to do with the case against the two surviving men who were on trial. It was just ridiculous, and only succeeded in irritating me.And the other thing was the loss of her baby. Hunter was not broken up enough about that, and it was partially his fault if you ask me. Plus, how do you fall in love with someone you've never even met (as Hunter did with Kari). That stupidness just killed it for me.The best part of the story is when Kari is suspended and goes to the mountains, and Hunter followers her. The story is all good while they are in the mountains on a mini break, but then, I don't know, it was kind of flat from there. Nice enough read, I guess.

It just sounds like this band is trying to get signed. I don't understand the lead vocalist's attempts at possibly screaming, this is music that should be sung over. What is with every song having the word 'man' or 'cat' in it as well? It gets boring and annoyingly repetitive. Remember the '80s? I'd rather listen to a nu-metal band. 'Fall To Earth' should have been left in the 80s as well, kids these days don't want to hear ballads.And 'God Bless America'?

Each track has it's own groove, and I think this group has a very unique sound. No, they are not the Creed or Tool or the greatest band in the hemisphere. But hey are a good band in my opinion. I plan on buying their new CD, too, which I guess is the best compliment I can give. I saw them live last weekend and they were excellent compared to a lot of the bands I have seen.

And then, over and over, we get these lengthy pseudo-flamenco maunderings that go absolutely nowhere no way nohow. And I personally hate it when an album has ONE vocal right in the middle. Torn would be much better off rocking the house with guest vocalists and leaving all that \\"thoughtful\\" dead air way behind. As it is, I couldn't get my head into this record one way or the other.

They're an insult to the Irish people. Ms. Roberts makes a big thing about her love for the country but it's obvious she has never been more then a weekend tourist. The entire trilogy is built on a shaky foundation shot full of holes that could have been plugged with just a day or two of internet research. I'm especially turned off by the way she has ignored anything negative in Irish history and skirted the English Occupation like it never existed. The pub in the book was built three years before the start of the Great Famine yet she never addresses how the Gallagher family dealt with it and managed to pull the pub through.I'm all for love winning the day but this is formula romance badly researched with stock characters I could care less about. You want a good love story with some REAL Irish culture? Go read Morgam Llewellyn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel - Beyond Belief","review":"My only excuse for having read this to the end is that I was stranded and had nothing else to read. It's silly, predictable and boring, with one-dimensional characters in a stereotypical setting. Beware! It is mind-numbing - there are plenty of good reads around, don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paperback Pulp","review":"What a farce! The vocabulary would barely challenge a sixth grader. The plot is painfully predictable. Weary idioms are everywhere-p.145...\\"I'll talk to Magee again and see just what's up his sleeve\\". The intimate scenes are ridiculous-p.187...\\"His mouth was savaging hers\\". Savaging?! Roberts certainly doesn't lack for words. Try p.315...\\"A storm hovered over the village, marching down from the northeast to camp on the border as an army digs in for a siege\\". What?! And then there are gross lines like-p342...\\"the baby shot out, a slick bullet, into his hands, and already wailing\\". But the worst is the profanity. When is someone going to 'blow the whistle' on all the profanity? It's totally unnecessary, not politically correct and, in this case, an insult to the Irish...."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best Nora Roberts book I have ever read!","review":"This book, the final in the trilogy-including Jewels of the Sun, and Heart of the moon, is so great. I've read quite a few Nora Roberts books and this one takes the cake. Roberts does a great job pairing Darcy and Trevor. Trevor is just what Darcy needs to keep her grounded.Highlight: Jude's birth with Trevor delivering!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart of the Sea","review":"Simply put, loved it, loved it, loved it! Smart and sassy, Darcy and Trevor make the perfect couple--Miss Nora knew what she was about when she put them together. The characters were solid, the dialog was laugh-out-loud entertaining and her literary eloquence was at top form. Aside from the loose completion of Gwen and Carrick's end of the story, there was little to want in the face of this beautiful novel. I can't help but be a devout fan! This one's a must read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me wanting more!","review":"Jewels of the Sun was my favorite one of this trilogy, but Heart of the Sea was very good. I want Nora Roberts to write more books about the Gallagers now! Forget falling in love (yes, I know she's a romance writer), I want to know all about the couples' children and Darcy's singing career . . . there's a lot of future book material here.Also, in defense of Darcy: I like her. She's not money-grubbing, she's a woman who knows what she wants and how to get it! One of the best things about this trilogy is that all three women are strong, independent characters. If Darcy is ruthless, it's because she's been treated ruthlessly and that's what she knows. How many men ask her out because of her wit and intelligence, do you think? None! It makes perfect sense that she would look at external factors first, since that's how men look at her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing To Say The Least.... (Sorry, Mrs R.)","review":"The first two books in this series were absolutely fantastic, but this one was boring, and didn't show Darcy in a very good light. Darcy was pretentious, superficial, and was obsessed with greed; fine clothes, nice house, that sort of thing, which had to be the best. She completely overshadowed Trevor, who should have shined here. There's no one better than Nora Roberts, this one just didn't measure up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing Conclusion","review":"I loved the first two books in this series, Jewels of the Sun, and Tears of the Moon, but it was so hard to get through this book. I found it to be very slow moving and painful, and only continued to read as I wanted to see how the trilogy ended. I don't want to give away the ending, but even if you enjoyed the first two books, you may want to think twice about reading this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Nora Roberts Trilogy","review":"I was missing the 3rd book in this trilogy by Nora Roberts so I was very pleased to find a good used one at Amazon.com.

The characters, background and setting is fantastic. Ireland and her \\"faires\\" is such fun and the love stories surounding the three siblings is gripping. I was so sorry when I got to the end of the trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her Best.","review":"Having read all her books, this one was awful. I loved Jewel of the Sun and Tears of the Moon; but this book lacked something. I've enjoyed all her trologies and family series such as The Macgregors, but this book lacked what we look forward in Nora Roberts. Heart of the Sea was not a perfect ending to this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite trilogy ever, even better than her Born In ...","review":"A must read. Witty, funny and yes you will probably spill a few tears along the way. If you haven't read any of the series, start a the beginning and read them in order. I had to reread the entire trilogy now that all three are out, and it was worth every minute!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nora Roberts writes excellent stories!","review":"I have read and/or listened to about 80 % of Nora Roberts' books. I haven't found many that didn't hold my interest immediately. The Heart of the Sea ends one of my favorite trilogies. My husband is legally blind now and I introduced him to Nora's books and he is now hooked on them too.I recommend this trilogy to anyone who loves Ireland, the Fey, and Love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying conclusion to a much loved trilogy!","review":"This was a very satisfying conclusion to a much-loved series! I was thoroughly charmed by the cultural immersion, the likeable characters, and the dose of Irish magic. However, I felt that this last story was a bit drawn out - I found myself growing a tad impatient with Darcy and Trevor for creating obsticles to their relationship instead of resolving their issues and coming together through open communication. Still, I highly recommend this lovely trio of stories!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read.","review":"The Gallaghers of Ardmore Trilogy are three wonderful book, I reccommend reading them in order, can't put them down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magical ending for a wonderful new trilogy!","review":"Darcy Gallagher knows exactly what she wants. A rich man who will love and adore her, and shower her with all the baubles she could ever wish for. And when that wish comes true she finds she was wrong -- she wants something more. A man who can love her as much as she loves him. Could that man be Trevor Magee?A heart-warming conclusion to Nora Roberts Irish trilogy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming, but a bit disappointing","review":"I had looked forward to the other books in this series. After the romance of Aidan and Jude, I hoped that the others would be as spellbinding and delightful. I found the story of Brenna and Shawn somewhat contrived and uninspiring and this last between Darcy and Trevor somewhat lacking in electricity as well. While the two main characters are strong individuals and the legends woven into the story make it interesting, I find Darcy a little too flippant to be a very lovable character and Trevor a little too concerned with business. The ending picked up a little, but frankly this was a book that I started, then read a few pages here and there, only to put it down for several weeks, not really caring if I finished it or not. I would not go racing to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little disappointed...","review":"I was a late discoverer of Nora Roberts' works and was absolutely won over by both TEARS OF THE MOON and JEWELS OF THE SUN. This Irish girl anxiously awaited the last of the trio. Unfortunately, while I thought the books was still very good, I was disappointed in the ending. I thought it ended much to quickly, considering the rest of the story was so evenly paced. I would still highly recommend the book, although I liked the first two much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not One of My Favorites","review":"You don't need me to tell the you the story in this, the third of her stories about the life and loves the Gallagher siblings. That has been done very well by the other reviewers. I just want to add to the reviews by saying that, as a Nora Roberts fan, this one was one of my least favorites. The first book of this trilogy captured my imagination with the use of the ghosts and legend and their impact on the main charaters' lives, but with each of the successive books, the story got weaker and weaker. I can't get a handle on my dismay with this book, but suffice it to say that when I finished, all I could say was to my friends and fellow romance readers, \\"Oh well -- whatever.\\" Not my usual, \\"you've gotta buy this one!\\" Trust me, you can wait to borrow it from a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"HEART OF THE SEA","review":"I AM A NORA ROBERTS FAN.

Enjoyed the Irish setting and each of the characters. If you are a Nora fan you know the formula but always curious whether she will pull it off again - she does and it was a very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as the Quinn family saga","review":"I really liked this series very much.

'The world is yours' it's a great song, it stars with a weird sample then keyboards of Roddy Bottom change it to almost an '2 Unlimited' song and it turns out completly different to a song almost like 'Smaller and Smaller'(of the Angel Dust Album), if you like that you will like this one to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruth moore knows what she is talking about","review":"This book was fantastic I just got down reading it in class.Our whole freashman class had to read at first \\"I thought just another to read\\" but I found out it is not just a book, I mean you got into it after but what amazed me so much is that the characters are so real.

These oster clippers are slow, vibrate, and make noise which isn't good for horses plus they don't cut good in heavy leg hair. They keep stalling. My old clippers that are worn out do a better job.

Best of all, this is powerhouse romance with love scenes about love in two stories requiring the transcendence of time for the love to prevail. The black hole concept is very credible. I preferred it to Michael Crichton's disembodyment through time machines that never made sense and the details of which were distracting to the story.

I bought 4 boxes of clips (actually could use a 5th), and ever since, the tracks stay in tact, my son is able to enjoy the table more, and my babysitter is happier as well.

I don't use it on ground level track, as my kids have stopped taking ground level track apart for the most part (2yrs & 3.5 yrs old). They kept accidentally knocking over supports and second level track, but problem is greatly reduced now.Product allows construction of second level track with fewer supports. It also allows you to move the supports to more convient locations (instead of at joints).So far, no problems with the product.

They slide on and off which allows the kids to figure out how to do it in no time at all! Better to get a silicone type of glue and glue it all together. And if we want to add or change it up at some point the silicone peals right off without damaging the tracks.

(though I would have to say Jarrows was the worst smelling -the best smelling was Syntha-6then Six Starthen Pure Protein)But for some reason ISOPURE came without a seal and without any scoop.Because of the lack of seal and no scoop - and since this is a food product - (all the other brands had a SEAL and SCOOP).

Money is not an ssue so it's doubtful I'll complain nor do I have the time to send it back. Chucked the container and purchased from the local Vitaminshoppe.

The first minutes are really funny and if that could have been kept throughout the entire movie, another tale I'd be telling.I really think Epic Movie was a great idea. It could have really worked... but for me, it just didn't make it. After the first 30 minutes I was just waiting for the end.

Fortunately I have seen most of these movies so the parodies were not lost on me.The sets and acting was mediocre, and the movie progressed quickly from one parody to another, and I actually did find myself laughing through a lot of the movie, but once it was over I kind of felt like I had just ingested junk food for the brain.What did my husband think?

I especially like the Norby piece with the addition of the Soprano voice into the ensemble."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANTHOLOGIC !!!!","review":"This a wonderful 2 cd set comprising the almost complete discography of the best of latin america-s power-punk rock band.It even features some non-album tracks and songs from ep's and member's solo album cuts,all beatifully remastered,as if that were necessary-though always welcome-since all of their records have the nicest of sounds on the original editions."},{"rating":"2","title":"So pretty it hurts","review":"I don't get out much (I go to bed too early) so maybe that's why I'd never heard of Nora O'Connor before a few months ago when I saw her at one of Robbie Fulks' 'Secret Country' shows at the Old Town School of Folk Music. But sometimes I like to know what I'm getting into so I bought this album first and now months later I'm still playing it and I can't take it off. Not only are the songs great and exceedingly catchy, but Ms. O'Connor has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard. Listen to her on the final song 'Down Here' and you'll know what I mean. Unbelievably pretty. Nora O'Connor is of the finest singers ever. Do yourself a big favor and check her out. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but it's the best thing going.","review":"Beyond Press helps to take your Quark XPress documents and convert them to HTML based docs. You can then edit them in DreamWeaver, FrontPage, or whichever HTML editor you prefer.The program has it's bugs. But it is simple to learn, and gives a good, clean HTML template. Unfortunately, text flow is one of the main problems. You also have to be careful of which fonts you use. And, not all shapes or functions of XPress will translate over well. It's a bit pricey for an Xtension, but considering what you get, it makes up for having to rebuild entire documents.The program comes with versions for both Mac and PC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to see a children's book on Domestic Adoption","review":"The majority of the children's books I find seem to focus on international adoption. This book met my needs much better. It is very simplistic but that is a positive to me, since I began reading this book to my son when he was only a year old. It is a great way to start introducing adoption into your everyday vocabulary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming","review":"This book was very lovingly written and make the child feel warm and wanted!! Good read for small children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very materialistic book. Not really adoption oriented.","review":"This book talks about what kind of pajamas were bought, room decorations, carseats, mobiles, quilts, diapers, pacifiers, flowers, wind chimes... all materialistic items. It's supposed to be about preparing for bringing home the baby, but could be for any child being born. Only the last two pages had anything about love or acceptance, and very little at that.Strangely enough, the book has an odor that makes me sneeze. It must be something about the way it was printed.I don't care for the crayon illustrations... they aren't childlike, and they aren't artistic, so the book is just weird looking.To me, there is absolutely no benefit to reading this book. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care for it","review":"I checked this out at our local library before buying. I will not be purchasing it. I just don't care for the tone of the book. It falls flat as it is very basic and about the parents preparations for the child. It does not have any emotional depth to it. I am looking for books to introduce adoption to our 2 1/2 year old. I prefer 'Tummy Mummy' and 'How I was Adopted' to this one. I also like 'Tell me a Real Adoption Story' for when she is older."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but one-dimensional","review":"This book is an okay book for those just beginning to talk with their kids about their adoption stories. In simple language it tells about the day they met. In my experience as an adoption professional, though, most adoption stories--at least domestic--include some contact with the birth mom and/or dad and perhaps their families. This book would be richer if it were revised to include that contact."},{"rating":"1","title":"I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE ACTUALLY CHARGES $$ FOR THIS BOOK","review":"I RECEIVED THIS BOOK, READ IT IN 30 SECONDS, THEN DECIDED TO RETURN IT IMMEDIATELY!

The illustrations look amaturish and also I agree with other reviewers about being put off byhow unprepared the couple seems. I don't think anyone giving birth is borrowing a carseat on their way to the hospital. Also (and this is just as an FYI) it's not for people who are adopting internationally (which we did). It's also weird to me that it's written in \\"you\\" form. So anypart of the story that doesn't match yours makes it a weird read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good intro to the subject for babies adopted at birth","review":"We found this book a good introduction to the subject of adoption for our granddaughter.

No one alive sings this music with greater depth of color and emotion while maintaining an absolute purity and clarity of tone. There are a few brief moments of slightly shoddy intonation, in particular in the more technical passages, but the overall singing is so beautiful that they're forgotten about moments later. The continuo, made up of some of the biggest names in early music, are excellent, with consistently intelligent choice of instruments and high quality of playing, both in sound and ornamentation. Especially notable is the simple but haunting \\"Si dolce ��'l tormento.\\" Those two minutes alone are worth the price of the disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"good review for the oral thoracic boards","review":"I got this book shortly before the oral boards and thought it was a good review.

It is full of the exquisite details that draw you in like a passionate lover against whom you have no control. The acting is top-notch, from the beloved Nonna to little Eddie Luca, who tells the story. It is a story of an Italian couple who marry against everyone's wishes, for love. It makes you laugh and cry, and you feel as though you know these characters. Family. Love. Despair. Hope. Luck. It is all there, and you will not be disappointed.

It is, for the most part, well written and enjoyable. My only complaint is that the author occasionally gets away with himself, away from the subject, and dips into these \\"reenactment paragraphs.\\" It reminds me of watching a program about a criminal investigation that suddenly cuts away from the facts, the interviews, and the evidence to give a reinactment. Poorly acted, mediocre, and it interrupts the flow of information to give the director a chance to vent his ego. In this book, Simon Read's strength is his creative nonfiction. He presents the information in an interesting fashion with a natural flow. Unfortunately, he undercuts himself when he veers off into pure fiction scenes in which he attempts to \\"reenact\\" events. He might be a good fiction writer otherwise, but it didn't work for this piece. That's my only complaint though.

I do think there was a bit of a breaking in period with it, but after washing it by hand (with tea tree oil/witchhazel/water mixture) it's become just right. I've come to the conclusion that no mat, no matter how expensive will be 100% slip-free. To work around this occasional slipperyness (it's very minor)I use the mat in combination with a Manduka eQua hand sized towel.

I use this mat for yoga (obv) and additional interval training circuits (Insanity) in which it has come in very handy. After pushing the pace for a while and you start to sweat like crazy, you want a mat in which you will not slip and be able to hold sturdy poses even when drenched. This mat works perfectly for such instances. The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 (which may not even be fair) was because it is difficult to scrub down ironically because of the reason it is also so wonderful.....its friction. So it may not be fair to mark it down because of that, but in my opinion its at least a semi-negative but I would still recommend this yoga mat."},{"rating":"2","title":"good communication, great service","review":"did a great job getting it in the mail for before christmas, and i appreciated that. easy to communicate with them thru the web sight and the receiver is enjoying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mat but still can get slippery for me","review":"My hands can sweat a lot so I still slip sometimes when using this mat.

That's not very often, compared to most yogis.The mat smelled funny from the beginning. It has a strong, rubbery scent. After all this time, the odor is still prevalent and distracting.The worst part is this mat has lost ALL its stickiness / traction. It slips and slides all over the floor, no matter what surface you are on.I actually liked my old, inexpensive Gaiam mat better! But I will be purchasing a Manduka mat based on the recommendation from my yoga instructor."},{"rating":"1","title":"total disappointment","review":"After reading all the reviews I was so excited to get this product and finally start using a \\"real\\" yoga mat. I've been practicing for about 4 years now and slipping is my biggest problem. Honestly, my $15 Target mat works better than this one. It feels amazing and very 'grippy' when you first step on to it. But as soon as you generate the slightest bit of moisture you slide uncontrollably. I couldn't even hold myself up in a wheel pose. I plan on writing to the manufacturer and asking for a refund. Per the other yogi's in my class, just spend the extra money and get a manduka."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odor","review":"To be honest the odor reminded me of a tire store, it was too much to take.

I'm really disappointed that my cheapo mat works better than this one and wish I could return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"very sticky mat","review":"hard to do laying down poses..salutes ..child's pose- ok for standing where you need the grip- found my hair stuck to the mat.. maybe it will be smoother after worn in.."},{"rating":"1","title":"wore out in 6 weeks","review":"I cannot believe this mat is falling apart. I purchased it 6 weeks ago. It is now crumbling where my feet typically go. I am so disappointed. I never purchased a \\"nice\\" yoga mat before and I was so excited when this arrived. It was nice and sticky and cushion-y. But this is way too expensive of a mat to be falling apart less than 2 months after arriving. Very, very dissatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Velcro","review":"It is great for down dog, nothing slips but it does attract lint and other things. I think it should come with a large lint roller. There is a fine line between not enough and too much stickiness. This mat is just about right."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great mat for a few days and then not so great","review":"The mat is indeed very non-slip when it's clean. But when it's not clean, it's very slick, worse than the worst sticky mat. The problem is that its open cell construction (like a sponge) soaks up sweat and body oils voraciously. The only way to clean it thoroughly is to soak it because the oils and such soak deep into the mat and wiping doesn't clean it. Since it's a big rubber sponge it takes days to dry after soaking it. Even worse than the slipping is that it starts to stink pretty quickly when it's not clean. So it's been quite a chore keeping my mat clean enough to enjoy. I'm tossing this one when it turns six months and going back to a normal sticky mat. I'd rather deal with the slipping using a towel than bother with cleaning this mat anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive smell","review":"Be warned, this yoga mat smells horrible and the smell is so strong even those practicing near me noticed it. Poses on the mat were impossible due to the stink. My car would be filled with the offensive odor just from transporting it rolled up. When unrolled, the bad smell was overpowering. In addition, Jade did not compensate me for postage to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good I never even think about it!","review":"I bought my mat in a retail store, and by the time I got it the rubber smell had aired out of it.Stepping on this mat feels like home to me. The material is asthetically pleasing to me, and I love the rich \\"sedona red\\" color I chose. The mat is thick enough so I am comfortable in any pose but light enough to carry to yoga class.And yes, it is very sticky. I never slip in a regular iyengar class. I do slip towards the end of a vinyasa flow class due to sweat, but I know of no mat that can fix this!I have used it for about 15 classes so far. Due to the dark color I have not had problems with lint or dirt showing. I clean it every few uses with a mat cleaner I bought at the store.At home I prefer a giant round mat, because I have the space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Worth It","review":"As a casual yoga practitioner, I was reluctant to spend so much on a yoga mat. However, it was time for me to replace my old mat and I really wanted something on which I wouldn't slip when working up a sweat. This mat was completely worth it. There is a slight rubber smell, but it is not nearly as big a deal as I feared based on some reviews. I purchased the black mat and none of the color has bled or transferred to my floor or clothes. Best of all, I can now confidently execute a downward dog and not worry about slipping. I am really glad I spent the extra money to purchase this mat."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks, literally and functionally","review":"When you first get this mat, the eau de rubber is overpowering. Eventually, it does subside, but for me it never went away. Perhaps because the mat itself only lasted about three months. Indeed it was quite sticky, for a few practices. After about a month, the traction tapered off and it started to pill and crumble. A few months later, it was at the curb, er, I mean, recycling plant. Go with the Manduka. It's not great either, but WAY better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoga Mat","review":"This yoga mat was not cheap and I thought I am getting a quality item but unfortunately it make static electricity and collect all trash and hair from the floor at the gym.It had horrible smell and not thick enough.I wish I could return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga mat exceeded expectations!","review":"Purchased as a gift for my dedicated yoga enthusiast 26 year old daughter.

Geleva's review is right on. I'd like to add this mat started falling apart in the first year and there is no warranty. I contacted the manufacturer and was told that's the way it is and I even escalated it to the highest manager I could find.Problems include; a strong latex smell that never goes away and is difficult to remove from your hands. The colors run and stain carpeting and clothing, this does not go away. The mat starts breaking down quickly. Did I mention terrible customer service.I've since purchased a Manduka ProLite and could not be happier. And, it has a lifetime warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS MAT. Slippery mat from the first time I used it, expensive and horrible customer service","review":"I bought a Jade Yoga mat in January. From the first time I used it, literally the first downward dog, I started slipping. I kept thinking I would be able to break it in. After a month, it was still slippery and dangerous to use. I had spoken with a representative from the yoga studio where I bought it and they told me to wash it. As I was talking to the rep, the person standing behind me said they also had that problem from the first time they used it. I washed it but the problem didn't improve. I was then told to contact JadeYoga. After many emails, they were friendly but absolutely unhelpful and I wasn't given a refund.I basically threw $80 down the drain."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware- didn't recveive the right product","review":"I didn't receive the Jade Harmony mat.

If you order this product be sure you get what you paid for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It","review":"My experience with this mat and the company who makes it was extremely bad. If you don't practice yoga in a dungeon or a dark closet this is not the mat for you. If you ever need to return it or ask for help from the company, this is not the mat for you. ANY sunlight AT ALL renders the mat unusable do to lack of stickiness. Why do YOU buy a sticky mat? I buy mine for the, guess what, STICKINESS!!!!There is supposedly a label when you buy it about this, however, since ANY light will cause the 'sun damage' its really mot. If you call the company and ask for help, the receptionist is likely to be amused by your problem (which she obviously hears a lot) and refer you to the owner whose disinterest is palpable through his e-mail which basically says in polite terms: too bad, so sad.I am strongly considering making a claim through the Better Business Bureau."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wore out very quickly","review":"I was reading the other reviews and a lot of them acknowledged that this mat wears out very, very quickly. Yet, still these reviewers gave 4 stars. I can't be that generous. I bought this mat for $60 and it was great. For two months! And then, it started to wear so badly that I would be covered in mat pieces at the end of each practice. I started using it with a mysore rug just to keep from getting gross.My next purchase will be a manduka pro. For $90-$106 most reviews have said they last at least 6 YEARS!!! And it has a lifetime warranty. This is a bargain compared to the jade mat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not be happier, wish I bought it sooner","review":"I have been doing yoga for ten years and have always used the generic mats you buy in stores. After an unfortunate incident where I slammed my car trunk on my mat and out a large whole in it, I decided to research mats and buy a quality mat. I attend 2-3 classes a week, mostly hot yoga. I narrowed my decision down to this or Manduka. Manduka has a closed rubber, so sweat sits on top of the mat. jade is open cell rubber so sweat is absorbed and the mat retains its traction and there's no slipping during a hot class. After class I just wipe down with a yoga mat spray cleaner and it's good for the next class. I can't believe I used a cheap mat for so many years. The change is unbelievable; better grip, better comfort, easier transition between poses."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I always wanted in a yoga mat.","review":"I'm in my early sixty's and have been doing yoga for most of my adult life. Teaching bring a lot of students with a wide variety of yoga mats. Over the years I've tried them all. I haven't bought myself a new mat in years because there was nothing out there that was anything special. I read a couple of very good reviews about the Jade mat. I went on line to find out more. I saw the price. I had to talk myself into buying the mat by saying that this is an investment in my passion. I had to let it air out for a couple of days to get rid of the rubber odor. I took it to class. The mat was great. I felt very secure and sure footed. I put my other mats away. I went to an all day Iyengar workshop. Everyone wanted to work with me on my mat or use it when I wasn't using it. Great mat. Well worth the extra cost. I hope I feel the same way after a year or two?"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"This yoga mat is great. We've tried several and this is our favorite so far.

I am embarrassed to admit I have only cleaned my mat a few times in the last two years, and for that it has lost some grip, but it remains superior to most sticky mats in grip and comfort. I bought this longer version for my husband and have found I prefer a longer mat as well. For teaching and practicing, I will be loyal to Jade mats."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for sweaty yogis","review":"A little smelly out of the box, but still my favorite yoga mat.

There is a distinct \\"tire\\" aroma but I wasn't bothered by it. After 3-4 months the mat started bunching up off the floor if I was putting pressure in two different directions; ie. it would bunch up around my feet in the warrior series. I had subjected the mat to extreme temperatures in my car from the end of summer to the beginning of winter, I think this is what made it more elastic and less sticky. I was surprised by this because i have many friends who leave their mats in their cars and don't have issues with them. I'm the only one with a Jade mat. I would definitely recommend keeping this mat away from extreme temperatures. I would not purchase another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jump in and Hang on","review":"Purchased last month as used through Amazon/theHouseOfMusicOnLine.

The install was easy and the driver also includes a calculator software with number transfering capabilities as well. I found it useless, but it [work for] many poeple's needs. My only Gripe is that the cable comes out of it on the right hand side, if you have it on the right side of the keyboard it has to go back around to the left side. No big deal but it is just kinda quirkie and thought that I would throw that in.Other than that it is awesome, the keys respond like it is an embedded keyboard and it doesn't hog a usb port, I know some have the hub but a co-worker has one like that and the hub on it doesn't work so I figured go with the Serial port and not use the USB... I own nothing else that uses a serial port so it works out great."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Breakfast on Pluto' Hits the Spot","review":"Some movies just stand out in all aspects. Neil Jordan's 'Breakfast on Pluto' does just that. The acting was great, the writing - terrific, and the directing couldn't have been better. What starts out as a simply told tale that one could view from a distance transforms into a captivating adventure that draws the viewer in. I couldn't help but cheer for the lead character, and although I laughed and found some parts to be genuinely silly and entertaining, the film hits all the right notes and peaks at just the right time. This is not a typical film and is not for all tastes. But, for those who can't enjoy it, I feel pity. I felt great after watching this movie - it's touching without being sentimental and most of all, it's an original."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely beautiful movie","review":"I'm a big fan of Cillian Murphy and have been working my way through his movies. Cillian's performance in this movie is nothing short of amazing. Half way through the movie I literally forgot I was watching a man. Patricia \\"Kitten\\" Braden is one of my the most touching, lovely, real characters I've seen on film.The movie also features an amazing early 70's soundtrack. This is a movie that traces Kitten's childhood, her search for her mother, her involvement with the IRA, her search for love, all while showing us what a strong and remarkable person Kitten is.If you're looking for something a little different, a lot entertaining, and very unique, I highly recommend this film.

Cillian Murphy gives an amazing, sensitive portrayal of a gentle transvestite in the 1970's Ireland who is trying to find his mother in the midst of revolution and bloodshed. Along the way, he is misunderstood, ridiculed, exposed to violence, and taken advantage of, and through it all he stays who he is, a gentle sweet-natured soul. You lose yourself in this portrayal, this actor is so brilliant. The musical score underlying the action is absolutely inspired.

Danning trying hard to live up to being the Female Clint Eastwood, plays a character who is silent, smokes cigars, and lives is a run down trailer. She is a Bounty Hunter who is seeking the man who killed her partner. Wings Hauser plays the villian Cavanaugh (who steals the only good scenes in the movie)with his demented, crazed, coke-dealing, psyco artist who is completely over the top and out of his mind. Since Sybil only has about 4 lines in the movie and seems to have a bored expression on her face, she is not as fun to watch as she was in previous movies. It will pretty much disappoint her fans who are use to seeing her play sexy bad girls in some of the wildest costumes of all times. This was her final film, but not her best.

I liked Diana very much, despite others' opinions, but Thorne was a nonentity as far as I was concerned. I was bored by the romance aspect and was more eager to see where the actual story went.

And for someone who was SO concerned about scandal, she sure did court it...and oddly enough, repeatedly recover from it (after having been devasted by it years earlier).I didn't like Christopher as much; he seemed like a user to me. And why did he never make clear his sincerity about marrying her? I also found him a bit domineering. But I loved his place on Cyrene.The mystery was well done, I thought--plenty of pieces kept in play and resolved at the right moment. As for the sex...there was definitely plenty of it.

This book is just a rehash of half a dozen other books which were all more interesting. He's got a tortured past and a secret he can't share. She's an artist, also with a tortured past, but she's an open book. They pretend to be engaged. There's some sort of nebulous danger. Boring. Deadly dull and I really wish I had another book to read.

I wear between an 8 and an 8.5 so I always order the larger size and hope they don't fall off my feet. These stay on, so I'm happy. The toe is a nice updated round toe... not so round that your feet look stubby. The little wedge heel makes them much more comfortable than a completely flat shoe. One thing that I can tell is going to bother me is that the inside edge kind of cuts into my foot. I tend to have problems with shoes rubbing in that spot where there's not a lot of skin because I don't wear socks with them. Bottom line, I could do a lot of standing in these shoes, but not a lot of active walking.

Spartan lives are enriched by stories and gossip, slights are never forgotten, feuds reach epic intensity, and bottled-up frustrations simmer till they explode. Through rich and vivid descriptions of the minutiae of daily existence, we come to know twin brothers Lewis and Ben Jones as they grow up and are shaped by their family and their small community. The townspeople become our own friends or enemies, depending on their behavior towards the twins, and we empathize with them as they use their limited resources to struggle with the Big Questions which concern us all--questions of life, love, spirituality, death, cruelty, justice, and ultimately, happiness. By paring life to the bone here, Chatwin gives us a classic example of the adage, \\"Less is more.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"It lights up.. half the time","review":"I bought this light with the intentions that it would be decent for wedding videography.

He did it before Bangs, Meltzer reminds the reader, as if Bangs didn't do it better.

These are not exceptional towels."},{"rating":"1","title":"better as bathmat","review":"got a pinzon (house brand) comforter that was great, but towel is like a long, thin bath mat, can't wrap yourself in it, heavy but not soft, if you want that warm wrapped up sense while you find the bathrobe, this isn't the one"},{"rating":"2","title":"More like a blanket","review":"Great towels. Thick, heavy, absorbent. Make sure you clean the lint traps before and after drying them.

On a positive note, you can skip your morning work out with the free weights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft, good size, hope you don't like the color","review":"I was pleased with the towels on receipt, so I proceded to wash them to remove lint,etc. I had just finished a load of dark clothes, so I filled the washer with cold water and half the amount of Tide liquid. I washed per the instructions, dried on low heat. When I removed them, 2 of the three towels and 3 of 6 wash cloths had yellow blotches as if bleach or something were splashed on them. Previous or subsequent loads had no similar problems. To the credit of the towels, they did remain soft and did not shrink. They'll be great for camping. I'll have to go elsewhere to buy ones for the bathrooms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too dense","review":"I bought these thinking that the 820g weight would be a good thing, which it would have been on a terry towel, but these are to tightly woven that the weight makes the bath sheet unweildy. As others have noted, they take forever to dry. The colors are duller than in the photos, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Restoration Hardware","review":"These towels are phenomenal. The bath sheet is huge!! In fact all the products in this line are larger than usual towels. Supposedly these are the same towels that Restoration Hardware sells. I checked, they look the same. The Pinzon towels are a little heavier and over 1/2 the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I should have known I was in trouble when I opened the packages and it says \\"no returns\\". Hmmm...thanks for telling me in advance. I washed the towels before use and immediately they faded and shrank. Plus they filled my washer with huge amounts of fuzz. Great. Then I tried to use them after a shower. The towels don't absorb water, wick water or do anything else - they just push the water around on your body/face/hands. So you stay wet and the towel feels a little damp. Total waste of money, time and resources. So disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality","review":"I absolutely love these washcloths. They are thick and extra absorbent and feel luxurious when bathing or washing my face with them. I'm planning to order more if these to gradually replace my older towels and washcloths with a full set of the Pinzon towels and cloths. Highly recommend these if you're looking for a luxury product at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic towels!","review":"I purchased 8 of the Pinzon 820-Gram Luxury Bath Towel in the \\"brick\\" color in 2008. I also purchased the hand towels and washcloths as well. I do not see \\"brick\\" listed as a color option at the time that I am writing this review, so I do not know if it is still sold. It is a nice rich, bold red color. These towels are amazingly soft and thick. They have not lost softness or color over time--you would never know that I had owned these towels for 3 1/2 years! I will be purchasing more in the future, in a coordinating color. I get a lot of compliments on this towel set.These are very much a five star product. However, I bought my set during a great sale on Amazon--I do not know if I would pay $20 per towel, even though I know how great they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"towel set","review":"Not impressed. hems started to unravel after first washing. Too expensive for such an inferior product. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love these towels","review":"Why is it so difficult to find good towels these days? For years we have been disappointed with every set of towels we bought. Until we bought these towels.I waited for a year before writing this review because I wanted to see how they held up over time. I think is it now time to declare victory in the search for the perfect towel. OK, perfect might be an overstatement. They are not the softest towels I have ever used. But, they are far from rough. They are high quality, high absorption, thick, and heavy-duty.I cannot comment on color fastness since I bought all white.Like other people have said, they shed like crazy for the first few months. Would need to run them through the dry cycle twice, and still I had never seen so much lint!! But, that is now history and the towels remain flawless, heavy, with wonderful absorption."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Luxurious","review":"I was expecting 4 Seasons Hotel plush luxuriousness from the description they were being sold under. Not even close. Returned them before use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Came apart!","review":"I bought this set in Sept 2012. My wife and I each have a washcloth, hand towel, and bath towel. She only uses the washcloth to wash her face at night. By January, four months later, she could see through part of her washcloth!! And, now, the whole is big enough to fit her finger. My washcloth is fine. She does not use heavy make-up or any atypical face wash. So, I gotta figure we got a bad towel. I contacted Amazon, and they said they could do anything about it. The rest of the towels are fine and I actually like their weight and absorbancy, but buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Color doesn't last","review":"I went overboard and ordered a complete set of these towels about 2 months ago, and I'm seriously regretting it. The color doesn't last, it discolors from a very nice sage green, to a very bad splochy yellow. The first to discolor were the wash cloths, but I figured that was the soap etc. This only took a few uses. Within a month, however, all of the bath towels, hand towels, and bath mats all discolored, with yellow sploches showing up everywhere. The towels are nice enough, soft, and work well, but for the premium price you pay, they should have lasted much longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatile Hand Towel & Luxurious Bath Towel","review":"This is a very substantial hand towel. These are the nicest towels I have ever had (and I thought I had good ones before!). I bought extras of the hand towel size because they come in handy for mutiple uses: as hand towels by the bathroom sink; big enough and thirsty enough for wrapping around the hair; the right size for rolling up and placing behind my head in the tub. I bought the white which look so elegant stacked in my bathroom that I now call it MY SPA.Since my review is showing up for the full-sized towels, also, I will add that the bath towels are heavy and absorbant and soft, truly the most luxurious towel imaginable. They are huge, can easily be wrapped around a body BUT are so thick and heavy that I defy you to get them to stay wrapped!I love these towels and will never settle for less again. So far, they wash like a dream, though they require a little more time in the dryer than my old towels due to their thickness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great and not worth $20","review":"I bought 4 of these (buy 3 get 1 free) when they were only $15 each - a couple of weeks ago. They just arrived and I am disappointed. Yes, they are heavy, but heavy as in a bath mat. The loops are too short and compact - making for a pretty hard nap. They aren't soft. They are smaller than all of the towels I currently own. I got the silver sage color, which on 2 lap tops and 3 PC monitors looked like it had a blue-ish hue to it - no they are just green, not blue at all and not a particularly nice green. The worst part, though, and the reason I'm sending them back is that the sewing is terrible. The finishing on the sides is way off. At $20, they should not be factory rejects.Update after a washing: color fades, too. Wow, they really suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gambled and lost","review":"Read the number of 5 star reviews and weighed them against the number of 1 star reviews.

I bought the Pinzon towels thinking they would be as nice or nicer. The difference is night and day. The Pinzon towels are thin, not very soft and the colors are dull. I don't know how they claim to be 820 weight since they are lighter than a 700 gram weight towel. The Pinzon towels are not as described, but are inferior--like Martha Stewart towels."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent towels","review":"Others have compared these towels to Restoration Hardware's 'paradigm' towels, and I agree. Very dense cotton with a fine silky finish, I'm very pleased with them. I can't comment on the color-fastness as I ordered white."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luxurious Towels","review":"I have not bought a towel for over $17+ before (that's considered a luxury to me).

We needed something large to completely wrap around us for using with an outside hot tub. These are very plush and heavy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got 2 now I have to buy more","review":"My wife has been saying for a while now that she wanted a towel that was taller than she is and I finally took the plunge and bought two towels for what we could have bought 10 at Marshall's or Ross. All it took was opening the package and unfolding the bath sheet to convince me it's worth the extra money. These are very heavy towels and not just because of their size. They have a very absorbent and dense weave that is very soft. I plan on muying at least two more because I know my wife is not going back to any of our regular towels again. So now our guests will have some very nice towels and we will be using these bath sheets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy","review":"I like this towel, you can tell it's very good quality and will last a long time. It does feel soft and is absorbent. However, I find it to be too heavy (some people might think this is a good thing) and too dense, because after I dry off in the shower, I like to wrap the towel around my wet hair on my head, but this towel is so heavy and thick, it's difficult to wrap it on my head, and it kept falling to the side and coming off. Just something to think about if you wrap your head/hair up. But otherwise it is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very absorbent and pilled quickly","review":"These towels are super heavy but they don't absorb water well.

The \\"bath sheet\\" is the size of a freakin beach towel! Its not big its HUGE! Its boarder-line too big. BUT... It drys me off SUPER fast and feels nice and heavy the way I like it. One major draw-back is that you must wash it SEVERAL times before it stops leaving behind fabric/lint stuff. The lint will get in your hair or on the clothes that you wash or dry this towl with so wash it by its self. Other than that I like this towel a lot! I would buy it again. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy them again","review":"These towels are extremely heavy which you would think would make them very absorbent. That is unfortunately not the case. And because they are so heavy they take forever to dry. If I dry my hands on one in the morning, it is still damp at night. They take forever to dry in the dryer.Also, because they are so heavy, they are hard to wrap around yourself after you bathe -- they slip off. I would forgive all of this if the towels were really absorbent, but they are only so-so in that category.I would have returned them, but I love the color (plum) so I'll keep them, but I won't buy any more of them and don't recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed after having Bamboo","review":"I had previously purchased Pinzon towels with Bamboo. I thought I would give these a try since about the same weight as previous Bamboo towels and had the color I wanted. Nothing compares to the softness of Bamboo towels.

Get the towels with Bamboo, you will not be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible towels","review":"I would not recommend these towels to anyone.

And it is NOT handtowel-soft. It has the exact consistency (and size) of a bathmat.I am pretty new to purchasing handtowels, I admit, but for me handtowel specs are pretty straightforward: soft; handtowel-sized; nice to look at.

I have to admit that my husband does the laundry and is a bit of a bleach freak, but they are shredding where they hang up on hooks in the bathroom. They are quite heavy at nearly 3 pounds per towel and I can't tell if it is the weight of the towel, too much bleach or a combination.

Great price for a high quality towel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thick, but not all that soft","review":"These are very good quality towels as far as construction, and their weight makes them super-absorbent.

WB is still dumping a little bit of refuse on us but they've evidently learned not to go overboard with it. Even better, this includes 3 more of the neglected director Arthur Davis's toons.My only regret is that, with the dwindling of unreleased Porky color cartoons, they couldn't have also included Brother Brat, Daffy Doodles, Little Orphan Airedale and Nothing But the Tooth instead of the three bad ones or the two repeats.

However, I'm disappointed because the quality is pretty bad (I thought it'll be HD or something nice) and the workout is just too boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Collection","review":"This covers everything I want in the set. The yoga is relaxing and tailored well for each trimester and taking care of morning sickness among other things, the pilates is more of a workout with proper modifications and guidance for each trimester, including breaking down items between the first part and second part of your third trimester while the overall training video is the most active, with three models showing how the exercise should be done based on where you are. Overall I like that I can do different things based on how I feel or what I need."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing!","review":"Overall, the dvds seemed to be kind of a low-rent production. I'm willing to overlook the home video-esque production value for a good workout, but was disappointed there too. First, the strength training dvd is lead by a super-skinny blond with gigantor fake boobs -- just what every pregnant woman is looking for: a workout with a Hooters waitress. Plus, the workout is awful, lots of exercises that have you do 30+ reps in a row of something (can we break this up into sets?). In addition, it did not seem well tailored to a proper and safe prenatal workout. Annoyed, I moved on to the yoga dvd, hoping for better. The Hooters-girl was gone, but the yoga routine seemed disjointed and slow paced (even for a beginner). Honestly, I gave up prior to the Pilates dvd, so in fairness, I can't comment on that. in short, save your money and opt for one of the many other great prenatal workout dvds on the market!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not reccomend","review":"I was in pretty good shape pre-pregnancy and looking for something to keep me in shape. I really enjoy Jillian's 30-day shred and was looking for something along those lines (20-25 minute workout w/cardio + strength) but with safe moves for pregnancy and some options as I get bigger. This is definitely not it.The overall quality of all dvd's was poor; bad selection of instructor's, settings, and pace. The strength routine dvd was ok but slow moving with too many reps at a time. The yoga was way too slow and boring to even get through and the pilates was ok as well but slow with a strange announcer voice telling you instructions. I haven't found a great pre-natal dvd yet but this one is definitely on the low end for workout and quality of dvd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"overall a nice dvd, I like the fact the teacher modifys the excersises for different stages of pregnancythe stretching/ relaxation yoga is my favorite!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this DVD set!","review":"I am now in my 3rd trimester and this was the first workout DVD I bought when I found out I was pregnant. I was not impressed with quality of the videos and I did not find the workouts to be challenging or movitivating, in fact, I barely broke a sweat! I tried it twice and that was it. If you are reading this review and looking for a great workout series, I would highly recommend Body by Trimester. I do the Body by Trimester workouts every other day and love working out with the instructor Joy, who is pregnant herself. I find her motivating and after her workout I am engerized and ready to go for the day. I also just purchased her Postnatal DVD that just came out! The website is [...]. I have thoroughly enjoyed every stage of my second pregnancy and I can honestly say that the Body By Trimester DVD's has been a huge part of why I feel SO GREAT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should mention you need equipment...","review":"I think I would really love the DVD if the description of the item or even the outside of the DVD anywhere mentioned that you need more than just a yoga mat. You need body pillows, folded blankets, yoga blocks, and a yoga strap and MOST of the poses require these items. It really should be mentioned since it costs even more money. This was very disappointing when I put the DVD in and found out that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!","review":"These videos were so uninspiring!!! While pregnant, I have found it difficult to get the energy and motivation to stay active so I was hoping these videos would not only help me stay fit but motivate me as well. Was I ever WRONG!!!!!! There is nothing motivating or fun about these videos. I understand that maybe they were meant to help with relaxation, unfortunately all they did was annoy and aggravate me. They have recently become the joke in my family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"I was excited to order this but very disappointed when I received it. You expect the person on the cover to be the instructor or student and it seemed she was neither. This is packaged to be very modern, but the yoga portion looks very outdated. Instead of an acutal workout, it just shows you yoga poses. The strength portion isn't bad. It has one woman in each trimester doing the workout so it's easy to follow. Overall, I'm disappointed and would not recomment this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"bought for my wife these video seemed very dated and not ascetically pleasing at all it looked like they were made in the 80s not really enjoyable she tried it a couple times but did not like it so here they sit she has chosen a different yoga routine"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a great set of DVDs. Yoga, Pilates and general fitness all in one package. It will get you through your whole pregnancy. The yoga program is especially good to help with the many issues and changes that come with pregnancy at different stages. I haven't done yoga before this, so starting it while pregnant, I appreciate the slower pace and a lot of attention to detail and comfort that's offered with the props and the instruction. My pre-pregnancy workout preference was more toward gym classes, especially cardio. The Fit & Toned program is just that, but for pregnant women. Good modifications are offered for the different stages. I haven't worked a lot with the Pilates yet, but I have done a couple routines on it and browsed though some others. It is good too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"It was okay. There are better yoga DVDs out there.

I got it because it was the cheapest recorder I could find, and I guess you get what you pay for. After a few months it wouldn't record new discs, but unfortunately for me that was after the 90-day warrantee on labor ran out. Now it occasionally refuses to play store-bought DVDs that work fine on other players, so I'm junking it.As for functionality, the rewind is pretty annoying, because it doesn't come close to stopping where you release the button, even if you are in the slowest scan mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value!","review":"We ordered this after our VHS/DVD combo unit broke.

Other than that, no problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope","review":"Skip this one. Less than 2 years old and the HDMI stopped working. It also claims DVD's are 'BAD' about 90% of the time when they play just fine in my older dvd/vcr combo machine. Video was nice when it worked.

Talked to so-called customer support who informed me that refurbed units may be more finicky than new. So far this is a glorified (and incredibly slow-loading) player. A week after the 3 month refurb warranty ended the unit stopped sending output through any output (HDMI, Component, Composite, Svideo)...

I was a fan of Collins before this but I heard this concert at Symphony Space and I loved his poems even more when I heard him read them in person. This short, wonderful program (introduced by Bill Murray) is a CD the whole family can listen to. He's funny, charming, and smart, and makes poetry come alive for adult and child alike with unforgettable yet accessible images.

The CD player is sensitive to minor bumps and the AM section of the radio tuner is horible.

Cinematic chloroform from what should have been a fascinating film. Had the music not been so frightfully avant-garde, I might have enjoyed this a little more. I got the point that the music reflected his inner turmoil, but it was just a bit too noisy and chaotic for me. Also, his imitation of a three year old who can't keep the same train of though for more than five minutes de-railed my interest in the story. Vanessa Redgrave, especially, and the rest of the cast give fine performances, but the movie just didn't work for me. This film was a real disappointment and I kept thinking what Mario Bava could have done with material like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great value bundle","review":"2 great movies on Blu ray with the price of one.

Instead I read a poorly researched report that does not really ask the hard questions about its subject.If this was supposed to be a tabloid expose, I am surprised Ravitch could not find more extreme cases. If she wanted a more serious look at how pressure groups affect education, she failed there as a well by speaking anecdotally and ignoring larger trends.At times, Ravitch lets her own political bias influence what she reports, giving much space to \\"left-wing\\" pressures on history textbooks, while ignoring the even stronger \\"right-wing\\" pressure.If you want a superficial examination of serious problems, then this is the book for you.It is not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"a 5th column attack","review":"As a teacher, I see this in our meetings and in our workshops.

The book does make the same points over and over again, as others have noted, but they may have to be hammered home. The only matter on which I disagree with her is that she has some hope for the future, while I have lost mine. The downhill road rarely turns up. Gresham's law in economics notes that if good money and bad money are in circulation at the same time, the bad money will drive the good money out of circulation.

I have read a couple of the Gor books, and they are their own genre, this is a totaly different expereince. While there are some of the same themes as in the Gor novels he is known for, this book has more than the Dominant male, female submissive overtones. Set in the Dakotas during the last decade of the 1800's, on the reservations and lands of the Native American Indians, it is very historical in nature, and you get caught up in the story, in the characters. Mr. Norman has in this book captured some of the feel of what that tenuous time in this country's history was like, especially between the Indians trying to save their people and culture, and the soldiers of the US government ordered to stamp it out.

I believe they will be easy to remedy-it's just annoying (especially after you have already cut the fabric). Another thing I noticed, is the suggested iron on vinyl, for water-profing the material, has to be ironed every time it is washed.

You get the idea that most of them would rather be doing secular music, but are just doing christian music because they did not make make it in mainstream music. Most (not all) of their favorite groups and songs were not christian music. Some of the answers were very surprising and disappointing, to say the least.

Applying this product topically presents two very significant problems: 1) The areas you apply it to become over-saturated quickly, which can cause a host of new problems, and 2) the cream rubs off on your clothing and bedding and also stays on your hands after application. Inevitably, it gets on others in your household, eventually entering the blood stream of those you live with including your husband, your children, and your pets. The trace amounts are unlikely to cause any deleterious effects, but if you use this cream as often as the instructions recommend, you are exceeding trace amounts for those around you.Internal methods of delivery are much safer, but again, no matter how you choose to address your peri-menopausal or menopausal challenges, consult a doctor before ordering anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I used the entire product and did not see a bit of difference.

I needed complete hormone supplementation after removal of uterus, ovaries, tubes and cervix. I used by prescription bioidentical compounded hormones. I tried oral progesterone (wasn't absorbing enough), transdermal progesterone (absorbed too much) so in addition to Bi Estrogen and Testosterone I also now use Pro-Gest so as not to be using unopposed estrogen and for progesterone's other benefits when one has had their ovaries removed.

I started out with the lowest dose possible and began having anxiety and headaches, so I reduced the dose to the size of a small pea. I tried to tough it out, thinking it was just because my body needed to get used to it. I got worse and worse to the point where I woke up in the middle of the night with a racing heart, and migraine and could not get back to sleep at all, which never happens to me. One day after I stopped this cream, I got a lot better. It was a horrible experience. Please check out askapatient.com and search for progesterone.

While the Pro-Gest was about 1/4 of the price, but it didn't seem to help me as much as Arbonne. The Pro-Gest cream was a lot thicker and stickier than the Arbonne, and it was more difficult to work into my skin. It seemed that the Arbonne help mellow out my moody PMS symptoms much better as well (I definitely noticed a difference with the Arbonne when I used it the last 14 days of my cycle). Plus I like the metered dosage pump with the Arbonne. So, I'm back to ArbonneArbonne Phytoprolief Natural Balancing Cream. It was worth a try, but I should've bought the small bottle to make sure it was going to work for me. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Emerita Pro-Gest Single use packets","review":"I received these on 9/3/22 and started using per directions right away. Not even one week and I have had no sweats. My hot flashes are very few and hardly noticable. This is the best thing that I have tried. Just started having some symptoms this past year. I had hot flashes and sweats in Nov /dec of 2010. My period returned for 6 months and was regular. My last period was lighter and then it stopped again. The hot flashes returned with sweats. (MY sweats were not that bad) I had to try something. These worked better than soy beverages, ground flax seed. I take 2 flax oil tabs daily and use this cream as directed. I am also sleeping better and am not irritable.I would highly recommend this to any woman in perimenopause.

Killing Floor immediately vaulted V.O.L. into my list of favorite bands. Bill M., is a poetic genius. His words get to the heart of the human condition. Fortunately he has always surrounded himself with talent musicians so the lyrics aren't lost in inanity.

KILLING FLOOR is one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of VOL's best","review":"Killing Floor is the last--and unquestionably the best--of VOL's early, psycho-folk period. The album is largely performed by only Bill Mallonee and Billy Holmes, but it feels like the most full of all of the band's albums. Holmes flavors the songs with mandolin, slide guitar, and even a trumpet, while Mallonee's lyrics are at once their most vitriol and go-for-the-jugular (\\"I could rape you with a single look / Kill you with a glance\\"), while at the same time their most fragile and personal (\\"Can you come and pick up another skeleton man? / I been cuttin' my wrists for a little sickness within\\"), often in the same song (these quotes are both from \\"Motel Room\\").The Vigilantes have reached these heights again, but never in the context of folk music. Killing Floor is the album that Jugular and Driving the Nails attempted to be, and if you're interested in early VOL, is the album to turn to."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album needs to be in your collection","review":"An important album in the evolution of an important band/songwriter; Bill Mallonee is a lyrical master. He's not perfect...he's not Dylan...and he doesn't try to be. But his words and music are genuine, heart-on-his-sleeve, no-punches-pulled.

I'm not a great writer so I hesitate to criticize anyone's work...but it must be done.This book is simplistic. The reader can easily see that it was written in the mid-80s, before content and quality became necessary in top-notch fantasy. Saberhagen takes different fantasy concepts, throws them into a blender and out comes the story.The biggest mistake is using a straight-forward narrative style. Saberhagen uses no more than 2 to 3 lines of dialogue per page. He covers immense amounts of action with only a few lines..completely removing any drama that could have been there.Additionally, the first 20 pages had some of the most atrocious grammer I've ever seen. Saberhagen liberally used the passive tense and sprinkled the pages with fragments and run-on sentences (I hate to point out the last two because I believe an author has the right to put them into his own work) To his credit, the book gets better. But it's still an inferior work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice reader for a great price!","review":"This inexpensive reader allows me to download images from my camera's SD memory card about 3 times faster than when connecting the camera.

Let me go ahead and make it official; to any real true ol'school Hip Hop head, This Is The Rap Joint Of The Year. The \\"Grind Date\\" personifies a lot of what Hip Hop was, is and still should be. Don't get me wrong, I like SOME of the stuff that's out now, but De La just took me \\"their\\" with this one. You can also find production by the sounds of Madlib, 9th Wonder, Dave West, J-Dilla and guest MCs like GhostFace, Common and MF Doom. With a line up like that, you have to give the CD a listen.

I expected the two songs I had already heard before this album dropped to be good (Much More, and Shopping Bags). But I didn't expect every song on the whole album to be this fresh. I love how De La lives outside of the trends just doing what they think is dope and not followin the leader like most of the stuff on the radio. The first track is off the chain \\"The Future\\", starts off slow but then it blows up, sick beat. Verbal Clap, Much More, Shopping Bags, The Grind Date and the rest of the album is off the hook, you will need a clean pair of shorts when you're done listening to this album. De La Soul, the true authors of hip hop, make DMX, Ludacris, and Jadakiss sound like elementary daycare MC's. Get this album, it better go triple platinum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage De La","review":"This KUBRAK clown from Israel who gave De La a bad review must be smoking some serious crack 'cause he obviously is clueless.

Man, I was thoroughly blown away by this album, and even more blown away when I saw who was handling some of the production, you got Madlib handling things on the lead single Shopping Bags (really dope track) J-Dilla blesses a couple of bangers too. This is definitley on my top 5 albums of 2004 list. Not a single track to skip, but the standouts include \\"Verbal Clap\\", \\"Shopping Bags\\", \\"Rock Co. Kane Flow\\"(Ft. my favorite MC MF DOOM) and my personal favorite \\"The Grind Date\\". I've been listening to De La since I was in the sixth grade and this is by far there best album to date, I mean I seriously got goosebumps when I first played this, I can't think of many albums that hit me like that.

It's very large, heavy and felt very substantial in your hand. If I were to take on a charging 300lb. wild boar in the backwoods of Alabama, this is the knife I'd use. The camo finish on the blade made the knife even more intimidating. Then my girlfriend grabbed the knife, felt the edge and laughed. This knife is not sharp, and requires extensive sharpening before it truly becomes a lethal weapon. The only other gripe is the handle is rather smooth, somewhat slippery and difficult to get a firm grip on. I suggest wrapping it with heavy duty adhesive tape prior to tackling any boars or zombies.

It's the perfect combination of \\"How To,\\" inspiration, and encouragement. In most writing books you can't find much real content; maybe one or two nuggets buried in the many pages.

It has history (Ottoman), romanic (illict), and drama (deathly ill child). I was hoping for more story about the end of the Ottoman Empire. What you get is lenghtly sentences on describing the \\"feelings\\" or \\"atmosphere,\\" and really little of a story. Everything exciting that happens in the story is told as events elsewhere. I enjoy novels with historica context and mystery; however, I found this story was a struggle to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book I've Ever Read","review":"This book is an embarassment to literature. The plot is porous and predictable and the character development laughable.

Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was hard to get into, although I wanted to see where it was going. I was disappointed with the main character, I wanted him to find some sort of redemption in the end, but he did not. I felt the book just ended with little conclusion. I felt sad and disappointed when it was over. I also thought the main character was very disrespectful to women and thought little of anyone other than himself. He could have created change for people, but he only thought of himself. Also none of the women had much depth. I did learn a lot about Constantinople in that time period, which was interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment After Sacred Hunger","review":"I loved Sacred Hunger. Like that book, this one is told in 2 parts, with 2 very distinct stories. Alas, both of the stories here are odd and disjointed.

But nothing to rival what Unsworth offers in his masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major league [let down]","review":"Well, I just got back from [a local store] and prepared to try out my [new] gadget.

It needs to be plugged into a USB port that's part of the motherboard. I loaded 5 songs onto the device and plugged in the new ear bud Sony headphones that I just purchased. Garbled sound, actually sound on one side only. I messed with the plug moving it slightly out of the device and was able to get sound in both ears. It sounded great, but when I pushed the headphone connector all the way in I only got sound from one side. I figured it might be the connector on the Sony headphones so I connected the super cheesy headphones that came with the player. Same result. Now I have to waste my time taking this [thing] back for a refund. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor customer service","review":"Stay away the product.... the headset connector is lousy. it is not compatible with MS winddows player.

It was very nice for a few months but then accidently it broke. So then I got the intel mp3 player. The day I recieved it, i opened it hooked it all together turned it on and tryed to download a song. AS SOON AS I STARTED TO DOWNLOAD IT SAID FAIL FAIL!! So I called teck suport and they said all you can do is take it back. How stuped!!. All I need to say is dont buy this product!! get another. I was stuped anough to not lissen to the reviews and buy it, but lissen to this. Until they get new software for it STAY AWAY!! Thats all"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within the first week","review":"Despite the cumbersome software, thought it was great- until it broke after only one week. So far, Intel customer service has been helpful and because they have no more players in stock, are working on getting me a refund. I may even purchase a second player with the cash- can't find a comparable product on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as I had read","review":"Great player! I had it up and running in about 10 mins (and I'm only average on the technical scale). The sound quality is great (although some hissing between tracks...doesn't really bother me very much). I did not like the headphones...they were bulky and did not sit very well around my head. I purchased others with the player and they work fine. Regarding the radio tuner....I had read that it didn't have great reception....I disagree big time! I work in the middle of a huge office tower where I have spotty cell phone reception and (as I'm listening to the radio as I write this) the radio comes in very clearly. I live in Pgh, PA so in cities of this size and bigger, you should be fine. I would recommend the accessory kit, I bought the player alone and wish I had the cradle and rechargeable batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good device, with one small problem","review":"The only problem that I have is the fact that there is no simple way to modify the order of the songs on the player.

I called customer support and because they no longer make these, there is no support.

Personally, I like the design of the Rio a little better, but the player was a piece of junk. I've been very happy with the Intel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I, like another reviewer, also waited for the right MP3 player to come along. The Pocket Concert has great sound, intuitive controls, and an FM reciever. I consider the FM a big plus just for the option it presents. Had the player for a few days and it seems to be of top quality construction. Only one small problem in installation. If the device gets listed twice in your device manager, you may have to update one of your USB controller files. Fortunately, Intel was smart enough to include this update on the included CD. I think you would be pleased with this MP3 player."},{"rating":"1","title":"software drivers","review":"Just purchased this device on Feb 9,2001. Unable to use as the software provided doesn't have drivers for XP Operating sytem. Unable to download from website and told that not available on CD. Apparently my DSL line preventing this somehow. I haven't had this happen with any other website. I am now trying to get a friend to download and send them to me in an email. Intel help desk said this would work. Somehow this seems to leave a lot to be desired. The device works fine and one day soon I'll get to use all of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intel Still Needs Work","review":"Long story short. The amp began clipping at all levels 60 days after purchase. Customer service was impossible to get in touch with and was grossly unhelpful even when you found a living person. Returned for replacement and it will be 30 days before I get another. This is added to the fact that Intel keeps attempting to disclaim my valid rebate.Ultimately, this is a very sad product. Technically, it is wonderfully designed with first rate sound. Alas, poor build quality and a customer service department manned by people woefully inadequate for the task, doom this product. Intel is not ready to deal directly with consumers yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Problem Was My Problem","review":"One reviewer mentioned a problem with the headphone jack and the inability to make a solid connection. I thought my unit had the same problem, which even led me to return it (twice). I finally discovered that I wasn't pushing in the headphone connector firmly enough. Once you do that, the connection is VERY solid. Couldn't be happier with the performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not great","review":"read a lot of review before I bought this mp3 player. I have to say I am a little bit dissapointed. well-designed outlook, easy-to-use software. But as a mp3 player, it lacks the most important feature, CD-like playback quality. Unless you turn up volume, you will find hissing sound very annoying. I don't know if this is because of decoder or output amplifier, I guess it's both. good for gym and jogging though, since you are not going to notice that in noisy environment. I was going to rate it 3 star, but think about the price and the memory, I give it 4 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the Best MP3 player around! Buy the whole package.","review":"The player is amazing! It is as small as a pager and thinner than most cell phones. The sound quality is great and I can fit 40 - 50 songs on it. Transferring a 5MB file to it only takes 10 to 20 seconds. The FM radio comes in very clear as well. I would recommend that you buy the charger and adapter package with it because if you are going to use it a lot the batteries only last for 10 hours. Rechargable batteries come with it but the charger is sold separately. I am very happy with my purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pocket Concert Delivers","review":"I've waited for this product to come out before buying an mp3 player. It was worth it. The sound is great, the software is easy to use. The UI could be better thought out. Sometimes buttons one would think scroll through songs don't. This just takes some getting used to. I would have liked a line out jack. I also expected it to be a little smaller. The size is ok, though. If you want a good player for a great price, consider buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a product for active users...","review":"I purchased this item a little over a year ago and, while I was satisfied with it's performance when it worked, I have been thoroughly disappointed by the fact that it has had to be replaced FIVE TIMES.I only use the product while running and it seems that it can't hold up to being jostled around at all. It works for a few runs, but eventually the program freezes. Once you get the \\"Player error\\" screen of death, there's no hope and the player has to be returned.Luckily, Intel has fessed up to the problem and is refunding me in full despite the lag since I purchased it. I just wanted to let any unsuspecting consumers out there know that while it's great if you want to listen while you're sitting still, it's not a product for active users."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for MP3","review":"This unit has some pluses and some minuses. On the plus side is the ease of use, memory, the basic software, belt clip, and sound. The minuses are radio reception is mediocre at best, it takes too long to transfer songs in that you have to do this one song at a time, unless you put things in separate folders first, You can't rearrange the music once you've downloaded it, the volume button is not sensitive enough. All in all I am glad I bought the unit and for airplane travel it will be great. However, I feel,the search for the perfect unit is still ongoing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Player, But Extinct","review":"Had I known that Intel would cease production of its mp3 player line a year after releasing it, I would have bought something else.

This Intel player is now dated and obsolete, especially for the price.[Old Review]Strong Points: 128 MB of RAM Good battery life Nice form factor and design Much better headphone amp than averageWeak Points: VERY POOR Radio reception. RAM is non-expandable. Intel Audio Manager does not include file compression capabilities, so your 128 MB doesn't give you as many songs as the equivalent RAM on a Rio if you use Rio Audio Manager's file compression capabilities when transferring to the portable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Great","review":"I was debating whether to get the Nomad Jukebox or the Intel PocketConcert. The Nomad Jukebox can store 6 GB of songs, but it is not designed for mobile use (DiscMan size, 14 ounces). So I got the Intel PocketConcert. I knew the PocketConcert was small and lightweight (3 ounces), but I was surprised at how small the size was. The PocketConcert is slightly bigger than a large lighter. Also, 128 MB is enough storage space for a good selection of songs. I currently have 28 songs stored. The Intel AudioManager makes it fairly easy to update the selections on your PocketConcert. Overall, what I bought will keep me happy for several years. By then, we should have an mp3 player that is less than 3 ounces and can store more than 6 GB of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound and design","review":"I chose this after a lot of research and use it primarily to got jogging or walking. Very impressive design. Great sound from the headphones. Very comfortable. Usability is high --- all of the buttons make sense. I love it. I'm using it to play WMA files. (Which, oddly enough, some sites claim that it doesn't do. Trust me --- mine does.) It has everything I need and no goofy stuff.(voice recording, ships with all the memory I need, etc)I also love that the dock serves as a recharger with ordinary NiMH rechargables. Great, great thinking. (Or just use standard AAA)My only complaint is that it doesn't integrate with Windows Media Player. I really don't want to go to a different place to manage my playlists. (And usability of the playlists in MusicMatch is pretty low.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome product!","review":"The Pocket Concert lived up to all expectations. Very easy to learn how to use. The audio guide walks you through all the Pocket Concert features. Software was a cinch to install and the Intel Audio Manager program is so easy to use that even anyone that got voted off \\"The Weakest Link\\" first can figure it out easily. MusicMatch is also very easy to learn how to use. All said and done the Pocket Concert is the most \\"user friendly\\" electronic product I have ever purchased. I highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Novel from one of New Zealand's best writers","review":"Craig Harrison's first novel is an excellent example of his work.

But Craig adds in the impact of a fascist and racist government, an interferring superpower and a scandel to create a flashpoint in the \\"peaceful\\" country. Following the introduction of Apartheid Maori terrorists steal the Treaty and attempt to fight to reclaim Aotereroa (New Zealand). Craig builds the suspense well.

And would like to add RABID FANS ONLY! I thought the band would be cool from their appearance in the movie strangeland. DVD had 2 very amateurish mtv style videos of \\"In league\\" and \\"Love stinks\\". The rest is video taken from fans in live concerts...yes that good of quality. In the studio with a camcorder. Nothing interesting there. And a few interviews. Live the Band looked like hip hop singers with the amazing gimmick of wearing ski masks (WTF?). Overall, a very embarrassing effort for this DVD. My advice is, Rent Slipknot and stick with some real winners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fern Flowering","review":"We loved this novel...dear lovers of magical fiction,... by Graham Joyce. This is the story of Fern who has been raised to be a midwife and an herbalist and an old fashion hedge witch who comes smack into conflict with 1960's England and a fast changing world. The magic here is less dramatic than you'll find in Charles DeLint's, or Holly Black's, or Maggie Stiefvater's novels, but is, in its way, all the more potent for being subtle and real. The characters are alive, and we feel as though we could, or in some cases, do know them. Highly recommended, particularly if you like Alice Hoffman's books.We had read one of Graham Joyce's novels previouslyThe Tooth Fairy: A Novel, which led us to this one. Now, because of this story we will read all the rest he's written.kyela,the silver elves"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as the original Hackers soundtrack","review":"I meant to purchase the original soundtrack, but accidentally selected this one instead.Very disappointing.

Perfume counter clerk, Melody Parris, fills out a wish list at the urging of a friend, and when her friend puts it in Santa's mailbox, her wishes start to come true, but not without a little trouble along the way. She also learns to be assertive and not to settle for less than she really wants or deserves out of life. Melody may be a late bloomer, but she gets where she wants to be in the end, which makes for a very happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Please!","review":"This is an amazing movie that I desperately want to watch throughout the year, not just when I can find it on TV around Christmas time.

One that comes out of nowhere to be a bit of rousing entertainment. One that is pure fun from beginning to end. Well folks, When A Stranger Calls is NOT that movie. It is an unbelievable stupid and far fetched remake of the much better 1979 horror camp classic. Our lead heroine Jill is forced to babysit after going over her cell phone minutes and is harassed by telephone calls from a mysterious caller. Every clich�� in the world is used here from the stupid cat-jumping-out-of-a-hidden-spot to the car that won't start to the killer can be anywhere at anytime. This movie is bad...not even bad in a \\"so bad it's good way\\" more in a \\"so bad it's boring way.\\" Skip this godawful film and save your movie for something else. You'll thank me later, trust me on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was pleasantly surprised","review":"I really liked this movie! It is a little predictable, but then again, what horror movie isn't? I am a huge horror movie fan and have watched so many, some over and over, that it takes a lot to scare me. But this movie did really creep me out. I thought this was a really good remake of a good older film. With all the disappointing remakes that are coming out nowadays, this one was a breath of fresh air for me and I can say it was just as good as the first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT DATE MOVIE!","review":"Ok so I went on a date to see this movie, and loved it... it was a lot of fun to jump with the quick scares and make fun of the stupid baby sitter..I always thought this was a GREAT story and the remake is creepy as hell.. I love how when the killer shows up you never see his face.. even if he is right there.. until the very end..I think what could make this movie better would have been if they could have Completely kept the punchline hidden until time to reveal.. the whole \\"THE CALL IS COMING FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE\\" they should have left that out of the preview.. there are some people who didn't know that was coming.. and If they never showed the killers face even at the end.. just keep it creepy and scary..but yeah!ok laterpeace out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked at how terrible it turned out to be.","review":"When A Stranger Calls has few scares and more bores. The story follows Jill, a high-school student who decides to baby-sit for a doctor's little boy and girl. While she is pulling an all nighter on baby-sitting, she starts getting prank calls from somebody, of whom she thimks is her boyfriend. The man turnes out to be someone else, but he won't say who. All he can say is, \\"have you checked the children?,\\" which is terrifying...at first. The film hardly explains anything, and it's an hour and a half of Camilla Belle running around, talking to the guy. This unexplained, dull, so-called \\"horror\\" film, is more of a bore. If I were you, I might even reconsider renting this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that scary.","review":"Believe me. I saw this movie when I was 12. (I am now 14) I also saw this movie recently. Both times I found it very disapointing. It really isn't that scary. I has an awesome plot, though. But, like I said, not really that scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"It well deserves one star rating.","review":"And I don't mean zero stars or negative stars, I meant one full shining star for eerie soil-your-pants type of music pervasively played throughout the movie.

That house is all there is to redeem this garbage.I gave this one star only because I there is no option for no or negative stars which this deserved.Save your money and buy the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"great service","review":"fast service, I ordered this product and another product the same day and I recieved this product first. movie was in perfect condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you enjoy looking at nice houses than this movie is for you.","review":"Only thing good about this movie and probably the most money spent to make this movie is either buying or renting the house in the movie that probably belongs to britney spears. Only reason I mention her is because the guy keeps saying \\"have you checked the children?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The problem with this movie was the acting. The setting was eerie but the actors seemed to just be asked off the streets if they wanted to star in a movie. None of them seemed to have any experince in acting. The movie was over after twenty minutes when I found out they had a maid. They hired a babysitter and they have a maid, see the problem? All in all, im glad I watched this on tv rather then rent or buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"When did Hollywood lose all traces of originality and new ideas","review":"PLEASE,PLEASE,PLEASE, AND ONE MORE TIME PLEASE, Hollywood stop remaking every movie ever made and give us something new. For every remake that works we get 15 of these duds that trash the memory of the original.We all know the story by now so I'll not waste time on plot(much like the makers of this half baked remake) and say that what worked in the 70's doesn't work here. This misses the target by a mile.NO MORE REMAKES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The first one wasnt that great but this one is way worse. It makes the first one look like a classic. It has a little bit of a different plot than the original. This was stupid. This gets worst movie of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch This Only Once......But Don't Buy It","review":"First of all I suggest you see the original 1979 film. It is more gritty and true to a real horror/terror film.The studio should not have wasted money on this silly remake. The babysitter in this movie just walks from room to room looking scared but nothing ever happens till the last ten or twenty minutes of the movie. It's so wimpy of Hollywood to not even have any violence or bloody scenes in this movie. Why play it safe to make box office? Obviously it doesn't work because this movie flopped. So be warned. Rent it don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not scary till the end","review":"This movie is good. I do recommend everyone to see it. The only problem is it didn't get scary till the end. Still a good movie though."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are remakes that improve upon the original...","review":"... and then there's movies like this year's WHEN A STRANGER CALLS.This movie did not take the frightening yet realistic premise of the original 1970s horror classic and update it for modern tastes, a la the new HILLS HAVE EYES and this summer's OMEN remake. Instead, they just dumbed it down, cast an ineffective lead and took away what made the original so chilling, namely the sadistic violence, which was seldom seen in the original, but used effectively when on-screen.To say this remake was unnecessary would be a gross understatement. If you want to watch WHEN A STRANGER CALLS, buy the 1970s original starring Carol Kane. It's scarier, better acted and more well-written than this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to these bad reviews...","review":"Please don't listen to all these bad reviews this is a great movie and expirience to watch. It was so good that even my grandma liked it. well anyways watch it and then say what you think. That is why I gave it a five star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollow In Every Way","review":"The original was a below average movie with about twenty minutes of the scariest moments in film history. I watched this version with an open mind, just hoping for a few bright spots. I found the movie to be a complete waste of time in every way. Every scene is predictable and exploitative. There is no reason to watch it. The traditional notions of artistic merit are sacrificed in favor of melodramatic fluff. Cheap thrills galore but no substance or originality. Just a bunch of innocuous sound effects, and silly, tedious telephone conversations with an unrealistic stranger. The leading actress, Camilla Belle, is pretty good, and does the best she can with a poor script."},{"rating":"2","title":"worthy--3.5 stars","review":"worthy remake for a change-I am surprised how good this movie is, tracing the genre back to the 70's and 80's and before camera work MTV style, this was refreshing. moves the story to present day and does keep the spirit of suspense over gore. my only concern is for the younger generation who never had a chance to see music, mood and camera shots to invoke scares/jolts. you could say that the story drags and takes its time building but that is the point of this movie-not just killing for blood and effect. there are fast cuts and sure aweebit more gore. I love blood and body counts as much as the other viewers. worthy of seeing, maintains story but does have a different ending. lighting, shadowing pulsing score and genuine scares make it riveting--it does update to present technology and is filmed in a nice atmospheric house--SPOOKY"},{"rating":"1","title":"What could be around the corner...........OH NOTHING at all","review":"Well this movie was quite a disappointment. All it was, was the babysitter, Jill, looking around every part of the house, and finding NOTHING. Extremley disappointing. COuld have been a whole lot better. The ending is extremly corny as well. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I never even bothered to watch this joke of a movie. Just get yourself the original with Charles Durning and Carol Kane. The first 20 minutes of the original is still one of the most chilling and horrifying sequences in film I have ever seen. I could tell from the trailers for the remake that it just used the name of the original and that was it. I truly wish there could be a law that would prevent films being remade but I just don't go see them and I'm fine with that. Watch the original with actors who can actually act and you'll have yourself a nice scare and will probably be jumping every time your phone rings for a while after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead out of the gate....","review":"This movie never really had a chance, because the previews for it tell you before you ever see it that the caller is inside the house. That and the fact that it was a remake basically kills the premise, because as soon as the stranger of the title starts calling you know where he is, and it becomes an exercise in frustration because you know everything that the girl doesn't, so there's no tension because you end up just sitting there waiting for her to find out what you knew before you sat down. The original worked because they left some secrets for you to find out in the end, but this one seems to be trying hard to keep it under wraps when everyone already knows. And if you already know the biggest part of the movie going in, then what's the point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"cruel and unusual punishment","review":"i think the only way my dvd experience with this movie could have been worse is if the movie had turned out to be another AOL disc! This bit of overblown schlock was not worth the one star i gave it, but they don't have negative stars for these reviews. the acting was rigid, unimaginative, and less interesting than watching paint dry. the only good feature of the movie was the house itself, although, if i was the architect who designed it, i think i would sue for having a cool structure like that used in such a travesty of film.if anyone tries to get you to watch this movie, run away from them, if anyone gives you this movie, throw it at them and run away, if anyone forces or tricks you into watching this movie, i would suggest bringing them up on charges of attempted murder... you will never get that time of your life back... they will have effectively murdered two hours of your precious life."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST movie I've seen in years!","review":"And believe me, I've seen a lot. And I've seen all the horror flicks, and this one is just atrocious. No plot, ZERO suspense, horrible acting, bad directing...please, save your money and your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody answer the phone!","review":"A girl with bushy eyebrows takes a babysitting job in a mansion in the middle of nowhere and is stalked by a lunatic. She calls the cops and they find the call is coming from inside the house. The build up to the action took to long and the ending was lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense and creepy movie!","review":"Out of all the horror movies I've seen, this is definitely one of my favorites. It's intense, creepy, thrilling, and more. I don't know why it got so much negativity, but I guess this film is more directed as scary towards younger people like kids and teenagers. I think it's way better than \\"One Missed Call\\" or anything stupid and unrealistic like that. I think it's a very good remake with great acting and terrifying suspense. The ending is also really creepy, and I love it. One of the best horror movies of the 2000-2009 decade in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unplug the phone","review":"The previews for this movie looked good, but I was mistaken. The ringing of the phone in the movie drove me nuts, their has been scenes in Scream that got me by the edge of my seat, but this one just bugged me. No real known actors in this except for Tessa Thompson from Veronica Mars for about 5 minutes throughout the whole movie. And Camilla Belle was decent in this, just not a good script, I was wanting to fast forward through the movie just to end it. The Grudge spooked me for a PG-13 movie, but this PG-13 movie was more for 13 year olds and younger."},{"rating":"1","title":"....Terrible movie","review":"I went into this movie with such hope that the movie would be good. But it was actually the worst thing I've ever seen. The scares in this movie were cheap and few and far between. The movie tried to scare the audience with the loud noises of birds flying, a cat jumping, and a sprinkler starting. The movie tried so hard but failed. One thing this movie does is make you think about how a big guy could kill several people but when put up against one young, seemingly weak teenage girl, is fought against fairly well. This movie is the reason why the horror genre is going down. Camilla Belle's performance was one good thing about the movie. It had several good concepts but those and the lead actress couldn't save the movie from a weak script. Save your money and go see something good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Top 10 worst movies i have seen","review":"This was a disgrace to all movies pretty much.

Nothing happened almost the whole time! I paid $10 to watch a girl pace around a creeky house for 2 hours, then get chased for 5 minutes at the end. There were no \\"scares\\" until literally the last ten minutes of the movie, which weren't even scarey! It was ridiculous. The tense scenes before then all kept ending up to be nothing, like her friend stopping by the house to say hello or the cat knocking something over. Do not see this movie if your expecting a good horror flick. Not even the music is scarey! Come on."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding!!!","review":"There were many characters that did NOTHING for the movie. The boyfriend who cheated with the mains character's best friend did nothing. The best friend who apologized by saying \\"I'm just a b*tch\\" was a poor addition to the \\"plot\\". The characters in movies are all suppose to tie into the story and most didn't.I was waiting for the mystery to start and it didn't. They closed with some guy we hadn't seen at all as being determined as crazy....hmmm...... why would that be interesting?\\"A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"worst horror movie ever.","review":"I stand corrected on Red Eye being the worst horror movie. This movie's plot is so simple and stupid and basically goes nowhere throughout the whole movie. I have honestly never seen a weak a movie as this. They stall time on the stupid phone calls that keep coming over and over again and her just walking around the house looking around. And then the weakest conclusion ever to the stupidest horror ever. Don't go for the hype. It's not a thriller at all. Just a stupid simple little plot that is extremely boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it was going to be good","review":"I dont fell like writing a review i just going to say it , it was not good , it was probaly the worst movies of 2005, i like the original better , it was more blood and killing , and they didnt stay in the house the whole time like the new one , this movie is booooooooring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!And I waste 7.50 Ah did you know they are bringing out a new Texas Chainsaw in october 2006"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST REMAKE EVER!!!!","review":"This has got to be one of the best horror movies of the year.Camilla Belle is so HOT!!!i'm buying the first day..."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S PRETTY SCARY...","review":"THIS MOVIE WAS SUSPEND, SCARY AND INTERESTING.

If you have enough metallurgical knowledge to know what is correct and what processing techniques are good, then you don't need this book.

I am VERY disappointed in the product and hope they fix it before next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"good program so far","review":"Have only used it a few times, but it loaded easily and seems easy to navigate through the various menus.

What did they do to it? The program itself is pretty good but where is the content? Under ready designed cards only Anniversary, Birthday, Best Wishes, Congratulations, Announcements. WHAT ABOUT CHRISTMAS, VALENTINES DAY, GRADUATION, EASTER, NEW BABY, ETC. Also very poor assortment of graphics the box says 19,500 images REALLY, the old windows version says 280,000 and it has cards for every occasion you could think of and it's 10 years old!

As soon as a new version came out, I bought it. So when I got my iMac of course I had to have Print Shop on it also. I was disappointed to find out that Broderbund did not have a version for the Mac. But another company did, so I was happy and purchased it. Needless to say I was very disappointed with the Mac compatible version. I don't even know why they would call it Print Shop. It is almost a completely different program. The great thing about this program that the Window Program doesn't have, is that you can open two pages at the same time and transfer images from page to another. It is also really slow. I really wish I could get the Windows version for my Mac."},{"rating":"2","title":"PS 2 is a hit!","review":"Believe it or not, one of the reasons it took me years to switch from PC to Mac was the Print Shop series of card-making programs that I had used for 15 or more years...I couldn't find it's equivalent on Mac. While this isn't apples-to-apples (I was using Print Shop 23 Deluxe for PC), it comes close in features and use. I make all my own greeting, sympathy, birthday, Christmas, etc. cards and had never found another program that allowed me to make cards so easily in the sizes and of the quality I wanted. I use my own photos and write my own scripts.

What's really neat is that you can drag and drop your iPhotos right on to the card. Printmaster is nowhere near as easy. Photoshop Elements is a nightmare when it comes to producing a greeting card.

I can't imagine an easier way to make posters, address labels, post cards and calendars. It seems like there are less graphics to choose from but that is probably due to the ability to download from the internet. All in all I do like this program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"I purchased this software to replace PrintMaster after having moved from PC to Mac to make school flyers and kids bday cards.

The clip art is substandard & the text and photo tools are less effective that Paint in Microsoft. How this got called a \\"professional\\" upgrade is beyond me.

If he did, he would have introduced some action or suspense into this deadly dull novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a dective novel fan","review":"But I really enjoyed this novel! I think it popped up when I put synesthesia into Amazon search. I took a chance and bought it.I really liked this book. The characters were very multidimensional, and intriguing.

Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best by far","review":"I feel a bit of an outsider here reading the other reviews...I am a BIG fan of Parker and loved his other recent work, soI looked forward to The Fallen. However, I did not like this book. I found it slow and plodding, without much by way of a plot. Somewhere along the line, I stopped caring about who themurderer could be amid all the talk, talk, talk, the watching videos,the failed marriages, why he changed his tie, dear God, I was glad to finally just get the bad guy although it was such a contrived and silly scene. And then he couldn't end the book!! It went on and on after all was (I had hoped) said anddone.

Jefferson Parker before, but I will probably do so in the future. This is a book that will keep the reader entertained throughout.It features Robbie Brownlaw who is a San Diego homicide detective with an unusual form of synesthesia, a condition that allows him to see colored shapes when people are talking and functions sort of like a 'primitive lie detector'. The author uses this plot device without overdoing it.There are numerous twists and turns and several possible suspects in the death of a city ethics investigator with lots of enemies. Parker manages to keep the guessing going to the end.I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fallen","review":"The Fallen keeps you as a fan of T. Parker.

However, the author tries way too hard to make the concept of the Hinge Factor work. In fact, most of the battles he lists have dozens of stupid points and no one hinge factor. The hinge concept is contrived and strained. Also, the battle descriptions are sometimes good and sometimes difficult to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining History for All","review":"Erik Durschmied has been able to do what many other authors, professors, and historians have not been able to do and that is make history captivating in the most subtle and fluid way! His discriptions of the battles are concise and easily followed. Durschmied gives such insight to these battles and shows how the smallest things can truly have the greatest impact on war. The book is easily read and is suitable for anyone in highschool up to the most seasoned historical reader. There is nothing quite like reading how a bottle of schnaps, a slap in the face, or the death of one way could all change the course of a battle, a war, and even history. It is these quirks which will draw you in but it is the great historical battles which will leave you feeling entertained and searching for more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needless","review":"While this book is somewhat interesting, I was greatly distracted by the endless grammer mistakes and typos (General Sumner occasionally becomes \\"General Summer\\", etc.) and, to a larger extent, the fact that this book is outdone in length, style, and execution by other books, such as the Guiness Book of Military of Blunders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Written and Full of Errors.","review":"This book was a failure on virtually every front.The author simply did not pay attention to basic facts. For example, in his chapter on the Battle of Tanga he referred to the battle as \\"the initial battle in Africa's share of the First World War\\" (November 1914). This is wrong. There was fighting in the Cameroons in August of 1914, in South West Africa (todays Namibia) in September of 1914, and so forth.He also suggests that if the Battle of Tanga had turned out \\"differently\\" the \\"World War, African Segment\\" would have been finished in 1914. This ignores numerous other battles in other parts of Africa (for example the \\"Lakes Region\\" and South West Africa) which lasted well after 1914.These factual errors are compounded by the errors in language. Throughout the book inappropriate slang is used, and the writing style is rather \\"breathless\\" and \\"sensational\\". He tends to describe various individuals as \\"moving like a beetle\\".It isn't worth the time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid, accurate, History Book","review":"The Hinge Factor is the most solid What-If book I have read to date. It gives an interesting perspective, in simple literature, on how some of Histories most important battles might have gone differantly had leaders used more common sense.

I particularly enjoyed the chapter on the Battle of Agincourt."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hinge factor by Eric Durschmied","review":"The author has written another book \\"From Armagaddon to fall of Rome\\" In it there is a very serious factual error. On Chapter on Alexander the grea, he has hinted strorngly that one of his generals, four Lysamachus, was responsible for establishing Mauryan dynasty of India. Also that Emperor Asoka was \\" involved in the foundation\\"Both of these assertions are factually incorrect.Mauryan empire was founded by Chandragupta and in fact he defeated general Selucas deep inside Indiain view of such errors, it is difficult to place reliance on other facts provided by the author in his books re happenings in early times."},{"rating":"2","title":"An escape into bliss","review":"A great CD with wonderful compilation of tracks, each track building upon the other.

I found this book very helpful, it set out major points, and the basic philosophy of the most important philosophers from pre-socratic times up into the present. It is one of the few history of philosophy textbooks to include philosophers who are still living today, and most people haven't heard of (e.g. Quine). I appreciated the way in which Strumpf sets up the philosophies in referance to the past, as well as its respective present. The book was just a bit dry, but it was chock full o' info.

Then when the DVD came out I was curious to see all of it, and before long we were all hooked! It really is addicting. Don't watch it to get an accurate picture of the pony express--that's not its purpose. Its purpose is to provide a great show that celebrates a piece of Americana, while throwing in some familiar legendary characters for fun! Before long you feel like you know these people--that's evidence of well-written characters and a great story line.

Most of the stories were just variations on tired old situations that have been done to death in older series.We are supposed to believe that these kids are pony express riders in Wyoming, but the scenes in all the episodes, except the pilot, are filmed in Arizona.

Gentelman new a little bit more but couldn't help fix the issue. Said it would be elevated to level 3 which would require someone to call me back within 48 hours. It has been 1 week with no call. Went to Micro-Center and bought an RCA rf modualtor, plugged it in and it worked. Took less than 1 minute. Threw the Belkin away. For the $20 not worth anymore of my time.

With both devices, the picture jumps slightly up and down randomly. But with this modulator, there's also sometimes a brightness fluctuation in a band across the middle of the picture.And this modulator does a bad job of passing through digital TV antenna signals. With the power disconnected I was able to receive all the channels through the modulator that I normally get. With the power connected, only one came through. This won't be a problem for most people since they'll be using it with old, analog TVs.I'm going to keep using the old VCR rather than this modulator. It isn't worth returning, so I'll keep it as a back-up to the old VCR.

It concerns three artists who have shared their lives together, including apartments and studios and the affections for one woman.The play is funny, witty like so much of Stoppard, absurd and in concluding a bit sad. I would love to see this performed and recommend it as a read too.If this was to be produced on stage I would say there are some complex technical necessities.

I was floored to find that these books were being marketed to the Nancy Drew reader. Many naive parents who purchase this series would be quite surprised at their content. Do you really want your child to be reading how Nancy Drew \\"sexily smiled\\" at a stranger? Parents who fondly remember days snuggled up under the cover with a good Nancy Drew book will randomly pick up this series expecting the same good mystery and wholesome read.

First off this book is totally different from all his other books (BIG DISAPPOINTMENT THERE), second the characters are severly undeveloped, third it took entirely too long for the story to unfold. Last, I didn't understand why he kept referring back to Rev Daddy and momma. That part was so unnessary he should have used that wasted space to give more insight on the main characters.

What's up with the dread obsession????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kudos to EJD!","review":"As an avid reader I must admit that I have become a little bored with the \\"cookie-cutter\\" novels that a lot of authors have been putting out lately. It seems like if you have read one you have read them all.EJD, however, has stepped outside of this comfort zone and done a wonderful job of breaking the mold in his last few books. Drive Me Crazy takes a week in the like of Driver, and ex-con whose past affair with Lisa, a former LAPD officer, comes back to haunt him.Driver's tale includes some really interesting characters including his gay brother Rufus, Panther the stripper that wins his heart and Arizona, the soon to be Queen of the Cons.This book is a little lengthy and drawn out but picks up in the end and you find yourself rooting for Driver's escape. If you are looking for a good read that isn't a ho-hum love story, I definitely recommend this one.KpSister-2-Sister Book Club"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best he's written","review":"Before this, I thought the Other Woman was his best book.

I felt compelled to finish it since I had paid the full price for a newly released hardback book. It is filed with intense violence. Lie after lie coupled with MORE violence. The characters were not fully developed; I hated nearly everyone in the whole book with the exception of Sid. Who could like Lisa??? Panther telling Driver that she could be any kind of woman that he wanted her to be?? That statement alone set the women's movement back 25 years. I was ok with Rufus for a while, but come on he soon followed all the others in the book and went downhill.Where is the man that wrote Friends and Lovers, The Other Woman, and Cheaters? Is he gone forever??"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fast Read","review":"The plot was pretty good. I had a question or two about the ending which left me a little confused. Seem to be two stories in one. If you are an aspiring writer, one of the characters in this book is a writer. It gives the reader an insider's view on what it takes to publish a book. It (publishing process) was somewhat discouraging. Despite MY confusion, as to the end of the story, it was a joy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"driving me crazy","review":"I have never received the book driving me crazy by Eric Jerome Dicky.

Yes, I know it's done to create impact and drama, but towards the end, this was overused and annoying. As it was, it took nearly half the book to even have a sense of caring for any of the characters, but I definitely didn't need EJD's constant reminder of the 'drama' unfolding through his one-word sentence technique. Finally, as the story started to truly hit some high points, it abruptly came to an end. And yes I also get the reasoning for its sudden end, yet I still expect more from EJD, not just his commitment to the genre he's writing about. Maybe I'm just more inclined to his earlier books, I didn't like Thieves' Paradise either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept Me Wondering........","review":"I LOVED Drive Me Crazy!

He is a talented author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor book, lacks the reality of the srtipping scene","review":"I have been a stripper for the past 6 years and I can honestly say this is a stupid book. The author does nothing to depict the truth.

How much can you really cover in 3 months? There are more than 100 great strip clubs in America. What the book doesn't cover is the high number of prostitution, sex, drugs, alcohol and screwed up women who work in these clubs, even the upscale ones. It also doesn't cover how many of these women will go out of their way to alter their bodies to have bigger or tighter body parts, or the danger or risks these women put themselves in.Yes it talks about the patrons, but it should talk about what it does to the women working to please us men!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Durant is one of my favorite historians...","review":"I recommend the whole Story of Civilization set. I've got all eleven. Durant is a brilliant writer and macrohistorian. His approach delves deep into the era with more than just a mere political or social history. I bought the set after my history professor recommended it some time ago. He covers Western Civilization and European history with an in-depth clarity that no historian of the 20th century can match. If you like history, don't pass on Will Durant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Historian, great history","review":"After the long Middle Ages, finally there comes the Renaissance. Like all Durant's other books, this one is very good. Like always, you get everything besides history. This is also a nice treat for the Art student. There too many figures to keep track of though. The reader must read carefully and make many mental notes of names. You get some interesting biographical accounts of all the Renaissance masters. The price of the book is good too. The work provides a good background to the casuses of the Reformation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bye-Bye Mustard","review":"Mustard is a playful cat that has been with Alex's family for 14 years.

This is quite simply one of those situations. Darkwave is my favorite genre, and this is something altogether wrong. I must regretfully say I'd rather listen to Marilyn Manson, which isn't saying much. The atmosphere of the music changes too erratically. The lack of cohesion found is immense. If my ears will never rest upon these melodies again it will be too soon. In fact, my ears are currently recouperating via Dead Can Dance. Please make sure to listen to all of the samples and be ABSOLUTELY sure this is right down your alley, or you make regret its purchase as I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"The samples for this CD are wrong...","review":"I think the other reviewer listened to the samples above which aren't right. I have no idea what the listing above is for, but it isn't the Goth Witch Project. The samples are for some other CD and not even a goth one.This CD set has a good mix of the old, like Sex Gang Children, with the new like Suspiria. It isn't the best goth rock out there, but it is a good selection and well priced for someone wanting to listen to a lot of bands for less money.I really enjoy bands like Theatre of Hate and 13 Candles, who are featured here. Please don't listen to the samples above to decide, since they aren't even the same CD. Maybe you can search the bands and find samples on iTunes or their websites. Maybe someone on Amazon can fix this problem! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A poignant look at death and friendship","review":"This movie is incredibly touching. There are really two stories here. The first is a portrayal of a woman facing imminent death with dignity and grace, and who continues to live life as fully as possible. The second story is one of friendship. Martha, the elderly woman, makes her home available to her visiting nurse so that the younger woman can carry on an affair with a married man. Martha laments that her son \\"married the wrong woman...most of them do\\" and this leads her to sympathize with the young lovers. In return, the nurse is the only one who understands and defends Martha's need for independence and control over her declining health. The story of the friendship between the two women, who have come to deeply love each other, is beautiful to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, reliable all purpose sauce pan","review":"This is a real staple for cookware essentials, especially if you already have a pot cover or two around.

Whoever put this crappy compilation together took the worst songs of some decent albums (KMFDM for example).

Aw, come on!), history, Japan and the Japanese, and his inability to shake off his all-pervasive American-centered view of the world, belie his professed attempt - in which he takes great pride - to offer an insider expert's view of Japanese society. Although Hiatt pokes a lot of fun at other so-called \\"expert opinions\\", ultimately he himself turns out to be not much better. As an aside: the contrived and therefore unwittingly hilarious sequence of events leading to the two protagonists finally having sex must be seen to be believed.Senior journalists need not necessarily turn out be good novel authors, as this book conclusively demonstrates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait....","review":"Still waiting for a digitally remastered directors cut on DVD or blueray.

So, it is from that perspective I review this movie. This story takes place during the Tet offensive, in which a small American firebase is forced to defend itself against overwhelming odds. The only hope for this base is a battle hardened seargent, who takes control of the situation and becomes the young soldiers only hope for survival. This movie is in my opinion the most realistic war film, prior to \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and holds the top spot along with \\"Hamburger Hill\\" as the best of the Vietnam war movies. Forget \\"Apocalypse Now\\" this is the movie that tells the Vietnam experience. Buy it you will not regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the subtitles?","review":"This movie was long overdue for the DVD format and is very underrated. My question is regarding the lack of subtitles. Considering that the typical American has yet to master the Vietnamese language, subtitles would have been helpful. I imagine that they'll include subtitles on the BluRay release lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap.","review":"This is a cheap imitation war movie, which is poorly made. The fight scenes are poorly done, for the most part, and obviously feature Filipinos trying to look Vietnamese in a lot of scenes. The acting is at best, barely acceptable. Even R. Lee Ermey, who is a very good actor, can't carry this film on his shoulders by himself. Some action scenes are pretty good, especially when a young soldier gets bayoneted by two enemy soldiers. Very well acted by the newcomer. For the most part, though, it's a cheap rehash of every other war picture about the Vietnam War."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie","review":"I just finished watching the movie. What a waste of time that was. The movie is full of historical inaccuracies. I won't even go into the military inaccuracies. You would think that a movie starring R. Lee Ermey would have not had such glaring screw ups. The acting is awful, but I suppose that should be expected when the \\"star\\" of the movie is Wings Hauser. Others have left reviews comparing to or claiming it better than Platoon or Apocalypse Now. I find those comparisons absolutely stunningly wrong! Save your money and time and move on to something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, low-budget, no-acting shoot-'em-up","review":"This may be the worst Vietnam film of all time.This had to be LOW-budget, and we get what they paid for! The acting is non-existent, except for some strong character from Lee Ermey (who was better in \\"Full Metal Jacket\\"). The Vietnamese were clearly (and poorly) played by Filipinos who seemed miscast. The human wave attacks were woefully unrealistic. If you like to sit back and listen to gunshots and watch bodies pile up mindlessly, you might give this a second star....\\"Platoon\\", \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" and \\"Apocalypse Now\\" all have much more compelling storylines and quality acting. And the even-earlier \\"The Green Berets\\" (with John Wayne) was better in most respects.I am surprised this is an \\"exclusive\\"... it should be \\"excluded\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Siege of Firebase Gloria","review":"I highly recomend this movie.

After watching Full Metal Jacket, Platoon and Hamburger Hill I find 'Siege of Fire Base Gloria' refreshing and hard hitting. War at the best of times is harrowing and usless but this film brought home the comradeship and closeness one finds in the services and during times of conflict. It was well directed and very well acted and showed a true representation of war you would not find other wise by actually being there. Its a shame you only have five stars because this film and its actors deservse 10+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple is sometimes Better....","review":"As is the case with this move Siege of Firebase Gloria. As I sat down to watch this movie, my father, who is a Vietnam Vet having served 2 tours, also sat down to watch it with me. What amazed me about this was that he rarely sat down to watch movies about the Vietnam War. When he did he was usually disappointed and never saw them through. After the movie he told me that it was a GREAT movie and about time someone got it [...] near right. Aside from the fact that I truly enjoyed this movie. His comment was all the critique I needed to rush out and purchase this movie for my private collection. I only wish they would release this on DVD.

A must for any collector or aficionado of the Colt Single Action Army. The scholarship behind the book is somewhat questionable. David Brown deduces the calibre from what the Colt shipping records say, but the shipping record usually echoes the customer order. Thus Brown presents 44 Russian, 44 S&W Russian and 44 S&W as distinct chamberings. But they are the same chambering, just different styles of nomenclature in the Colt ledgers. Before 1907, 44 Russian and 44 S&W meant the same thing. After 1907, 44 Special and 44 S&W meant the same thing.

I find the sound produced by the headphones to be excellent, and actually like that they fit snugly around the ears and back of the head (think the polarfleece Artic 180's earwarmers you may have seen).Did experience some problems loading the software, and once I had it loaded still had a bit of difficulty. Echoing comments made by a reviewer of another Intel MP3 product, this may have something to do with a \\"conflict\\" with other software on my machine, namely RealPlayer/RealOne. However, things appear to working fine now, but it can take some tinkering.

Then I noticed the fraying, so I stopped using that pouch. A few weeks later, the fraying began on the main back panel around the corners; and from there it just got worse, so I returned it to the store.

The segment began at 5pm exactly in this documentary and amazingly enough.....skipped over the 3rd largest structural failure in world history (the first two being WTC's 1 & 2) as if it never happened. Anyone who doubts me can watch and see for themselves. So? The makers of \\"America We Will Never Forget\\" follow in the footsteps of the 9/11 commission, which in its' 500+ pages ALSO neglect to mention the destruction of this building.

She imagines herself to be some type of royalty and labors to keep her privacy. What she fails to realize is that the only interest any reader would ever have in her is that she happens to be the sister of Jackie. So she can skip the plethora of pictures of herself, boring stories about \\"One Special Summer\\", etc. All that she has ever undertaken is founded upon her presumption that with minimal effort she should \\"start at the top.\\" This book is a perfect reflection of her attempts to give nearly nothing and achieve great results.

I actually found a minor character, lawyer Alec Barclay, much more intriguing than the hero. And that's a bad sign! And excuse me, but what judge on earth is really going to ask our heroine, in the middle of a hearing, \\"Have you always loved this man?\\" Really now. The obsessive grandmother's sudden emotional breakdown was a little hard to swallow too--she doesn't really come across as likely to crack under pressure.

On the other hand, he is quickly bored with the Activity Centers, such as Whales and Dolphins, Flight, and Mars. They simply present one screen with things to click on.

There is of course the romantic part of the movie, but it is not overly mushy or sickening like many romances. This is not Jane Austin.

It's a bit more quiet in it's plotting than the former, but I think it should stand on it's own merits and storyline(which I will spare you of a synopsis at this point). Let's just say it's very endearing to watch the two less splashy siblings(Justine Waddell's Molly and Anthony Howell's Roger) of the greatly admired Cynthia and Osbourne blossom in their own way through the series.And of course, it's obvious they are meant for one another from the start-but with five hours to fill up, of course they are given distractions, obstacles, meddlings, and long absences from eacthother before they can finally take a moment to realize how perfect they are for eachother! Good, clean, sweet, love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andrew Davies does it again!","review":"As he showed with his masterful handling of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, Andrew Davies can take a long character novel and make it fascinating, even if five hours long. The acting is superb. Justine Waddell as Molly is very pretty in a quiet way, but outshone (as she should by) by Keeley Hawes as the charming and fascinating Cynthia. Keeley Hawes manages to capture Cynthia's character. She is full of pretty ways, and so honest, that we like her in spite of ourselves. Tom Hollander is excellent as the slightly weak Osborne, and so is Michael Gambon as his father. This is the most Austen-like of Gaskell's books in style, and somewhat resembles Mansfield Park in plot. But what makes Gaskell special is her characters, all varied, and never cariacatured.

The film is a sort of \\"coming of age\\" as it follows the charismatic Molly as she grows into a charming and loveable young woman. The costumes are lavish and beautiful! And the acting.... Truly outstanding. Justine Waddell, Keeley Hawes, and Iain Glen, along with the rest of the exceptional cast, give phenomenal performances in their respective roles, and interact well with one another. The film is filmed in the same vein as the A&E adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice - if you enjoyed that, you'll be sure to love this charming and romantic film."},{"rating":"2","title":"domestic scenes, historic trends","review":"This is an especially fine piece of television drama. The screenplay is intelligent and witty, and inspires a real interest in the material and the characters. Gambon and Waddell are outstanding among an almost faultless cast. The characters of Molly and Cynthia are endearing at a human level, but also fascinating as emblems of the cultural and social changes - both limitations and possibilities - affecting women in the 19th century. Neither is a spokeswoman for any '-ism', but each provides a moving and articulate response to the greater issues of power and responsibility. The emerging scientific challenges to religious and social (and familial) orthodoxies, also explored, are dramatised neither self-consciousnessly nor by imposing a false note upon the narrative of several ordinary lives. I found this story worth savouring and re-viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Victorian Plot","review":"Wives and Daughters is worthy of comparison to Austin's Pride and Prejudice.

It eventually does and I believe that the viewer's patience is rewarded. The romance was nowhere on the realm of North and South or Pride and Prejudice but like everything else in this miniseries, it grows on you. Overall, I liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"If you like the 1996 BBC version of Pride & Prejudice, then you will LOVE this! Excellent storyline, excellent script-writing, excellent acting, directing, filming, art directing, costuming, settings, etc. Absolutely magnificent!

Michael Gambon was a great actor, of course, but his performance was levels above anyone else so that he seemed out of place! **SPOILER** And where the heck was the kiss/romantic embrace at the end? I know the novel was unfinished and the writers had to make up an ending, but please. If this is supposed to be a romantic novel, there should be a more romantic resolution than what was given.

Adams. My expectations for this BBC period piece were extremely high given the raving reviews it received on Amazon. The first half of the series bored me to tears. I do admit the characters were less static during the last two episodes. Still, I can't imagine watching this series again. I would strongly encourage anyone interested in BBC drama to rent W&D before making a purchase! The BBC period pieces, North & South (also based on Gaskill) and Pride and Predjudice are VERY good, however, and are worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap","review":"So I saw this on Amazon a little while ago, but instead of ordering it, I saw it at a local costume shop. It looks cute and that's what I liked about it. Anyhow, I tried it on, shirt and skirt were okay.... shirt a little see through though. I start a load of wash and washed it correctly. Though when I took it out, the \\"corset\\" fell apart. I found pieces of \\"stuffing\\" in the form of foam. Irritated! Sadly, there is a no returns in this store that I bought it in, so there goes my money! I would defiantly NOT buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"shirt was aweful","review":"This costume was a good price; however, the \\"gauze\\" style shirt was aweful. I ended up buying something else last minute. So much for the general sizing. I am 5'9\\" and 135 lbs. I generally wear a small to medium. This shirt was so small it would fit a child. The elastic was super tight. In addition, the vest was so cheaply made I threw it away after one wearing. It barely held up for the occassion. The skirt, however, was comfortable and fit well. I realize it is just a costume, but nothing like being uncomfortable all night at a fun party. I would not recommend this costume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eww!","review":"This costume looks very frumpy.

I put batteries in the remaining 2 to let them 'try them out'. They are real flimsy and cheap, which would be fine if they worked. Yellow one worked for a minute, then stopped working.

I was able to read the newspaper with this lantern light. It isn't too bright, but, enough to get by. For the price I believe that they are a great value and good to have in an emergency.

Given the subject matter -- writing software documentation -- I would have expected the author and publisher to put even *some* effort into creating a useful visual language.

I do recommend it as an overall view of the process and will be useful for beginners to the profession."},{"rating":"1","title":"A difficult book to use","review":"I have to use this book in a technical writing course and I find it difficult to use and read, especially if you are new to the field.The formatting and layout of the book makes it easy to lose track of which section you are in (using a numbering system to identify sections would be helpful) and it needs more white space. The author tends to be verbose at times and this also helps to \\"lose\\" the reader.A short answer or multiple choice question section would be useful to help in review of material covered in a chapter.The index seems somewhat sparse and a \\"master\\" glossary at the end would be useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"good wool comb","review":"I'm a hand spinner and bought this comb to use on individual locks of wool from fleeces.

Bogart was good, as usual, but no great plot or deep thoughts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden Era Cinema","review":"I'm not a critic, and I'm reluctant to make comments on how another person's hard work might have been better in this or that small way. I've never made a movie, so I'll never know. Does this movie entertain? Yes. Does this movie give a good representation of what a 1940's crime movie is supposed to be like? Yes. Does Bogart deliver and OWN every scene he's in? Yes. If you are not a Bogart fan, this probably is not the first film of his I'd recommend, I'd leave that honor to The Big Sleep, or Casablanca, but this movie entertains, and tells a surprisingly relate-able story, even some 60 years after it was made."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Mad Dog\\" Roy Earle","review":"Bogart is brilliant as notorius gangster Roy Earle, in the classic film HIGH SIERRA,1941. Director Raoul Walsh reaches deep inside the underworld of syndicate crime and shoots a close up character study of a desperate criminal trying to find his destiny on the rocky road of life, and to break away the chains that forever remain shackled in his psyche. Bogart steals the character of Earle - \\"above and beyond\\" as one of \\"bogies\\" best acting performances along with a solid supporting cast with Ida Lupino as Earle's loyal entrusted girlfriend and Arthur Kennedy is one of Earle's partners in crime. High Sierra is co-written by legendary director John Huston. A must for Bogart collectors, this Warner VHS is an excellent transfer, featuring the films trailer,presented in black and white.

You have two women in here: the hard-boiled Ida Lupino and the soft-and-sweet Joan Leslie. Both are entertaining to watch and both demonstrate a few surprises in the personalities of the characters they are playing. Bogart does the same: goes back and forth between tough guy and softie.Another key member of this unusual crime story/film noir is \\"Pard:\\" a little dog! Human supporting roles are supplied by some familiar and solid actors such as Arthur Kennedy, Alan Curtis, Henry Hull, Henry Travers, Barton MacLane and Cornel Wilde.There are so many different angles to this story, it's always interesting to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the final scene alone","review":"Others have written how this movie was a 'breakout' movie for Bogart. Others have analyzed the complex character he plays, a hardened criminal who nonetheless has a compassionate side. I found the heart- wrenching part of the movie its final scene , one of death and separation and grief presented in a truly desolating way. In my mind is the image of Ida Lupino, the little dog after the Earle- Bogart main character has been killed.What struck me forcibly when I watched this as a very young person was that it did not have a 'happy ending' and the thought that life might not , deeply disturbed at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Bogarts best.","review":"I had seen this movie on TV enough, that I decided to go ahead and buy this DVD. It's a wonderful addition to my movie collection.The DVD is beautiful, very nice transfer. Movie itself is wonderful, full of intrigue and the last few minutes of the movie are wonderful.All the preformances are spectacular. This is one of Bogart's best movies, Dark Passage is another wonderful Bogart film. Ida Lupino, Arthur Kennedy add to the richness of the picture. I recommend buying this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOULLESS GINGERS WHO MADE A SOUL BAND?","review":"So bad, had to read it for FILM class, the book is full of 'he said' 'she said' all in the worst possible cockney accent, so you have to kind of figure out what they are saying, which is a waste of time.

Most transmissions were in the 600 meter band. \\"Welding Machines\\" were transmitters that is a spark with some interesting methods of generating one and tuning circuits were used to more or less (by todays standards mostly less) control the output frequency. The crystal set was king, few if any had the latest and greatest regenerative sets (patent 1914).

However, after previewing it, I was stunned with the art and the story of Molly Bannaky. It is a compelling story that would hold the interest of middle and maybe even some high school students. Students who enjoy picture books for the art work will find this a treat. The lighting in this is particularly memorable and I think many young artists would be inspired. This is a wonderful picture book with a compelling story of a lessor known historical character with inspiring illustrations. I've ordered it for the media center. :)MZ Cox"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pictures far superior to text","review":"Alice McGill, Molly Bannaky (Houghton Mifflin, 1999)The first thing to be said about Molly Bannaky is that the illustrations, by Chris Sontpiet, are some of the finest you will ever see in a kids' book. They make this book worth the price of admission, and your children, if they're into the pretty pictures thing, will probably treasure them long into adulthood.It's too bad the prose doesn't fit the illustrations. Molly Bannaky, the story of the grandmother of scientist Benjamin Banneker, is rushed, uneven, and contains gaps large enough for the author's entire credibility to fall through. I've mentioned kids' innate crap detectors a number of times in my reviews of kids' books; some of the transitions here (do authors really still use the word \\"suddenly\\"?) are bound to set them off.But you've still got the pictures. **"},{"rating":"2","title":"Longtime Favorite","review":"This has been my favorite general cookbook for almost 20 years.

And then one morning I came downstairs to find coffee all over my counter, down my white cabinets and sitting on my wood floors. I thought it was just fluke and cleaned it up and made a new pot. Then this started happening more and more often. You have to line everything up PERFECTLY! Make sure everything is in properly or you will have an overflow to clean up!

Once the coffee brews the electronics go into la-la land, and the thing has to be unplugged and replugged back in (basically re-booted) to get any of the buttons to work.Look at how many \\"remanufactured\\" versions of this coffee maker there are out there.

The first one broke after a year and the second one has had a steady decline for the past few months and it is only 2-3yrs old. The compartment that holds the coffee beans (to be ground) gets stuck in the machine every time and you have to fight with it to get it out EVERY TIME YOU MAKE A POT OF COFFEE. Also, there is a compartment on the front of the machine that pops out to hold the coffee grounds which pops out in the middle of brewing and the machine spills coffee all over the counter.Again, this is the SECOND machine that we have had problems with. For 161 dollars, you should be buying a coffee machine that will last a lifetime. Don't give your money to this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design...junk","review":"Do not buy it. We got this as a Christmas present two years ago & right away I spotted a design flaw.

Needless to say we sent it back to the manufacturer for a replacement (boy, did that take forever & a day) when we got the the replacement it called it quits after 5 months by only producing half of the coffee you made. We maintained both very well & changed the water filters as instructed but this thing failed again & again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece of junk","review":"Don't buy this piece of junk.

He claims that while sex within marriage is obviously ok, so is \\"sexual communion between unmarried consenting adults within a meaningful friendship, and premarital sexuality between persons exploring the possibility of or engaged in a potential marriage contract.\\" (p.35) While there may be no direct biblical injunction against such sexual contact, Ellens never reveals to his readers by what evidence he has reached such conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was bored & disappointed","review":"As hard as I tried I just could not get into this book.

Cleopatra is a vampire (very rare for a female to be made) and her sire kept her ignorent of the fact that there are campaion's and a vampire society etc....that when it stops being interesting.This books has no stucture. Things seem to to added because you find that as it goes along it isnt making sense the author must realize this to and trys to cover it by suddenly bringing in an explanation out of the blue.

You never really which way the story will go which is why you're at the edge of seat flipping page after page. Sidney Sheldon does not disappoint.

I've never read such an unsatisfying ending. Nothing was cleared up, tensions weren't resolved, and the characters were worse off than at the beginning of the book. Why bother reading a book if it ends stupidly? The characters were stupid and shallow. Ugh. I can't even express how disgusted and disappointed I was with that book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of His Very Best","review":"I see many 'first time' Sheldon readers are reviewing this book....it is great to see that old good books never die! This is truly one of his best, it is a real page turner, and an easy read... he knows how to keep the book in your hands from start to finish... and you'll want to read more of his work when your finished. If your taking this on vacation...take along his Master of the Game too...you can finish both in 72 hours or less! My husband found these books in my library and read them NONSTOP....he thought they were great fun and really liked the female characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"This was the first book I've read by this author and I won't waste my time reading another. The story started out with great promise but as the main character self-destructs, the plot gets more shallow by the chapter. There was no ending; it seems as though Mr. Sheldon lost interest and just quit writing. Since it was a Kindle freebie, I didn't expect much and I wasn't surprised that I didn't get much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ending","review":"I love Sidney Sheldon's books, but I was quite disappointed with this one. I can't believe it got such good reviews. The story was fast-paced, interesting, and well written. However, the ending was awful and frustrating. It was too abrupt and too many things happened at once, it didn't resolve well. It was also too much of a let down. There are definitely better Sidney Sheldon books than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down!","review":"I am definitely a Sidney Sheldon fan, but I was disappointed with this story. I was never sure if I was supposed to be rooting for or against the Jennifer character. After reading the book, my first thought was, what was the purpose in reading this book. Usually I feel good or bad after reading a book. After reading this book, I felt like I had wasted my time. I also felt that there were several loose ends not dealt with in this story, e.g., Adam's wife, Ken."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"no words can give this book justice!! had me on the edge of my seat feeling as though I knew the the people!!

Very anticlimatic and disappointing. I felt like I'd wasted a lot of time by reading the whole thing.The book reads like cheap fiction, but it didn't 'have' to. The author shows his talent in parts of the book, but for some reason he just couldn't get it all together. Almost nothing in the book turns out the way you'd like to see it turn out. It was just weird, and again...very disappointing.I won't be wasting my time reading any more of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book, sad ending though","review":"I bought this book just a month ago, I finished reading it a couple of days. I love it, I love the courtroom scenes, and the beautiful and poignant love story of Jennifer and Adam. It is really so sad though, why did their son Joshua have to die? It has a sad ending too, but Jennifer is a survivor.My cousin read it too, she loves it. We both love \\"Master of the Game\\" too. I have read and enjoyed all Sidney Sheldon novels except \\"Tell me your dreams.\\" I'm planning to buy it yet. He is the best, incomparable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money.....Reviewer: Sucker For Freebies, N.Y.C.","review":"I downloaded this book when it was free on Kindle, so it didn't cost me anything but my time to read it. I wish I hadn't. I see that there is now a price on the book, so I beg you not to waste your money. This book is nothing more than a third-rate potboiler, regardless of the author's celebrated name. I was drawn in by the rave reviews that I read, and the first few chapters. They were good, but after that the book went rapidly downhill. Characters were cardboard and the story was one cliche after another. Apparently Mr. Sheldon also disregarded the writer's maxim of 'show, don't tell' and the story was a straight march down the road to the very predictable end. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinishable","review":"If 'unfinishable' is a word then it describes this book for me. I love love loved The Other Side of Midnight but haven't liked another Sheldon book since. I found the 'heroine' completely unlikeable. I think we were supposed to see a strong, gutsy, independent woman but time and again she went against her stated beliefs. Besides she was generally annoying. The scene with the nails (if you read it you know what I mean...) was ridiculously sugar coated, then when that is 'resolved' she goes home and does WHAT? Seriously? I could probably have taken all her hypocrisy if her character had been better developed such that she had some deeper reason for her stupid behavior, but instead she's written to be brilliant and outside of the court room is anything but. I wasn't expecting much more than a good read - not a classic or deep tome - but sheesh, I didn't even get that."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent read.","review":"This is came highly recommended from an avid reader. I could not put the book down.. I enjoyed it from strart to finish.. I purchased three more books from Sidney Sheldon....Keep up the good work"},{"rating":"2","title":"An older legal thriller that has aged surprisingly well","review":"I apparently picked this up as a Kindle freebie in May 2010 -- since it was first published in 1980, I'm guessing it was maybe a 30-year anniversary celebration freebie or something. Not being very familiar with novels written shortly before I was born, I had no idea how old the book was.On the whole, it's aged very well. It reads a lot like a combination of John Grisham's best legal thrillers with some Mario Puzo's Godfather thrown in. The storyline had several major twists, basically all of which succeeded in surprising me.I even enjoyed the parts of the book that were a little dated -- references to national heroes whose names I didn't recognize piqued my curiosity, and a scene where the main character is trying to complete the \\"nearly impossible\\" task of winning a paternity suit made me chuckle. But the dated parts were fewer than you might think... the main character even turns to Lexis and Westlaw for her legal research, just like I do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Book","review":"This is a well presented overview of the World of Greyhawk. It contains brief descriptions of countries, history and geography. This is a good example for Dungeon Masters who want to create their own world. I was a bit disappointed because the map included was not the same as the one shown on the front cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"mediocre","review":"Its your basic setting nothing special, its worth it if you dont got the bucks or dont want to wait for the forgotten realms or any other more specific setting.Also good for beginners!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greyhawk Overview","review":"This is a good introduction to the lands of and around the Free City of Greyhawk. I was impressed with the quality and detail of the included fold-out map. Almost every location on the map is overviewed within the 32 page Gazetteer: Mountains, forests, wastelands, wetlands, lakes, rivers and major cities with plenty of adventure \\"seed\\" ideas.Keep in mind that this product is only 32 pages in length. It is an overview and only offers some minor detail of the vast campaign world. It is enough to get started, but for any in-depth campaign, the DM will have to flesh out any particular area in which he and his players will wish to play. The Living Greyhawk product that will be released later this year (October, I believe) will be a full 192 pages in length and will most likely pick up where this product leaves off (and offer an online and continually growing campaign world).All in all, I give a thumbs up as a good introduction to a beautiful campaign world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grayhawk returns","review":"Someone commented that this was a generic setting, and that people should wait for Forgotten Realms, or some other universe to be released. This is not accurate. Oerth, the setting described in the gazetteer, is the original, and perhaps best, D&D setting.Formerly published as \\"World of Greyhawk\\", this is the setting Gary Gygax and co. created way back when the game was first created. It's also the primary setting for D&D 3rd edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"If you want a good gazeteer for the world of Greyhawk, buy the Living Greyhawk Gazeteer. This is good as a refresher, or if yo just need the map. It's size means the info on everything is limited. Very brief writeups on the various countries and factions don't have enough meat to make your own campaigns off of unless you're looking to make the Greyhawk world your own creation. But if that's the case, why aren't you creating your own world instead of buying an official one? Save the money and buy the Living GreyHawk book. It has more to it and is more worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't a good buy, no matter who you are","review":"If you are an old Greyhawk fan, this is all common knowledge. If you are getting into Greyhawk, get the Living Greyhawk Gazeteer as this smaller version is way too small to be of any real use. Sure it is only 8 dollars, but you may as well burn the money because this book, if interesting, can ONLY make you want the bigger version, and if you don't find it interesting, well... that speaks for itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torn Seam and Broken Zipper","review":"I have had this bag for a few months and used it occasionally.

Conceptually, it doesn't even work as a collection because there is no flow or consistent tone to the pieces. Ambient here, vocal there, experimental after that. Bleah.In the same purchase from Amazon, I also ordered JBK 'Playing in a Room With People', so it was kind of a double whammy for me. Now I have 'Big Wheels In Shanty Town' on three CDs.

I highly suggest starting off with Thomas Egenes \\"Introduction to Sanskrit, Part I.\\" Egenes text consists of 18 concise but simple lessons which provide one with a foundation in basic Sanskrit for building upon with more a thorough text. (In fact, Egenes states that his text is a \\"pre-primer;\\" I have to say, it is a most excellent one.) Coulson's text becomes much easier to comprehend.I also recommend taking a look at Devavanipravesika, the text used by Berkeley for its Sanskrit course. It is very thorough and not as difficult as Coulson's."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought and returned this book!","review":"This book is not meant for anybody to learn Sanskrit. It covers too many topics in too few pages. To make matters worse, quality of paper used in this book is really bad. Also, binding of the book is that of a cheap thriller and it is really hard to keep it open while reading.One good thing about this book is that, all Exercises have their Solutions, and in my knowledge Egenes's \\"Introduction to Sanskrit\\" is the only other book on Introductory Sanskrit which provides the key to exercises.If someone wants an inexpensive book to learn Sanskrit, one can get Charles Wikner's book \\"Sanskrit Introductory\\" available as a free download. Although it does not cover all the material in an introductory Sanskrit course, it is better than this book to get started."},{"rating":"1","title":"For professors not for learners","review":"I can certainly recommend this book to all university professors teaching Sanskrit and to all those individuals who know everything about Sanskrit, and now want to see what the respectable author has to say and know about Sanskrit.But if you do not know Sanskrit and want to learn it, do not spend your money and do not waste your time on this book. I love \`Teach yourself ...' series, I used some of their books and this book was my first disappointment in that series.On three occasions I started my study but I could not go past the first chapter. The author assumes not only that you know Greek and Latin but also that you know Sanskrit and then passing lightly over important grammatical points and rules, spends most of his and yours time to give you some subtle hints about some exotic uses of Sanskrit grammar.So avoid this \`Look what I know about Sanskrit, you will never be as clever as I am' book and try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better alternatives now available","review":"Since I first wrote a review of this book in Feb 1999, I have taught a Sanskrit course based on Egenes' Sanskrit textbook.

The author writes in a style that, by today's casual standards, seems more suited to a highbrow English college (like the Cambridge of yesteryear). The font is terrifically small, the explanations didactic. I was told that the author later committed suicide, which I find plausible. Out of the 13 or so people in the Sanskrit class which used this text, only three failed to drop out; those three were already \\"linguistically accomplished\\" and could make some sense of it. In the beginning of the class, I handed everyone a sheet with the alphabet on it (not from the book); later, people said that without that favor, they'd have dropped out a lot sooner. I think Egenes or Bucknell's (sp?) book is probably a safer bet. I have Egenes' and I've gotten alot out of it. Or you can join the Sanskrit for Social Change movement (no kidding). Burn this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is great if you have a Phd in linguistics!","review":"This book is probably a great book if you a have a firm backround in lingustics, but it is hardly a \\"beginers book\\".

It also presumes a fairly advanced knowledge of Venetian art and history. In addition, there are various out-and-out errors: For example, on pg. 19, the Italian word \\"fondaco\\" is wrong-- it should be \\"fondamento\\"; on pg. 21, the saint identified as Stephen is actually Sebastian; on pg. 264, St. Sebastian's date, stated unequivocally to be 4th century A.D., could just as well have been 3rd century, since sources differ on the point.

But the symphony's not all there! The second movement begins half-way through, long after the famous horn solo, and lasts only six minutes. Whether the original lacquers were defective or missing or whether Dante/Lys goofed is unknown, but the omission is disastrous, and makes this CD one to avoid. It would be better to find the earlier studio Columbia recording of the Mengelberg Fifth on M & A or the later, better recorded studio Telefunken Mengelberg Fifth, also on Lys and which has all the virtues and none of the egregious defects of this issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sincere, Honest, well researched","review":"Thanks Mr. Welsh for this heads up on what could happen if y2k repairs are not made.

It explains FEM using the concept of the weak formulation -- something that one obtains directly from the governing equation via multiplying by a test function and integrating over the domain. This point of view is more philosophically satisfying and holistic than the narrow matrix structural analysis approach which seems to mislead students into thinking that FEM can only be applied to structures and solids. Incidentally, this weak formulation is also the original one held by Richard Courant who is arguably the modern founder of the FEM. FEM is a complex subject and a lot of hand-holding is needed for beginners. The book succeeded admirably as it is interspersed with detailed numerical examples illustrating the preceding concepts. The author spares no effort to be as complete as possible in his derivations. However, his coverage of the Calculus of Variations seems a bit weak. Overall, highly recommended for a first course on the FEM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yup! 'tis the best!

Most of the examples are on mechanics and materials, but even I (a mediocre Chemical Engineer) can understand what the man's talking about. As the title says, this book IS about the Finite Element Method. Okay, lemme let it out: the man's my professor, and we use the book for the course. Granted, my perspective may be slanted by the fact that I like Dr. Reddy (he's the ultimate teacher - one who's concern is to ensure the student understands), but, I can still read ahead of the class (without his assistance) and understand the material.

She lets the client do the interpreting of the cards as pretty pictures, much as a psychiatrist might ask a patient to interpret ink blots.This author calls it a \\"fallacy\\" that some think tarot readings help you find out about your future.To her, the cards are merely a symbol system that can assist you in understanding yourself -- and you can forget about predictive readings for others. \\"Lighting candles or saying prayers\\" to her is \\"just plain ignorant.\\"I'll take a book that tells me how to read the cards.

As a tarot fan for 2 years I recommmend this book which comes with a deck of Waite Tarot( It saves you a lot of money so you don't have to buy another deck separately). This book does not really teach you how to interpret cards, it just let you think and make your own decision.... Also, the author does not really believe tarot is a tool for telling the future.

Personally, I have hooked this device to four different systems and it worked smoothly on only one of them.After a ton of online research I found that the nVidia chipset USB seems to have trouble with the ATEN/IOGear line of KVM switches. The small benefit of USB KVMs does not outweigh their inherent burdens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure to Communicate","review":"I just bought and will promptly return the GCS632U KVM. The device does not work with some (most?) multi-function USB keyboards... that's what support@iogear told me. Well who knew? It's not on the packaging! In fact, the \\"Features\\" list on the package states \\"USB sniffing technology allows complete USB mouse and keyboard emulation...\\" That seems overstated at best and certainly a little disingenuous. I have a relatively simple Logitech \\"Inertnet Navigator\\" keyboard and the KVM would not work with the keyboard. Support told me to go buy a plain vanilla USB keyboard. Why would I want to do that just to make their KVM work? I actually use the multi-function keys on my keyboard -- duh!

I have not tried the audio feature. The audio and USB cables have convenient wire-management clips that slide up and down the main cable, which keeps their generous length from getting in the way.Unfortunately, this is yet another product that features very awkward sealed packaging.

On very rare occasions, the PC will cease responding to the keyboard, but unplugging the keyboard and replugging it reactivates it. I don't use the KVM audio, I just plug the Mac speaker line into the line-in of the PC.I use the KVM with a PC keyboard.

They take a USB plug, but they don't pass the entire signal - they replicate keyboard and mouse ports, and don't allow combinations to pass all data. Skip this switch if your mouse and keyboard are on one USB cable, or you are using a wireless mouse/keyboard combo. It wouldn't even work with a wireless keyboard plugged into the KEYBOARD port and a wired mouse plugged into the MOUSE port. That's right, separate ports - should have tipped me off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great USB Kvm, skip the audio though","review":"Like most other reviewers, I could not get decent performance from the audio part of this KVM. But to finally get a good performing KVM that works with a USB console is worth the price and skip the audio. Good KVMs with PS2 consoles have been around for years, but USB console KVMS that don't cost you any mouse or keyboard functionality have been hard to come by. Many in fact describe themselves as a \\"USB KVM\\", but only the connections to the host PCs are USB; the actually keyboard and mouse have to be PS2, or you have to use a USB to PS2 adapter, which is where the functionality in the USB keyboard and/or mouse gets lost.This compact unit finally does the trick and lives up to the expectations one would have of a genuine \\"USB KVM\\".Thanks IOGEAR.

I use a usb mouse and keyboard (not wireless) and switch between a Mac Mini and a Windows machine. I don't use the video port on the switch because it's not DVI and my monitor already has 2 ports. Seamless switching between the two stations, even when windows is booting or Mac is shutting down. One thing I have noticed is some signal noise from the speaker jack through my speakers no matter which machine I'm using (annoying), though it didn't start happening until I installed a new graphics card so its possible that triggered it.

If you want to hook a basic keyboard and mouse up between two computers then you should be just fine.However, if you use a docking station for a laptop it may not work. Apparently it draws more power than hooking up the same keyboard and mouse by themselves. This makes sense, but it seems to draw more than the power supply for the dock can provide. This resulted in the keyboard not working. The solution was to bypass the docking station and plug in directly to the laptop. That defeats the purpose of the docking station.This device also cannot handle special keyboards with multimedia features or special buttons.None of this would be a very big deal if it was made clear on the packaging. However, the package mentions none of these limitations, nor does the manufacturer website. I see others have had the same problems from some of the reviews, so beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere","review":"This thing would not work even with one computer.

Most all keyboard/mouse combos use only one USB connection - which will not work with this switch! Iogear knows about this flaw and reports this information hidden in their website.If you do not use nor plan on ever buying a wireless keyboard/mouse combo, then maybe this device would work for you, but as so many people have found out already - this device is unacceptably designed and has required many product returns."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"I have had nothing but audio problems with the cheap 1/8\\" connector.

Also, if you don't have a Scroll Lock button on your keyboard, forget this device.I got it to work, but the monitor on the DVI only computer blinked on and off periodically. I changed the monitor cable, and it does not blink anymore. However the video fan cycles on and off every few seconds, which is annoying. I think I will just have to throw this away, get a monitor for the other computer, and cut my losses.I was also using a modern backlit keyboard that does not have a scroll lock button, but the hot key switching did not work to change to a ctrl ctrl sequence to cycle the monitors.

I contacted IOGEAR through their website and did get back an answer within 24 hours (forget trying to call, I went on death hold). Unfortunately, the answer was that the KVM would not work through a port replicator and that I had to hook up directly through the laptop.

It was a pain to put both computers on my desk in my home-office and continually switch back and forth between them.Now, through a simple keyboard double-click action, this device quickly and easily lets me toggle which of my 2 computer video outputs gets displayed on my larger home monitor -- either my home computer or my business laptop.

I also use the KVM to switch audio. I've configured the switching so that's it's triggered by tapping the control key.So far, almost everything works as advertised. Switching happens pretty cleanly.One minor glitch: occasionally when I switch to the Dell, the display won't work. I get an error message about \\"on the monitor, \\"Cannot display this mode\\". Seems to happen when the Dell has gone into some power saver mode.Otherwise, it works fine. There are probably better KVMs out there, but they're more expensive.

Furthermore, although the device claims that it can handle higher resolutions, the screen was noticeably fuzzy already at 1920x1200.Altogether, altogether, I consider this device nearly useless. You may be able to switch between two Linux servers with it, but for its primary use--switching between two desktop machines--image quality and reliable operation with Windows are paramount.Sad, really, because physically, the device is nice and small, and the company spent some effort on making the device flexible and easy to program.

I consulted the manual and sure enough, it indicated that only 2 speaker systems are supported.I am not faulting IOGEAR for my oversight, mind you, but I think the fact that this product cannot support the very widespread 2.1 systems warrants 4 stars rather than 5.

Eventually, the pan would pop up and out completely, so the driver would not contact the paddle, and no more mixing or kneading would take place. If we noticed the problem, we would press the pan back into place, and it would mix/knead again for a little while.

I have 30+ years of bread baking experience, 16 years with a bread machine; I'm not a newbie.I'd read reviews where the pan was a problem, so after putting all of my ingredients into it, I made sure it was secured as tightly as possible. The machine started after the delay that I set. Although loud, it wounded normal for all of 10 seconds. Suddenly, it started shaking and banging, making a noise similar to a washer with an out of balance load. I quickly unplugged the machine and opened the lid. The pan had completely jumped out of the clamps. I immediately repacked the machine and sent it back to Amazon.I bought theZojirushi BBCCX20 Home Bakery Supreme Bread Machine. Since the day I received the Zo, I've been averaging 3 loaves of bread every day. They come out wonderful, the machine is very quiet and best of all, the pan stays in place!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TR2500 Failure","review":"I make a lot of dough and bread. We have had three other Breadman machines, and the first two gave good service. The third lasted a year, and the current one has now died after four months.Kneading always required watching because the pan would pop out. During kneading the corners often required scraping to fold in all the flour. The \\"extras\\" adding mechanism stopped working after two months. Now the machine is completely dead except for the internal light, which proves it has power going to it. Breadman machines seem to have really gone down hill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made bread pan","review":"The bread pan is flimsy and did not stay in place.If one is willing to re-seat the pan several times it makes a good loaf of bread. Not willing to do that every time I returned it the morning after I bought it.I think the pan and clips are under engineered for the job. Probably there are other places inside that are equally flimsy, if the things you see and touch are. My old Oster used similar, but much larger/heavier clips to hold a much more substantial pan. The idea is fine.I'm used to looking in on a bread machine during the first stir, to scrape the sides with a rubber spatula, to add a little water or flour.However going to look every time the motor runs to make sure the clips haven't come loose is beyond my patience. Do yourself a favor and buy one that's better made. Or plan on watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bread, Operator Problems!!!!","review":"I love the machine and the bread that comes out of it. I think I am the problem though when it comes to putting in and taking out the bread pan. I seem to have a difficult time taking it straight out without having to get a knife to release it from the side holders and when I put it in I don't hear a snap. Other than that I haven't had any problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, I got a Dud","review":"I just got this machine and went to break it in, per the manufacturers instructions. Before baking bread, you have to run the machine on a bake cycle while empty in order to burn off the manufacturing oils. It went through the motions of kneeding and baking beautifully. I let it cool down to room temperature and then proceeded to assemble the ingredients for my first bread recipe. When I plugged in the machine and turned it on nothing happened. The display would not even come on! It appears to have burned itself out on the very first use. :( I ended up making my bread the old fashioned way. My friend who has the same machine but different model (TR220C) swears by his and has been using it at least twice a week for year. Maybe I just got the lemon of the bunch?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for Gluten Free breads","review":"I was given one of these machines for Christmas and am so pleased that I am buying one for my niece. We make only gluten free bread, which is significantly different than \\"regular\\" so I don't know about other reviews stating problems - perhaps there is a lot of unit to unit variability. We have had a couple loaves fail but, in general, get far better bread than we are able to make by mixing and baking in the oven. We figured out that with the cost of gluten-free bread from local stores is so expensive (fresh made is even more expensive than the horrid frozen loaves that grocery stores sell) that by making our own the payoff time for making our own is less than 6 months at a loaf a week!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pan won't stay in place!","review":"When the bread pan stays in place, this is a nice bread machine with great features. However, the pan kept popping out of place and I tried all their \\"troubleshooting\\" techniques to no avail. The customer service was reluctant to do anything to remedy the situation. Finally I insisted on a new pan, but several months and phone calls later, I still hadn't received it. Now, because of the bread pan knocking around, the inside wall of the bread machine has worked itself loose from the rivet and now has about 1/2\\" of give, so the bread pan wil not stay in place at all and is unusable. The customer service is terrible, and a month later I still have not received a replacement machine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"New model, still has kinks!","review":"In the last 3 1/2 weeks I have been the not so proud owner of two different Breadman TR2500BC. The first we returned because the door did not close all the way and the bread pan would continuously jump out of its holding. The second one we tried burned everything, even on the light setting and using the recipes provided. My previously owned, yes I gave it away before discovering all the problems, bread machine still worked beautifully after eight years. I was just hoping to upgrade and have some of the newer features which this model had. It looks great and the features are extremely easy to use, it just couldn't seem to cook the bread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reno cook.","review":"This is my 2nd bread machine, the 1st one lasting 12 years. The horizontal capacity is large, great for dough recipes, a little large for a 2 lb. loaf, but manageable. I love it, it stays on the counter, being used at least twice a week. The fruit/nut dispenser isn't large enough for the amount of fruit and nuts my family enjoys, as we always add more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I purchased this Breadman TR2500BC Ultimate Plus breadmaker and it is the poorest quality machine I have ever owned (and I have owned several other Brand breadmachines). The pan does not fit in the machine snugly and wiggles around sounding like it is going to come loose. The kneading paddle fits very loose and had a LOT of slack around the shaft and it jumps up and down when it is kneading the dough. I have call the Breadman company and they sent me a replacement kneading paddle and it does not fit any better than the first one. They are supposed to send me another pan for it, but have not. I am VERY dissatisfied with this bread maker and will NEVER buy another Breadman brand product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Make a Bad Loaf with this Machine!","review":"I've owned at least five bread machines in the past 40 years, and this one is hands-down the best. With other machines, i found there were usually 2-3 bread recipes i could make and know they were turn out predictably OK. But when i'd try something new, the results were usually disappointing.Even though we've had this one only a couples month, but have tried at least six new recipes and every single loaf has been looked and tasted like a loaf of bread from a bakery. The crust is perfect (some other machines i've had made the crust too thick) and egg-shell thin which we like. The loaves rise tall every time.SO IMPRESSED with this machine; Just can't make a bad loaf with it!Dec 2012 update: this was a great unit, while it worked. But after a few months it just didn't work right. I wasted ingredients for 4-5 loaves, thinking it was surely something I was doing wrong. It wasn't. I finally gave up, pitched it, and bought a Zugrushi machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"I got this machine yesterday, and am returning it to Amazon today! I made one loaf yesterday, and it came out alright. Then, I tried to make another loaf today and when I plugged in the machine, nothing happened. The machine would not turn on, and I tried it in 4 different outlets in different rooms. I had the TR200C for 3+ years before I decided to give that one to my mom and get this one. BIG MISTAKE! But, I did read the bad reviews before ordering, so I was prepared. I decided to press my luck, and it didn't work out for me.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MACHINE UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING TO DEAL WITH THE RETURN PROCESS!!!I am just thankful that it died before the 30 days was up so I don't have to deal with Salton!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just arrived and not happy...","review":"My review not so good at the moment. I only just got it out of the box, and already I am not happy with the plastic sticker that serves as a cover on the control panel.

Anyone else have the same problem?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pan Keeps Jumping Out","review":"Are you serious? Ultimate bread man? NOT!!Its great if you can stand by it and hold the pan in while it kneads. I thought it was something I was doing wrong until I read reviews. This makes for a hazard of fire if you leave this machine unattended or use the delay. I wrote the company and they basically said \\"too bad\\". Well too bad for them I will never trust a product made by them again and will spread the word. Will also enter a complaint with Health & Safety on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"breadman 2500BC bread maker","review":"I am on my second one. Bought a new one for x-mas and had to return it before I even got to use it. When I plugged it in and filled the container with the ingredients and pushed start. It kneaded the bread but never head up. Sent it back and received the new one. Plugged it in after filling the ingredients and it wouldn't knead the bread, warm up....etc.... Unplugged it for 45 minutes and trying it again. We will see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get parts","review":"Decent enough bread. However, we lost the mixing paddle from a newer machine, purchased a few months ago, and so far all we have been told is that the part is on backorder. For six weeks.

And we've paid for the part already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I received a Breadman Ultimate Plus as a Christmas gift in December 2009. Within 3 weeks, I was having problems with the paddle detatching during kneading. This leaves axle grease in your loaf, which you usually do not discover until the bread is finished baking. The machine is averaging ruining every third loaf at this point and I am trying to return it and receive a refund. Save your money and buy a better machine or just learn to make bread by hand. When it works, the machine makes delicious bread. But after having problems and reading 7 y.o. reviews where the same problem existed, it seems the manufacturer doesn't care to correct long-standing issues with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy flanges allow pan to jump \\"off the track\\"","review":"I bought this model for friends, and showed them how to use it. Halfway through the mixing cycle it started making loud noises; I looked inside and it looked OK, but when the bread was done it became obvious that the inner pan had \\"jumped\\" out of position with the gear, and was lying about 40 degrees askew. We set up another loaf, and they report the same thing happened. I noticed that all that holds the pan in place is two straight flanges of metal that go over two small flanges on the pan. When I got home I looked at our TR875 model and noticed that it has much more robust, curved flanges with openings inside for the bread pan components. What a penny-wise and pound-foolish design flaw! I have now ordered the TR875 model for our friends and will return the TR2500BC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"I enjoyed my bread machine at first. Then after about 6 months the pan started jumping out - which of course lead to unkneaded dough and an unusable loaf of bread. I called the company and they sent me another machine after cutting the power cord off my machine and sending it in. The same thing happened with the second machine - except this time it happened right away. I sent the machine back to the company for them to evaluate the machine. After about 3 months and weekly phone calls I finally got the bread machine back. The company stated \\"There is nothing wrong with the machine\\". Just went to get a loaf out of the machine. The pan had jumped out again. Another loaf of unusable bread. It works at times, but very unreliable. Unless you have the time to stand there and hold the pan down I suggest you purchase a different bread machine. Yes, I did what the company suggested. Pull the side tabs out a little. Use more water in the receipe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Broke after 6 months. I opened the lid and it fell off because the plastic hinge had separated. My father also bought one at the same time, but his lasted only 3 months (pan began popping out during kneading cycle). I bought the cheapest bread maker and I got the cheapest bread maker. Now I have to buy another. This next time around I'll buy either a Panasonic or a Zojirushi. Should have bought a Japanese model to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was returned","review":"It looked great, the discription was exactly what I wanted, but it didn't work. The pan where the bread is mixed kept popping out while it was in the kneading cycle. I hope the one I got was just defective, however I returned it and I am not going to buy another. I just make it the old fashioned way, by hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breadman TR2500BC","review":"I purchased this breadmaker thinking it had all the features that one could want. BUT...I can't leave it unattended because the pan pops out some of the time. I called their customer service and they said to spread the flour out evenly in the pan and pull up on the clips that keep the pan in the breadmaker before you but the pan in. I have done both and sometimes it works and sometimes the pan still pops out. Not sure it doesn't work All of the time. Bottom line is if you want to use it unattended this probably isn't the one for you. I will say that when it works it works great but I prefer better odds. I want a breadmaker that works 100% of the time! My advice would be to pick another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breadman TR2500BC Breadmaker","review":"The machine I purchased malfunctioned each time it was used, except when making jam. Bread pan became disengaged from mechanism that controls mixing and kneading processes, thereby ceasing all kneading functions. I returned this items for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR CUSTOMER SUPPORT","review":"Breadman's customer support is terrible and they will not stand by their product. I had a problem with a previous model. It was clearly a design flaw. They would not replace the breadmaker when I called and told them of the issue and instead told me all I needed to do was pull out the clips and that would fix the problem. It did for a while but when it no longer worked the breadmaker was out of warranty and I was rudely told that they would do nothing, even when I explained that I called when it was still under warranty. The solution - I should buy a new pan (must be a redesigned pan) for close to $50 w/ shipping. NO THANKS. CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS TERRIBLE. WILL NOT STAND BY THEIR PRODUCT. POOR DESIGN. BUY FROM ANOTHER MANUFACTURER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken after 8 days","review":"I purchased this product 8 DAYS ago and I went to use it today and the computer failed to receive power. Nothing displayed on the display. I have taken very good care of this machine as I hoped it would last years. Another problem I have is I live at 7200 ft and the wheat bread recipes included in the manual will not raise correctly at this altitude. The suggestions in the instruction manual did not help. Another review on Amazon steered me in the correct direction. If you live at a high altitude, use less yeast and use the white bread kneading cycle to produce results. I am very sad that it will not work, I just figured out how to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the basics","review":"I have had this breadmaker for several years. Attempts to make basic bread/dough are hit/miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Breadman Breadmaker?","review":"I bought this breadmaker as I had previously had a Breadman Ultimate for years and loved it. This one is junk. The pan will not stay in place, I have to wedge a wine bottle opener on the side to keep it from slipping off. When I called HUGTHECOOK, they said it just needed to be adjusted. I would send it back, but my cats shreaded the box. Wouldn't buy anything else from HUGTHECOOK either."},{"rating":"1","title":"No unattended operation","review":"I'm rather disappointed with the Breadman. I bought it on the claim that it is a fully automatic, restaurant-quality bread maker, and it is definitely not that. It doesn't mix the dough properly without attention or help. When I leave it to bake by itself there are always unmixed clumps of raw flour in the end product, which is never quite a bread. It is also rather loud and several of the included recipes need adjustments to work properly. I'm not at a high elevation or use non-standard ingredients or measures, so I don't understand why they wouldn't work. I still use it to make bread, but it is not as care free as claimed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I've had mine for 4 years, making great bread at least once a week. No problems until today, when the attachment b/w the bread pan and machine broke. However, you can get a new breadpan for about $20 from the Breadman website. So, 4 years and counting! I love this machine and use it all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This bread maker is a perfect example of very poor engineering. I did some research and found entries om line that went back to 2006 where there were complaints of the pan jumping up off the drive during the kneading process. Also besides being dissapointed in Breadman, I am also dissapointed in Amazon.com. Several of the comments I found were that the same Tr2500bc bought through them had the very same complaint and Amazon was not very cooperative. One instance it took 6 months for a buyer to get a refund. My feeling is if Amazon knew there was a problem with this machine why did they cotinue to sell it on their website. Shame om Breadman and on Amazon........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed design, pan pops out; does not do one lb loaves well. too bad!!","review":"Like the other reviewers who suffered the pan problem, I called the company. They very nicely told me to get a pair of pliers and adjust the clips. OK for a month, and then the pan just wouldn't stay in. I had to bake it in the oven. Also, while it advertises one lb. loaves, the manual says you have to keep adjusting the dough ball -- and you do! Otherwise, this is a great machine if you like to adjust things. It's all programmable -- you can change any part of any cycle. (OK. It's a guy thing.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"Sometimes this machine will make a good loaf of bread, but sometimes it fails utterly. You have to keep a close eye on it as it bakes, or it comes out a complete disaster. Often the paddle will just spin in circles, making a hollow cavity in the loaf without kneading properly. I have to pull it out and knead by hand, then stick it back it. What's the point of a breadmaker, if you have to knead by hand? That's half the work! And it also means you can't trust it to run on a timer, so that's the second good reason to own the machine out the window. It don't think the inside gets warm enough, either, because the yeast does not rise as much as it should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just returned my first one, let's see if second one is better","review":"I just returned my Breadman after only 2 loafs made. It appears the metal brackets which hold the bread pan in place are ineffective. During the kneading process the bread pan will pop up out of the drive assembly and essentialy stop turning the mixer arm. I liked what I saw otherwise. My first 2 loaves came out as expected, and controls were intuitive enough. I'm hoping my second one works!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible item! Do not buy!","review":"I received this item as a Christmas gift, and I wish my family had listened to all the negative reviews of this product. I attempted to bake a loaf of basic white bread, and the kneading paddle popped off during one of the kneading cycles. I failed to notice it, so I had to dig the paddle out of the \\"finished\\" loaf of bread. By \\"finished\\" I mean the bread was cooked on the bottom and raw on the top...which is probably because the bread pan popped out during the last cycle (which I also failed to notice). If you like paperweights that make paperweights, then this item is for you! If you want a breadmaker that makes bread, do not buy this item. I'm waiting for a refund for this item so I can try my luck with another one (not by Breadman) and hope I have better results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem and no customer support","review":"I bought a new Breadman TR2500BC bread maker and used it to bake five or six loaves. At least three times, the kneading paddle came off the shaft during the kneading process and worked its way toward one end of the loaf, resulting in ruined bread. The paddle does not seem to fit on the drive shaft as tightly as it should. If I place the paddle on the shaft, pushing it on firmly, and then hold the otherwise empty bread pan upside down and shake it lightly, the paddle drops off the shaft. I tried unsuccessfully to send an e-mail to the address given in the instruction manual, but my server said it was not deliverable. I then mailed a letter to the Consumer Relations Department, also at an address shown in the manual. That was a month and a half ago.

I worked with the Salton customer service (Jeff C.) and he verified my Amazon receipt and promised to order a replacement part on 9/15. However, I didn't get any response to my follow-up since. It has been a very frustrating experience and I feel perhaps other people can use this precaution. 1) The fact that the manual cover page has instructions for customer with incorrect parts could be an indication that this happens quite often. To me, it tells me that the Breadman products may have a serious production problem, parts are often mispackaged. 2) Customer service level is not acceptable.It is a shame that this is supposed to be an excellent machine. I wrote to customer service asking for a return label to return the machine, and it has gotten no response either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy!","review":"Pan keeps jumping out of the clips and track!!!

My Breadman frequently stalls during the Knead 2 cycle. Other times, the entire pan pops out of its clips and I have to unplug the machine to re-insert the baking pan.

I could set up the recipe I wanted to make and walk off. It was noisy during the kneading cycle but that didn't last too long, and the bread it turned out was great. (The trick is to get the water at the right temperature). After using it frequently, however, the pan has started jumping during the kneading process over and over. I can't seem to get the pan pushed down far enough to get it over the clip rings on the sides despite pushing as hard as I can, so the pan just jumps around. I wind up standing next to the machine and holding the pan in the machine while it's kneading. After the kneading cycle is over I can lower the lid and walk off and it bakes the bread well.

I ran an empty cycle first as the manual suggested, and everything was fine. I then made my very first bread, which turned out ok. But the bread pan got stuck inside the machine.

I've had to stand over the machine and resecure the pan several times during this cycle. After the dough has risen and the second kneading cycle begins the pan pops up again. If I am not there to catch it, the dough is ruined. I called customer-no-service three days ago and have not received a response.

So far I really like it though.Also the coating on the paddle started to peel (not helping my fear of these unhealthy coatings) and I could not find a replacement paddle.

I cut a piece of 1\\"x1\\" pine molding so that it fits snugly across the top of the pan (lengthwise), but wedges itself under the lip around the baking compartment. This serves to wedge the pan into its proper place. It has held steady for more than 6 loaves. I suspect it will eventually bend the metal out of shape, and I may have to use a longer piece of wood to hold it in place. WARNING: I first tried this with plastic tips on the end of the wood, so as not to scratch the metal surface, and make it fit more snugly, but the heat during the baking cycle melted the tips. I suppose you could stand over the machine and remmove the wooden brace after the final kneading cycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good quality","review":"Despite the negative reviews, I purchased this machine because of the different features.

I sent it back since I didn't want her to open a USED Christmas present. Amazon promptly shipped me another USED breadmaker. This time it was even worse.

I did make bread in 2 of these and it consistently made a great bread. I just don't understand why they can't make these machines better.

White bread (1.5lb) - the pan snaps out of the spring brackets during the kneading cycle. Happens 100%. The machine cannot be left unattended during kneading, which defeats the purpose of the delay timer. Other that that, the bread bakes ok and comes out fine.2. Whole wheat bread (2lb) - the dough didn't mix properly and ended up with sodden bread with big hard flour lumps - total disaster.3. Banana bread (batter bread) - as with the whole wheat bread, some lumps in the dough, usable, but not great.The Breadman 2500BC fails mechanically to do what it's suppose to do.

I have an earlier version of this bread maker and wanted to get another machine for a number of reasons. Customer service could tell me nothing.. Not even where I could buy one.. The back ground noise was at a level where I could hardly hear the representative speak and they demanded my phone number before they would even talk to me. Once they did the information was so generic it was useless.. From the very moment I called in it was all about getting me off the phone.

I tried 3 DVD's to make sure that it wasn't the disc causing the problems. I haven't tried the MP3-CD option, mostly because my new toy was quickly being packed-up and driven to the post office.

In my career(Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University), I've had many opportunities to see what engineers, psychologists, and especially engineers for whom English is a third for fourth language do to mangle English prose.

Heart felt originality and the album's refusal to stay put in predictable stylistic ruts make this CD one to be played again and again. The well crafted songs and great sounds give Rover Songs an appeal close to that of any big name, major label artist on the scene today. Styles heard on the album range from pop melody to brooding Pink Floyd darkness to country-rock to piano ballad. Jim pulls them off with ease and still avoids the trap of being immitative.

Not to mention that the software that doesn't work is the studio software, so if you want to make music, and you run a decent operating system, your out of luck.

True love always prevails..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Research, But Romance Novel In Disguise","review":"You should believe what the reviewer for Publisher's Weekly says about the stilted prose and the one-dimensional characters in this book. Sundaresan's wonderful job with the setting and history of this time in India are diminished by the corny love story. When the unfolding \\"romance\\" is the focus, everything gets gushy and begins to sound like a Danielle Steele novel gone amuck. I hope Sundaresan keeps writing and gets the two halves (believeable historical details and believable characters) to balance out a bit more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I found this a very dissapointing read. The author's understanding of courtly life is shallow as is her use of court language. Apart from some factual errors--which may be overlooked since this is after all fiction, the characters of Mehurnissa, Prince Salim or any of the others, are not fully developed. I really did not care one or other what happened to any of them.This is a very interesting period in Indian history and deserves a more understanding treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looooong and slow","review":"I typically love books based on Indian culture and cultures that have arranged marriages, etc. However this book was not what I had hoped it would be.While the story starts out great with a growing family moving to make a better life for themselves and the experiences they face, it slowly becomes something a bit more political and focuses on war too much. I could not get passed the war talk! It seemed to go on forever and I was disappointed by how the story unfolded. There seemed to be too much about the war and not enough about the main characters. I was very disappointed but that is probably because I was thinking the story would be something entirely different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a huge fan of historical fiction (The Borgia Bride; The Red Tent; I, Elizabeth; anything by Phillippa Gregory, etc) but was rather disappointed by The Twentieth Wife, especially the lack of closure at the end of the novel, as if it were written merely in preparation for the sequal. While I appreciate the level of research and commend the author's dedication to her subject and trying to capture the world Melrunnissa lived in, I felt parts of the book lacked direction and were quite boring and long-winded. Additionally, while the author was so methodical in her research, it was disappointing that the dialogue did not ring true to this time period."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre history and romance","review":"I have to say I was dissappointed with this book. I really wanted to like it...it had been strongly recommended--i love history and historical fiction and the Mughal period in history, but the writing fell short. The characters are mere sketches for whom the reader cannot develop any real empathy. The romance between Jahangir and Mehrunnissa is not given any depth. There are numerous very basic cultural and linguistic inaccuracies that should have been corrected in editing. The descriptive writing borders on cliche and stereotype. Not impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshingly engrossing...","review":"I absolutely loved the book. Didn't want to go to work until I finished it. It is really a delightful read, unlike other recent works from South-Asian writers that have flogged the topic of \\"expatriate anguish\\", where invariably one character wants to steer away from everything native and seeks refuge with an individual from the adopted country. A topic which does disservice to immigrant sensibilities.This book has a wonderful mix of history and fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travel to a new world","review":"I read this book while I was pregnant with my twins. I knew a vacation was not coming anytime soon so I ventured into a new world for me -- India. I loved this book, filled with drama, mystery, history and just lots of good reading. I read this and The Feast of Roses and now that my twins are 4 months I have loaned them to three people that agree. Great book, savor it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The twentieth wife","review":"I am going to buy the next book of the series.I enjoy historical fiction and this book was great. The characters are all so believable and interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising Start","review":"I agree with many of the Editorial Reviews above. There are so many nice things to say about this book - facinating historical periods that are rarely used in American books, intriguing characters and interesting events. However, it is easy to be distracted by the stilted writing and the lack of character development. As much promise as this book had, it reads more like a Danielle Steele novel - the main character claws her way out of poverty (with well-timed, if unexplained, assistance from other characters) to become the most powerful woman in her region. I hope Indu Sundaresan continues to develop her writing skills because she has certainly found an interesting topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birlliant introduction to an over-looked era","review":"I just finished this novel and I immediately looked to pick up the next volume - which is not published yet. The brilliance of the Mughal Empire is fully set out, no trite or repetitive descriptions. It is wonderful to see a writer focusing on a time in Indian history other than the British Raj and doing such an excellent job with her writing. I would heartily recommend this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too wordy and too many characters.","review":"There were far too many characters and they changed their names. I could not keep upl with the story because I was forgetting who did what. I read for relaxation, this was far too complicated and I read at least 2 books a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging","review":"This is quite well written and an engaging book. The author managers to generate some authentic romantic buzz between the two leads and takes the reader into this world quite well. If you're interested in this period of history and like a romance you'll probably enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it","review":"I generally like historical fiction and I'm fascinated by India culture. However this book dragged in the middle. I thought it was going to be a love story, but at least half of the book detours away from the story about the main characters. I had to push myself to finish it and I don't think I'm going to read the others as I had planned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a love story","review":"I enjoyed this book but it was basically just a very long love story with a predictable ending. I know next to nothing about the history of India and enjoy learning my history through fiction, but this book didn't help. I didn't realize this book was really just a long love story based on truth. It did have some peppering of history throughout but I found it a bit tiresome just reading about the angst between this couple that you know will finally get together in the end. Definitely a \\"chick book\\" in my opinion despite some talk of fighting and male envy/jealousy as to who gets to be king. If you want to read a love story - go ahead but if you want real history, move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got thru it","review":"Another book I had to read for book club. If you've followed any of my reviews you know this is not my style. I don't get how an author basically relates historical facts with some character interaction around them. The characters were disjointed and didn't relate well. Also, several of my friends had not researched this and realized this is a tale in two books. We were all disappointed at where the author decided to end the tale, after struggling so hard to get to that point. Just very one dimensional. The world did not feel alive, it felt much like a fictionalized school history book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life to an Era","review":"The book gives life to an age long past, a civilization which stood on the same soil we stand today. They lived, they breathed, they ate, they sang, and yet today they lay forgotten in their graves, mentioned only for the wars they fought and the lands they captured. This book explores the humanity of those people, and shows how much, and how little, life has changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"The book had a great story to it and some valuable history lessons as well. I was hooked from the first chapter. Perfect mix of history and intrigue!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Editing anyone?","review":"I think this book could have been a lot better if the editing were done correctly. I found all the mistakes boring and annoying.

I wish my history books in school were written the same way...I would have learned something."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried so hard to like this book...","review":"I tried so hard to like this book. The story is a magnificent one, the history so alive but I couldn't get myself past the fact that a 6-8 year old could be so wordly and articulate. Her obsession and goal to marry Prince Salim from such a young age held little ground. No reason or impetus was given for this sudden aspiration. I only got to chapter 3 when I had to put it down as it lacked conviction and authority."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I spend all my time reading. What a treasure it is to find an extremely well writtten book that is so fascinating that I can't wait until I have time to pick it up and continue reading.

Only one word comes to mind \\"fantastic\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a delight!","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this book - historical fiction at it's best! If you want a taste of Mughal India under Akbar, this will leave you wanting for more. I felt like I was transported to 17th century India. Along with the historical perspective, you also get a very engaging story with a number of sub-plots....highly recommended. Now I have to read the sequel...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Twentieth Wife","review":"It is easy reading and I have enjoyed this author very much. I will probably buy some more of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engrossing read about an interesting time and place","review":"This was a well-crafted historic novel about women in the Mughal Empire (what is now Pakistan, Afghanistan and India) several hundred years ago. Characters are engaging, and the intrigues of various attempts at the throne are shown in interesting ways, recalling similar fights for supremacy in England of old. If the test of a novel is that it interests you in the time period and setting, this one is a success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay...","review":"as an avid reader of historical fiction, I can honestly say this is not the worst book I have read. However, the author's many mistakes really make this hard to read- for example, I have never heard of the word \\"Bapa\\" being used to address one's father (I grew up speaking Urdu)- and the author refers to the maternal grandfather as \\"Dada\\"- when the word is Nana. Mughal women did not wear \\"ghagara\\"s (loose skirts); rather they wore \\"gharaara\\"s, a sort of split skirt with embroidery and embellishments. And Muslims don't greet each other with \\"InshaAllah\\"- which means, God Willing- the author uses this phrase numerous times as a greeting or salutation. If you are familiar with the culture and language, it is annoying to read these mistakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"If asked to describe The Twentieth Wife in one word, I would choose captivating. This novel relays actual historic events of the Mughal Empire circa 1601 through fictional storytelling. The reader gets history, romance, and strong social commentary on a woman's role all in one. I finished this novel of about 400 pages in two days because it involves its reader and I couldn't put it down. An excellent novel with equally excellent themes about the power behind the veil."},{"rating":"2","title":"More fiction than history, but very well-written","review":"Like most historical fiction, this book is more fiction than history. However, the historical details are present, and not in a superfluous manner--they were sufficient to keep me from getting frustrated and were acutally woven into the story, not just halfheartedly thrown in.As for the story itself, Sundaresan is a good writer, and knows how to hold her reader's interest. The characters are reasonably well-developed (I say \\"reasonably\\" because some are better developed than others), the descriptions are enough to keep the reader's imagination fired but not excessive, and the plotline itself is strong. I wouldn't put this book in the top-10 I have ever read, but it was still a four-star read and I will be one of the first to own \\"Feast of Roses\\", the sequel to \\"Twentieth Wife\\", when it comes out on paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Love Story with History","review":"Everyone knows about what led to the building of the Taj Mahal, but the history behind it is fascinating. Without Mehrunnisa, maybe the Taj Mahal would never be build. Interwined in this love story is pieces of history that make the book more captivating. I could not put this book down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"I recieved this drive as a gift Christmas 2001.

This thing has disabled my computer five times in the last two hours. Which is to say, each time I have tried to use it.

The fact that Iomega includes a postcard exhorting you to not return the product to the store without first consulting Iomega \\"customer support\\" is a very, very good indication that they have very little faith in the likelihood of this product working.

Guess what the serial number on my CD-RW started with? Iomega admits it was a problem they just discovered. Had I been warned in the beginning I would not have bought this particular unit.

It is known to have some issues with Windows XP.Overall the CD drive is fast enough. It burns a typical 700 Mb CD in about 17 minutes at 4 X speed. If you get errors while burning I would suggest using a slower speed.Hard Disk to CD write max speed is 4X but for CD to CD dopy this burner is slower and you are better off burning at 2 X speed.I found the CD drive to be very handy and [inexpensive] for my needs.Note : It also works under RedHat Linux 8.0 with GToaster and xcdRoast software."},{"rating":"2","title":"These reviews scared me at first....","review":"After reading all of these reviews (after I already ordered a reconditioned model), I began having buyer's remorse. But, the product works like a champ. I set it up according to the simple instructions (WinME, Gateway Desktop, USB) and was burning CDs in no time. I have to admit, though, I have had some experience with the Adaptec product, and if you are doing data CDs, avoid the \\"Direct CD\\" button, and only burn them using \\"Data CD.\\" The Data CD option shows you more of what is going on and gives you some indication that progress is being made. Two of my CDs turned into coasters using the Direct CD software; which is probably due more to my impatience than any problem with the software. Overall, this was a good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Drive for the Mac","review":"Bought this drive to use on my older PowerMac; once I installed the software and the USB driver from Apple it worked very well. My only gripe is that there is no written manual that comes with the drive and the online manual from Iomega is slow, cumbersome, and not very helpful. Given this it was frustrating figuring out how to use CD-RW discs with this drive, which as another rater mentioned must be formatted. Unfortunately I've only been able to write music at x2 speeds, but I think this is a limitation of the Apple software. I've also noticed media differences, I would stick with TDK and avoid Memorex which the drive has a hard time recognizing. Overall, I think this is a great cross-platform product."},{"rating":"2","title":"burn baby burn!!!","review":"I like this Cd ReWriter very much! The software is very compatable with my Macintosh and it works very quickly to make copies of all my software. Music takes some time, but music isn't what I burn a lot of cd's for.

I've been in contact with Iomega technical support first via email (took weeks) and then on the phone (available weekdays only from 9 to 5!). I've received numerous (sometimes conflicting) advises from Iomega technical support personal. None of the solutions led to a satisfactory outcome. The device ruined dozens of blank CDs.If you have a Toshiba laptop DO NOT buy this device.

Not so with this: I upgraded to w2k and Iomega sent me to Adaptec sent me to Roxie to find out I had to BUY the software upgrade. SOLUTION: I 'borrowed' a new drive from the store and returned it later.A couple of the audio cd's I made wont play in my car stereo, but that could be the discs theirselves. If you want to use Nero, the adaptec software will conflict with it. I uninstalled adaptec, installed Nero and re-installed adaptec and then the software was compatible.But the software upgrade issue was the drawing line for me. There is just to much technological change to be charging people for upgrades so they can keep using the hardware they already bought!

It has ruined so many of my brand new CD-RW's and CD-R's and that's with the media Iomega says IS compatible.

I made sure I used compatible media and get \\"disk severly damaged\\" messages practically after every burn of a new CD-RW. CD-R data disks freeze up during copying files and become useless. CD-RW disks accept the copying of files, but for the most part can't be read in regular CD-Roms drives (even if the UDF reader software is installed). Also, it takes 45 minutes to format each CD-RW disk. The Easy CD Creator and the Direct CD software included for burning music CD's freezes up and makes the CD-R unusable.

He then brushed me off with the suggestion that I check whether my media (which I had told him had been supplied by Iomega) was compatible with the product.

You can tell how certain chapters go off topic that the editors were desperate for any contributions they could get. Here, however, clearly the editor had chapter ideas in mind and found writers that could follow through.Still, this book had competing flaws. At times, it states things obvious about bisexual concerns. Then other chapters were far too theoretically-high-falutin'. I wanted to send the chapter on bisexual, African-American men to some buddies, but it was all jargon and no beef. It may help the author get tenure somewhere, but it's otherwise useless.Books on bisexuality like \\"Closer to Home\\" and \\"Bisexual Politics\\" are excellent.

While the subject matter is a political hot potato, this was a pretty good \\"made in Hollywood\\" movie, especially Bai Ling's performance as the female lawyer who steps in to defend Richard Gere from false charges - at first believing him to be guilty and then growing to see that he is innocent. The other thing that adds to the emotional depth of the movie is the beautiful music score. For these two reasons alone it is worth getting a copy of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good moments but mediocre on the whole","review":"This is almost a good movie. It has a statement to make(China's prisons are not the best place to be afterall) , a decent plot and an Oscar-worthing perfomance from Bai Ling as Richard Gere's chinese laywer.The problems begin with Gere's colourless acting and the directors obsession to make him stand out.It's silly to watch him use his right to defend himself in the chinese court.How can you believe that a common business man would have the guts and the brains to do that ? Then it's the producers fear not to let the chinese actors speak their mothertongue for more than five minutes.They somehow seem to be scared that if they do so , the audiences will be bored and leave the cinemas before the halfway mark.\\"I'm gonna tell you this in english in order not to humiliate you\\" says Ling's character, to a chinese officer in some justice building full of files . Ok but...why?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A well attained picture!","review":"China is the big frame, in which the drama will take place. An instigated murder from the Power highest spheres. There must be someone on whom to assign the false crime: an American.To prove his innocence with the well know barriers of the idiom among other obstacles will be the stage of this suspenseful thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe what that you see here(severity to who resist)","review":"An amusing way to think of movies like this - what if it was a Chinese buisnessman in the United States? The xenophobia of the Chinese in the movie, is just a reflection of the popular American view (which Hollywood is obliged to respect and re-enforce). American audiences will not see anything different, just the expected \\"horned\\" foreigners and the triumph of the \\"white male\\" over the other slithering slimy characters. And, of course, the reason why our hero is in the him vs. everyone in the movie because of trade issues. If you liked this movie, then you might want to try \\"Rules of Engagement\\"However, credit must be given to the beautiful photography and the very textured and captivating music (and that's one start for each)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My stars are for Bai Ling","review":"I haven't watched many of Bai Ling's American films other than Red Corner. I just saw her in Dumplings - Three Extremes and she is fabulous. It was sometimes disappointing seeing photos of Bai Ling in loud and revealing clothing so different from her subdued knockout style in Red Corner but Dumplings made me come around to appreciating Bai Ling regardless of what she is wearing and to even appreciate the beauty and talent she has to carry off some really wild outfits. She really is a very good actress. I think there are many ways to SELL yourself as a media product and she's a lot better than some of the professional girls next door in HK cinema who can NOT act. Bai Ling is willing to put aside personal concerns and to expose herself (not just physically) to do a good job and I hope Chinese filmmakers use her more. I would love to see her in more quality productions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Product came with slight blemishes, but played extremely well. Good job all the way around.

Instead of being the super tough hero he gets kicked around a lot which lends him an air of humility, for once. I am a bit of a China fan so I am biased about this film, but it has a reasonably good story and is well acted. The only thing that annoys me is the fact that if they really wanted to set him up then they would have appointed a biased judge who would see him convicted no matter what...but let's not argue with that as we need to allow the makers some poetic licence. Altogether a \\"worth seeing\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bai Ling is nice actress !","review":"I have just watched this video and now am very interrested in Bai Ling.She is very nice and very attractive actress.Richard Gere is of course very nice.

Scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"I will not rehash points about the novel's quality/structure/etc. as dozens of review have already done so. I'll keep it short and sweet.Pros:Original ideas/story, solid scientific accuracy (as far as I can tell)Powerful atmosphereEnjoyable, dynamic, intelligent writing styleCons:Poor balance of multiple storylines (+some storylines are not satisfactorily resolved)Characters somewhat lacking in development; some characters are arguably extraneousBook lacks cohesion; transitions are not smoothThis is one of my favorite science fiction novels ever. Bear's writing style here is tops. It's just an extremely enjoyable, innovative, well-written book with a few narrative issues. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in a nanotech SF book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read.","review":"It's not just about science fiction, it's also about human emotions. The first part of the book gets quite confusing (it might help to have taken a year or two of a biology class) but after it, the book picks up and is quite good. Nice ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfocused Virus Story","review":"\\"Blood Music\\" has a cool premise about a bizarre, self-aware virus that spreads across the United States and communicates with its human hosts, but it sadly never really works.For one thing, there are WAY TOO MANY characters to keep track of. We don't care about too many of them, because (1)We don't spend enough time with them and (2)They die too quickly.The story moves at an incredibly slow pace, when it should be moving like a rocket. I don't mean to sound impatient, but a story like this deserved a faster pace.This book should have been tighter and more character-driven (with fewer characters). The story is too dull to complement its premise. All that promise from the premise was wasted. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glaahhh!!! They published this pile of bupkus?","review":"I only made it seventy pages before I couldn't read any more. I tried to skim another 70 pages but I couldn't even stand that. This is bar none, the WORST sci-fi novel I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loss of identity is GOOD for you!","review":"Don't be misled by the utopian aspirations of the climax; BLOOD MUSIC is little more than fascist propaganda in disguise. All flaws are removed, all imperfections are eliminated, and everyone has become one big, happy family of mutant muck. Adolf and Josef would have embraced the concept of the noosphere with open arms. In some regards, BLOOD MUSIC is similar to a fan-written STAR TREK novel that tries to depict the Borg as the good guys.Filled to the brim with unlikeable characters, a clunky narrative, and the final, vile message that turning down the chance to be \\"assimilated\\" is ultimately wrong, even foolish, Mr. Bear really, REALLY should have known better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down.......","review":"This is the first Greg Bear book that I read, and I was hooked almost from page 1. This is a book that you shouldn't start if you have to go to work the following day, as you will be up late finishing the book. If that isn't bad enough, once you finish the book, you can't get your mind to shut off and go to sleep. This was one of the most entertaining books I have read, my only regrets is that the following day at work on only a couple of hours sleep was not very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Early Bear","review":"Some readers might take issue with the author's concept of bioengineering leading to posthumanity instead of nanotechnology. But remember, this book was written before K. Eric Drexler published \\"Engines of Creation\\" and well before Robert L. Freitas began describing nanomedicine. While Bear's book does not use the term Singularity - again, this is nearly a decade before Vernor Vinge's famous 1993 speech - it does contain a moving depiction of just such an event. \\"Blood Music\\" is remarkably far-sighted and it's also a ripping good yarn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique concept draws you in","review":"This is an interesting variation on the biodisaster thriller.A scientist creates blood cells that are able to think, but when they get loose what they think is that they'd like to change the world. This novel is intriguing, but some of its more human aspects tend to be watered down at the end. However, the concept is brilliant, and well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Use of Sentient Microbes","review":"Maybe the original Novella this book was based off of had a tighter structure and delivered a story which knew where to stop. It won a Hugo award, I think, and the first 150 pages shined... but afterwards, failure. Too many elements from Hollywood B-movies, most notably 'The Blob' made the late book into a joke. Professor Vergil, despite his technical know-how, comes off as a lonely man who wasn't careful what he wished for.Perhaps I wouldn't judge this book so harshly if I hadn't read it second. While it was published beforeThe Children Star (Elysium Cycle)andBrain Plague (Elysium Cycle), those books by Biology professor Joan Slonczewski covered the same topic with hope instead of ruin. Reading Blood Music after those masterpieces was a big letdown.Overall, I can't recommend this book compared to the two novels above. It's headed for my used bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Im not impressed easily! Wow!!!","review":"This is a great book. I had never read Greg Bear before (and now I cant wait to read another). A friend of mine lent me this and I could not put it down. Very well written and intriguing!! I loved it. I never would have guessed the way he ended the book.

Feel free to email me. : )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expansion of a great short story into an overlong novel","review":"The original short story was wonderfully written and lead to a plausable and chilling conclusion. The novel expanded the story and altered it with additional material which, to my estimation, seriously detracts from the impact and interest of the original. Just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"No no no!","review":"Bought this for my 1998 Honda Civic Si when the power antenna broke.

I gave it 2 stars instead of one because there is nothing wrong with the version itself, just the weak content."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED THIS BOOK!! A MUST READ...INCREDIBLE BIOGRAPHY","review":"I would make this book required reading for students of American History. One single page can interest the reader to do more research. For instance, the whaling industry in the 1830's, historical homes to visit, a view of Wall Street so long ago...The writing is excellent and I am an avid reader of biographies. I am also a daughter of a Wall Street stock broker. I had heard of the infamous Hetty Green; the \\"Witch of Wall Street\\". And to think.. someone finally wrote a book...WOW!I grabbed the book off the shelf at Barnes & Noble and was not dissappointed. Excellent writing. So well written.. Three cheers for the author. I am grateful that somone wrote a book on this incredible woman. Now I know more about her. Facinating..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compassionate biography well written","review":"Charles Slack takes a refreshing look at a significant American financier. If not the target of a collective smeer campaign by her competitors (and a complicit media looking for another heady Hetty story), Hetty Green has at the very least not received her due as an American financial titan--until now. Slack ably makes the case that Green knew her stuff and stuck to her guns. No smoke and mirrors here and no apologies. Just a woman--granted sometimes fascinatingly eccentric--who knew how to create wealth and took great pleasure in doing it. Slack writes elegantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Biography, But. . .","review":"I enjoyed this read very much, and reached the 50% mark on my Kindle the first night. My lone complaint with this biography, and it is a substantial one, is that Hetty Green comes across as a one-dimensional person throughout the book. We are told over and over again that she was greedy, cold, cheap, short-tempered, and had no use for proper hygiene. The author does not relate any stories that represent the positive side of the subject's personality. It seems to me that a woman who lived into her eighties must have had good days when she was warm, giving, and caring. Certainly, no person is so locked into personality traits that they can't manifest other traits from time to time. Although it would have been nice for Hetty's personality to have been fleshed out in greater detail to allow for some positive attributes, let me reiterate that the book was well written and is certainly worth the Kindle price of $9.95."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double check compatibility","review":"Great card, but it has compatibility problems with the Abit KT7 (RAID) motherboard and Windows 2000.

Easily beats out great books like John Gray's Mars and Venus in the Bedroom, or Charles and Caroline Muir's Tantra: The Art of Concious Loving. Adds a depth of wisdom, spirituality, practicality, and insight into men and women's sexual needs and their loving satisfaction that is missing from other books on sex. Its an easy to read book that has a lot of practical real life examples on how couples can better communicate and act to solve common sexual problems and use sacred sex to build a passionate, intimate, love relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!","review":"If you read Vachss for his Burke series, don't bother with this long-winded and ultimately pointless disappointment!

Save your money for the next Burke novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Territory for Vachss - Might Take One More to Get it Right","review":"The prose, characterizations, and plotting here are up to Vachss's usual high standards, but this is the first time Vachss has attempted, so far as I know, a sprawling, multi-POV, omniscient narration; his wielding of this new tool is a little clumsy. Vachss has been working in first person mode for a long time. He seems a little uncomfortable with the omniscient narration and consequently overuses the tool of dialog-as-exposition. But that more of a writer's complaint than a reader's. If you like a good noir crime story, this is well worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"I have been reading Andrew Vachss' books for over a decade and have enjoyed the entire Burke series (although the earlier books were better than the later ones), but Two Trains Running did nothing for me.I found that the book was just too convoluted and trying too hard to do a James Ellroy in complexity of characters and depth. It just didn't come across well at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strike One","review":"Worst book I have read this year. Have read a lot of A Vachss but he missed me completely here.

You'll need to track many, many characters and plot lines--some of which are simply left dangling at the end of the book.\\"Trains...\\" is skillfully written here and there, but more work than fun to sit down and read. Brace yourself for the flat footed conversations between Dett, the anti-hero, and his small town girlfriend which go on forever. Where was the editor?Sex happens, yes, but it's too often complex and unenjoyable. Sporadic scenes of explosive violence--mainly at the end-- fail to animate a plodding and somewhat confusing story. And speaking of confusion, this is the second book called \\"Two Trains Running\\" to appear in the last year. Obviously it's a pretty good title; maybe all books should be called \\"Two Trains Running.\\" Anyway, this is the one with individually dated paragraphs."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 and 1/2 stars -- Slooooooow train to nowhere","review":"I've read several of the Burke novels. They have always held my interest -- even when they stretch credulity. This one (NO Burke) is a disappointment.

However, its hyper syncopated keyboard riffs and double time drums are a rush for those who want to rock. The other 3 songs on the EP (which so far are exclusive to this disk) are more standard RW and all quite good, sporting clean sound with some nice guitar bits and sing song melodies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking fragrance","review":"I bought this product for $18.00 and with shipping it came to $24.95.

I would not recommend this product to anyone. I feel I have been taken for the money that it cost and yet, when I checked it out online, before purchasing, it got 5 stars out of 5.

The authors have some creative ideas about what life may be like in that period. Unfortunately, they do not find creative ways to communicate these ideas. The characters are continuously saying things that should be obvious to their companions so the only point of most of the dialogue is to tell the readers what is going on. This makes for very awkward and forced conversations that leave no room for character development. The concept is great but this is a poorly written book hardly worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Fiction","review":"I cannot get over how so much of Christian fiction is two dimensional. The characters are flat. The story is flat. In this particular case the absence of Jesus through the entire book is a bit bizarre. The idea that Jesus' main associates in the book have forgotten all the teachings of the Bible is really far out there in unbelievable land.

The lyrics and the music complement eachother to bring a fresh perspective on the feelings of the people involved and afforded me fresh insight into some of the possible motives behind the actions of Judas Iscariot, Herod, etc. In addition, the lyrics helped to bring the characters alive.

Great, complex characters, lots of historical detail and insight-- and a very suspenseful plot. Combines tragedy, patriotism, love, lust, and sudden, savage violence into a rip-roaring story.Based on true events, Fleming provides insight into historical characters great and small. Towering above them all-- as he does in ANY book that is true to the events-- is George Washington.A vastly under rated soldier, who learned quickly from his early mistakes, GW was also a brilliant spymaster, who probably integrated intelligence work with the tactical movements of his army, as well as any commander in US history.Lively, informative, and entertaining, this continuation of Fleming's Liberty Tavern series is as fun a way to learn about American history as has yet been invented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moog K6131 Pitman Arm","review":"Moog K6131 Pitman ArmExcellent quality heavy duty parts that I have been using for years, The only thing I wish was different was that the typical grease boot on this specific part is only a foam washer?

Then again, in those days, everything was polorized. Music, like hair and dress, was politics.This is fortunately no longer the case, and if you like soul jazz, look no further than this album. McCann and Harris create a tight, rocking R&B; that is both danceable and ellgent. This is not a organ romp one off, but polished, well-composed music with outstanding players.

Also on hand is a 20 year-old Betty Grable, who was still about 4 years away from becoming a star, and having to stumble through middling pictures like this in between.For Garland or Grable completists, this is an obvious buy...but others will likely be better off spending their money on a better movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Item Details","review":"Details lists for a 1 1/16 inch sway bar.

This is just a rediculous film that in its weak attempts to 'explode prejudice' and 'deal with 9/11' fails miserably.The director evidently felt that by making the film complicated and giving it 'twists and turns' and trying to be unpredictable that this would solve the problem of the characters, neither of which are realistic or honest.

She lives with her mother, but spends time with her father.

Okay, maybe not all, but there is a hell of a range here. If you ever wondered whether the jazz flute could do anything more for you than help pass the time from the produce section to the meat section or from floor one to floor five, this is where you must settle that question.

Its all great stuff this!Herbie Mann and Roland Kirk appear twice which is good as they're two of the most famous jazz-flautists. \\"One Ton\\" by Kirk has got the most hilarious flute/nose flute solo I've ever heard.Really, the flute has to be the coolest instrument in the world when put into the right musical context and I think here is a good example of what can be achieved when said theory is put into practise.

I'm a big fan of their previous works including Burn Out At The Hydrogen Bar and East Side Militia. I'm really into most of the bands on Underground Inc. and last saw Jared performing with Pigface. It was awesome to hear him singing some Chemlab with them.After listening to this album, I was really disappointed. The sound and direction of the music was lacking their unique sound. Every time I thought the album would get better, I was let down. Only a few songs stood out to me, like Force Quit, Monkey God and Atomic Automatic.

And while I go back and play most of my older games regularly, I never play this one. Why? Because of one bug.Due to a programming glitch, the \\"Dance Play Settings\\" menu was omitted. As a result, it is impossible to disable the corner buttons on a dance mat without a gameshark or similar modification device. The corner buttons are enabled to allow play with a regular controller, but are not intended for use with a dancepad. Of course, since this game is designed for a dancepad, this is a problem. With the corner buttons on, this game constantly registers mis-hits on my steps and is basically unplayable.Konami should not have released this game with this bug, and they should have offered an update for free with a bugfix. As it, the game is unplayable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Teen's Review","review":"Coming from DDR Extreme 2, I felt this version was a little less... advanced.

I like playing, and played without reading the manual. So I got to be pleasantly surprised by lots of things, like new songs appearing and getting an AA rating on beginner mode. I didn't like playing with the eye toy though, that was just weird.I don't know any of the game-playing nuances, or how it compares to other versions of DDR, or for that matter, what game play is like on the more advanced levels. But I have had fun. And there is a good mix of different songs with different tempos. And I like the workout mode. It empowers me to see the calories burned and how that compares to activities like jogging or swimming, even IF the numbers are not totally accurate. I have no idea if they take weight into consideration for their calculations, for example.I enjoy myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the arcade game","review":"If you are looking for all your favorite songs that you find on the arcade version, you won't find it here.

Most songs aren't even moderately challenging, even on heavy mode. The workout mode makes no sense to me; it will track your calories but you still have to play in game mode. This means that every 3 songs, you have to go through the whole loading process again. In DDR Max 2 the workout mode is different...you can play 400 songs if you want, without starting over. The nonstop mode is also frustrating as you can't customize it. That means you might start with a song on light mode, 1x even though you want to play heavy mode 2x.Also, the new song engine is awkward but I could deal with it were the songs worth playing.I agree with the person that said this is basically a waste of $40. I've had the game since its release and I've played it about 3 times; it frustrates me and I go back to Max2."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little disappointed with this one.","review":"DDR Max2 and Extreme2 are better (better songs and dances), but it is still a phun game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dance review","review":"We did not care for this product.

The proverbial question of, \\" Why are some of the best bands so commercially underrated?\\" is unfortunately not answered with this disc. Perhaps it's just America's leaning toward cheesey pop such as The Spice Girls and Mariah Carey.

The sounds he 'harmonizes' sometimes work -- sometimes not.The liner notes mention that at one of his shows members of the audience were so upset with the quality of his music that a near riot ensued. So why did he include a track from that show? Did he want to infuriate more people? Fripp seems bent on indulging only himself. Note to Robert: it is best that a performer serve the needs of the audience.The redeeming quality of this CD is that it is unique. Certainly no one else plays like this. It sounds very interesting.

When I heard they were releasing an album I got really excited. I've listened to it many times since I bought it, and am not disapointed in the least. Great stuff, sounds awesome professionally mixed, and they're a great band to see live, put on a kick ass show. The singer has a great voice, and his screams fit in perfectly. The guitar riffs go from soft and melodic to heavy and pounding, and some weird effects thrown in are cool. Their lyrics aren't revolutionary, but they get you pumped up.

She has the baby bratz, but those dress very skimpy too. She actually took regular doll clothes that were appropriate and redressed her baby bratz without my prompting. I never thought I would buy bratz, but she really likes them and if they're not too slutty, I don't see the harm in it.

And uses energy?In any case, I just get some of the paper out of my recycling bin and line the bottom of the pail with that. Yeah, I hafta clean the pail.

Second, when I went to my compost pit to empty the pale, everything came out in a big clump and it was very hard to break the bag apart to let the contents mix throughout the pale. The bag got syrupy and stuck to all the mushy food inside. I used this product for at least a month before I got sick of it and decided to revert to using no lining.

Unfortunately, that was not the case with this item. I found it at Whole Foods for a cheaper price. The vendor wrote asking about my experience but when I complained about the price, I never heard from them again. My son has used the product and said it does not hold up well to moisture.

THen, the bags leaked or split, so I 'd have to bring the whole bin and the bag to the compost pile anyway. When we ran out, I didn't buy more and it's been fine without them. I just run the bin through the dishwasher once in awhile. Regarding degradability, I noticed they didn't break down as quickly the vegetable matter, but they did break down eventually, so they weren't a problem (I just dug them into the soil).

She tells about her family, some of the people she helped, and what happened to her while she was in jail. She also includes some details about her child life and how she felt about the war.

But after I finished reading it, I had more questions than answers. First off, when the girl tells her mother she's been raped, why doesn't she take her daughter to the hospital or Rape Crisis Center? Why don't they report the rape to the police? How did the rapist give her full-blown AIDS? Why doesn't the mother have her tested right away for HIV?When we teach kids about sex, drugs, AIDS, rape, and all the other troubles in life, we have one goal in mind; we have to teach them what to do in an emergency. This book teaches the kids what NOT to do in an emergency!Along with every other Beatrice Sparks book, I would censor this and remove it from the school library. If you are the parent of an impressionable teenager, I would advise NOT giving him/her this book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"It was so sad to read about a typical teenage girl who fell for an older guy. I discussed this book with my friends and we all agreed that if an older guy was giving us the time of day, we would fall for him. What girl wouldn't want an older boyfriend? That's what I thought until I read this book. When Nancy met Collin who was four years older them her, she fell in love with him. Though I would find it suspicous that I could never go to his apartment, I thought the story he told her was very convincing. When he raped her and gave her the HIV virus, her life went into a downward spiral. In her last few years of life, you follow her through touching and embarassing events, as well as many sad ones. I never cry when I read books or watch movies, but this one got to me. I recommend this book to any teen of pre-teen girl.

On the back of the cover it reads, \\"Reading this true story may save your life.\\" It is very true. This book teaches teens and their parentsto be more aware of the incurable disease. I would rate this book a five. I never got bored with this book. It is an excellent real life example of what can really happen to you, especially if you have the idea, \\"Oh, AIDS can never happen to me.\\" The main character in this book, Nancy, shows you what it is like dealing with AIDS in your social and physical life.

The book is extremely sad but after doing some research online there is a big debate if this book is real. Her other stories like \\"Go Ask Alice\\" have been said to be fake.

She was an innocent fourteen years old when she fell in love for the first time. Collin was a college student; he date-raped her and left her infected with the HIV virus. When I was reading this book, I could feel Nancy's pain and struggles she faced dealing with Aids. I am so proud of her and how she dealt with her situation. This book really moved me. I learned a lot from her experience. I've enjoyed reading this book. It was easy to understand. I was absorbed throughout out the book. I definitely recommend this book to all teenagers.

Why? Because although AIDS effects each persons' body differently, she would not known that fast that she had it.

After Collin met, became loved by, and then raped Nancy, he left and abandoned her. \\"Collin\\" was only a made up name. We know this because in the book the police and detectives couldn't find anyone by the name of Collin who could have done this.

I don't think so","review":"I have no idea how they market these bulbs as having any component of \\"blue\\" to the light. I bought these to better match my HID low beams, in a word they don't. The stock HIDs which are quoted to be 4300K, they are white maybe a little blue. These PIAA bulbs are if anything yellow, there is no way anybody could say these are at all blue (the back of the box calls out the blue component) with a strait face and they aren't even really white. There is no color difference between these and the bulbs that I replaced them with. That is a shame as that is the only reason somebody would buy a bulb like this. The worst part is they even show on the side of the box what their 4000K bulbs should look like, I can hold the box up next to the white wall the lights are shining on and it isn't even close.On the plus side they are not dim, but the bulbs I pulled out weren't either and they cost half the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"piaa h7 cool blue are not blue","review":"These bulbs where advertiseds as having a lite blue tint .

These bulbs light up the night like no other non-HID bulb out there. They also have a good color blend for me. One of the downsides is that (I believe) they are rated for a 500 hour life (unfortunately, longevity is sacrificed to achieve brightness). With motorcycle headlights on fulltime, and riding 300-400 hours a year, I have to swap the low beams out every year and high beams every other year. I have been using these bulbs for 5+ years and, unlike some of the other reviews, I never had one burn out in less than 350 hours. One more thing, another downside is that in a heavy rain, the whiteness of the light does not penetrate the curtain of rain drops as well as the warm white/light tan of conventional halogen bulbs.

It was a total waste of my time and money. I was disappointed because I really love her writing. One of my favorites is \\"A Knight in Shining Armor\\" by Ms. Deveraux. This one makes me think maybe I should wait until the books are in the library. I know I will not purchase one of her books in hardback. I can wait for the paperback issue.This book, in my world, is equivalent to a Harlequin romance novel written in the 70's. It is pure fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another wonderful lovestory from Jude","review":"I love all of Jude Deveraux' novels. I have read all of them except the one that I plan to purchase tonight! Her stories always leave you with a warm \\"all is right with the world\\" feeling, and this one is no different. There is just enough magic to add spice but not enough to damage the book's \\"believablity\\". We can all relate to some aspect of her heroines and we all find her heros absolutely \\"delicious\\". Her characters all have very realistic characteristics and just the right mix of humor. Love it Jude!... Keep writing and I'll keep reading. These novels are a wonderful escape vehicle."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give this book minus stars I would.","review":"I am very disappointed with this book. What kind of ending do you call what she did? Cheating the reader is what I call it. I've read many of Ms. Deveraux's books (Knight in Shining Armour) one of my all time favorites.

I won't buy another of her books that's for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not like JD's others, but very good.","review":"This is unlike Jude Deveraux's other books, as it is a combination sci-fi / mystery / part-romance.

No sex, which is usually a downfall, but I didn't mind, as the story is very good.If you read this book, you must read the other 2 books in the trilogy. It is pretty good by itself, but the other two complete the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY somewhat back to normal!","review":"I have loved Jude Deveraux's books for quite a while now, but lately it seemed that her writing had taken a rushed, undeveloped turn. I liked her older stuff MUCH better. However, this book was much closer to her normal style. I liked the characters again! I agree with many of the others though in that the characters are still not as fully developed as they used to be and that the ending petered out when it could have been great. I know she can write great endings and not the typical romance epilogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE WRITING OF A BORING STORY","review":"This is the first book I've read by this author.

I felt this book was poorly written and the characters were plastic; I couldn't connect with them. The storyline just didn't seem realistic. Reading this book was like watching a very bad TV show. I stopped at ch. 5, skimmed through the book and read the last chapter and returned the book back to the library way before the due date. If you want to read a good romance novel with a sci-fi/fantasy/supernatural element, check out the Roswell High series by Melinda Metz, or even better, watch the Rowell tv series to be rerunned on Sci-Fi Channel beginning Jan. 2003.

There were several times when the change in setting and focus left me saying \\"WHAT?\\" and I had to reread to figure out who was where and what was happening. [I should only have to do this if I put the book down for a long time and a these books are a two hour read for me.] What happened to Montgomery's parents was very out of the family story line so I had a very hard time with belief now if it had been her parents and Montgomery was the one with the sight then well... The ending was very bad. I felt as if the author lost interest [or the editor was screaming shorter shorter] near the end so it was a slapped condensed version of what should have been much much better. Instead it left me with a he said then she said feeling. The book left me sorry I didn't pick it up at a library book sale for a quarter.

Monroe, wasn't very believable and the hero, Adam Montgomery, lacked depth. Parts of the book didn't seem to be well thought-out, which was disappointing.The highlights of this book were scenes where the famous Montgomery money was used in fabulous shopping/makeover scenes...My recommendation is to buy \\"Summerhouse\\" instead. It is classic Deveraux that is beautifully written with characters people can identify with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forever? Maybe to read.","review":"I love Jude Deveraux. Since A Kight in Shinning Armor. I am a very loyal fan of hers, although I don't get her new books right away.This is a very disappointing book. I could not get into the story. It was slow moving. Too much worthless details. I could not identify with the lead character.I was just plain disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The last Jude Deveraux book I will read.","review":"I have been a fan of Jude Deveraux's for many years, but if this is any indication of the new direction she is taking with her writing I will find another author to spend my money on. The prologue is the best part of the book. I didn't believe any of the characters. Who would write a book about an antagonist who is so stupid she doesn't use her magic mirror to find out that losing her virginity will cause her to lose her powers and a mother who cares so little for her child that the child lives a street person type of existance, but shows up to sacrifice her life for her daughter's? This could have been a really good book if the author had taken time to make the characters real and not cheat the readers with basically two epilogues instead of a real ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The prologue begins with a decent opening, giving the reader the impression that he/she'll be in for a good fantasy ride. The build-up to the point of the story was OK, but a bit dragged out. Too much time was spent focusing on the usual attraction between the lead protagonists (Darci and Adam) and not enough on Darci's journey of discovery of her \\"supernatural abilities\\". The climax of the story when Darci is supposed to defeat the evil witch is too rushed. The reader is left wanting to see exactly how Darci eventually disposes of her and the life and death struggle that ensues. All in all, I found the story unbelievable and unrealistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Jude D.'s worst books.","review":"If I could have given this book no stars I would have. I own virtually every Jude Deveraux book and have read her for 14 years. Though witchcraft isn't my thing, I bought this book anyway b/c it featured a Montgomery. Boy, was that a mistake. The plot was implausible. The characters unlikeable. And I can't believe she killed off some Montgomerys! She hasn't written a good book since \\"Sweet Liar.\\" Each year the books get progressively worse. I haven't even bothered to read the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forever by Jude Deveraux","review":"First off, I have to say that Jude is my all time favorite author of romance novels! \\"Forever\\" is the first novel of her's I've read in a year or so, so it was refreshing to read. I loved it, couldn't put it down. Sure, some of the characters were \\"unbelievable\\" but who cares? It's fiction,right?I only had 2 problems with this book: The ending was abrupt and seemed rushed, or like something was missing (kinda like \\"High Tide\\") and there was no sex scene in the whole book. Although, the story didn't really need one, come on! It's a romance novel! It was like a lot of foreplay.....I would definitely reccommend this book though, I really enjoyed it, it's funny, witty and the typical Montgomery man rescuing a damsel in distress.And Jude, if you ever read this - Can you please write some more Historical Romance Novels? I like those best, and you're so good at them! Especially the family sagas like the Velvet ones (loved!)

It reads like it was written by a 10 year old. Actually, my 10 year old could write better stuff than this! The characters were flat and the dialogue was stupid. I give the publisher an A for writing an intriguing blurb on the back cover that made me pick it up. The premise was very interesting and could have made a fantastic story. I will say this though: I do find myself having to at least finish it because I do want to know how it ends. But that's all it has going for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissappointed","review":"At first, I was glad to see Ms. Deveraux wrote a Montgomery/Taggart book again...Until I read to the middle of the novel.

Everything after that first chapter is mediocre at best. The romance between the two main characters isn't interesting or realistic.I was very, very disappointed by the ending. Things were just getting really interesting and the author cuts away from it. The ending is explained in the epilogue. Also, I thought the epilogue's ending was a little too cutesy.The book did have some interesting parts but it never drew me into the story the way her other books have. Skip this one.

The characters are always dynamic and the romances, while at times out of this world are always entertaining.

Unfortunately, in comparison to her other novels, I found it to be a huge disappointment and just not as interesting or of the same caliber as some of her other books. Those looking for a great Jude Deveraux book would do better to check out Sweet Liar, Remembrance, or a Knight in Shining Armor."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!","review":"First, I love Jude Deveraux. However, this book seems like she just got tired of writing the story so she said THE END! Darci is not a truly likable person and the relationship she instantly establishes with her father is ludicrous! She describes fully what happens to the family of Adam, but when it comes to the final showdown.....suddenly we're one year later with no explanation of how it was all accomplished!!This should not have been listed as a romance as there is only ONE kiss in the entire book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The story just fell apart","review":"Let me preface my review by saying I really do like Jude Deveraux. I think her historical romances are top notch and her contemporary novels are insightful and real page-turners. Sadly this was not one of her best. I was very intrigued by the story premise of a main charcter with paranormal powers and how she is involved in this witch-coven storyline. Unfortunately, her main charcter Darci was too naive almost for belief. Even if you could move past that (we often do here in the romance genre), the suspense and excitement was ruined by the anticlimactic, disjointed ending. I just don't understand why Jude broke up the most exciting ending by adding an epilogue in the middle of it, then proceeded to kill your interest by having the climax explained by one of the characters rather than by actually describing it. Just weird. Inconsistent and weird. Not to mention frustrating. Could have been a good one - but instead it just fell apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the old Jude Deveraux???","review":"I loved her earlier books. Her last severval offerings seem to be written by a different person. I had held out hope for this one because she returns to the Montgomery family, but it falls way short.

I won't buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read","review":"As with the comments on all her novels Jude Deveraux always delivers. Her characters jump out of the page. Can't wait for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Only I Could Have Used A Magic Mirror...","review":"If only I could have used a magic mirror such as the one centering this novel, I would have seen that Jude Deveraux's latest offering holds none of the emotionally evocative romance I remembered from books like 'Velvet Song' or 'Remembrance.'The writing contained no style, the plot did not develop any tension, and the character motivations seemed malnourished (though almost every chapter included gratuitous talk of food). The narrative lacked imagery, and the dialogue disappointed me highly - no wit, no spark, just flatness. I wasn't charmed by any of the characters, nor did I develop an interest in their untimate fates, which is just as well since Ms. Deveraux chose to skip what should have been the most climactic scene in the entire book and summarize its events in an epilogue chapter.'Forever...' is definitely not worth the purchase. You're far better off reading an old favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"If this novel is typical of the author's work, I have to wonder how she ever achieved her reputation. The story is terrible; the heroine not just oddball but genuinely repugnant and geeky. There is no logic to the hero's attraction to her; she puts their lives in danger, does stupid and unattractive things, she snoops, she's insufferably smug, she's written as pathetic trailer trash, and yet this handsome and supposedly intelligent man...well, it may be the fantasy of some women out there to be able to win the handsome prince, no matter how much of a toad she may act, but this was not entertaining.I didn't care about the plot, because I didn't care about the protagonists. I detested them.I couldn't finish this book, and wish I hadn't spent my money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read!","review":"Darci Monroe is a young woman who uses her true persuasion (a paranormal gift) to help out the small old town she lives in. Not knowing her father she is left to live with her mother all her life. Darci's mother doesn't seem to be the least bit interested in Darci's life. She see's Darci as a burdon. Her mother's only passion in life is sleeping with the younger men. Darci decideds to use her true persuasion to land a job and ends up landing a job with Adam Montgomery (yep another drop dead sexy montgomer) At fist Adam Montgomery looks at her as a father would.

Always (the 2nd book) Forever and Always (the 3rd)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"Like many of you, I have been reading Jude Deveraux for a long time. Also, like many of you, I buy her books just because she wrote them. This time, I wish I would have read the customer reviews before I took the time to read the book. I can't say it was a waste of my time. The book wasn't awful. It was just disappointing to me. I kept waiting for something else ... that never happened.After writing for a period of time some authors seem to become bored with what they have been writing and try to branch out. I understand that. This just seemed to be too much of a branch out for me. I am so used to Jude Deveraux providing a GOOD love story that this one just fell flat for me.In the past, when an author has moved too far away from my reasons for reading their work I have found it easier to just let their books sit on store shelves. I'm not too sure that I'm not at that point with Jude."},{"rating":"1","title":"J.D., what are you doing to me??","review":"I really like J.D.'s historicals, so I thought I'd give _Forever_ a try. What an awful book. The characters aren't developed, and the stereotyping is much more painful even than what you see in many romance novels. (Am I supposed to swoon with envy over the heroine with \\"no fat cells\\"?? Girl, please.) We're supposed to feel good about a kidnapped, abused child/woman sleeping with a with a stranger a day after her rescue. (Therapy first? Please?) AND virginity is held up as some magical state of perfection for 30-year-old women--and ONLY women, it's made very clear. Thanks for that nice cultural regression, Jude. I am so disappointed. This book is really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never again!","review":"I am a big Jude Deveraux fan. I loved her earlier work - the Velvet Saga was awesome, the Princess was hilarious and Sweet Liar a treasure. I have to say that I'm getting more and more disappointed in her new work. I can't say I enjoyed this book at all - it was confusing and very dark, but I don't think that's how it was intended. There is no real spark or connection between any of the characters and that just makes it disturbing to read. I recommend you borrow this at your local library and save yourself the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed too!","review":"I have read more than 30 books by Ms Deveraux and usually I like them very much. Some of them I loved, others were very funny but this book was very disappointing. The characters were very weak and I had the feeling that they were only a sketch and not totally finished. They had only two dimensions and I couldn't be atracted or attached to them. The plot could have been interesting if the characters could collaborate but they seemed not to be interested. The dialogues were disjointed and empty. The problem with this book was not the intention to make a different romance without sex, I think sex in a romance book is great but not essencial for a great one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glover is ace","review":"This game is really fun and i have still not completed it after a whole year!

You must put it on the base to heat it up and once it is removed from the base it stops heating so it no longer maintains a steady heat. There is also no on or off switch on the unit so you have to disconnect the power cord when not in use.When it comes to straightening it doesn't stay hot for any length of time so it is only good for one chunk of hair, if that. The plates glide over your hair and barely make contact with it so it is hard to do small sections. When finished my hair was still bumpy and some sections looked like they hadn't even been touched with heat. I am definitely returning this product and I hope this review will keep people from spending money on this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not get hot enough","review":"I tried it, but it doesn't get hot enough...

I took over 100 pictures with this camera at all resolutions and the pictures were incredibly blurry. Only about 10, out of the 100 plus pictures, were ok quality (not very good quality at that).

This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and sorely regret buying it for my daughter. The movie purports to be about little foot learning the \\"wisdoms\\" from his grandparents and then going on an adventure applying them, but instead it winds up mocking the idea of listening and thinking about what you're doing. The comedic yellow-bellied dinos wind up providing a sort of praise for stupidity and debasement of the wisdoms. It encourages children to ignore lessons of their parents and just do whatever feels good to them at the time.To summarize the lessons this movie teaches: Kids, it's okay not to listen to your parents. Feel free to wander off with any strange kids you meet in the neighborhood. If you've been told not to do something, but it feels right at the moment, go ahead and do it anyway. Parents don't know that much anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"must have","review":"Who doesn't like Little Foot.

Loretta Roome's studies have taken her far and wide, and she stresses the importance as an artist of being able to explain the historic, symbolic, and esoteric ideals behind the art, as well as learning to create our own traditions...As a henna/mehndi artist, there are two books that are essential.

Using the gentle nature of a Basset to bring this story to life is a fantastic touch. The book's illustrations are absolutely wonderful - showing the characterization of a Basset Hound in his true form. This book is highly recommended by me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book for all ages","review":"This book is charming to say the least. To say the most the illustrations are wonderfully accurate of a basset hound and the story is one of the most wonderful I have read in a long time. Everyone has heard the stories of animals fostering other animals babies, this is a wonderful adaptation of that theme for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent resource for the end times","review":"\\"The Final Battle\\" is the best book on end times prophecy and tribulation times available. Mr. Lindsey has expertly given the facts revealed in the Bible and applied them to the world events of today. Every fact or theory presented is well worded, providing for no possibility of confusion. The purpose of this book is primarily for revealing facts about Revelation and certain passages from other books of the Bible. An added bonus: Show it to your non-Christian aquaintances to scare them with the facts of what non-Christians will have to go through. The disasters will scare anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was written before 9/11","review":"This book is one of the best descriptions of what Islam really is, and it's hatred against the Jew. This book, which was written in 1995, accurately describes and predicted conflicts that have already occurred. I think this is one of Hal's finest books, although I disagree with some of the eschatology, for instance, he thinks that the Ez 38, 39 war is the actual Final Battle, which this is clearly not the case. However, the descriptions of the countries surrounding Israel and the coming conflict he describes in perfect detail. He was warning about the dangers of Islamic fundamentalism/extremism in Afghanistan, the surrounding central Asia (ex Soviet) Muslim states, the Islamic takeover in European countries (UK, France, etc), well before most people even had heard of them until 9/11 already took place. Probably the most accurate description/predictions were the role of Iran (Persia), just look at them today for yourself. Great read, highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"more drivel designed to spread hatred and enrich Hal","review":"Again, Mr. Lindsey writes a book that contains his vision of the end times psycho drama. This guy doesn't quit and for good reason. He's found a lucrative niche starting with \\"Late, Great Planet Earth\\". He adjusts his interpretation of scripture to fit his twisted view of the endtimes every few years and writes a new book.There is one constant and that is his \\"everlasting hatred\\" toward Muslims, and most particularly Palestinians. This stuff sells well as there is a large bloc of Christians who desperately need something to hate to sustain their faith. Skip this book and read the Bible yourself.

I like that they are four wheels all around, rather than the roller blade style. These are so much easier to help her learn how to keep her balance while rolling. They do run large in size, so I'm glad I ordered them in her exact size instead of slightly larger so that she can wear them for a while. I think these will still fit next spring after the winter has come and gone. The material is great, the wheels roll smoothly, and the front brake is perfect. Couldn't ask for a better beginner skate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent skates!","review":"My first grader loves these! Not only are they pretty (that's essential!) but they're very comfortable.

Buy this book for the pictures! As always, Mr. McBride's artwork is fabulous, richly portraying the beautiful arms and armor of the Ottoman Turks and the skilled warriors that used them.Again, the text is not worthless or as far as I can tell inaccurate; in fact, I found this book to be one of Nicolle's best. The three-page chronology in the back, along with the examination of the tactics used at various battles are the most useful parts.In summary, like the similar Osprey titles 'Saladin and the Saracens', 'Armies of the Muslim Conquest', and 'The Armies of Islam 7th-11th Centuries', this book's text would be a great introduction, but the photographs and especially the color plates can be used and enjoyed by anyone with an interest in the last and the greatest of the medieval Islamic Turkish states."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful and incorrect","review":"This is a misleading work in its entirety, especially the history section. Both the text and the drawings look like they came from WWII era history books. Recent re-evaluations of Ottoman historical records have led to a dramatic change of perspective, by eminent scholars such as Heath Lowry and Rhoads Murphey, on everything from the non-Turkish contributions to the founding of the empire (2 out of the 4 founders were Catalan mercenaries in Byzantine employ), to the reason why \\"gazi state\\" is a complete misnomer, and finally the pragmatism and flexibility in military organization that led to such brilliant early successes. These and many other essential factors are missing here. I would strongly recommend not wasting resources on this shoddy relic, and instead sampling more recent scholarly works, including ones by the aforementioned authors, and downloading more accurate and better drawn pictures of Ottoman soldiers for free on the web."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it for any aspiring poets","review":"I am currently using this book as a textbook for a poetry class, and I am very satisfied with it.

By carefully disecting several chosen parables, Claypool takes a walk through the mind of Christ and shows His wisdom at work.

The only thing that keeps it from being played on the Smooth Jazz stations it seems is it's occasional beeps and blips generated by cliche analog synths. Everything is right around 100bpm and falls inbetween exciting and downtempo. I imagine these guys are 'nice people to know'.The keyboard parts are particularly boring. You can tell that the song's production is starting with the keyboard recording. Single blocks of ringing accoustic piano chords at the beginning of measures as if the composer is imaging the rest of the parts as he/she is noodling on a piano. Not that great.However, not everything is black & white and this album does have a couple of decent tracks. \\"Ocean Air\\" is nice and catchy though you can see through it in a couple of listens.I usually eject this one after trying over and over to give it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had to have it","review":"After enjoying their \\"gran riserva\\" so much, I had to get this album.

It was the damnest thing! I thought it just came loose and I could get it back on with my allen wrench, but when I retrieved it, I noticed that the plastic mounting nut that secures the fender to the inside of the fork, broke!. Seriously! I tried to repair it using a small metal nut, but it no longer stays firmly attached to the fork.

Some adventures work better than others; at their best, the book is a singular joy to read; at their worst, they can be a bit tedious.

First, one is impressed by the precision of observation and expression. While the symptoms are shared with other patients, this is always the description of a particular victim of the disease. Second, one is impressed by the ever-changing attitude of Daudet to the progression and feared progression of the diease. Third, one is impressed by Daudet himself in his concern for those around him. The result is an enjoyable, informative introduction to Daudet as a person and as an example of human response to continuous pain.Julian Barnes' translation is excellent - footnotes are provided that identify people, places, medicines that are unfamilar. Two short essays on Daudet and syphlis complete the book.While this book may not appear to be high on the to-be-read-list, it deserves a place near the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I bought this product because I had a poor mattress and experienced back problems.

For some reason I expected it to stay flat, even though it is an air mattress. My mistake. Then it would always move around while I was sleeping. I would wake up and the mattress topper and I would be hanging halfway off the bed. It just would not stay under the fitted sheet. After all that trouble, I still experienced many of the back problems I had before.To its credit, this product did help a little bit, but not much.

The rhythm section of Bob Cranshaw (bass), Cedar Walton (piano) and Alan Dawson (drums) does a wonderful job backing \\"West Coast\\" Sonny.Criss particularly stands out due to his blues-laced horn and interesting phrasings, with Cedar Walton standing out amongst the sidemen most on these tracks. On \\"Calidad\\" Walton breaks off into a romping solo sure to get you toe-tapping in no time, and \\"Yesterdays\\" takes a moment to show-off Criss's dexterous abilities and once again showcases some wonderful piano work from Walton. All around this is a great album to own and belongs in jazz collections everywhere.Personnel:Sonny Criss (alto saxophone)Cedar walton (piano)Bob Cranshaw (bass)Alan Dawson (drums)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Respirator","review":"I bought this for my son, who uses it as a prop for photos . . .he is happy with it but he does not use it for its intended purpose so I can't comment on that .. .he chose this one for how it looks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect.","review":"Perfect service.

It would stretch and blur the photos, totally distorting the image. Neither text nor picture messages would send. The delay on ANYTHING you try on the phone is several seconds. The call and end buttons were on the *wrong side* which is just a personal irritation. When you press any button chances are it wouldn't 'take' and it would have to be pressed again pretty hard for the phone to get the command.On the plus side the speaker phone was crystal clear, great bright screen, and again I love the exterior.I played for two weeks and sent the phone back.

I did not realize just how poor the picture quality was until my brother-in-law visited and we compared phones. He has a Samsung VGA1000 picture phone with Sprint PCS. The picture quality difference in these two phones is like night and day. The Samsung phone pictures are much sharper and have better color than the V300.

I finally called T-Mobile yesterday. They were happy to repair/replace the phone for $10 shipping until they told me that it has been out of warranty for 5 days.

Also the phones time is off by over an hour, and cannot be corrected. This Motorola phone, like many other Motorola phones is a piece of junk. Do not buy it. As a matter of fact don't buy any Motor la cell phones. Also T Mobile refuse to do anything to assist me, all they want to do is sell me a new phone, and have me sign a new contract.

V300 looks nice and has numerous features, but the main use of the cell phone should be, well, to talk to others, right? This is virtually impossible with V300 because it drops every single call after 12-13 minutes. If you continue calling back and talking to someone, the call drop time reduces to 10, then nine minutes. It's extremely annoying and I find it impossible to have a business-related conversation (sure, my brother understands that the conversation is going to cut off and I'll call him back when it does, but it doesn't seem very professional to start a conversation with a client with \\"My phone cuts off, so when that happens, please be patient, I'll call you back.

However it is a little bulkier than many other phones on the market. It was the hottest selling phone during the Christmas season last year. People were almost fighting to get it due to the limited quantity but like all Motorola phones it suffers from battery bugs that Motorola hasn't seemed to fix in almost all their phones.

The connector pins Moto uses to charge the phone weakens and causes the phone not to charge (the V60 also had this problem since it is the same connector). Spreading the pins back out on the phone side with a needle repaired it.4. Once the battery is low, the phone beeps til you charge it so you choices are charge it, or turn it off.5.

The camera is so-so, but is fun to have since you can email the pics to people as soon as you take them. The directory is a little confusing as I still don't know if I am saving to the phone, the SIM card, or both, but I don't care about it too much. The voice dialing is nice, and the speaker phone is great.As for T-Mobile, there is much to be desired. Lots of service holes in my area (metro Detroit) and a lot of sudden drop offs.

The phone's OS crashes on me at least once every two weeks or so, and I have to remove the battery to get the phone to reboot.The worst thing, though, is Motorola's insistence on having external volume buttons. I can't bend over, sit at my desk, or get in my car without hearing the tell-tale beeps because I've brushed the buttons. Wouldn't be so bad if they could be disabled, but apparently they can't be. What's terrible is when I turn the volume to vibrate mode, but then brush the external buttons and the phone has been turned to LOUD mode.

Spontaneously resets to silent or vibrate, so you miss tons of calls. Shows calls that you answered as \\"missed\\" after you hang up.

Number of missed calls and number of pending messages indicator is always wrong. Volume spontaneously shuts itself off and you can't hear your caller.

Think twice before you bite on the rebate lure.The phone, with T-Mobile service is okay. Half of the calls will be dropped about 10 minutes in, and the battery life is nowhere near as stated. The phone itself seems to be pretty good, although the keypad layout could be more aesthetically pleasing and the keys a tad larger. To do it all over again, I would have bought the v600 for the bluetooth, but the rebates offered on this one at the time were too good to pass up.

If you are going to switch to T Mobile, buy a cheap phone or get a free phone first to make sure it works in your area.

The camera is great, takes decent quality VGA photos. However, again the only option is to e-mail it, which costs money. You can not download those photos to your laptop/pda.Overall, I recommend this to people who just need a nice cell phone, but don't care for any connectivity to their other devices like laptop or pda.

My first V300 would drop all calls every 20 minutes, on the dime. After replacing the battery to no avail, I had T-Mobile ship me out a free replacement. My replacement now drops calls every 8 to 9 minutes! This would be funny if the darn phone didn't cost me so much. I will be getting my third replacement any day now...but after reading all these reviews, I now realize that a fully functional V300 is, as another reviewer stated, a crap-shoot.

It is forever dropping calls after as little as two to three minutes due to a complete failure to keep a signal locked in even when stationary with a full signal present. Nothing I have found fixes the charging issue and T-Mobile will not replace with a different model free of charge to spite several inquiries. At least it only cost me $150 new!

I called T-Mobile and they apparently know about this problem, but still sell the phone. Judging by the rest of the reviews, this has been a problem for a lot of people.The other major problem with this phone is that sometimes it doesn't feel like charging. I would have plugged it in and it would say that it was \\"unable to charge\\".

This phone is not made by Motorola per se but by their Asian partner, maybe that explains the \\"girlish\\" styling, but it's still pretty cool. Of course, the light weight and good battery life make it a stand-out.My favorite phone is still the Sanyo VM-4500 video camera walkie-talkie speakerphone cell phone for Sprint PCS..."},{"rating":"1","title":"dropped calls galore","review":"for $300 this phone should SHINE!! let alone it has a camera, voice recording capability, you can see a cute lil picture of the person that is calling...

Extremely disappointed with this purchase.My advice would be to buy a standard USB->5 pin mini-USB cable anywhere for $5-$10 and use freely-available drivers and software for wallpaper/ringtones/volume gain/skins/pictures uploading/downloading instead.It only gets one star because there's not a selection for \\"zero\\".

I can't believe it- they finally sent the part for the lotion dispenser, they sent the whole pump unit with the straw thing. But I had told them that I only needed the straw part. The worst part is when shipping it they put it in a box and bent the pipe part in half damaging it beyond repair! I tried to contact them and again no response.

This book however lacked all the elements that made the first on so good. Missing was the in depth psychological profiling, the search for the villian and the anticipation of the climax. This book also did not develop the characters from the first book any further and I did not remember the character of John being as stupid in the first book as he was made out to be in this one. If your looking for a fairly interesting tale with some good description of turn of the century New York this would be a good read. If you loved the first book and are looking a good sequel then pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I read and loved the Alienist and hoped for more of the same in Angel of Darkness. Angel did not come close to measuring up and I was very disappointed. I did not like Stevie as the narrator and would have preferred the character Moore's adult perspective instead. Stevie's use of \\"what\\" instead of \\"that\\" nearly drove me crazy. Also, Moore, a character I liked in the Alienist, was turned into a foolish, ignorant character who was almost entirely useless except for Carr's use of him to belabor a plot line. Also the character of El Nino was ridiculous and seemed to be nothing more than an embarrassing stereotype. He had the dimensionality of a cartoon character. So I was very disappointed in Angel and would not strongly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same procedure as last year?","review":"I was very pleased to rediscover my heroes from \\"The Alienist\\" in another novel, this time told from the perspective of young Taggart.While the book itself is flawless and offers the same fascinating profiling work we do know from \\"The Alienist\\", it's still not the same... I just wasnt able to get as impressed as I got with Carr's first novel...Its solid work, and I enjoyed the book, but \\"The Alienist\\" was so brilliant I guess its just too difficult to write on the same level all the time, even if you are a very talented author like Caleb Carr."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Kitchen Sink Effect\\"","review":"Sometimes there can be too much of a good thing, as the reader will soon learn when reading this book. Too many characters to keep track of, giving his lead characters too little to do, and burying the reader with one deus ex machina after another were just some of the frustrations with this follow up to a much more suspenseful and clever book,The Alienist. Carr seems to suffer from the disease that many Stephen King books have, a lack of judicious editing.

I normally would not even stay with a book that slow, but knowing Carr's previous work, I assumed there HAD to be something better coming.

To the comments about Stevie's \\"what/that\\" confusion, I would add his constant use of \\"what you might call\\" every time he used an unlikely term. The character of El Nino was poorly developed, and the characters from the first book were largely drained of complexity (Moore whines, dines, and gambles; Sara draws her derringer or kicks someone in the shins every two seconds; the Isaacsons bicker; Montrose plays the piano; and the Doctor noises). The book's saving graces were the setting, the scenes involving Darrow, Clara's character, and the relationship between Stevie and Kat. I'll certainly look out for Carr's future efforts, but this was a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book on it's own.","review":"I enjoyed the book on it's own merit. Not having read \\"The Alienist\\" first, as many people have, I found this work interesting and fun to read.

Perhaps the ending wasn't the greatest but the story and setting was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A kick-butt book!","review":"This was an awesome book! I loved it! Mr. Carr grabbed my attention and kept it by the throat the first page. He is a very talented author. I also enjoyed The Alienist immensely! Keep up the good work Mr. Carr! I just wonder if maybe a next book will be told from Sarah or Dr. Kriezler's point of view. Maybe even Cyrus'. =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"TYPO TYPOS & MORE TYPOS","review":"Plot and story line very good however; this book was so full of typos and misspelled words that for me it was aggrevating to read due to the pages and pages of mistakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Angel of Darkness( Dr. Lazlo Kreizler)","review":"Like the Alienist, I couldn't put it down. Well woven mystery,full of intrigue ,with many unexpected twists and turns.I loved his characters. I wish Caleb Carr wrote another one featuring Dr. Kreizler and associates. I'd buy it in an instant."},{"rating":"2","title":"carr does it again but in a different style","review":"reading the reviews that were made before me i realized how passionate people get about books. thats what makes literature so involving. i felt captivated by this book and found myself flowing through the book quickly, considering the length (600+ pages). i thought this book would be written in the same style as the previous novel, the alienist, angel of darkness caught me off guard with it's slower courtroom drama. the plot takes longer to develop than the alienist but don't let that deter you from picking this book up, because once it starts, it really get's moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.","review":"The Alienist was a terrific story - I bought several copies as gifts for friends. But the Angel of Darkness was annoying; too many extraneous characters just in the story to prove the author did his research. The major problem I had is that the \\"gang\\" was hired to find a kidnapped baby. Well, they get totally sidetracked, and go chasing all over the place, forgetting the thing they were supposed to do! Who cares if they leave this kid in dire peril, they've got to do research to get the kidnapper on bigger charges! Totally implausable ending, and generally way too many unnecessary details. Doesn't this guy have an editor??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite engrossing but not as good as \\"The Alienist\\"","review":"I really enjoyed the Old New York feel of Mr. Caleb's writing. Again, the psychological pursuit of the suspect is engaging. I left it, however, not quite as satisfied as with \\"The Alienist\\", perhaps because the previous book was very fresh and this one, while still quite good, did not grow on the theme and/or process, but rather, was a continuation thereof. In short, very good but maybe a bit formulated."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Sequel - long but worth it!","review":"After reading The Alienist, I didn't think the sequel could be as good, and it is not - it's better. The characters are developed and the reader never feels like it's all figured out. I enjoyed the book tremendously, and I'm not particular a mystery/thriller fan. Well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light the fire, feed the cats & prepare to submerge.","review":"Gloomy winter weekends are perfect for Caleb Carrs \\"Angel of Darkness\\". Much to the relief of my fiance, I've just finished this eerie character sketch of maternal instinct gone mad. Poor man was neglected until I finished it. Caleb Carr's editors could stand to watch out for repetitive passages & those cutesy end of chapter cliff hangers. Those points aside, Libby Hatch is one of the most realistic villianesses I've read. Beware, do not pick up this book if you've got an agenda. All in all a tasty bit...Write faster Caleb... we're waiting for more!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be ZERO stars","review":"Do NOT waste your time reading this insipid, tedious and ultimately boring follow up to the superior \\"The Alienist\\". If it wasn't the middle of summer, I would have used the book (all 750 pages of it) as kindling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near as good as 'The Alienist'","review":"After loving 'The Alienist,' I was very disappointed in 'The Angel of Darkness.' It was completely implausible, especially the 'Angel' being on good terms with a street gang. And the midget was just too much. A big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who kidnapped Caleb Carr?","review":"The Angel of Darkness reads almost like a parody of The Alienist. The first book made you feel like you were breathing in the stink of the Bowery, the sweat of The Tenderloin district. Roosevelt himself was quite believable, as was the whole description of New York, its people and places. With T.A.O.D., I felt like I had returned to the modern era, and was reading a goofy send-off of the first book. The capper is that last scene, with Roosevelt and the Navy Police storming through New York beating up the gangsters. Go Teddy! Rah Kreizler! Please, save the forced-upon climax for the movie-goers, but don't insult us readers with such treacle.Bah! The reason I haven't rated this a one is because it works as a fourth leg for my beat-up sofa rather well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Your Editor","review":"I purchased this for my Kindle. I'm over half done and am bumfuddled as to how this got out of editing. Virtually every page has transposed letters, words run together, misspellings, wrong pronouns. I don't know if the Kindle version of a book receives less scrutiny but I can honestly say I've never read any book, paper or electronic, with more errors per square inch. I would give the story a 'B' but the editing is an 'F-'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging 1st page to last","review":"I read Angel of Darkness before I read The Alienist. I have to say that Angel was the better of the two. The characters were richly drawn, sympathetic and realistic. The setting was colorful and really left you feeling like you had really been there. I loved this book and can't wait for the next one. I could read about these characters forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A long, engrossing novel.","review":"If you enjoy Mr. Carr's work, you'll enjoy this book. If you enjoy only \\"serial killer\\" novels, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! So many people who said they loved The Alienist do not enjoy this book. I enjoy reading about these characters along with Mr. Carr's descriptions of late 19th century New York. This isn't a history lesson however, so those of you out there picking on these books for the use of historical characters in fictional situations really need to calm down. Bravo, Mr. Carr, keep em' coming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Caleb Carr is a master of description","review":"I preferred the Alienest to Angel of Darkness, but I still loved the book. Caleb Carr is a master of description. The way he describes 1800's New York is wonderful! When I read the Alienest I thought the book had to have been written a century ago because nobody so young could have written so detailed an account. Angel of Darkness, even though it is a sequal to the Alienest, was written from another character's point of view. Carr succeeds using Stevie as the narrator. Both Carr books are must-reads for any mystery or historical novel lovers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was fantastic, thrilling and hard to put down.","review":"I was totally enthralled with \\"The Alienst\\" this book was on the same high standards. Totally recommend it if you like a chilling, mystery murder book. Thanks Caleb love your books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be a lot better, but a nice read","review":"I wish the author had spent even more time on the day-to-day life of turn-of-the-century New York. His insertion of a few historical characters (Teddy Roosevelt & others)adds artificiality to the plot, which could stand on its own just fine without them. Also, the book could be a couple hundred pages shorter .... I'd rather he had used the space to flesh out the atmosphere more, rather than puffing up all the dialogue. I lost interest partway through, but finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overshot","review":"Carr had 1000 pages in him--700 for the Alienist (one of the most entertaining books I've read) and 300 for this one. I gave up when Darrow entered the scene. First, the narrator didn't work in the the way what the author wanted it to work in. Simply lacked credibility. Second, if I want to read a courtroom thriller trash, with bad Clarence Darrow garbage, I'd read Big Trouble, third, this book had that same feeling as a Murder She Wrote episode in its last season: run out of plot, simply take the show on the road.Fourth, it took on a Star Trek feel, where we could tell by page 50 who the red shirts were, doomed to die before the episode ended. God, this was plain awful, and it was made worse by the fact what the expectations from the Alienest were so high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and long, not a good combination","review":"The book really was a diappointment. It was way too long (where was the editor?) going into endless detail that just flattened the narrative. So many of the introduced characters, mostly the villains were without depth (but also El Nino, a \\"good guy\\"-was stereotyped bordering on racist)which really put a damper on things. The narrative was also predictable, you just knew who was doomed, and who was not. Really not worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Books in One","review":"I really enjoyed most of book... but it had an awkward pace.. Parts of it like the visit to Libby Hatches mothers house had me on edge. Other parts, like over descriptive dinner scenes were annoying. The end was disappointing. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't read it.. but a space ship could have landed to save the day out of nowhere and had the same effect. I wish the ending had stayed with the story. The characters were great and saved the book, especially El Nino."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long, but well worth the effort!","review":"I very rarely would give a book 5 stars, but I think this one deserves them. In a world full of trash, this book is extremely well written. Each character was well developed and seemed real. I found myself wondering if this wasn't a true story. It took me almost three weeks to finish, and I usually devour books quickly. It was even excruciating at times because it was so long, but stick it out and you won't be disappointed. It's a thriller that reads like a classic. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exellent Adventure","review":"Like The Alienist, an excellent adventure into another time. Tightly written drama, plays out in your mind so that late at night you almost wake up in another time when you fall asleep with this book in your hands. I can't wait to read the next in this series, and between Caleb Carr in New York and Mark Graham's Philadelphia historical mysteries, I can spend more time in the past in print than I'd ever want to in real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough act to follow","review":"The Alienist is a tough act to follow, but the Angel of Darkness is a worthy effort. Carr continues to develop fascinating forensic scenarios in an age prior to technology. Carr captures the complexity and creativity of a Doylian novel. I recommend this book to Sherlockians."},{"rating":"2","title":"great until the end","review":"Having read The Alienist (a must if you want to read this book), I was excited to see where the characters were. The book was great and I was completely into the story of Libby Hatch, a sadistic woman who is kidnapping and killing children. Carr only lost me with the ending. The perfect example of a deus ex machina, I was rather dissapointed. To have followed the book all the way through only to be presented with a substandard ending was a let down. But I would still recommend this book because the concepts it presents are still very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted: a good editor","review":"This book is a classic case of a guy with a first good novel, given virtually free reign to write his second book. Extremely slow paced (one chapter goes on for several pages, and simply describes the main character going to get the doctor in a carriage). Or maybe the author was paid by the word. Worth a look at because the Alienist was so good, but be prepared to be bored during large stretches of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Horrible Horrible","review":"Boring ,boring, boring- Trite characters. No sense of the time period. The players had very 2000 thoughts and the story line must have bee picked up from several soap acts that recently closed."},{"rating":"1","title":"All I need to say is...","review":"Caleb Carr, what were you thinking? Was it even you who wrote this book? And you need to fire your editor, Mr. Carr, because she did \\"what you would call\\" a disservice to you and your readers. I never rolled my eyes so much..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Over rated Author of the Year","review":"This is a real case of the emperor's new clothes. Caleb Carr got a good reputation for \\"The Alienist,\\" even though it was tedious and derivative and anachronistic. \\"Angel\\" is even worse-- so much so that, only 200 pages into its monumental 700+ page bulk, I got tired of waiting for the plot to start and dropped it. People who like these books probably haven't read this sort of thing done well: Jack Finney's \\"Time and Again\\" (NOT the sequel, \\"From Time to Time\\") comes to mind, as do several of Peter Lovesy's Sgt. Cribb mysteries. But Carr is a dull and pretentious author, and I say he's naked and to hell with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy sequel to 'The Alienist'","review":"To tell you the truth,I find this book better then the first one. The story continues with the same charecters but a different host, this time a street smart Stevie and it looks more approcheble. The cast is great as before and story more fast moving.But it is the chemistry between Stieve and Kate which provides the life of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"I loved the history and creative characters. The second novel is even better than the first and I hope there will be a third!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A charming sequel","review":"Certainly the change in point of view from Moore to Taggart might be jarring at first, but the technique works in the end. I can see why many readers found this a lacking sequel after reading The Alienist, but I read it as a departure, something experimental and simply different from its predecessor. If you're looking for a book whose author takes an identical approach to each book (even though they feature the same characters), try Sue Grafton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very hard to get into","review":"The awesome reviews of this book are a lot of hype. I couldn't even finish it. Does not compare to the ALIENIST at all. Totally BORING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment after the achievement of The Alienist.","review":"After Carr's first novel, I hoped for great things from him. However, The Angel of Darkness was a real disappointment. There was not the same evocation of place (turn-of-the-century New York) that helped to make The Alienist so fascinating. Details from the time merely seemd to be leftover facts from the first novel. The narrator was unconvincing and inconsistant--Stevie moved from poor grammar to sophisticated language and I found that extremely grating. The plot was slow moving and the characters were basically the same ones we met in his first novel. I hope Carr is done with this group of characters and moves on to new ground for his next novel; he can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I was very much looking forward to reading Carr, having heard good things about him. But if this is the best he can do, I suggest you look elsewhere. I know I will.Carr's writing is terrible--he badly needs an editor willing to sacrifice at least half of his overblown prose. And from a historic perspective, The Angel of Darkness is a mess. His characters' actions and speech are totally unconvincing; in fact, Carr's only concession to period speech seems to be having the narrator substitute \\"what\\" for \\"that,\\" as in \\"the book WHAT I hated.\\" The first time he used it was annoying; by the four hundredth, I shut the book, permanently.If you're a fan of the genre but prefer your books written and researched somewhat intelligently, try Charles Palliser, or Arturo Perez Reverte."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sequel and a winner - a rare combination","review":"After the exquiste ALIENIST I was prepared for a letdown with this latest novel. We are again back in turn of the century New York City and the description is just as real as before. Only this time the cast of characters has been augmented by a servant boy who becomes the narrator. This gives the story a whole new twist.This time we are chasing a female criminal, an evil woman, and an apparent rarity in those days where women were viewed as the gentler sex. She is a cunning criminal with a first-rate mind that is always calculating the next move. Again we have the intelligent and beautiful Ms. Howard going where no woman has gone before. She is a modern woman for her times but never for effect.SOme reviewers have criticized the inclusion of \\"famous\\" people but this was accomplished with a subtle touch and therefore is perfectly acceptable. Again, one is mesmerized at the writing and description as much as the witty dialogue and swift action.Bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and a waste of paper.","review":"A sad attempt at a sequel to The Alienist. Slow and clunky to read. Stared slow and got worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful.","review":"The reviews what criticize this book are dead on. The grammar what Carr uses is distracting from a story what was already suffering from a sorry lack of editing. 750 pages what I wish I hadn't wasted my time on. If you want to get a good book, get The Alienist, what was a far superior book. ."},{"rating":"1","title":"How the heck can people consider this book *good?*","review":"This was the most tiresome, droll, straight-out boring novel that I have ever tried to read...I had to stop reading partway through simply because I was bored to tears. And not only did the plot seem to develop at a snail's pace, but the grammar (yes I know it was told from a street urchin's point of view and that's how he would probably talk) and sheer verbose-ness of the text were horrible as well. I found myself having to read the same page/paragraph two/three times before I could even figure out what Carr was trying to get across!Don't waste your money on this one. Pathetic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good mystery and philosophy in one!","review":"This book was very good on several levels: The mystery itself is intriguing and sometimes edge-of-your-seat suspenseful. Especially as a New Yorker, I LOVE the description of New York City at the turn of the (previous) century. The littlest details add up to be very evocotavive. I also enjoyed the forensic and social history items. But most important was the psychological aspect. Without giving the plot away, it raises issues and can help people think about a current and very disturbing. criminal case.I'd read The Alienist so long ago that I barely remember it, but think this probably isn't quite as good. That's why it got a 4 rather than a 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"As impressive as \\"The Alienist\\" was, this one is that bad.

Mr. Carr is an expert at weaving fictional and historical characters in a psychological nightmare with murder and mayham to spare. It is a long read, but I hated to see it come to an end. \\"The Alienist\\" is on my nightstand now."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Angle of Disappointment","review":"Two of my generous four rating points for this book are dedicated to \\"The Alienist\\" which I thoroughly enjoyed. One point goes to the \\"feel\\" of a century ago. And one point goes to the fact that so much current fiction is worse than this book. That said, \\"The Angel of Darkness,\\" although it had its rare compelling moments, was a superficial, stereotypical, artificial, name-dropping embarrassment. \\"Hey, there's Diamond Jim Brady! Ain't he fat? Did you see all the food 'what' he ate?\\" It's a good thing Mark Twain isn't alive. Carr's premise for his novels works. Too bad he can't write for the reader, rather than the buck. Perhaps there should be \\"term limits\\" for professional reviewers too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like beer, if 1 is good, 2 are great unless you're an alkie","review":"The Alienist it isn't. The Angel of Darkness seemingly picks up where The Alienist left off but for as far as I've read (page 50), there isn't the slightest similarity between the prose of the two books. If you're still not dissuaded, keep in mind that the voice of this book is \\"Stevie;\\" the streetwise juvenile delinquent. Proceed with caution or at most, check it out of the library. I hate being taken to the cleaners on hard cover books, don't you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good story but......","review":"The Angel of Darkness is a good story but the author should have stopped with The Alienist. Carr's new book is more of the same, and as a matter of fact to much more of the same. Perhaps those who have not read The Alienist will find this book more entertaining, but even a first time reader of Carr will find this book a bit tedious to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting new CD!","review":"I saw this band live in San Francisco last week. Their high energy in performance is matched on this CD. Great instrumentalists, wonderful solos, terrific vocal blend by two very strong singers. Their material is interesting and fresh.

I was horrified at the repetitive and intrusive music, the miscasting of the son as Jessica Lange's son, the confusing plot, and the way-overacting of all the actors.It was a bad experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring !!!","review":"I love Sam Shepard. But I hated this film. It really had a lot of potential, and the story was basically good, but the way the movie was put together was terrible. I kept waiting for something memorable to happen, but it just never did. This movie was sort of like watching the pilot of a new TV series -- you know, where the viewer is just getting some background information about what's going on, and where the characters don't seem quite comfortable with one another yet. The film tried to be artsy but fell way short. The mention of Sundance and Cannes on the box caught my interest, but I should have remembered that those highbrow endorsements mean absolutely nothing to the average filmgoer like me, who is just looking for entertainment. This movie was not entertaining in the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"over the top and silly","review":"Brad Thor has a penchant for writing big action stories and this is no exception, but the plot is so outrageous and unbelievable that it's difficult to take this novel seriously. The whole kidnapping of the president and government conspiracy behind it was not remotely realistic. His main character, Scott Harvath, is interesting, but the situations that he gets involved with lend no credibility to the character. I spent the entire book saying to myself, you have got to be kidding. I find myself wanting to like Brad Thor as a writer, but his novels don't deliver and this is no exception.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Was Hoping For","review":"Any comparisons to Vince Flynn or Robert Ludlum are WAY off base. The dialog was brutal, at times cringe-inducing, the storytelling weak. The main character (Harvath) is not compelling at all, the rest of the characters are one dimensional. Perhaps Thor gets better in later books, but I'll take Mitch Rapp any day of the week over Harvath. Was a chore to complete...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Basic Plot, Terrible Everything Else","review":"The basic plot of this book should have been really interesting. Unfortunatly the author took a good idea and ruined it. The dialog of this book is some of the worst I've ever read. No character development other than the main character and he's not a believable character. After reading some of the other reviews, I have to agree with the guy that said the author was already thinking \\"Action Movie\\" in his head - one liners abound in this book. I am a fan of Clancy, Ludlum, etc and was hoping this would be a new series I could read, but no way."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lions of Lucerne","review":"This book came as highly recommended reading, but I was disappointed. Some parts were great reading, but others many loose ends. Scot Harvath is describe as a SEAL, experience Secret Service man, I don't understand how someone like that can make so many elementary mistakes in his pursit in staying under the radar and covering his tracks. Wouldn't he know there would be security cameras in the Ritz? Boring!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ex-Navy Seal","review":"THE LIONS OF LUCERNE By Brad ThorThe Ex-Navy SealYou'd have a hard time beating the start of this one. The president is kidnapped on a ski slop in Utah and a whole team of Secret Services men are killed while Scot Harvath is busy saving the president's daughter.Scot finds himself breaking a several rules before he makes any headway finding out where the president is being held. The people holding the president are formable foes and have their own sect. Scott takes off for Switzerland where he has some information that the president may be held.It looks like a collation in his own backyard is responsible for the kidnapping, and now Scott is charged with murder. The story builds up to bloody climax in Switzerland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Increasingly Unbelievable","review":"The book started off really well, decently detailed, very possible dialogue and a good plot. This goes on till about half the book, even the parts about Scot Harvath trampling on the crime scenes, having 'superhuman' strength so as to overcome his numerous injuries is acceptable. But when he escapes each and every assassination attempt, walks into pre-meditated gunfights poorly armed, lack of detailing as to his preparation which I would have expected to be a must as it's in the genre of factual based thrillers, all this just made it mediocre. If you want to read about a one-man-army but with a more plausible storyline, better detailed plot along the same concept of danger to the US president, read Transfer of Power by Vince Flynn."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do better, Brad","review":"Go a little lighter on the attributive adjectives! Many of the nouns he describes are generic but overall, good story teller. I'll check the next book out to he if he's improving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother With This One!","review":"When I started reading The Lions Of Lucerne, the first of Brad Thor's series featuring Secret Service Agent, Scot Horvath, I thought I was in for a real exciting reading experience. However, shortly thereafter my high expectations rapidly deteriorated. Reading this book became the equivalent of reading an action comic book, with the hero being a combination of an indestructible superman and a one-man army. Horvath's main character (and secondary characters) lost all credibilty for me to the point that I'm not sure if I want to read any of Thor's other books in this series (even though I own these books). Beyond Thor's weakness in character development, his dialogue is often cliched and, perhaps most annoying, is that the plot moves at too slow a pace throughout much of the book and is very predictible. Do yourself a favor and don't bother reading The Lions Of Lucerne."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll pass","review":"Some books just don't hook a reader.

I am an avid mystery reader and I found this book horribly dissapointing. The characters are shallow at best, the plot completely predictable and the details as credible as the the authors name. I should have known better....my bad"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Predictable","review":"This book was so stupid and predictabe, please people do not waste your time reading this piece of garbage. Thor should not even be a writer. What you guys should do instead of wasting your time on this book is put on a good Bond film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and fast moving","review":"Thor hooked from the very fist page in this very first novel of his.It takes some nerve to try to kidnap the President of the U.S. Horvath, is a great character, that Thor created in the likes of Dirk Pitt and Jack Ryan. He stands out as his own man.I think he twisted and turned the plot just right without being too much over the top.If you get hooked you've got several good stories with Scot Horvath ahead of you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"Let me preface this review by what I expect from political and espionage stories. I want the author to conduct thorough research that supports the plot and make the plot plausible. Forsyth, Silva, DeMille, Clancy, Morell - they do a phenomenal job of that.This author doesn't. This book was so far away from believable, I rolled my eyes countless times. The president's entire detail is killed in a man-made avalanche and the terrorists kidnap the president. Right. Sure. That could happen. But one man survived, the main character. And for the rest of the book, he is the luckiest son of a bitch alive.The book is just silly. I don't want to rant anymore, but I'm \\"one-and-done\\" with Thor. He has a cool last name, but that's where it ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassed for myself, Brad Thor, and Nelson DeMille.","review":"Sophomoric writing in general, banal dialogue that seems to go on forever, plot contrivances bordering on the ridiculous and plot holes you could drive a Hum-Vee through, and a lead character, and by association an author, so bigoted and misogynistic that he should only be found at a Trent Lott for President rally, not as the hero of a novel. The authors comments about women and Middle Easterners, disguised as dialogue, are repulsive in the extreme. It is my hope that Mr. Thor will not write another book, but if this tripe has already gone into a paperback printing, he's probably sitting at his word processor right now. Hope it crashes."},{"rating":"1","title":"more cliches than a hallmark store.","review":"seriously...I could just feel this guy dreaming of the movie rights as he was writing this book. There were such great quotes as \\"not on my watch\\" and \\"we don't negotiate with terrorists\\" that you could just imagine Steven Segal reading for the part. Also, it was just plan racist. I get making Muslims the main target in today's spy novels. The Russians had their turn as did the Nazis but now it is just the entire population of the Middle East. Or so you would think from this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive Disappointment","review":"Brad Thor AIN'T no Vince Flynn. Having been recommended by a good, usually reliable friend, we ordered not one, but twoaudio books by Thor to see us through the 950 mile trip to the Florida Keys in December. We listened to the opening (andinterminable) kipnap fiasco on a mountain at a sky resort and couldn't take it any longer. I'm convinced Thor has no talentand writes totally mundane, unnecessary, useless and, vis-a-vis the Secret Service, unture dialogue just to fill up the pages.We returned the second audio book to Amazon and threw \\"The Lions of Lucerne\\" and our money in a trash bin at a reststop on the Florida Turnpike. At the time we bought the Thor tapes we bought a Sherlock Holmes mystery tape vocallydramatized by Sir John Gielgud and Sir Ralph Richardson. It was fabulous proving once again that there are few writers in the last 40 plus years who can come even close to measuring up to the masters of the past. If I could have given it NO stars, I would have.I"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO GOOD","review":"Read the book and did not like it at all, I bought this book because of the review and unable to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lions of Lucerne","review":"Great story if you're a fan of Mighty Mouse. Nothing of value that I could find, and I'll stick to Vince Flynn."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was my 2nd try, but","review":"again, I got the same feeling and conclusion as when I read the 1st one:Boring writing style, boring prose, boring scenarios, too right-wing crappy. failed to get connected no matter how hard I tried to read along, the reading was just like chewing a piece of cardboard with lot of ink on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A satisfactory action book","review":"Lions is a book about a courageouse agent, rescuing kidnapped US president. This premise is not very realistic, as is the novel itself. But it's a fun James Bond - like yarn.Everything is large scale, bigger than life, etc. Nevertheless, the charactes are likeable, the scenery is nice and the action swift. This is no Forsythe or Le Carre, and it's less intricate than Ludlum, and has no geopolitics, so Clancy comparison is strange. Lions should be compared to Bond or Jon Lands' Blaine McKracken - and Scott Harthath is on the level with those guys.Bottom line: Basically, this book is a Hollywood action blockbuster on paper - not very intelligent, but swift and pretty.And, let's face it, we still like such movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Language/sexuality disappointing","review":"Read and really enjoyed \\"The Last Patriot\\" so wanted to get some previous novels by this very fine author. Downloaded the kindle version of Lions of Lucerne and found language and sexual scenes almost immediately that put me off and discouraged me from continuing further. Disappointing as he had not needed those elements for his very entertaining, more recent book. Wish I could have a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"First-Rate Action Scenes, but Little Else","review":"THE LIONS OF LUCERNE is Brad Thor's debut novel written in 2002. Since writing this book, Thor has become a very successful author, with his most recent effort hitting #1 on the New York Times Bestseller list.Other than some very well written action scenes, this book has little to recommend it. The characterization is two-dimensional, the dialogue trite, and the hero Scot Horvath almost too bland for words. The political conspiracy plot is outlandish, and is structured in a manner that contains few surprises. I found the whole storyline to be almost painfully predictable, right down to the final showdown at the villain's mountain hideaway.THE LIONS OF LUCERNE is written well enough for a debut, but the plot and characterization problems made it a pretty mediocre reading experience. If you want to read a first rate action novel, my advice is to go with Lee Child instead, who is a far superior writer and plotter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"The Lions of Lucerne is a fast paced, exciting read. I don't want to give too much of the plot away and others have already described in detail what the book is about. I'll just say that it was very enjoyable!I usually read horror/fantasy books so this was a bit of a departure for me but my husband said it was excellent. He was right!
