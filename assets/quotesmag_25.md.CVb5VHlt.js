More country influences than usual on David Olney's albums. The first 2 songs are my favorites, 1917 about the 'relationship' between a prostitute and her 'customer'. And the second about John Dillinger, who in this song is not much of a hero, but a heartless criminal. Both are examples of the superb story-telling talent of David Olney. And by the way, this album also contains a cover of one of the greatest Townes van Zandt-songs, Snowin' on raton."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT BUT TOO SHORT","review":"This video would be rated five stars had the workout been longer than 25 minutes.

You will simply want to add some more excercises afterwards. The modern industrial generic music is refreshing in a way but I prefer more upbeat music.

Like another mom who wrote a review, I can be sure to finish this tape *BEFORE* the baby wakes up, so it's much more satisfying. Plus, since I homeschool my other kids, I don't have a lot of free time during the day. The tape is also great on those *many* days when one of the three kids is sick, and I can't go to the gym.

Petra Kolber is my favorite aerobics instructor because she embellishes basic aerobics moves with jazzy and funky flavor.

Keep up the excellent work Petra!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Made for our structured media panel","review":"We bought the Leviton surge-protected double power module to use in a 28-inch Leviton Structured Media panel. We did our own low-voltage wiring but the power module was installed by the electrician and looks great. It will leave more room in the box for the modem, router, switch, cable splitter and amplifier, phone bridge panel, ect. Our house is still under construction so haven't had any opportunity to test it but expect it to work fine. That's why we bought the Leviton brand made for this box. I just hope we can use all the plugs since those devices seem to have the big clunky plugs. Leviton should make a unit with 4 or 6 single surge-protected plugs spaced further apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parents Must Be Involved!","review":"Excellent book. The best part of the book is her emphasis on parental involvement and \\"monkey see, monkey do\\". For instance, adults don't realize it but they often engage in \\"bad-mouthing\\" others (even others' children!) in front of their own children. Of course children hear this and believe another child or adult is \\"bad\\", but worse yet, begin to bad-mouth others as a way to act \\"more adult\\" and gain power in situations with their peers. It's a problem we as society have in general and the book brings up these and other rarely-thought-of topics. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hasbro keeps the collectors happy!","review":"You can say this for Hasbro: they sure know how to keep collectors happy. So what if they keep repackaging/repainting older Batman/Robin/Nightwing/Batgirl figures; the payoff is the exclusive figures you will never get anywhere else. Past box sets have included: Alfred, Commissioner Gordon, Batgirl (in her correctly colored costume), R'as Al Ghul, Talia, etc, and now the Ventriloquist and Scarface! Just the fact that they made these figures speaks volumes about how far Hasbro is willing to go to please collectors. The shame is that they have lost the Batman/Superman license as of December 31st, and Mattel will now own these rights. Let's see how far Mattel is willing to go in producing lesser known figures, and/or Batman's rogue gallery. And paint schemes or older versus newer is just nit-picking. Be happy you got the figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Awesome Awesome!","review":"This could be the best looking of the \\"exclusive 4-packs\\".

That may not seem too out of the ordinary, but this book, simply and aptly titled FLOWERS, is a very special experience. Self was given a two-year fellowship at Kews where she spent her time observing gardens and painting flowers. These paintings are over-large (6 foot by 6 foot) blossoms that are celebratory and investigatory at the same time. The sheer magnificence of some of her selected blooms are overpowering yet very beautiful. Her observations and renderings of flowers on the wane are some of the more memorable works in this volume.Accompanying this portfolio (of very fine color reproductions) are essays by author Will Self, art critic Sarah Kent and garden expert Elspeth Thompson, each of which adds a new dimension to the appreciation of nature from varied stances.

This is because 2-3 diagrams take up one page and the second page is blank. The diagrams were not very effective at conveying the underlying priciple and most diagrams were a mediocre example of the application of the principle.There is little information in this text on how to identify and develop the inherent contradiction that one is trying to solve. However, the contradiction matrix at the end is relatively easy to read when determining which priciples to apply to a problem.I had hoped to buy a single book on TRIZ to get a better understanding of the theory and its application.

I bought it for the Kindle and enjoyed it. It read somewhat like a narration but that did not bother me. Good suspense, action, ingenious plot. I'm glad I got it for my Kindle. Now I will have to see the movie which I have never seen. I don't expect the movie to be as good and detailed as the book, it hardly ever is.

Given that the novel was written in the 1970s by a 20-something first-time novelist, it was okay.For the author it must have been quite exciting. His first book made into a major movie with top stars.I'm sure James Grady has learned enough since then not to rely so heavily on coincidence as a plot device.Also it is very annoying to jump from POV to POV on the same page.The one thing in the book that was better than the movie was the explanation for the initial \\"hit.\\" I found the book's explanation far more plausible than the movie's.The book was worth reading, but only barely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safety first: Exactly what new parents need","review":"All first-time parents should get a copy of Geraldine Hickey's DVD, \\"Saving Baby's Life,\\" which delivers exactly what it promises: simple, concise, accurate, and effective instruction to help you respond to a choking, respiratory, or cardiac emergency experienced by your infant or newborn. There are differences between adult and infant CPR, but Hickey doesn't bog the DVD down with comparisons. She focuses her comments squarely on the infant's care.

It's a source of animated gifs for web designers (I have the running cat image that's been going around.)For people who want to understand animals in general, this is a good reference. I never thought that all the ways an animal can go from point A to point B each had a name to it and that a quadruped can have so many ways to move.Its an interesting historical piece, too. People do not see horses doing useful work any more and it's a reminder that we all had a life before internal combustion.

From today's modern technology perspective it has limited value simply because there is SO much out there in the world wide web to show an artist the human form in motion.However, from a historical viewpoint it changed the way artists painted animals in motion, most notably, the horse! In spite of today's equipment being used easily by the average consumer to slow and stop motion, the results discovered and published in this book were the result of ingenious deduction and long, hard work to dispell previously held conceptions! For that reason it deserves a place on the shelf of every artist's book shelf!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book","review":"I am a daycare teacher and I love using this book with my class.

It is an invaluable book for any Bach lover. Pelikan connects Bach musical interpretation of texts with the work of a theologian. His main thesis is that Bach was just as important of a theologian as he was a musician. Interesting reading. This is a 'must have' book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bach Insights by Great Theologian","review":"Jaroslav Pelikan was one of the most prominent theologians and historians of early Christianity until his recent death in 2006. His insights into the theological currents of J.S.Bach's era are deep and tied closely to the texts in the church cantatas, passions and B Minor Mass. As a Lutheran (at least until his late conversion to the Eastern Orthodox church) and historian of the Reformation his view of these issues is invaluable. His knowledge of Bach's music is comprehensive and this book benefits from this unique combination. His explanation of Bach's Pietist sympathies, or lack thereof, is of particular interest. This book should be read by anyone who loves the music of Bach."},{"rating":"2","title":"new thrill for Bach lovers","review":"This book reaps a marvelous harvest from a sparklingly original idea. Pelikan goes to the root source of Bach's genius, his faith. What results is a crop of new ideas not only of the grandeur of Bach's music and the interior impetus of creative genius itself, but as well a rich exploration of the authentic reaches of theology. The great Capellmeister lives anew in these pages in a way I've not encountered since Evening in the Palace of Reason. Pelikan's chapter on themes and variations in the Passions, and his meditation on human redemption in the St Matthew Passion, are together worth twice the price listed here. I've studied and played Bach all my life. Bach Among the Theologians has given an arresting freshness to a nearly sixty year passion!

The brass fitting on the end was too wide to push down the fuel tube though. I knew if I forced it I would not be able to pull it back out because the brass nozzle pulls out of the hose quite easily. I took off the brass fitting and the hose fits but so would a garden hose.

My most practical fueling option is the dual 5 gallon fuel can drag to the dock. Holding a 5 gallon can while fueling the boat is potentially messy and a work out. My modified Sierra Tools pump (original hose was much too short) went out after several years and I was looking for an alternative that was not battery operated (household batteries and moisture do not mix) and less of a challenge to store. Not only is this product cheaper and gravity powered, it is FAST! Also, the hose was long enough that I did not need to modify the product. I just prime the hose and watch. It empties nearly the entire contents of the 5 gallon gas can. This solution is so awesome that I bought some for my friends. Life is good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"I wanted something to siphon the gasoline from a five gallon tank on our dock to our jet skis in the water. The tanks are heavy and cumbersome when trying to fuel in waves.I watched the video that was posted, and then tested the siphon by sucking the water out of the base of a basketball system we wanted to get rid of.

You have to dip the brass end into the gasoline (or other fluid) container and then raise and lower the siphon. There is a glass ball that rises and allows fluid to pass when you lower the siphon. When you raise the siphon, the glass ball falls and prevents the fluid from escaping. Once there is enough fluid in the siphon, lower the other end into the container/tank you want to fill. Since it works with gravity, the container you are filling must be lower than the container you are siphoning from. I haven't tried it with water but it should work with any fluid. This thing is slick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brass end piece comes off easy","review":"This worked good at first. It was very easy to get the siphon started.

Very difficult to get started. Would only use for toxic liquids in confined container. The instructions show this being used to get water out of pool- would never waste my time starting when could just submerge the entire hose first or use mouth suction. If need to get something toxic out of container (such as gasoline) then spending a few minutes getting this inefficient, crude valve to function has a purpose. I have a motor scooter and occasionally need to empty the gas tank so will keep it considering it's not worth the hassle of a return. Will definitely not use for draining the fish tank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for small amounts of liquid","review":"I purchased this to siphon fuel from my generator, and this tube is too large to even access the neck of the tank. Also, this siphon is for containers that have lots of liquid, as you need to use up and down thrusting motion to start the priming process. So, a small generator wouldn't have enough liquid in it, and also not enough clearance to accept this siphon. But, for large containers with lots of liquid this will absolutely work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't work in my Honda Del Sol or CRV","review":"This siphon will not get past the too small opening in either of my Honda's so I'm going to need to return it.

This political biography does not give us much of a personal view of Moray but definitely outlines the Reformation and political processes that he went through in his struggles with England and Europe. With all the stories based on Mary, Queen of Scots it is nice to hear some of the other side of the story. I enjoyed the lessons and believe Moray would have been a great King, had he not been a bastard. His political savvy and Generalship in battle were unsurpassed and led him to becoming the \\"Good Regent\\" A person who deserves more recognition. Great book, full of info.

Sure, the band broke up after this one. Sure Mike Watt sings some songs that Ed Crawford usually sang.Production by J Mascis adds some extra squall and grit that I really like. For once Crawford's guitar has balls to match its agility.What really can't be discounted though is the songs. These songs are miles beyond \\"Flyin' the Flannel.\\" They careen and ricochet, erupting into clouds of feedback and just as suddenly floating gently down like the shards of exploded lightbulbs. There is an intensity to \\"Sincerely\\" and \\"Witness\\" that just isn't present on the previous album. The anger is palpable in \\"Hell-hole,\\" and one of the reasons behind that anger boils over the edges of \\"4.29.92.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"What a shame it's out of print.","review":"I read this book many years ago, but it's impact on me was so powerful that I vividly remember it to this day. Yes it is long and the material is now dated, but the overall content is something every American citizen should read. It will open your eyes to what a farce the so called \\"war\\" on drugs really is in this country. It's understandable how our government caves into the corruption when you look at the staggering amounts of money and power plays involved. The now dissolved Centac organization (the focus of this book) is about the only U.S. government agency worth the tax dollars. Their approach was to go after the top men, unlike the DEA and police system making small/mid-level busts every now and then to get good news coverage, while they continue taking their kickbacks and ignoring the kingpins and tons of drugs coming in. This book will make you ripping mad and scare the hell out of you at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish and disappointing","review":"This three-disc boxed set is amateurish and disappointing. As an avid Oscar follower and fan, I considered this a must buy, but don't be fooled by the lack of similar titles - this just isn't worth it. The series is dogged by repetitive footage (no interviews are included, only scenes from trailers) and monotone narration that frankly drives you crazy after a few minutes. Very little insight is brought to the Oscars story, and the few bits of interesting information that are included would barely fill a 10 minute segment. At almost 10 hours, you can see how padded out it is... And, to add insult to injury, the image and sound quality is poor and the packaging shoddy!

The motor on the razor sounded like it was going to go so I decided to try the quadra action because supposedly its better. Right away I noticed that my shaves took longer using the quadra action because those small holes just took away slots and they really didnt cut anything. I'd have to go over shaved areas again and again just to get all the stuble. Today I just became frustrated and took out my old reflex action and voila I was done shaving in 1 minute. This model is overpriced and not worth it. Sure you can wash it under the tap but the water causes the hair in the chamber to clump up until finally there is just a whole bunch of gunk in there thats very difficult to clean out. My old reflex action was munch better because all I had to do was open it up and the powedered hair just came out. Save your money. Get a reflex action instead of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best shaver for the money","review":"The Norelco 7885XL Quad action shaver is the best I have ever used. In the past I have tried everything from other shavers to razor blades. The Braun and Remington shavers were a joke. They never seemed to give me the close shave with no irritation that I desired. I have very sensitive skin so going to a blade was a hard decision but I tried the Mach 3 turbo. As far as blades go they aren't bad and give a close shave but for my sensitive skin no way. Not to mention they get a little pricy as people know who use the Mach 3. Then I tried the Norelco and I never looked back. 1) close shave 2) no irritation 3) extremely easy to clean 4) initial cost may seem high but in long run saves alot of money 5) not that it matters much but looks very stylish. Overall fantastic best on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trusty portable razor.","review":"This razor has worked for me for over three years--still working but changed the \\"blades.\\" It's comfortable in your hands and it charges quickly.

It's a little bulky, you should now be able to get much lighter ones in the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as the Norelco's of old","review":"I like others thought that when my 20 year old Norelco gave out that electric shaving technology would have advanced to new heights. Not true with this unit. Older units definetly shaved closer. The weakest part is the push button that releases the head of the shaver for cleaning. One must keep this area very clean or you can not unlatch the head with a simple pressing of the button. In my opinion, the latch is too small and \\"too plastic\\". Get frustrated and bang it against the counter to get it open and it will eventually break. Would not recommend for the cost. Time for Norelco to go back to the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe","review":"I recieved this shaver a week ago, and am quite impressed. It gives a close shave, or at least as close as any electric can. This razor is far superior to any foil razer and the lcd display is a real help.

Overall an excellent buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad but...","review":"Well this was advertised as an Amazon gold box special when I ordered it, and it came with a 60 day guarantee, so I figured I try and replace my old blade with a new electric razor.I figured it wouldn't be as close of a shave, and I was right, however it was a close enough shave to where I deem it worth keeping. Plus it's a ton more comfortable, and it shaves quicker than an ordinary blade. I can get my face done in less than 5 minutes instead of 10 minutes with a blade). With no need to change heads every 3-4 times this razor will pay for itself vs. those blades that keep getting more expensive.They are right though, the electric razor will need a minimum of 2 weeks to get used to your face properly before you will get its full effect. But give it a try, if you can sacrifice some closeness of your shave for lots of extra comfort, this electric razor is well worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget about blades","review":"This is a great shaver.

If you're expecting some music genres like Alternative, Pop, Jazz, or Rock, this is not the soundtrack for you. \\"Nip/Tuck\\" features the kind of music you'd hear on the Ibiza, Hed Kandi, or Ministry Of Sound series: a blend of House, Trance, Lounge, Electro-Pop, and Chillout infused selections.

And the razor works like new again! I put these on the subscribe and save plan so they will always be shipped free and I save a little in the deal.

Compared the new heads to my old ones and you could easily see that they were not a match, and indeed they did not work...the shaver rotors did not mesh and turn the heads.Called Philips/Norelco and explained the problem; they agreed that I ordered the correct heads and that they should work...much to their credit, they sent me a new set, yes, HQ8's, came today, and yep, they did work!! Same (identical) package that I ordered from Amazon, but different heads that looked like my old ones and did mesh.

Next to it on the store shelf were the HQ8 replacement heads, selling for the SAME $30. So, Norelco sells a new shaver, with cutting heads, rechargeable batteries, and a charger for the same price as the heads alone!!!Presumably, Norelco makes some profit on the new $30 razor. The three cutting heads represent, maybe, 20% of the value of the new razor...or about $6 in value. So, to sell the replacement heads for $30 or for the discounted Amazon.com price of $25 is robbery.Norelco seems to be telling its customers to simply buy a new shaver each time the cutting heads begin to get dull...encouraging more wastefulness on a planet being buried in waste...thanks Norelco."},{"rating":"1","title":"No better than worn out originals","review":"These blades cut only slightly better than 2 year old originals -- which are ripping my face they are so worn out.

Even if they were not transferable, I would still have had a razor with new blades, albeit a more basic model. I intend to do that the next time my blades no longer provide a decent shave.

Look at the excellent cover by John Picacio, and then imagine this: as good as that cover is, what's inside it simply blows it away, and that's no mean feat, gentle reader. Rick Klaw is jarring at times, abrasive, witty, intelligent, laconic, challenging, an expert in many fields from bookselling to the composing of effective comic books, science fiction or how to hold a book signing. His ruminations on censorship are white-hot and deserve to be read by anyone who holds on to the foolish notion that what will protect children is ignorance, his understanding of what makes effective writing is vast, his ability to interview (in this case, Michael Moorcock, an authentic genius... much like Rick himself is) holds startling clarity.

I tried their repair kit bit it was only useful for the smallest of cosmetic dings.

I don't understand why the manufacturer changed the design but did not rename the product so that I would have not wasted $220."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good introduction for first time Holly listeners","review":"I wouldn't normally review a greatest hits album, because naturally they are good. If you haven't heard Holly Golightly before then this compilation of hits would be a good introduction. She is quite unique in her genre of music. Very few Women have been successful when it comes to writing and recording hard electric blues. But Holly's light gravely voice suits the style wonderfully.With ten albums under her belt she has a huge selection of songs to pick from, spanning ten years of hard work. The tracks here show how her sound has evolved, from bluesy garage rock through to alt-country blues, with the odd folk song in between. They run together on this disc beautifully and before long you will be singing along.This is great as an introduction, but I would recommend buying one of her studio albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Hot","review":"The writing style of the book was fast with the main character, Nick Escalante, an interesting complex character that wasn't all that likable. However, the timeframe of everything happening over a few days forced the appearances of other characters to be short and sweet, and the characters were far from \\"fleshed out\\". I found there were a few too many \\"coincidences\\" that were hard to accept. \\"Red Herrings\\" weren't really explained well and the ending was more of a comic book ending than I expected. Also, if you don't want to know what's coming then don't read the dust jacket summary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Emotional Connections","review":"I received this book as a Christmas gift having never read a William Goldman novel. Let's just say that I'm not too keen on reading another.I would give a quick plot synopsis of this book, but that is one of the main problems...it just seems to wander from plot point to plot point with little coherence. Each \\"chapter\\" seems like its own contained little story with much too little overall context.Also, the main character--Nick Escalante--is supposed to be an interesting character portrait of a Las Vegas lifer, but instead he is just a guy who sort of goes from one job to the next...nothing too interesting.Once I finished reading Heat, I had absolutely no emotional connection to either the plot or the main characters whatsoever...it was pretty much a waste of the time I spent reading it.

To me it was like someone said \\"You like Rushmore? Being John Malkovich? Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind?

All in all I'd say this one is a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric effort","review":"Interesting premise. I think this could have been a great movie with more work (better sound, actors, writing, etc.). Disappointing, although Mark Duplass' performance impressed me. The story doesn't really make sense.SPOILER ALERT - Kenneth runs his car into a guy's house who's girlfriend he has a crush on. So, basically, he tried to injure or even kill them, because he liked her. He later claims that she was his girlfriend who was killed by some lunatic who ran his car into her house and that he has to go back in time to save her. Somehow that's irrelevant if he is actually building a time machine and not just \\"crazy\\". Already way crazy on the first count.

It was mildly interesting, mildly amusing, and kind of a coming of age movie, coming to term with previous relationships movie. It held my interest, but really that's all.

That Gone with the Wind gets the same 4 1/2 stars that this does seems unrealistic in the extreme."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as I hoped","review":"Movie was slow and not as humorous as we hoped.

There are a few sub-plots but they do not add anything to the story as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away","review":"lots of plot holes in this \\"coulda been a contenda\\" movie. really disappointed in the fractured and implausible story. too many holes to fill in to manage suspension of disbelief."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a brilliant film","review":"A very sideways look at a time travel story, I have to say this film captures the brilliant and awkward and imaginative.On the face of it, it is not the kind of film I usually go for, but it was mentioned by a facebook friend of a friend, and I am so glad I checked it out - I will certainly recommend it to others.And yes, I cried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yup, it is a good one.","review":"This was a perfect film for some low key hanging out. It's the kind of feel good movie that, as others have said, doesn't get too sappy. It's quirkiness doesn't get too quirky either. I think Aubrey (Darius) really pulls the whole premise together as she slowly transforms throughout the film. She was just awesomely awkward then fearless and then awkwardly fearless and fearlessly awkward. Yup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun movie!","review":"This is a fun movie where you can just lose yourself and enjoy the ride.

Ending was kind of a surprise (not the main one, but the \\"side mission\\") but didn't really detract."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyment not guaranteed","review":"It didn't engage me at all. I thought maybe the age gap was the reason but my 20-something son did not like it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I missed seeing this in the theater and couldn't wait to see it via rental. I was really in the mood for quirky comedy with romance thrown in. I was extremely disappointed. The dialogue wasn't that clever and the two falling in love did not have great chemistry. The ending was downright silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So","review":"Didn't love this movie. It was interesting at times but ultimately, I found it slow moving and boring. No great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull attempt at humor","review":"I cannot believe the volume of good reviews... Would not pay to see this.

Worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"More please!","review":"This had so much more to offer than the average movie in theaters today. There was comedy, there was romance, there was \\"life lessons learned,\\" there was sci-fi, there was a high speed 15mph chase scene in a busted Datsun 280Z (lol), there was evil gov't intervention, there was really good acting, there was excellent CG effects, there was bad prosthetics, and most of all there was a happy heart-felt ending. Couldn't take my eyes off the screen!Disclaimer: I am not related to anyone involved in this movie. I just wish the cast and crew would make a bunch of sequels! If they can keep the charm alive and not lose the wonderful campy look of reality vs what Hollywood pumps out, this could easily be Dr. Who with humor included. Absolutely loved it!!! Kudos to everyone involved!Anything negative? With all the wonderful quirky characters, there wasn't enough time to tie up all their issues. But hey, that's why there are sequels, right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun film","review":"I enjoyed this film it was original and fun, however it was a little outlandish.I enjoyed the characters and the quirkiness of the film. It had a low budget feeling about itThough and that was distracting at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun quirky movie","review":"The movie is funny and enjoyable and worth the watch. The main character essentially plays the same role she does on Parks and Rec. but it still a fun watch. Even my Dad who poo-poos most movies got a kick out of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sweet, Humorous Movie","review":"What begins as a seemingly dark cynical plot about magazine writers exploiting someone who seems a little crazy creates a \\"road trip\\" movie with unexpected events. It's still a humorous movie; and the actors are all really perfect in their roles, all yearning for something that just eludes them because of something, (ie. age, sudden loss,feelings of being a misfit) they can't control. Without giving the ending away, this movie highlights the light over dark with imagination and a wistful sweetness."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of 2012","review":"Solid acting performances, especially Mark Duplass. Really enjoyed the whole film. character development was great & the end is satisfying but still leaves you wondering. Definitely recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Indie Romp","review":"Fun, not-so-predictable story with some drama. Nice character development. None of the four main characters are perfect, but enough believably human to make you \\"buy in\\" and want their happiness, which they say clearly do not have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film, unusual plot","review":"Darius, a young magazine intern (played by Audrey Plaza), is recruited to help a staff writer with a story about a bizarre young man who has advertised for a time-travel partner, specifying that \\"safety is not guaranteed\\". When she finds him, she goes undercover to get the story. As she gets to know Kenneth (played by Mark Duplass), his story gets more and more interesting. He really believes he'll be able to go back in time. Soon, she's attracted to the lonely young man and feels guilty about deceiving him.I love indies. This one is funny, sweet, and unpretentious with quirky but genuine characters. Besides Darius and Kenneth, there is a second intern, Arnau, and the staff writer, Jeff. While Darius gets the story, Jeff and Arnau are pursuing everything but the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked this movie until the end.","review":"Potential spoiler alert (but no details)I was enjoying this movie as I watched it. It seemed to be developing into a slightly darker story than I expected, with a lot of human interaction, good and bad.Then, the ending.The ridiculous resolution to the movie completely erased any feeling I had toward the characters and threw all of my interest out the window. What a lazy finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nah...","review":"It's nice to see actors who mainly work on TV take a stab at feature films. And I'm a fan of indie films. Which is why I was disappointed with this effort. It didn't feel like the characters or the story were sufficiently developed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously? That's how it ends?","review":"I won't give anything away here (well, maybe I will), but you know when the premise of a movie revolves around a man claiming he can time travel that an ending is going to be tough to pull off. This movie's ending wasn't surprising or fulfilling. It went from being an entertaining little indie flick to an abruptly over, absurdly ridiculous finish that leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I would give this movie three and a half stars for the first 80 minutes and 0 stars for the last 10. You don't leave knowing exactly what happens, which can be cool, but only if you care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile for a viewing","review":"Not bad if your looking for a movie to watch. ending was a bit hokie though. all in all a good plot which doesn't leave you feeling depressed.

Witty, great characters, overall fun to watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly entertaining.","review":"I watched this expecting it to be a typical art movie, but it was actually pretty entertaining. Definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great off-beat light comedy.","review":"Nice to see another voice in the off-beat comedy market ... if you like Kaufmann, Wes Anderson, etc, this is a film to consider. I am often disappointed by films as tired, clumsy, and/or pandering to an ignorant public, but this was pretty satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, but a bit lacking","review":"So if you think this movie is about time travel, don't bother... also, if you're from the seattle area, don't be distracted by the melding of scenery from Pacific Beach, Ocean Shores, Aberdeen, and the puget sound area.It was entertaining, but the end felt like a typical \\"hipster\\" movie finale..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film","review":"I never heard of this film prior to seeing it on Amazon. I have recently become a fan of Jake Johnson (New Girl...) but did not realize he was in this film until the trailer began. Well, I am a supporter of most all things Chicago based :-) so I watched the trailer. I thought it looked fun and refreshing; not overly done and predictable in the way that so many movies are today. This, instead, seemed like a \\"real\\" film.I was right. It was real, it was fun, it was different and refreshing. There was a bit of sweetness to all of the characters and the ending; I truly didn't see it coming.I appreciate having access to Amazon in that I have access to many styles of artistic development that I may not otherwise. This is a great film to watch whether you want something quirky, or indie, or different or just... good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful film.","review":"Loved it!

I should have reviewed right away, becauseit is a funny and quirky film that is full many many little moments that are so entertaining. The characters are all so well developed, and the actors do justice to the roles. Hope and anticipation of something big out there that will change our world forever is a human condition especially prevalent in our youth, and this movie brings it all together in one big adventure.

The quality was not. Bland performances, slack direction and a flabby script makes a seemingly unique idea come across as stale. This was an extreme disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, HORRIBLE soundtrack","review":"I really enjoyed the movie, in spite of having to change the volume constantly. One minute the soundtrack is blowing you out of the room, the next minute you are turning it to max level just to hear the dialog.I don't know if this is just a problem with my copy, but it is something to consider befor spending this amount of money to own. Rent it first; $24.00 is a lot of money, new or used, to pay for a distraction like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies ever made.","review":"Terrible script and worse acting. My wife walked out of the room after a half hour and I stuck it out to the end hoping it would get better. It was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This movie was shallow.

I can not believe I paid 3.99 because 40 other reviews liked this movie. It has nothing to do with time travel at least I think so because I skipped through it after I realized it was a CHICK FLICK. It is slow also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but fails to fulfil its promise in every way","review":"The preview showed promise and Aubrey Plaza is charming, but the film fails on many levels by not taking the time and effort to show us how intimacy develops between the actors. So much time is wasted on non-essentials that none remains to actually make us care. Worst for this viewer was that the film fails to define what is real and what is not, and I can't care about characters in whom I can't believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it.","review":"Fun movie. Quirky and somewhat predictable but still worth the rental and time.

It made you feel like a little kid again . but at the same time its a great comedy/romance/adventure film/"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving and Bittersweet","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect going in. I was intrigued by the trailer and the excellent reviews, and I love Audrey Plaza's April on Parks and Rec and Jake Johnson's Nick on the New Girl, but time travel? Not necessarily my thing. But I absolutely loved it. There was something just so moving and bittersweet about Darius and Kenneth's journey, and while I wasn't in love with the other characters (Jeff and Arnou), they provided some amusing comedy to balance everything out.It's hard for me to know who will and won't enjoy this movie because it is quirky and a little different, like most indie movies. But I loved it. I saw it twice in theaters, and can't wait to get the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must See","review":"Unexpectedly good movie, Wanders through relationships and inward soul searching of cast members.

A cynical young woman who has had an unhappy life and who can't seem to find good employment gets hired as an intern at a small Seattle newspaper. She is assigned to go an a road trip with a sleazy feature writer to look in to a strange small classified ad of someone looking for a partner for time travel. The young woman and another intern accompany the sleazy one to a country town and they stalk the time travel requester. Some ludicrous situations, some intrigue, good character studies, plot gets a little tangled but it works well and is well worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool movie!","review":"I love quirky weird stuff like this.

Sadly, I relate to these characters, so I was totally rooting for the nut with the time machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly sweet and not cliché","review":"If you want to watch a movie that is earnest, clever and surprisingly delightful, I would recommend watching \\"safety not guaranteed\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ogeechee: A River and Its People","review":"There are not many publications about the Ogeechee River so I was glad to find this one. The photos are from a good many years ago but that is what lends them charm. The river itself is unchanging - yet in a constant state of change as it flows relentlessly to the sea! The information is interesting and informative. For anyone who loves the Ogeechee, this is the book to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Beautiful","review":"This is Mariah's best album EVER!

There's a few uptempo songs, like the #1 single \\"Dreamlover\\", \\"I've Been Thinking About You\\" and \\"Now That I Know\\". The rest of the songs are nice ballads, including the #1 inspirational song \\"Hero\\". She does gospel on the soulful \\"Anytime You Need A Friend\\", which was a mild hit as well. The title track is really nice ballad, but my favorite is the closing \\"All I've Ever Wanted\\", which is a strong love song. I have the version of this cd with the bside \\"Everything Fades Away\\", which is on the \\"Hero\\" single I believe. Other highlights include \\"Never Forget You\\" and \\"Without You\\". Overall a really nice album, start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah's third million-seller","review":"MUSIC BOX was released in 1993 following three albums since 1990,the year her self-titled debut was released. EMOTIONS followed in '91,and the live 30-minute MTV UNPLUGGED in '92. Mariah covers WITHOUT YOU originally recorded by the late Harry Nilsson. Air Supply covered the song after Mariah. Aside from WITHOUT YOU,hits include DREAMLOVER,HERO and ANYTIME YOU NEED A FRIEND. Total playing time of this CD is 42 minutes and 1 second. Some CD players read it as 41 minutes and 59 seconds. It's worth listening to,though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This CD is definitely a must. The album had five big hit singles spawned from it (Dreamlover, Hero, Never Forget You, Without You, and Anytime You Need A Friend), which is proof of the disc's merits. Pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best......","review":"What can I say? This is still the best cd Mariah has made to date. This cd has it all. Hero, which is a very inspirational song, is one of the best. I've been thinking about you is one of my favorites on this cd, because (and let me know if I am wrong) we have always had those moments when we just want to break out of our shell and tell the one we love what we think of them. Eventhough this cd had generated only 2 #1 singles (dreamlover, hero), I think that this cd is truly a spiritual, inspiring, romantic work of art; which would turn the head of any hopeless romantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"mariah brings the music scene back to r&b/pop","review":"the early 90's was full of grunge and rap that big artists were being shunned for a minute. In 1993 that started to change when divas like whitney, janet and mariah were dominating the pop charts once again. Whitney's was a soundtrack CD with one big hit, janet had a lot of hits and the album sold well but MUSIC BOX outsold it and had the longest running number ones dreamlover and hero which are among the most remembered songs ever of the 1990's There are a bunch of beautiful ballads in the rest of the album and 2 hip hop/dance numbers. There was no stopping mariah after this, she released a BEAUTIFUL christmas album the only good christmas album out there and then the daydream album which sold the same as this album and had even more memorable hits synonmous with the 1990's"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music to my ears!","review":"I first bought this album when I was a 7th grader and I wrote about it in my diary :) I said \\"This is a great CD, someday I'm going to sing just like her! My favorite songs are \\"Hero\\" cause it's so true, and \\"I've been thinking About you\\" cause it reminds me of Devin :) he's such a cutie!\\"Now things have changed since '93. I've never been able to sing quite that well, Devin moved away, and I lost this Album, but one thing remains the same. This CD is a great collection of Mariah's talents and I think it is her best. I love all the songs on it, and it shows off her voice in all it's glory.She does best on Music Box, and Just to Hold you Once Again, because I think her voice is best heard soft and slow.This CD is a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Her last great","review":"Considering that Mariah Carey drifted more and more into rap and \\"screaming\\" without sense, \\"Music Box\\" is seemingly her last really good album. \\"Hero\\", \\"Anytime you need a friend\\" and the cover \\"Without you\\" are great songs and clearly among Mariah's best. Some other songs on this album are \\"fillers\\" - that's why it didn't make it to get 5 stars. Otherwise a good album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah's Masterpiece","review":"This album is Mariah's bestseller, for good reason. It contains two of her biggest hits, the pop perfection of \\"Dreamlover\\" and the inspiring lyrics of \\"Hero\\". It also includes her beautiful remake of \\"Without You\\" as well as the inspiring \\"Anytime You Need A Friend\\". Then there are the beautiful album tracks, such as the title track and \\"Just To Hold You Once Again\\". This album also contains Mariah's last (as far as I know) collaborations with Clivilles and Cole. These tracks (\\"Now That I Know\\", \\"I've Been Thinking About You\\")have a House-type feel and prove Mariah's versatility. This album is listenable from beginning to end, with no slow spots. If possible, one should try to order the version with \\"Everything Fades Away\\" as a bonus track. That track is worth it's weight in gold. This masterpiece is a must for any Mariah collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome mariah CD","review":"this was mariah's best selling record ever and Daydream sold the same amount too.

Mariah Carey is a very very good singer. She sings better than Britney Spears, Avril Lavigne or Jeniffer Lopez, without a doubt. You could be better listening to Mariah Carey, instead of Britney Spears, and all of those pop princesses.On this album the songs are fine, but not each of them. I did not give this album 5 stars, because here are some poor songs, like Anytime You Need A Friend 2/5, All I've Ever Wanted 1/5, I Been Thinking About You 2/5. My favorite songs from this album are Withhout You 5/5, Dreamlover 5/5, Hero 4/5, and Never Forget You 4/5. When you want to buy an album, first read a review !!!

Two more of my favs are ALL I'VE EVER WANTED & MUSIC BOX. Last but not least my absolute fav song on this album is WITHOUT YOU. Mariah makes this song her own and her vocals are as always amazing but I think especially in this song. Its beautiful! This is Mariah's masterpiece & classic, its also her best selling record and a album everyone should own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Album - expresses early 90s","review":"I liked this album very much when it was released. After listening to it, it very much grew on me. Every once in a while I would find a different song that would speak to me. I found all the songs, without exception, to be beautiful. It's definitively a classy album, and a great representation of the early 90s. Some people commented that this album doesn't have much variety, that all the songs sound pretty much the same. I have a great appreciation for this. This CD puts you in a specific mood, and it doesn't ruin it for you in the middle. If you are over the 90s type of production (crispy sounds), it's unlikely you'll appreciate this album. I'm definitively over this album now. Sound production matures from year to year, plus older people are less likely to appreciate crispy sounds than kids and teenagers. Thus, for this, physical, reason you may not experience the complexity of this music. Listen to the samples and you'll know if you can take it."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN TOY FOR TRAIN LAYOUTS","review":"This is a very realistic looking train station.It is similiar to the one in my hometown.Fits in well with any train layout especially if you have a passenger train."},{"rating":"2","title":"The same as Pure Moods I but more for your money!","review":"New Pure Moods (2 CD set) has almost all of the songs from Pure Moods I but also much, much more! With 40 songs on this CD, you can't get a better compilation album. I first found this CD in England while originally searching for Pure Moods I (which I haven't even given back to my roommate yet!). This CD is so good that I'd even purchased it for my friends for their birthdays! I don't see what better gift I can give them.....and you can give one to yourself too! You'll thank me for recommending this later. Since people complained about Pure Moods II (which has only like 16 tracks) you won't be disappointed with this one. And since this CD is sold only abroad (if you're in the U.S.) it will cost a little more since it's an import. But it's totally worth buying. Quality music is priceless....especially with all the nonsense we hear on the radio these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"repetitive and unimaginative","review":"the vocals are flat and the music is very uncreative and repetitive. i bought this album because of the great reviews on here thinking they were objective. the vocalists are a couple of bores. where is the emotion in these voices? the lyrics are beautiful, though. over all, this band sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do they think are doing...","review":"I'm sorry but I am not going to hear any group that sings \\"and Jesus is crying...\\".

It gives a detailed 6 month plan on how to get in shape for climbing Mount Rainier. There is a lot of great information and enough climbing specific exercises to keep from getting bored. This DVD was also recommended by the guide service I am using, Alpine Ascents. The production is pretty low which is why I did not give it 5 stars. However, it does not take away from the value of the information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful information","review":"This no frills video has fantastic information for training to climb high peaks. What I especially appreciate are the clips showing exercises that can be done with items found around the house. This comprehensive, straightforward plan includes specific recommendations for exercises/number of reps/etc. each week of the program. I will recommend this video to all of my friends who want to get in shape (as I am doing) for Mt. Rainier or any other high peak. Thank you Courtenay and Doug for this great video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, don't waste your money","review":"I am planning on climbing Rainier next summer and I was intrigued by this DVD. Luckily I did not buy this. I rented it from Netflix, and even their ranking system had rated it extremely low. While I agree the stretches and workouts are beneficial, anyone with any sense, experience, and comfort in a gym will not need this product. There are plenty of free programs out there on the net, keep your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny from the word go","review":"I purchased the DVD, Train to Climb Mt Rainier, for my 19 year son for a Christmas gift in 2009. Upon viewing it, he and his brothers (all older than he) were laughing so hard at the acting and portrayals of mountain climbers that they didn't learn a thing from the DVD. The high fives were corny as well as the lessons of what not to do to train for a climb. I believe that this purchase was a complete waste of my money and was extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended by someone who was there","review":"As a former Armor officer in the Persian Gulf War, I can tell you that this book genuinely conveys the feelings and experiences of young officers in the desert. The authors are humble enough to admit their own shortcomings, and their memory of detail is truly astounding. The only way you will ever get a better idea of what the Gulf War was like from the turret of an M1A1 tank would be to read this book after going several days without sleep while wearing a charcoal-lined suit inside your clothes dryer."},{"rating":"2","title":"An okay read","review":"I was a M1A1 tank platoon leader in the 1st Infantry Division during Desert Storm and this book brought back memories of that time in my life. For a non-military person this book offers a unique insight into what it is like for a unit going off to war. there are flaws though, as mentioned by others it is hard at times to figure out who is doing the talking. One minute I'm reading about the scout platoon leader and the next I am reading about one of the tank platoon leaders without knowing I had left the scout platoon leader. Overall it is a pretty good book once you get past the confusion of who you are reading about on some pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mystery Thriller!!!","review":"This is a great mystery thriller starring Cloris Leachman about a married couple driving on a deserted road and stopping at a run down diner when the husband goes to the bathroom he never returns suspecting foul play!!It's an eerie must see movie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't be with out it!!!","review":"I recived one for a shower gift and had no clue this would be the one and only saving grace for my son!!!!

We keep two in the crib; I'm considering buying about 5 more and spreading them throughout the crib! They wash and travel well, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Product","review":"Warning*** Don't buy this product unless you are positive that you will be happy with it. The 60day full guarantee is a lie. Amazon gave me a very hard time returning this when my son was unhappy with the shave,and I was within the 60 days, and when they did agree, after numerous attempts through email, they deducted 20% and are only refunding me $84 out of the $109. I understand not getting back the shipping, but when they say satisfaction guaranteed, I expect the full purchase price back. This was a truly awful experience with Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of the same for Parker","review":"Being a long time fan of Robert Parker, this book was disappointing. Too much same stuff, not meaty enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, 7865XL beats my razor any time.","review":"To achive the maximum closeness, you must follow the instruction from the small hand book included in the package. At first, you will not see a dramatic change but keep using it and your facial hair will grow to be shaved by 7865XL faster and comfortable every time. My facial hair is thick and a common razor's blade last about 3 to 4 weeks average use. The 7865XL does it in no time and close to my face. My face ends uplike a baby's bottom. The first use always take time, but as you progress shaving over and over on your face it get faster. Depends on your skin and your hair growth too. I can shave in less than 5 min and I have side burns that the combs can go around the edges; of course with some help from my hand. As I hold the hair upward, the electric razor does it job. What more can I say? You gotta try it to prove yourself wrong. And remember, follow the instructions from the small booklet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After using this attractive product for three weeks, I am returning it for refund to Norelco. Problems are skin irritation and painful hair pulling. Additionally, the shave is not close compared with even a disposable blade, despite using pre-shave conditioners. I was very disappointed in the quality of shave, because this product is well-made and there were many postive reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Norelco 7865XL","review":"I am trying to use electric shaver for the first time and I did not like it better than shaving with twin blade razor. I tried few times to shave and it sucks. It feels so good to go back to twin blade razor again. I think I will never try electric shaver again. It is much more painful than using a twin blade razor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.....","review":"I read all the positive reviews on this shaver, so I picked one up 6 weeks ago. It shaves my face quite well, but does a lousy job on my neck and jawline. I had to go to an engagement party recently, and to get a decent, clean shave I had to break down and use a razor. The booklet says to use only the electric shaver for 3 weeks straight to give your skin time to adjust; but not only wouldn't this thing shave my neck decently, it actually caused a nasty rash to develop as well. I had to use Lanacane for a week to get rid of it. This Norelco model will be my last attempt at using an electric shaver (I tried a high-priced Braun as well, with similar results). Over 90 bucks spent on this thing, and I still can't get a really good, satisfactory shave. I can't recomment this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS SHAVER!!!","review":"I've owned Norelco's for over 20 years now and this is the worst!The side trimmer doesn't cut anything, the charge only lasts one week and the shaver causes a rash on my neck. My old Norelco's side trimmers always cut right so I think they ought to fire the engineer that designed this one. All the previous Norelco's I've owned had a charge that lasted two weeks so I think they are skimping out on the batteries they use. The design of the head is lousy; the stupid holes actually cause a rash on my neck.I know they say to apply less pressure but if you do then you don't get a close shave on the rest of your face. The other thing I hate is the external adaptor on the cord. The old Norelco had a slim cord with no stupid adaptor on it. The only good thing I can say about this shaver is that it is easy to clean under warm water, but what good is this if you are not getting a close shave and developing rashes on your neck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Norelco","review":"I find the product performs well and holds a charge well into 4 days. It does take a break-in period for your face and the razor. You have to stick with it through an \\"uncomfortable\\" period.

Other tracks of interest include a disco song called \\"the Floor\\" and a bouncy harmonious ditty called \\"It's a No\\".

After a search on Amazon, I found out they had several newer recordings. I purchase this one among the others. I believe it is their third complete CD. It carries on in the vein of the first two. There are 14 tracks here. Enough to keep your enjoyment of this band satisfied. I am addicted to the sound of Sally Ellyson's voice. It is deep and breathy, and fluid and melodic. She gets the tones right to your heart without the vocal acrobatics you hear when women audition for Amercan Idol. She will purr you into heaven.

So that we could both start on relatively equal footing, we each bought a precontructed theme deck from Wizards' new Champions of Kamigawa series of Magic cards. I bought the white deck you are now browsing (Way of the Warrior) and my friend bought the red themed deck. After three relatively quick games one thing became abundantly clear - the Way of the Warrior deck is extremely powerful right out of the box. Using a new \\"Bushido\\" rule, many characters gain significant attack and defense numbers simply by blocking and/or being blocked. Some weak characters can transform (via a new \\"flip\\" card feature) into more powerful characters simply by attacking and harming a rival player.Honestly I don't know if this deck could stand up to serious, custom-designed decks, but that's not why I bought it. I bought it simply to get back into the game of Magic and stay competitive and it did just that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful way to talk about \\"China Mom and Dad\\"","review":"I try to keep up-to-date on new books published about adoption, but I had not heard about \\"We See the Moon.\\" I came across it while searching for adult books on adoption for my husband, who was adopted from Greece over 40 years ago! I ordered this book, and I was more than pleasantly surprised. It is simple in its text, has beautiful folk art illustrations, and offered the opportunity for dialogue about my daughter's biological parents (she came home from China in January, 2000).

Although the illustrations are all reproductions of Chinese peasant paintings (widely available elsewhere in the form of cards and calendars), the text is adaptable for any young child adopted from overseas. In recognizing the adopted child's natural curiosity about his or her birth mother, the book gently validates the adopted child's losses as well as celebrating the love and comfort of the child's adoptive family.

The only decent song is \\"my life\\" and even that is just decent.I appreciate josh klinghoffer's collaboration and input, but in my opinion releasing a cd where all/almost all songs are his is going a bit too far.I hope John's next release will have what we all love about him: amazing guitar work, and ever improving vocals.Meanwhile I regret spending money on this cd, after one run in my stereo its going to the bottom of the pile, and in goes \\"to record only water for ten days\\".John please come back."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would say it is my least favorite John Frusciante album.","review":"After The Will to Death, I was convinced that John Frusciante is a god.

Not surprisingly, it arrived quite broken. I am sending it back. I am writing this review because someone may want to order another brand of rosin that comes in a hard plastic case (rather then just a cloth) to save themselves the aggravation of having to return a broken product.

They are about 4 inches long and the card they're on is about 7 by 9 inches, so they look awesome for display. The main product image shows 3 bikes, hence the confusion for the first reviewer. If you check the seller comments, you'll see what bike you're getting. I'm not sure why other sellers are charging so much for them, but they are out of print and a few years old and this makes them very collectible. Despite the previous reviewers dissatisfation with a specific purchase, these motorcycle are the COOLEST of the Maisto Marvel diecasts and a perfect collectible for motorcycle or Marvel collectors.

The old liners were made of a thick plastic, which made it extremely easy to sift. Now, there are VERY thin liners and they tend to stick together when lifted out.

I since have not been able to locate elsewhere, so decided to order 10 boxes online. After using the first box I understand why Walmart no longer sells this product. They must have had way to many returns, for the quality has been down graded. You go to pull the top liner up and the others stick together leaving the litter in between the liners? I doubt I will be a returning customer unless I can be convienced that the quality has been returned to its original form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great litterbox solution","review":"These sifting liners are a great way to keep a litterbox clean and maintained. For cats that scratch and dig deep into their litter, they may not work as well, as the liner sheets can get torn up by kitty claws. Our cats, however, are quite compatible with these liners, and my wife swears by them. It is a very efficient way to daily maintain a litterbox, and is far better than scooping in most instances. I can think of a few design improvements, however, such as nice, strong pick-up loops around the circumference of each liner sheet to make lifting and sifting even easier. Also, since the sheets are flat, placing a new set in an empty litterbox (especially deep ones) means the stack of sifting sheets will ruffle up around the sides of the pan, making it tricky to fasten everything securely with the included rubber band. A sifting liner design that incorporates a sort of \\"box-shape bottom\\" pre-formed into the stack might be a helpful update."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a thought...","review":"I think they may have different product types because the type I bought at a well know chain store came in a box with a cat lying in the grass with a blue cloud filled sky overhead.

First I should mention I have the Intec case for the DS system that has a hinged top and a rubberized interior and spring latch to close. It is of exceptional quality and costs about what the storage case I am reviewing cost. So naturally I thought that these cases would be of similar construction, here I was wrong. The game case is made of the cheapest plastic possible and does not close easily because the injection molding process was so poor. This makes it difficult to open and I think the hinge will wear out inside a couple months. Also, since it is not available from Amazon currently, only it's resellers, the return shipping will cost me as much as I paid for the item so I am stuck with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylis too big","review":"I bought the case for my granddaughter. She is 6 yrs. I like it and she really likes it. We got out our spare stylis and tried to pop it into the stylis spot. It won't fit. This is the stylis that came with the Nintendo DS as a spare. So now we can't have a spare in this case box.As for being hard to open and close, it was. So before I gave the case to my granddaughter I rubbed some bar soap on the two corner tabs and it opens and closes very easily. I wish this case was just a 16 game holder for the small games. That would be very nice. Overall I am happy with this. All the games will be in one place and clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good.","review":"Just a plastic box really.

So are her specific tips for understanding your true goals, framing a pitch so that the recipient really hears and is receptive to your message and going after what you want in a way that is effective without being off-putting to others or somehow untrue to who you really are.

Whenever she starts talking about real \\"poets\\" or \\"poetry\\" the tone becomes condescending and judgmental.Far too much of this book is spent trying to deflate the supposed desire for poetry superstardom (hah!) and not enough on encouraging people who are new to poetry to give it a try and do something new.

I was somewhat surprised (and, I admit, a little nonplussed; sometimes you just need to give SOMETHING a bad review, no matter what it is) to discover that The Complete Idiot's Guide to Writing Poetry is actually a pretty decent stab at sticking a writing course between two covers. There are some pieces of text where I wanted to cringe (the idea that line breaks are arbitrary, the idea that haiku is a 5-7-5 strict form), and a few that seem to contradict one another (mostly having to do with meaning and message), but overall not a bad little book.

It was very frustrating on exam day to see all kinds of information not covered in this book -- and I'm not talking specifics here but GENERAL CONCEPTS. If your undergraduate biology study was more focused (i.e. you haven't had development or plant bio or physiology or evolution or cell bio), you're probably better off taking an in-depth review of the Campbell general biology textbook (an older edition of which I'm sure you could get cheaply and not feel bad marking up).

Granted, the box says ages 3 and up, but conceptually there is no reason a younger child couldn't play...we just had to remove the tiny chips and replace them with larger paper squares. Most of the sounds are done well, but there are a few that the adults finally know only after a few rounds of playing. Just didn't work with our (admittedly low) level of technology.

I will generally re-apply rosin every 45-60 minutes of casual practice. I am new to violins and have only been practicing for a very short amount of time so may be my fault. non the less I recommend this rosin for a person with a light/medium bow hand. if you are a person who seams to put more pressure on their bow then go with a lighter harder rosin. on that note this rosin started on the first pull no scratching needed ^.^ was very pleased I plan to use this stuff for a while"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"This trimmer works only so-so.

For me, these slower blues numbers that really allow a player to pour out emotion into the music, and to take it slowly or play faster over the slow beat, are the ones where talent really shines.

I don't think she'd get the same diagnosis these days. \\"Psychopath\\" comes to mind. Ugh. Someone recommended this book to me is the only reason I bought it and read it. I wanted to stop reading it after the first cat killing, but thought MAYBE there was some redeeming value to the book.

Hi-Low and Dance Step have the quality of being filmed, rather than taped. The background is artistic: montage images on a large screen; billowing curtains off to the side, nearly out of sight. The music is of the ambient-world variety, as in the Buddha Bar or Hotel Etages compilations. With such high production values, exercising never becomes a monotonous grind. However, the learning curve is not instant. You will have to stop and rewind the tape, but it is worth the effort. The Abs and Legs tapes can be learned in one or two viewings.

It was just too beautiful.At first I was spectical. most of the songs start with this acoustic guitar music and I was thinking \\"okaaaaay, this is country music\\" but its not. Cause then the music changes. Its just so awsome. I can't really explain it. And the best part is, these songs arent for chicks, guys, christians, muslims...Its for everybody.

It's amazing that at her young age she is able to express herself so wonderfully to connect with her audience.

I like a viarity of music styles but Bethany's doesn't attract my attention. There's too much guitar. I love Nichole Nordeman and she has lots of piano. Maybe it's becuase Bethany plays too much guitar, and I love piano and guitar isn't my fave instrument.But don't be discouraged listen to the clips and if you love them then get the album, as Amazon's service is quick and I think it's pretty good.

I've had about five trimmers over a 20 year period that I only used to trim my heavy eye brows about once a month. The numbered settable head was much better than attachment combs on others. The blades were very perfectly sharp to the end. Could have been a great product except for the batteries. This was a $70.00 item and turned out to be very disappointing. I could have gotten the same use from a $10 battery powered trimmer of course having to spend approx 10-15 dollars on batteries over this year and a half period.

I thought I would be clever and buy another manufacturer's vacuum-trimmer in a brick-and-mortar store. It was awful. The vacuum barely worked and if I didn't hold the trimmer perfectly aligned with your face the cut was very uneven. I returned it and bought the Norelco T990 from Amazon. It is fantastic! The flexing head of the trimmer gives an even trim every time, no matter what angle I hold the trimmer. Its so reliable that I don't really even need to use a mirror. I really like the charge indicator as well. I don't have to guess if its time to charge the trimmer. On the downside, the pop-up trimmer isn't the best or most convenient, and the \\"deluxe\\" case isn't as deluxe as it sounds. However, those are minor gripes. Overall, this is an excellent beard trimmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but short life","review":"I have had this trimmer for over two years now, and use it about twice a month. I'm very happy with its features and durability. After two years though, the battery quickly stopped holding much of a charge then eventually became unchargable.That may be understandable of a nicad battery. The problem is they do not use standard batteries that you can easily replace. I did open the trimmer after some trouble, the batteries were soldered in, which I eventually removed. They looked like two AA's but I quickly found they are really four 1/2AA or 1/3AA, totalling 6V. I could not find replacements in several electronics catalogs, their 1/2AAs are too long and 1/3's too small.Anyway I now have to use it with the power cord, which is not that big of a problem, but for the price I was expecting something that would last much longer, so just be aware of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Battery Performance","review":"This was a great razor while it lasted, but a VERY poor purchase overall.

The guide flexes to follow the curves of your face and you can remove the guard completely to do close touch-ups. Also has a small pop up secondary trimmer, but I never use that function personally.

However, while the trimmer works well on thinning my sideburns, the flat edge is sorely lacking. My main use for a trimmer is to edge my sideburns and occasionally thin them out. With this trimmer, the flat edge did not perform to my expectations. It didn't seem to even touch the hairs around my sideburns, and no matter how many times I ran the edge over my skin, nothing seemed to happen. This razor works well for people who want something to thin out their beards or sideburns, but the straight-edge is sub-par. If that doesn't matter to you, then this is a good trimmer. However, if you are like me and need a good straight-edge, then find another razor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good study aid","review":"This book arrived promptly and it was worth the small amount of money spent.

I called Norelco, they were very accommodating and immediately sent me a replacement. I charged the new one, as I did the original, exactly as the directions suggested. The second shaver lasted about 5 shaves before it too died. I could not even get it to go on when plugged in. After several hours I tried it again when it was plugged in, and it did work. At that point I had totally run out of patience, after spending so much money on a shaver. I sent it back to Norelco for a complete refund and am currently waiting to hear from them.

The \\"smarts\\" in the unit watch the switch and turn the unit on or off depending on how you control the switch. The problem is the unit is sometimes not too smart and ignores the switch.

I bought the 8894XL primarily for its long battery life (I travel internationally for weeks at a time). On one hand, this gave the best shave ever. BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND. . . . . After less than three weeks of use, it fell apart. Literally. The head assembly fell out of the body and could not be put back together. Of course, I was in Asia with more than a week left on my trip. So I bought another 8894XL at the duty-free store; it was much more expensive than from Amazon, but maybe the Philipshave version will last longer. Upon my return, I called Norelco customer service; but that is another story. . . Clearly, from my experience (and the experiences of others who have written reviews), Norelco has major quality control issues. For a shaver that lists for 320USD, this is ridiculous.

When it was new, a shave only took a few minutes and boy was it smooth! Now the facial area is still done great and in little time, my neck is lack luster to say the least. It misses patches and to go back over them takes a lot of time to only possibly shave it. Regardless if it shaves it or not, I get irritation.

I have never had any problem with skin irritation, even after a 5 minute shave. And the battery is just incredible. I've only recharged it twice, and once was just to make sure it was topped off before going out of town for a couple of weeks. It just keeps going and going.

It turns out that there was a manufacturing defect (an identified defect in the printed cicuit board of the charging circuit) that has caused this problem!!

That is why I can't use a blade as my primary shaver. I've had the 8894XL since it first came out. It gives a very good shave, but not as close as a blade. But the best thing is there is minimal irritation.Thinking I could get a closer shave with an electric razor, I got the top of the line Braun. It did give me a shave as close as a blade, but at the expense of great irritation and break outs. It made me appreciate the Norelco more.If getting the closest possible shave at all costs is the most important quality you are seeking in an electric razor, get the Braun. However, if you are plagued with irritation when shaving, then this Norelco is the shaver for you. It is for me.Oh, and the razor is easy to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Initially impressed, then disappointed","review":"I was initially impressed with this shaver. The shave was very comfortable and close. And it rinsed clean! Or so I thought. I dilgently rinsed the shaver under the faucet after every shave. However, after a few weeks, it needed hand cleaning. I opened the shaver, and cleaned the the heads. The design of the shaver heads made it virtually impossible to replace them properly. I finally got the heads in correctly, or so I thought! The shaver never operated correctly after that. I struggled for quite a while and could never get it right. I finally gave up and returned it to Norelco. Hopefully, my refund will be processed soon. I purchased the Remington as a replacement. Its shave is not as comfortable, but it is adequate, and it has its own cleaning system which doesn't require hand cleaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not quite as close as my 4yr old Braun foil shaver","review":"Ok, it's a nice razor and does shave close. But no closer (in fact a little less close ) than a Braun foil razor I've had for 4 years, which I bought reconditioned.Caveat: I use the electric razor to shave my head. When I did half my head with the Norelco and 1/2 with the Braun, the Braun was closer-even if barely. The Norelco was on it's closest setting, too. Also, the Norelco's blades were brand new, and my Braun's were about 6 months old! This was most noticeable at the end of the day, when the Braun stubble was a little shorter. Also, when I used the Norelco on my face and the back of my neck, it gave me razor burn like I have never experinced with a foil razor.As another reviewer here said, change your foil and blades (for me about once every year or so) and that's the real key to good performance. Finally, it just makes sense to me that the thinner the metal between the balde and your face, the closer the shave. Foil wins!"},{"rating":"1","title":"World's most expensive disposable razor","review":"This shaver provides an excelent shave, but appears to last less then one week.

No matter what setting I use I get irritation on my neck. It is is also difficult to shave around sideburns but that is true for most rotary electric shavers. Pop-up trimmer is coarse and does not give a clean appearance. It performs very well on face I wish I could say same about the neck. The only work around for neck irritation is to use few gentle strokes of MACH3 razor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norelco Spectra Deluxe Shaver 8894XL","review":"Another great Norelco product. Gives an excellent shave, the battery charge lasts forever it seems, and it is easy to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"design flow?","review":"I bought this model for my husband, and I wish I didn't. He had problems with it, such as it would shut down before the battery was depleted when it was still showing between 50 and 70 min on a display. He had it replaced, and the second unit had the same problem. He sent it back for a refund and sad that Norelco/Philips just lost a customer as he lost his patience with this shaver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent shave but aolt of clean-up","review":"I purchased the Norelco 8894XL approximately 3 months ago. I love the electric shave that I get from this razor. There is ONE SERIOUS design flaw with this razor though. The shaved stubble (that is supposed to be trapped inside the head) comes out everywhere. My wife makes me use the razor outside, so that I don't get the shavings everywhere. It is very messy and I contacted the Norelco division (of Philips) and inquired about this. They told me that they have heard of this problem but would send me out a new head (just the blade holder portion). This did not solve the problem. I clean the razor after every use, in order to cut down on the mess, but has come to the point that I will have to try an electric foil razor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Money","review":"This razor is a piece of junk. Norelco can't seem to master power management. First charge, per instructions, created 100 minutes of power on the readout. After just 15 shaves, 66 minutes showed on readout when the unit discharged itself and left me with no power to shave with. Second charge produced 100 minutes of power on the readout but upon powering it up, it immediately dischaged again. Then, trying to shave with it plugged in caused it to automatically shut off every 10 seconds. In addition, when flipping open the head assembly for cleaning, is popped completely off the unit and onto the floor. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I bought this shaver based on good reviews, but after 6 months I still have to use a blade to shave my neck and to get close to my sideburns, so this shaver is basically useless to me. It also leaves my neck red and raw feeling. I have not had any problems with it, but I'm going to sell it and try another brand. It works a little better when fully charged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be aware - 2nd unit with battery problem","review":"Very good shaver... for a few shaves. I bought my first unit on Christmas, had it replaced due to the battery problems similar to the ones reported in other reviews here. Second unit - same problem. My idea of a good shaver (and good product in general) doesn't include dealing with the customer service, and I've had too much of it with this shaver. I was offered a third unit - c'mon...I went for a refund, these guys need to admit that there is a design flow with these units and fix it rather than keep replacing the units. I have one word for them - recall"},{"rating":"1","title":"KNOWN MANUFACTURING DEFECT","review":"April 10, 2004:I've now used the replacement unit for a few weeks, burning through a 103 minute full charge. The unit works well and apparently does not have the defective circuit.It appears to me that Norelco discovered the manufacturing defect, but could not distinguish between defective and non-defective units. Rather than recall all of the units, Norelco apparently decided to let its customers identify and return the defective units. Given the number of negative reviews on this site, the percentage of defective units must be quite high.March 8, 2004:I have had EXACTLY the same experience as the others who have posted reviews citing the defective circuitry. I'm now trying the replacement unit. So far, it works . . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for an Electric Shaver","review":"I used a Braun shaver for about 10 years, but found that I had to shave at least once a week with a blade razor to prevent ingrown hairs. I have been using the Norelco 8894XL for about a week and so far no problems or temptation to shave with a blade. The shave is reasonably close, but compares with how my beard would be about 2-3 hours after shaving with a blade razor. The thing is cleaned with water - very convenient compared to my old Braun....I am not sure about the \\"James Bond\\" part - so far no babes or fast cars and my martinis tend to be stirred.Added after a couple of months use: I have now had the razor for a couple of months. Still excellent. The ability to wash the razor out with water is a huge plus when it comes to cleaning. A single charge lasts for over an hour's worth of shaving - this is about 40-50 shaves for me. The indicator shows 100 minutes at full charge, but I haven't gone to zero yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Problems are widespread","review":"Battery discharges completely before first shave completed. However the shaving heads did feel nice for that brief time. Blue wall plug in chargers is an odd choice, it doesn't appear to match the shaver. Also it was slight difficult to insert into shaver. Should have ability to recharge in stand but doesn't. Leather carry bag is a nice touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Yet.","review":"I too have owned just about every name brand of razor including Braun. This has been the closest shave I've ever had with an electric. I've always liked the Norelco line but this razor is fantastic. No hipe here. Just a good, close , quick shave. It dosen't hurt that the razor looks good too. Cleaning it is done with the flip of the head and a quick rinse under the faucet. Yes its pricey, but no, the other models don't shave quite as close. If it isn't a Spectra you won't get the same results. I highly recomend this shaver for anyone who wants the best. When is the last time you priced good razor blades or throw-a-ways anyway?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice shaver","review":"Wow, I am truely impressed by the performance of thisshaver. You really do have to give your face time to adjustto the electric razor. After a week of using my Spectra, the shave has become easier and closer. Probably still not as closeas my Mach 3 turbo, but pretty darn good. Just be sure to keep your old manual razor around to get the tough to reach areas.(neck,etcc.))"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Panasonic, or even Braun","review":"I've owned and a Braun Syncro and Norelco Spectra, each for six months. The Panasonic Pro-Curve ES8092NC is better than both. Closer, faster shave. (I shave dry) Good trimmer. Smaller \\"footprint\\" than the Braun. Relatively easy to clean, especially when compared with the Norelco. Overall rank: Panasonic is No.1. Braun is No.2. Norelco is No.3. By the way, Norelco has problems with their \\"money-back\\" procedure. Don't count on getting your refund.Sure, it has to be recharged more often, but that's a problem only if you are going on a hike in the woods. (Why would you want to shave there?) The recharger stand is very compact and portable. Just leave it on the stand and it will always be charged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died the second day - Mr. Bond!","review":"Not much to add to the title. Bad! I see that some other people had the same problem with it. I know two days is not much, and that I am supposed to wait to two weeks for conclusions (what is the hair \`brain' science behind this anyway?). However, it worked poorly for me from the beginning. Hmmm ... good looks, just like James Bond ...On the contrary, the wet/dry Panasonic ES8092NC worked well from the beginning for a very close shave. Better than the Mach 3 - with no surprise cuts. Please check my review there. I also tested the Braun the Braun 7680, but the Panasonic was an overall winner for me. The Braun is too involved with the cleaning thing, plus $ for supplies. The Panasonic is simple to clean - water and soap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Electric Razor I've ever owned","review":"Absolutly the best electric razor I've owned. I've previously always owned top of the line norelco's.

I use it in the morning at home or in the car (shame on me) and stick it back to the charger and never pay attention what the charge status is. I recommend this product and would buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be better for the Price","review":"I recently purchased the Norelco 8894XL and had to return it the same day because the sideburn trimmer snagged and ripped out hair, instead of cutting it. The razor itself was okay, but was not nearly as smooth as I expected for the price. I had upgraded from something about $100 less and I noticed no positive difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoops! Back to the Drawing Board...","review":"The 8894XL is supposed to be the caddillac of Norelcos, so I figured I spend a few extra bucks and get the best. I currently use a Norelco and decided it was time to retire it after five solid years of good use. After reading the mixed reviews about the 8894XL I was a little apprehensive about ordering one, but thought I would give it a try. Well I should have trusted my instincts because the unit I received was dead as a door nail. It would not take a charge at all and I was forced to send it back. I think that if a product is that problematic, the manufacturer needs to address the defect immediatley, especially a reputable company like Nolerco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Shaver, but go for the Braun","review":"Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent shaver. I just cant justify spending [item price] for the same shave I can get with $100. I chose the Braun 7526 with the Clean and Charge base. The shaver is excellent, and the cleaner works excellently. If you are one of those guys who hafta have the latest and greatest, go for this. If not, get the Braun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Norelco yet.","review":"The 8894SL Spectra Norelco tops its excellent Quadra model by a wide margin. It shaves noticeably closer and faster without irritation. I have used Norelcos for years and this is clearly the finest razor yet. It is a tad pricey, but my face is worth it. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product. Defective battery.","review":"The razor shaves great, but mine won't hold a charge. I've had the product for about a week. Despite the reviews posted here and elsewhere indicating there to be a battery problem, when I contacted Norelco both online and via telephone they denied there was any problem. The solution they proposed was to ship me a box, have me ship them the defective razor, and then after processing they will ship me a replacement. I was told this will take 2-3 weeks. Given the price of this unit and the known defect, I'd expect better service, but I certainly didn't receive it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Norelco","review":"Had the Reflex Action 5885XL and replaced it with the Quadra 6886XL last year. The Quadra was horrible (a bad shave that took 10 minutes) and I recently junked it. Given the above, I was a bit hesitant to pay for Norelco's latest gadget and looked into buying another Reflex Action (it worked for me and now was only $70). Either way, being that it had a money back guarantee, I ended up buying the 8894XL - excellent shaver - fast and close. The Spectra is nothing like the Quadra and closer than the Reflex Action. Of course, a 100 minute battery and rinse-ability are good to have as well. Worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close shave. Quiet, trick shaver","review":"This is a light, shaver. Very quiet and smooth. Good attention to details. I hope it will be reliable as my 1978 model was. I switched to foil shavers, liked their shave but their vreliabiblity was poor. Norelco may now have the best of all worlds. A close shave, and reliability. Obviously at that price it was a gamble. But I believe it was a good move. It is very trick,easy to maintain,easy to use and So quiet and smooth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Early June","review":"This 23-song, 64-minute CD from England is valuable more for its historical perspectives than its quality.

But, when her magazine is bought by her ex husband she can't seem to function any longer.This book becomes a huge dissapointment at this point and painful to finish. She is no longer a funny strong character. In fact she lets herself be bullied by the ex and even \\"gets back together\\" with him while he still has a girlfriend. Yuck.

I didn't want to read it, but I had paid for it and have loved most of Howard's other novels (with the exception of All that Glitters, that shares the same problem with this story). It was offensive to women, to put it mildly. Chauvinistic, sexist Rhy is incapable of communicating (paradoxically, he is a reporter--well, maybe that is no paradox after all). Sally allows herself to be bullied in ways no human being should be. Sally and Rhy are worthy guests at any tacky talkshow, not characters in a novel by Linda Howard."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time or money -- it's unreadable","review":"This book was virtually unreadable. As I attempted to work my way through it (yes, \\"work\\"), all I kept thinking was why in the world \\"Sally\\" would even want to be with \\"Rhy\\". His only attractive feature, his physical appearance, was grossly outweighed by his repulsive tendencies to control and abuse. The author's overuse of superlatives in describing the personality and actions both main characters was mostly unbelieveable and sometimes laughable. Linda Howard has produced several wonderful books (\\"Son of the Morning\\", \\"Shades of Twilight\\", \\"Dream Man\\", \\"Lady of the West\\") and I look forward to more new works that reflect her considerable talent.

Rhys ignored anything Sally wanted, going to all lengths to destroy her career and her self esteem. Jeez the guy is a stalker- and we have laws and lawyers to protect women these days.

There's hardly any emotion about the loss of her son.I can't stand Rhy. He's an overbearing, egotistical jerk. He leaves her for 7 yrs expecting Sallie to come back first.

Linda Howard is a great author, I have read most of her novels but her earlier ones just don't deserve any attention. In An Independent Wife, we meet two characters that are just too stupid to live. After meeting the hero, I thought he seriously was going to commit murder, too abusive for my taste. As for the heroine, she was wimpy and gullible, whatever happened to \\"independent\\"?

The most positive thing I can think to say about this one is that clearly Ms Howard was practicing with variations of alpha male characters, and from the stone age Rhy's clearly living in, the wonderful Black Niall, Gray Roulliard and John Medina have evolved.I know it was the 80's, but this became seriously painful to read. It needs a disclaimer like the ones Sandra Brown includes on her reissues of early works - something like \\"this book was written in a time when it was considered romanatic for men to harass women into exhaustion, admit having married them only because they felt sorry for the poor dears, bully them into leaving the work they enjoy, and stay at home where they belong - but only once the man figures out that's where he'd like to be too\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Independent Schmindependent","review":"Linda Howard is one of my favorite authors, so I bought this book in spite of the bad reviews. While an interesting comment on what was selling in the romance genre in the early 1980's, this book screamed the message JEALOUSY IS NOT LOVE (without meaning to, I'm sure).The fact that the hero is controlling, jealous and manipulative, and the fact that the heroine thinks this was normal and loving, illustrate the need for intense therapy for both parties -- not a continuation of the \\"romance\\".I also wanted the heroine to BE independent, get a spine, leave this jerk in the dust, and get a restraining order against him.A book on abnormal behavior? Maybe. A romance? No way.I truly wish Ms. Howard had re-worked this book, not just re-published it, as it cheapens her considerable talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst romance novel ever published!","review":"This is absolutely the worst romance novel that I have ever read. Despite the usual high quality writing and editing that I have come to expect from Linda Howard, this is horrible. The male lead, Rhy, is far beyond the alpha male - he is just mean. Sallie/Sarah is so completely victimized by him that she cannot think her way out of a paper bag. It is incomprehensible that they make each other so angry but \`cannot help' but give in to their \\"love.\\" This is the type of writing that leads women to think that being stalked and abused is something normal - that they have \`asked for it.' Linda Howard should be mortified to have written this book, and Mira should be ashamed for continuing to publish it. I know that I am disappointed and angry to have purchased and read it.I give it one star because it is not possible to give it zero - or less."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst I have ever read!","review":"The book was terrible, horrible, hate inspiring, etc. Rhy is a total jerk and loser and Sally for being a supposedly self-reliant and intelligent reporter can't tell that her ex-husband (I won't even honor him with recognition) is walking all over her. When he was through with her I wouldn't be surprised if she had cleat marks down her back. Then when she finally leaves him she just convinces herself to fight for him. As if there were anything worth fighting over. All in all I felt like ripping up the book at about page 20 maybe earlier, but I have to much respect for books in general to do that so I'll just forget about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book, don't read this book","review":"I have been meaning to write a review since I read this book about a month ago. I completely agree with the many people who have skewered this pathectic attempt at romance. The relationship between the two main characters is dysfunctional at best and the characters are pathectic and annoying. The HERO is the exact same jerk that the heroine usually dumps for something better. The nicest thing I can say about the book is that it's relatively short. I wish I could give it no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her best books, but not the worst!","review":"This is obviously an early Linda Howard! She has become a much better author since this was first published. While I did not think this book was as bad as \\"All That Glitters,\\" Ms. Howard should have had a talk with her publishers before allowing these books to be reprinted without updating! She is capable of so much more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Independent what?","review":"The title has nothing to do with the story, which is about a woman who brings herself out of a marriage with a man who deserts her because she isn't 'woman enough for him.' A) Get over yourself. B) She took him back! Why? Because he's the hero? I'd call him an abuser, a poor husband, and someone she'd be better off without. Plus, she's not independent. Where's the self-esteem she worked hard for? Where's the interest and dedication to her job that was detailed in the first chapters? Gone. She goes right back to him, ruining years of hard work to bring her into a highly respected position in a newspaper company.A complete waste of time and effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"The characters are not believable.","review":"I've read all of Linda Howard's books twice yet this is one I choose not to read again. The characters of Sallie and Rhys are somewhat far fetched. Sallie vacillated between very strong negative feelings towards Rhys one moment to being completed captivated by him in another. For an \\"Independent Wife\\" Sallie has little or no backbone. Linda Howard's talent as a writer has progressed far beyond this early book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I love(d) Linda Howard. Usually, her strong characters, unusual situations and fluent writing make her books enjoyable. Unfortunately, this book contains characters that are too unrealistic, even for a romance novel. The lead female character made me want to scream or throw the book acorss the room, which I did after I read the rather poor final chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"This story reads like a stereotype of romance.","review":"It was easy to see this was a reprint, readers today would not put up with an overbearing male boss forcing his will on the heroine. Although the story has emotional impact, the amount of backstory and the demanding \\"hero\\" detracted from the effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tragedy Masquerading as a Romance","review":"This book would have made more sense as a tragedy than a romance. It is a very sad story of controlling obsession and co-dependency. Unfortunately the characters are probably all too real. It would have been a much happier ending if the heroine could have summoned the strength to leave the guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Disappointed","review":"I have read many of Linda Howard's books and this one actually made me angry. This was not a romance story at all. The male character Rhy was a selfish controlling bully. I find it hard to believe that any woman would allow herself to be manipulated to the point of being a mindless idiot. This book is a insult to any woman who has been walked out on and has had the strength and fortitude to pick herself up and build a successful life for herself. This was not a romance story at all, and sends a very wrong message to any young readers out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"I couldn't believe this was a Linda Howard story! The author draws an abusive, overbearing man and a spineless, wimpy woman as the characters in this book, then tries to rehabilitate both of them in the last chapter. Sorry, but that won't do.Spend your cash on some of her more recent books--they are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Independent Wife","review":"I have really enjoyed about eight or nine of Linda Howard's books. Unfortunately, this was not one of them. The plot is cliched, the characters are not likable in any way, and the entire story ranged from unpleasant to revolting. Even taking into account this was written in 1982, it is loaded with stereotypes and cliches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Like it!","review":"The heroine in this book is too weak and and Howard portray Sallie as a fragile thing that can't resist her husband-who's a totally jerk and too controlling. I didn't really enjoy this book. Eventhough I didn't like this book, but I love Howard's most recent books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated - why in the world reissue this dinasour!","review":"Very disappointed in publisher for trying to make this old outdated issue something brand new! If Ms. Howard has no new romance (she seems to be focusing in the hardback suspense area) please do not insult readers with this awful book. I highly recommend to all Linda Howard fans DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK - SEND A MESSAGE TO THE PUBLISHER!! Cannot stress how dated this book is for 1999 - Ms. Howard's publishers - take a hike until you either have something new or look at the wonderful backlog of series books she has to offer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Information overload","review":"Explains one aproach then rejects it in favor of another then yet another.

Some reviewers seem to think it should be a little more basic, but maybe they should have read the introduction.

(Plus, got customers like me buy this book for a cool sum.)As an exception to every rule, some of the chapters in this book are good, especially the discussion on MVC and Filters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good as a Novel","review":"This book is awesome. The one thing I truly love about this book is the layout. I had zero experience in JAVA/J2EE and after the first chapter it all made sense. I Actually make time to read this book.The one thing this book does that no other I have read is tech the low level nuts and bolts along with top level syntax and make it make sense. For instance, the chapter on Servlets rocks. It teaches Servlets on both \\"Here are Servlets\\" and \\"How to use them\\".I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to learn JSP/Servlet environment. It is a great book to learn the big picture and be able to use all know features in the technology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a beginner","review":"This is definitely not a book for the beginners.

After that the product just seemed to die. The battery would not charge; and even when plugged in it would only work for about 2 seconds and just die off.I would not recommend it unless you are ready to return it after about a month of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weightless","review":"Much like a track on the CD, the best way I can describe this collection of songs is Weightless. I cannot understand the glowing reviews of this CD--unless they are written by friends and family of the singer--but every track sounds alike. Each song has the same airy-fairy whispery vocals, set to an astoundingly similar musical accompaniment. When the singer does, indeed, break away from her breathless, whispery vocals (which is not often), she often is off-key or flat in her pitch. That may explain the breathy, soft, whispery quality of her vocals--her best delivery. The tracks are unimaginable in arrangements, altho some of the lyrics are well thought. But on the whole, a disappointment to me, personally, and not at all what I had expected based on glowing reviews. I found the CD to be a bore--maybe something one might play for background music whilst receiving a massage or a facial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to have her back","review":"If I were to introduce someone to Sissel, the best analogy I could think of is probably Charlotte Church - a little bit of classical/traditional, an early debut, and so on... and you can guess from the introduction that she might have some difficulty leaving those behind, and try to give us a different image.I imagine it might be very hard finding the right materials for Sissel, so that she doesn't sound too detached from the pop world, but still get to showcase her best qualities. For me some of the lyrics are too simple to be involving, and some of the songs could be stronger, just because Sissel's voice deserves better.My favorite song here, by far, is \\"where the lost ones go\\". The intensity of the emotion sends a chill down my spine every time. The album overall is still worth the wait - perhaps I was expecting the impossible :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most excellent","review":"I just got this CD last week. It is very cool. My co-workers stopped by to say \\"whoah what is that\\" or \\"can you please turn it down\\". Heh. If you liked any of the other Scorn stuff, you'll like this. Excellent background music for a laid back party as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"FATA gets it back.","review":"We all know the drama that resulted in the departure of lead vocalist Ben, as well as the abysmal release that was \\"Abandon Your Friends.\\" From Autumn to Ashes seem completely aware of how bad that album was, and decided to return to the studio quickly for \\"Holding a Wolf by the Ears.\\" Former drummer/vocalist Francis has taken over all the vocals, and I am almost tempted to say that this is how it always should have been. Francis does a great job handling both the screaming and singing on the album. The band has also matured a great deal in terms of musicianship and songwriting. People like me who basically gave up on this band years ago should be pleasantly surprised with this album. Not only is it their best album since \\"Too Bad You're Beautiful,\\" it is probably also their most aggressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a progression!","review":"I've been a fan of From Autumn to Ashes since around the time that \\"Too Bad You're Beautiful\\" was released. I was a little disappointed with \\"The Fiction We live\\", and I felt like they really started to turn the corner from a hardcore sound towards a more metal sound with \\"Abandon Your Friends\\". This album, \\"Holding A Wolf by the Ears\\" really took me by surprise, as it continued the progression towards a more \\"metal\\" sound. I was also surprised with the departure of their main vocalist. I don't think the drummer is as good of a screamer, but he does a great job nonetheless. I'm still amazed at how many different sounds they can display on a single album. So many bands have one good song, and then try to capitalize on it by making every single song on that album sound just like it; not so with FATA. Standout tracks for me were:1. Deth Kult Social Club2. On the Offensive4. Daylight Slaving5. Delusions of Grandeur12. Pioneers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice comeback","review":"Like many, I found FATA through The After Dinner Payback and was blown away by The Fiction We Live... so I got excited and bought Too Bad You're Beautiful, which, I have to admit, I never really got into. I then picked up Abandon Your Friends when it came out and was even more disappointed.However, when Wolf came out, I figured I'd give it a try, and I am so glad that I did. I'd put this right up there with Fiction We Live - my favorites are Delusions of Grandeur (maybe my favorite FATA song ever), Death Kelt Social Club, Recounts and Recollections, Goat in Sheep's Rosary. Fantastic hardcore album, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshing","review":"This album is definitely a far cry from anything FATA has done in the past, good or bad. If you are listening to the album hoping and wishing for another too bad your beautiful you will definitely be disappointed, but if you listen with a fresh ear i think its one of the best albums i've heard in awhile, its a new and refreshing sound. The music is faster, and much more melodic. There is actually some really technical music hear which stands out a lot more than previous albums. I think this is what the band needed to make a new start, to open things up a little bit and you can tell by the music that the band is having fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprising","review":"I'd have to agree with these reviews prior to mine. I'm not happy to say, but i havent been listening to FATA for awhile now. The abandon your friends really put my thoughts about the band down (Though there is a reason if you read up). My buddy put a new cd of FATA in the other day, i had no idea they had come out with a new album. Once i heard it i said \\"this sounds different\\", then i realized there was a new vocalist that turned out to be the back-up vocalist from before. The album blew me away, and i really believe this is the way it should've been the whole time. I really never liked Perri(former singer), and if you havent hear them yet definately take a listen. ROCK ON GUYS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Singing???","review":"Honestly, I love FATA. They are great but I just don't know what happened to the singing. There is a lot less on this album. Fran has an awesome voice and sings great but he doesn't do it very much on this album. The Fiction We Live was the album I started listening to these guys on. That is the best work from these guys by far. I hope there next album has more singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Promising to Ashes","review":"The first album showed more promise than is realized here. this record shows some increased focus, but the vocals have simply not developed along with the rhythm section, and the songwriting is stalled. There is an effort towards a heavier more agressive style here, and in that context, the vocals are simply grating, and the guitar playing pedestrian. thse giuys sound a lot like a thousand other bands playing in local clubs all over the world on any given night and simply do not have the songwriting or melodic chops to rise above. i felt the last album showed such promise, but was a but unfocused. they have focused on the wrong sound and material here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cookbook I own","review":"I have hundreds of cookbooks but this is my all time favorite.

I agree though, the drying time is much longer than Epson, Canon, or Red River papers but, the quality is just as good once the print dries.

The design is very pretty and the matching coaster is great. I like that it's thinner than my old mouse pad, roughly half the depth.However, it does not work well at all with my laser mouse. Using an optical mouse is fine, but laser tracking is poor, resulting in very uneven pointer movement (drags, skips, drags some more).In addition, the surface is wearing away where my wrist rests against it. Granted, my home setup is not ergonomic (the desk is higher -- or my chair is shorter? -- than is optimal for computing), so there is more contact and friction between my wrist and the rug here vs. sitting at my work desk, but it didn't take very long before erosion started. The rest of the rug is still holding up fine, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice mousepad","review":"My old rug mousepad was lost after many years of use and I had to get another one.

I figured it would be very inexpensive, like something I could get at the dollar store, but paid the extra for it here in the hopes the quality would be a little better. I could not be more wrong. Within MINUTES of playing with it, it stopped working/stopped making the sound that is the point of the toy. My son did shake it to play with it, but that is the point and he certainly didn't do anything particularly vigorous with it. Just a few minutes of flipping it up and down -- and now the tube has white marks on it (pink showed up which is fine, but I'm also disappointed that we could not pick our color) as if the plastic is already worn out, and while the item inside the tube will still go up and down, it does not make the silly sound.

I really wanted to like it. It had a lot of features I wanted, dual wan ports, VPN, etc. but this thing really sucks. I have 8 years experience as a network administrator, but this thing was never reliable. I had to power cycle this router at least twice a week due to lockups. After updating firmware 4 times I finally gave up. Netgear tech support from India is worse than useless. Save yourself some frustration and get the Xincom DPG-502. It has worked flawlessly for 2 months now and it was $100 cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mission critical failure","review":"I finally gave up on this dual wan router. Our use is mission critical. Whenever this router would lock up and cease to function, I would have to travel to our office all hours of the night or weekend to power cycle it to resume service. I installed every firmware upgrade for the past nine months, with hope that this time the freeze ups would be fixed. I could no longer tolerate the poor service. I have replaced this router with a single WAN port Dlink (I had to give up using the dual WAN months ago because of poor reliability), and not only does the Dlink NOT lockup every couple days, but the network speed and response time increased! I had been blaming my cable provider for the poor Internet speed, but it was this Netgear router all along. Do not purchase this router unless you want to constantly deal with the headaches that it gives."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Walks are Hikes!","review":"I eagerly anticipated getting this book as Thomas generally puts out excellent guides/books. This one did not meet expectations..not by a long shot. The four walking tours basically follow the same roads as the auto tour routes and the tours are boring hikes as such ranging from 3.3 miles to 4.4 miles each. The \\"hikes\\" come with very, very sparce narratives and a few uninteresting photos. The horrible audio-taped bus tours provide more value..and they are bad. It does not even give details on the Big Round Top loop , Johnny Reb or Billy Yank trails AND one can get much better documented town tours of city center Gettysburg buildings from the tourist center or directly off the net. As the John Archer East Cemetery Gettysburg guide/book from Thomas gets 5 stars this gets the opposite, the worst. Save the money. Don't even think about getting this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction, Maybe, NON-fiction...NOT!","review":"Funny how people will believe everything you read, unless you know the truth. The people who know the truth know this book is fiction, but of course you have REAL Special Forces with real names. ... these \\"quiet professionals\\" never asked for this, never gave permission to use their names, and some of the missions didn't take place. It's pretty bad when SF soldiers won't even buy it...(only their wives because they think it's so great having their husbands names in a book) Get Real!!!We can't blame Robin Moore.

This book is an embarrassment to SF and betrayal of the trust that SF has placed in Mr. Moore. Most all of the people mentioned by name in the book had asked and been promised by Mr. Moore to mention them by first name only and not to use their photos. This promise was broken.The Rah Rah comic book style of the writing is an insult to the professionalism of the Special Operations Community. If you want to know why Robin Moores new book is nothing more that a paste up of news clippings, his unprofessional actions in writing this book is your answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting, should be more to it","review":"This book is interesting as one of the first book that details the covert war and cubsequent victory in afghanistan. Most interesting is the sotry of Adbul Hak, the Pashtun leader who died because he started a rebellion too early. This book explores the special ops men who helped crush the taliban. An informatie, interesting book that takes us from the briefing room to the battle field, a neccesary book in the war on terror genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased but still interesting","review":"Ok, the book was very biased and it is hard to take Robin Moore serious when he writes the book like the diary of a teenage girl in love with a rock band (or in this case the Special Forces).I also find it hilarious that Mr. Moore's mysterious \\"Jack\\" character the one that shows up through out the book to do incredible deeds just got arrested in Afghanstan for running his own personal prision (see July issue of Time) and torturing people. Apparently this idiot was doing this all on his own with out goverment backing. To top it all off he was known by the media as some crack pop that would shot off at the mouth about all his heroic deeds.With all that said, I think that the book (with all of its propaganda) still makes the point of how brave the men and women are that participated in the events (even the one's that are not Green Beret that Mr. Moore never misses an opportunity to call ignorant)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was there","review":"The author is faced with a chance to write the story as it actually happened and Mr. Moore lost that opportunity. Now this book will forever be known as a complete work of fiction by those of us who were there, conducted the operations and then interviewed by Robin Moore as to what happened. Venturing too far off the path of validity was perhaps due in part to his \\"buddy\\" Jack Idema, who is referenced far too much throughout the book. Mr Idema is a compelete work of something else, just google search the name. In short, disappointing is too nice a word for the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this book.","review":"I read this book on a plane a couple of years back and am only reviewing it now because I've now learned that most of the story was totally concocted. I just finished Robert Young Pelton's Licensed to Kill, which details how \\"Jack\\" Idema--an ex-con who went to Afghanistan to track down OBL--fabricated most of this story, was able to trick the authors into believing that he was ex-SF, and profited from his outrageous, totally inaccurate story. It wasn't much of a book to begin with--way over the top--but the story behind it is pretty amazing.I would recommend Licensed to Kill if you're interested in what happened to \\"Jack\\" Idema. If you actually want to read about the Afghanistan campaign look at Masters of Chaos, First In, Down Range, and Not a Good Day to Die.Do not buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Un-Nerving","review":"Absolutely detailed and informing, but nothing like the Green Berets Robin had greater success with, as far as taking in the reader. I actually hated reading this, not since Robin has put a excellent piece together, but because this book reveals what an ugly situation Bin laden has created. As I read this, digging through all the channels from 911 to the current, I now am thoroughly disgusted with what sacrifice and drudgery many have had to travail to catch up with Laden, not to mention the acts of terror. I wonder how much Robin had to put up with in bringing us this information which I cant imagine being any more complete anywhere. If you want to know, it is very descriptive in this incredible account that is also unbiased hard fact. I would hope another book follows up on this, I hope Robin writes it. I say yes and recommend this along with SB or God by Karl Maddox that goes into a probable and realistic war in this region to include Iraq."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Book","review":"The book is really about the Green Beret in Afghanistan and the mission they undertook and the job they did. This book is not about J. Keith Idema \\"Jack\\" who has basically hijacked a book. If anyone has questions about Jack just call the Afghanistan Embassy in Washington D.C., or Special Forces Command at Fort Bragg. Mr. Idema is responsible for selling captured AQ Tapes to the Media instead of turing them over to Special Forces.I would have rated the book five stars but I removed one of the stars because of Mr.Idema...."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Hopes, Big Disappointment","review":"Considering the \\"Transformational\\" way we fought and won the war in Afghanistan, the inovative use of special forces from throughout the services and particularly the groundbraking conventioanl-unconventional force mix, I had high hopes for this book. Instead, it was a bombastic, highly subjective account of a few Special Forces actions. There was zero effort at analysis, crticism, and implications. In short, a big disappointment. I would recommend this book to a bored 12 year old, but not to any serious adult interested in the evolving nature of warfare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Story","review":"This book presents the riveting true story of the skill and sacrifice of the Green Berets in Afghanistan and how they brought hell to the enemy that delivered 9/11 to America. During the war, I found myself watching the evening news and wondering in amazement how city after city in Afghanistan was captured by U.S. and Northern Alliance forces. It seemed like magic and it seemed nobody in the media had any clue how this incredible story was really playing out. Robin Moore had a front row seat and, apparently, incredible access to the Green Berets that delivered this amazing victory and left the Taliban reeling in disbelief and ruins. This is a fantastic story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Moore Tour de Force","review":"I don't think Robin Moore has ever been in better form -- and that's saying something! His descriptions of what the Special Forces confronted in Afghanistan make Gettysburg seem like a pillow fight.

Did Moore drop the manuscript on a windy day on the way to his editor, pick up the pages in random order and say \\"what they heck, I'll just hand it in this way...a paycheck is a paycheck\\".Seems like he had the access to make a better book. Disappointing. (Sorry, Dad.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Details - Disappointing Book","review":"Although I was very impressed with the details in this book and learned a lot, as a book I found it very slow reading that did not flow well. I have great respect for the Special Forces and admire what they do but Moore's style of writing made you think he was going far overboard and exaggerating too much. Even if everything Moore says is 100% true, his way of writing this made you tend not to fully believe him.If I was related to a member of the Special Forces, I would probably feel this was a tremendous book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Review","review":"The book gives the reader a general understanding of how Army Special Forces were used in Afghanistan and a general understanding of the politics in the region. However, it is not very detailed. Depictions of battles and operations are very skim. No detailed descriptions of how units were deployed or maneuvered on the field. Because everything in the book is so general, many of the vignettes become repetitive and boring. Not for the military historian or for military personnel. This book seems oriented more towards the general public."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for non readers","review":"I thought this was an awesome book. I Was an E-6 in the Army when i read this and at the time, I was deployed to Kandahar. I often read this during my spare time and consulted a lot of the locals, and terps about everything that i was reading. When they talked about the Afghan Generals they brought up more stories and even confirmed some of the ones in the book. I'm by no means a Special Forces hooah hooah guy but i thoroughly enjoyed this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"To much information","review":"This could be a good book. However, to give out actual names of the Special Forces members that participated in these events is WRONG. These guys have families that could be in potential danger from giving out information that Robin Moore has.

I should have known from the start when I thumbed through it and read a few of the short sections in the After Action Reports. They were so wrong on defining the term of the facts ... such as the disgust of Airborne soldiers over the issue of the black beret. All soldiers assigned to an airborne unit regardless of their airborne qualification wear the maroon beret, and did before the black beret issue.

If you elect to read this book be advised that it is not a good history of TF Dagger or SOF operations in Afghanistan. It is not objective in the least. Take it with a grain of salt. His contempt for all of the other SOF units, including AFSOC and NAVSPECWARCOM assets, tarnishes the book. Maybe somebody will write a credible book detailing the history of TF DAGGER down the road.

I am not saying that SF does not deserve credit for all of the oustanding work they did. If you are looking for an accurate description of how events unfolded in Afghanistan and SF's role in them, then this is not the book for you.

I haven't needed to bring the shop vac in the house, since owning this upright. Only down side has been that the little headlight burned out within a week of purchasing. No biggy but then 6 months later when I got around to actually removing and replacing it I discovered that the bulb and possibly the wire to it had burned. No more covert night time vacuuming for me.

My single gripe with it is that because it is so heavy, I wish there was another solid handle to use for lifting it and moving it around when necessary.

I would probably not install this in a weather or light exposed area because the plastic would deteriorate, and the metal would eventually rust. I will try to amend this review after a year of use. It would be nice to have these in a bunch of different colors for oiled air, spraying air, different pressures or whatever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling Story about Canada's Dirty Secret","review":"This compelling book brings to light the stories and struggles of some of the 50,000 young Canadians who were recruited to fight in the Vietnam War. The U.S. deliberately recruited them, setting up offices in Plattsburgh and Bellingham near the Canadian border. But the Canadian government doesn't recognize these men as soldiers and hasn't provided any of the support services they should've been getting to cope with what they experienced. Consequently, many have suffered in silence. For some, the pain was too great.Despite the subject matter, this book is hard to put down. It reads like a long magazine article rather than a book. It also changed the way I perceive the men who fought in the Vietnam War. It seems that many bought into the U.S. and Hollywood propaganda about wars and being a soldier. When you're 18 years old, that can be pretty powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Horticulture/Landscape Students","review":"Dave Fross is my teacher for a native plants class and boy dose he know his stuff.

Emptying the dirt out and assembling it back together is clumsy and messy.

He never stops making hit records, and \\"Never Let Me Go\\" is a perfect example. It starts off with \\"Little Miracles (Happen Every Day)\\" and ends with a three-part melody, featuring remakes of hits by the Bee Gees and the Spinners, and finally the romantic title track.

I love that it boasts such a huge collection of classic artists all coming together for a vertially impromtu tribute to such a legend. It is clearly un - rehearsed and this is what makes it so appealing. The artists express their own interpretation of the songs and it is somewhat raw in places which provides a nice, almost commical touch. Each song is different to the original but you can still clearly detect the respect each artist has for Dylan and you can imagine the impact and influence he had on their lives and careers. Which was the whole point of the concert.People looking at buying this albmun should remember that this is a concert and although the CD is excellent, the Video (which I give 5 stars) is even better because the performances and the audience definately have more impact on the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISGRACE!!!","review":"No one besides McGuinn should ever be allowed to cover a Dylan tune!

While I don't think many people are cut out to make a living in the manner that Ron Galella does, I think it is very important to understand why he and , in fact, all of us, are protected under the first amendment. This film offers some great insights into lives and beliefs of not only photographers like Galella, but also the people they photograph.

It looked as if there was no threading in the pole for the screw to grab on to. Also, the top does not come off to refill the holder.

Sometimes we can even get one area rug vacumed before the battery runs out. Ours has found a new home in the trash.

With 2 small children I needed something to use everyday to pick up crumbs. I was very disappointed. I currently own a Eureka Boss Lite cordless which has been just OK but that I've used for four years. I wanted something more powerful so I bought the dustbuster. This vacuum is very very heavy for a cordless, weighing in at 7 pounds on my scale. My full-size vacuum is an 8 lb Oreck so I felt this was way too heavy. Also, I was not impressed with its cleaning ability. I had to go over dirt many times before it picked up. This does not happen with the Eureka. I gave it 2 stars only because it is versatile in that it can also function as a plain old handheld but overall I was disappointed and I am returning it in the morning to look for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and handy","review":"In my home I have three large dogs that constantly shed and the flooring is mostly laminate. This product is so handy. I either use it as a stick vac with the brushes running (for the best pick up) or detach the dust buster for use in specific areas. It's great not having to deal with a cord, and it's more powerful than most cordless vacs. I will use it for a quick touch up of some scatter rugs and Persian carpets, but for deep cleaning I'll use a regular, plug in vacuum. I can use it for my whole house without running out of power. I like it so much that I have one in my home and another at my vacation home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black & Decker Cordless Vac","review":"I now own 3 of the Black & Decker Cordless Vacs, and my whole family loves them.

I highly endorse this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"I am really upset with the performance of the Black & Decker cordless floor vac. The idea is great, but the vacuum is not. I used it maybe a dozen times, and the back of the handheld portion of the vacuum kept sticking to the upright portion. In essence, I had to fix the thing every time I went to use it. In it's defense, the suction was okay, and the beater brush was a good idea. Maybe I got a lemon, but I'm not willing to try it again.

The book is far too short to do justice to its subject, but that resulted from the fact that the author had his troubles. After initially welcoming him, on Yehudi Menuhin's urging, Boulanger later became uncooperative, leaving the unfortunate author to consult mostly already-published sources instead of her own then-extensive archives. He did not really have access to her closest associates either, after his initial contact with Boulanger herself. Given those severe restrictions, the author has, in fact, perhaps done better than might otherwise have been expected with his subject. I particularly recommend his excerpts from Boulanger's published music criticism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful","review":"Takes you on a trip to wonderful places.

With two simple side pockets and the team insignia at the bottom of the left leg, Colusseum has constructed an elegantly simple and affordable product that stands up under many washings.Please note that Colusseum makes several brands of shorts and this review is only regarding this type of shorts. The other cotton shorts that colusseum makes with the NCAA team logos on them are not in the same ballpark as the reviewed shorts are.

His book, and consequently, his methods, are far too rigid; the guidelines in the book are presented to the reader as if they are the ONLY way to do an audition, and if you don't do it HIS way, you are wrong. He even provides a list of songs NOT to sing. However, I believe that a successful audition is not about following a set of rules, but rather what works for each actor. A song might be overdone, but if one can do it, and do it well, then, by all means, do the song. Additionally, Donald Oliver is a pompous, arrogent man, who \\"name drops\\" to try to impress his students, and believes that his way is the only way. Do not buy into the \\"rules\\" of this book. If you must read this book, only use it as a reference. I recommed the book \\"NEXT\\" by Steven M. Alper instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider the source...","review":"As a fitness professional and kettlebell instructor I really liked Scott's material intially, but as I did more and more research into his credentials I found the majority of his accomplishments are greatly exaggerated.

The special itself, the show is show completely unedited and with some different camera angels and most of the split screen gone. Also we get the after show recordings, where Elvis recorded songs to be inserted in the US showing of the special. The the actual special with inserted songs, split screens and all is presented.

This was shown in 88 countries and was the first concert ever broadcast world-wide. I give it a 5 simply because it includes the rehearsal show, which might be better than the broadcast show. This is historic in many respects. I spoke with Charlie Hodge on September 23rd of 1977 (I'll never forget it) and asked him about the song line up of this show. He stated, and it made sense, that the 'eagle' on his outfit, the red, white and blue colors and the fact Elvis performed some American classics (many of which were not normally performed) where because he wanted to respresent America to the world-wide population. He also stated that the show was more tame than a normal Elvis show and more directed towards the vocal aspects."},{"rating":"2","title":"The King Is Dead...Long Live The King!","review":"Wow! I saw the original broadcast lo these many years ago, but with today's hi-tech wonders, this format is fantastic! Believe me or not, I was fortunate enough to have seen Elvis in person literally weeks prior to the first world wide satelite broadcast. Presley worked every January at the Las Vegas International Hotel (now the Hilton-International) doing two shows a night. My friend & I paid the high price of $15 each (includes two drinks each). In those days, where you were to be seated was determined by the size of tip given to the maitre d'. We gave him $20 and were seated at the end of the runway to the stage in a classic Vegas style sea-shell shaped booth.Now with this remastered video and audio surround sound, this will be your chance to see what we enjoyed that evening.

I have the \`Aloha' CD and I love it so I thought I would start out with this DVD. WOW is all I have to say. First off, Elvis looked great and sounded superb. His voice is really at his prime. Songs such as Steamroller and American Trilogy really showcase his vocal range.I loved seeing him interact with the audience!The first few songs you can tell he's really nervous but as the show goes on he relaxes and has some fun. During Suspicious Minds he demonstrates the moves that helped make him famous.This DVD set is a must have for any new and long time fan of Elvis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"Ordered the Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite CD and it didn't play.

Aloha from Hawaii is like watching Elvis self-destruct in front of your eyes. HIs eyes are empty, his speech is slurred, he is offkey, puffy, the songs that are not his standards are embarrassingly bad and overly sentimental. His covers of the Beatles and Frank Sinatra and others are weak. The '68 Comeback is to Aloha from Hawaii as Cheddar is to Velveeta, as an eclair is to a Twinkie, as ice cream is to Cool Whip.

D12 without Eminem actaully did a good job. THe Justine Timberlake song is one of the worst songs i have ever heard. Ludacris song could have been cool but whoever mixed that track must have been high when they did it. The only song that i thought was really pretty cool was the Pussy Cat Dolls song! I could for sure see that moving working well in the movie and it's a song that you can listen to on its own without the movie and not be bored!! All in all a pretty horrible soundtrack.

The media and parents of the victims are always prominent in news coverage but we generally just get a *statement* from the parents with their heartfelt regrets. This movie is special because we go behind the scenes with the shooter's parents and we see an in depth look at what's happening behind the scenes with them and how they slowly fall apart.

If that is the case, why did they make the charger to function as a storage place as well. It comes with screws to place it on the wall. I keem mine there all the time, plugged in.

If you didn't hang with the kind of crowd that listened to The Brothers Johnson, Parlement, The Ohio players, or The Isley Brothers, chances are you never heard many of these songs.

We couldn't believe that a ship could cross the Atlantic so fast!

I have to tighten them so much that it was difficult to open them when I got home.The cups didn't insulate very well either. The cups were so hot that you would not be able to hold a hot cup of freshly brewed coffee without using the hande (which aren't all that comfortable either).Lastly, the black plastic bottoms of the cups are not sealed so after washing, even hand washing, water would seep into it and sit there. and sometimes when you go to drink, it leaks out (yup something else to stain your shirt)For this reason, I can 't recommend getting this product, even if its on sale and is cheaper then the cost of a single decent travel mug."},{"rating":"1","title":"uneven disaster","review":"spill one...... and the half full one.

The editors of this book are not social scientists, but they are intentionally non-judgmental. However, this work seems to verify what social scientist John Gottman has found in his extensive research on marriage and relationships-- that a happy marriage/relationship simply cannot grow out of too much emotional distance and lack of shared nurturing and vision in a marriage. (See THE RELATIONSHIP CURE and 7 PRINCIPLES FOR MAKING MARRIAGE WORK.) The book easily held my attention, and gave many insights into the dynamics of troubled marriages, but exclusively from the wife's point-of-view. I recommend it to those who wish to better understand the dynamics of troubled marriages, especially where at least one outside friend/lover may be a factor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing Non-Dr. Phil Approach","review":"The subtitle of this book drew me in. The authors interviewed women who had either gone through affairs or were thinking of it and picked 26 of the stories to label A-Z to illustrate the many faces of infidelity. Each woman has a different reason for her actions and a different outcome. The authors don't judge the women, merely present their stories in each woman's own words, allowing the reader to take from the story what she will.Completely fascinating from cover to cover. Given the television shows out there like \\"Desperate Housewives\\", the topic is always relevant. Anyone could read the book, yet no two people will take away the same things. Each story creates new emotion, whether hate, sympathy, wondering why the woman ever married or despair that she would never find true love. One thing was constant, my complete resolution not to repeat these mistakes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly witten, poorly presented in True Confessions style","review":"If more sexual detail were present, this could easily make a series of stories for True Confessions magazine. That is how poorly this books reads; the stories of the women in this book are presented in template formula.

Instead, it was an easy way for an attorney and a novelist to make money. Shame on Hyperion for sensationalizing this subject in such a fashion and for publishing such trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too shallow","review":"It may be good for young adults, but I got bored after few pages. Story is predictable, characters shallow, alien races mono-dimensional...Chanting alien monsters are just funny...It lacks logic too - huge star ship has only 5 robots and one Guardian robot? Humanity on the edge of extinction doesn't make any survival plans and only parental love saves three kids? How those aliens exterminate every creature on fallen planets? Not even single surviving human in some bunker on some planet? Why Mothership better than Earth other warships?In short, this book is not worth to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did we read the same book?","review":"Started out interesting, ended up feeling like a paint by the numbers plot.

The acting is terrific, especially the sexy Linnea Quigley, and the Fonzy Award winning Tom Ferda. The toaster scene alone is worth the rental. Pat Moran works double duty as the screenwriter and the Jack-O himself!! This one was much better that Latshaw's last film \\"Dark Universe\\".. A must see!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the worst, but could have been better","review":"This is that kind of movie that is pretty bad, special effects wise, acting wise,etc. I think if they would have had a scarier monster, and a bigger budget this movie could have been awesome. I mean the director cast his son in the lead role, and the deaths were very fake looking( a girl gets her throat slit and the blood squirts for over a mile,can we say squirt gun?). The acting wasn't the best, I mean the kid's being buried alive and all he says (very flatly like he's reading) no. If they would have sold this to Dimension Films and have Kevin Williamson get a hold of it, this movie would have been great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um...Uh...Well there is some good killings!","review":"ok, this movie has both incredibly annoying actors, and cheap effects! there is only two cool things about this movie, the kiilings are cool (but not all that original) and pumpkin jack looks cool! if you want this movie, don't pay alot of money for it, its really not worth more than $10!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rent this sometime","review":"Jack-O is one of those rare films that are so unbelievably devoid of ability, it's hard to imagine any human could have constructed them. However, producers Fred Olen Ray and Roger Corman are known for taking garbage to whole new dimensions.The plot approaches total nonsense (what jumps to mind: shower scenes that appear from nowhere, along with footage seemingly cobbled in from a separate film), the characters are as obnoxious as is humanly possible, and the acting is the worst -- there is one fantastic scene at the end, where as the child is being buried by the monster, mumbles \\"No...\\" in a bored voice..All said and done, Jack-O is quite possibly the ultimate b-movie; it goes far enough off the un-artisic scale to become art again.It's a work of genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame-O","review":"I watched this movie by accident and still regret it 2 weeks later. I love B movies, but this one puts them all to shame. The plot is so weak I found myself trying to make one up just so I could continue watching. If you are a fan of actors that not only cannot act but have no heart, and a story that isn't really there watch it, but if not avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run for your life, from this movie","review":"Bad, Bad, Bad...that's what this is.

Even though I never lived through this time, I have seen movies that were made in 1960. This was a movie that looked as if it came from that time. Since the movie was made in 1995, the quality was poor. I gave it two stars instead of one because I thought it had a good story to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"leonard gets political","review":"Its an old one but a good one with lyrics that are as good today as when he wrote them"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe add a half-star for better times in the past...","review":"I only liked \\"Closing Time\\" and \\"Anthem\\" on this CD, and even those are a cut below Leonard's best work. This release gave me the feeling it was made of tracks that were not good enough for earlier albums, and someone decided to put them all one disc and get rid of them. The biggest insult to his fans, however, is to try to cover Irving Berlin's \\"Always.\\" Both Cohen and Berlin are great songwriters, separated by a generation and a World War and amazing changes in love and courtship and sex customs. Leonard is great at writing relationship lyrics, and so was Irving, but for different planets. Try \\"Various Positions\\" and his \\"Greatest Hits\\" albums instead of \\"The Future.\\" This one is just not in the top ranks of his concept releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"We cannot live without the future","review":"I just noticed that both of my CD copies of the Future have disappeared, probably gone away with my daughter to college. So I have to replace them, of course. One for the car, one for the house. The sad thing about really brilliant albums like The Future, like everything that Cohen has ever bequeathed us, is that the people who really should listen to them don't. Leonard Cohen may very well be the greatest poet of this generation, of the last fifty years. He is able to put words to gut feelings, he is able to reveal truths which we sense but cannot see. His great humility and continuing love and patience with an ever more unforgiving world are lessons in themselves. The message that Cohen is giving us in this work, I think, is that we have no choice but to keep trying, to keep loving, and to keep waiting for the miracle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was he joking?","review":"Although this album definitely has some strong tracks, overall it was a big letdown. Cohen somehow goes was overboard into his own style, and it feels like he is doing a parody of himself. While many of his previous albums are very haunting and engaging, this one just leaves me feeling embarrassed for him.Really, I'm shocked to see all these other great reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is it","review":"This is the best album of the 90's. I've listened to it hundreds of times and it just gets better with each play. Mature, musical & tough as nails."},{"rating":"2","title":"....a look back into an artist's life...","review":"In \\"The Future\\", Cohen exhibits the world weariness of a now older man who's lived life to the fullest and bears the scars on his soul. There is no message of redemption offered here, just an honest relection on the human condition. Cohen's lyrics reflect the complicated web of lives, the secret thoughts as seen through a private mirror....."},{"rating":"2","title":"A master at work.","review":"Like Bob Dylan and Neil Young, Leonard Cohen couldn't carry a tune in a bucket. And it just doesn't matter. His lyrics are some of the most powerful you'll find, and his direction is entirely fresh. Truly unparalleled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird and Wonderful","review":"This is a good CD for background music or long trips in the car. The lyrics are worth listening to without the music.

The primary reason I purchased the book was for the 20 very good star charts contained. It was not until I started using these charts that I realized that many important Messier objects were not included!Although the pictures are wonderful , and very attractive , I buy books of this type for information--not to \\"sell me\\" on being an amateur astronomer. I don't need \\"cheerleading\\". There are other books available that offer somewhat more information than this one--so 4 stars (more like 3.5 stars)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am Thankful for Children and their World","review":"I am thankful for the book.

It has been a great help in completing my course work. I could not have afforded the new book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This book is pretty awsome. It goes deep into the heart of flash 5, which is it's actionscript. This book clarify the concepts pretty good. The author does start the book with an introduction that explain the basics, but he assumes that his readers to have experience with flash before, like flash 4. So if you're new to flash 5, get the actionscript foundation or something. But otherwise, this book is a great piece of work. It would be perfect if this book came with a CD filled with examples that the author talks about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just actionscript","review":"With this book, you learn the basics of all programming languages.

I own or have read many others that don't cover the basics or the thought processes behind writing in a scripting language. Most books on this topic started out over my head with little explaination and were accompanied by buggy and/or old code. With clear and consice writing, Philip uses the first half of the book to fully explain programming concepts as they pertain to scripting in Flash, and then follows up with examples of how to implement these ideas.I can't say enough about how far this book has taken me into the scripting world. Kudos to Kerman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back, Jerry.","review":"One of the best things about being an announcer on AOR (Album Oriented Rock) radio stations was the constant exposure to great music, through the distribution of promotional albums. \\"Saving Grace\\" and \\"Take a Chance\\" were two early Jerry Riopelle collections which deserved airplay, but didn't get much outside his native Southwestern U.S. Alas, his early record company (ABC, I believe) didn't give him enough of its promotional budget to make him a contender.

It's great to have him back with such a solid effort as \\"Hush Money.\\" Buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great after all","review":"I was very disappointed with this item.

Their second album, ABC, is a timeless classic and sounds as fresh and vibrant today as it did in 1970. 12-year-old Michael Jackson's vocals explode like dynamite - full of soul and energy - while Marlon, Jermaine, Tito and Jackie provide smooth background harmonies. The title track and \\"The Love You Save\\" topped the charts but this album contains one great song after another. Michael pours his soul into \\"Don't Know Why I Love You\\", Jermaine delivers sweetly on \\"I Found That Girl\\", they groove on their cover of Funkadelic's \\"I'll Bet You\\". I could go on but that's how amazing this album is. The Jackson 5 set the trend that other pop music family groups followed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best Album Hands Down","review":"Without question, this is the Jackson Five's top album. Not only does it include \\"ABC\\" and \\"The Love You Save\\" but also amazing performances of cover songs like \\"Come Round Here, I'm the one you Need\\" and \\"I don't know why I love you\\", and originals like \\"One More Chance\\" and 2,4,6,8.

When you can't bear to put it down and you don't want it to end, it's a good book! Greeley has characters with whom you can identify, a plot that keeps you going and a setting that makes you long for those big old houses by a pristine lake on summer days uncomplicated by bumper to bumper traffic and air pollution. I read the other reviews and wonder if everybody is so uptight these days that they can't imagine just laying back under an oak tree and reading a good book - not a great book, not a great work of literature. Just a good book.

Then it just became very boring. One of the main characters seemed more interested in having sex with his first love than actually developing a relationship with her. Even his daughter told him she'd seen Jane naked at the gym, and he shouldn't let her get away----hardly your normal father/daughter chit-chat. Eventually I checked the author, and sure enough it was a man. None of the conversations in the book seemed real, and I could not relate to any of the characters. I never finished the book, it just didn't hold my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"two men, one woman, not much else","review":"A mysterious car accident claims two lives. One man witnesses it.

The mystery to me is why I'm still reading this book. It must be because the style is enjoyable. There sure isn't any plot. Greeley's style is definitely fun, but other than that I'm not sure what this book has to offer.

I like this book because it presents the introduction of a new baby as a natural, happy event. The mom is pictured breastfeeding not once, but twice and the dad is shown changing diapers, dressing the baby, strapping on a baby carrier and cooking dinner.

I assume the lack of text is meant to encourage discussion between parent and child but explanations aren't holding my 18 month old boy's attention.

Or try to listen for her on the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back With A Flop","review":"I'm a huge Olivia fan, but promoting this album as representative of the \\"mellow\\" Olivia is not \\"truth in advertising\\". The songs on this album are barely passable, with the notable exception of the remake of \\"I Honestly Love You\\"--which in my view is a genuine achievement. As someone who feels her best material was from her \\"country\\" era,this material doesn't come close to the material she did in her original \\"country\\" period. The only song I liked was the \\"I Honestly Love You\\" remake, which I suggest be bought as a single. I do believe Olivia is still capable of replicating the quality found in her original 'country' period, but this album doesn't do it. I await the day when such material appears."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Much Welcomed \\"Back\\"","review":"In her new CD, ONJ sounds as if she has never left us. Her voice is as clear as a bell and as touching as it has ever been. Her last CD, \\"GAIA\\", was a chronicle of her thoughts and experiences through her scare with breast cancer. With this new release, she has relaxed into a newer, more comfortable mode, but her phrasing encompasses all of her most recent experinces. To have the opportunity to hear something as perfect as \\"Love Is A Gift\\", is itself, a very rare gift, indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"She may be back, but....","review":"After reading the variety of reviews here I decided to check this CD out before purchasing it.

Sadly this cd is very disappointing, as the songs on this cd are rather dull. This cd offers little. A reprisal of the already overplayed \\"I honestly love you\\" does not make a good cd. Olivia is very talented but this cd is mediorce at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT NO COUNTRY!","review":"Not much to say. I think I finally have to understand that even though I love her in person and all, this CD truly was a mess. First of all, it is on a country label. It is not meant to be called country and I say it is a sin that it is under MCA Nashville. All I gotta say is, she should have stuck to pop. I give this album 2 stars still, because the songs are somewhat decent. \\"Love Is A Gift\\" is pretty good, as well as \\"Under My Skin\\".

There was major swearing every third scentence and I felt like it took away from trying to feel for the characters. (If Norah's a good girl why isn't she portrayed as one.2. Aside from the swearing there were a lot of really r rated things going on that didn't make for a good story.3.The discription of the book made it sound SO much better than it actually was.4.The whole thing was confusing. If Norah's parents have been married forever than why does she talk about her step monster in the begining of the book.5.

Third, some of the minor characters were complete cliches--the party hard cute gay boy, the promiscuous friend etc...Also, the ending (I will not spoil it for people who wish to read the book) is completely a cheat.

But You should not make light of his performance as I thought for the first time.Ormandys conducting has fiecely powerful propulsion. Although, the tones are rhythmically and brillantly bouncing. It is completely opposite to one by Charles Dutoit and Montreal Symphony Orchestra that is elegant and well-proportioned. Ormandys \\"Classical\\" Symphony is not elegant but satisfactorily excellent performance, certainly. I like his account.But, they(especially,Sympony No,5 ) has a little harmony disturbed in exchange for the powerfulness.

I was quite disappointed in it, however, because it's entirely too specific in listing the ways in which parent and child who do not look alike are still similar. I was especially put off by the religious portion...my son and his wife are not religious, nor are we, but the book assumes that the parent adopting the child is and will pass on that tradition. The book is useless for us and will be passed on to the library sale. The other book I purchased, \\"The Red Blanket\\", is vastly superior, both in text and illustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked it, daughter did not.","review":"As the adoptive Anglo dad of a now 5.5 yr old Chinese daughter this books title and description spoke to me...

So, as we all know, every human is different. My daughter did not like this book,I did. WHo did I buy it for?

But the specificity of the types of sameness \\"in our hearts\\" in this book--and even the implied requirement for sameness (\\"in our hearts we are the same\\")--make it miss the mark. What makes us a family is our parental love for and commitment to our child, and consequently our child's love for us (the latter is welcomed but not required). I don't want to teach my daughter that if she thinks differently from me or chooses a different spiritual path, etc., then she won't be my daughter. My love for her and commitment to her are unconditional, not based on her feeling or thinking like me.Ultimately a well meaning but misguided attempt that sends the wrong message."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice text, weird illustrations","review":"This book is chock full of really lovely sentiment regarding how similar we are ... on the inside...(gross paraphrase)Unfortunately, the illustrations are freakish.

She couldn't stand the illustrations, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"somehow made me sad","review":"hi, as others have said, this is a beautiful book with a beautiful sentiment about love and bonding in adoptive families. But it made me so unhappy reading it, and then of course I had to figure out why.And my thought is, that the \\"I don't .....\\" sections on each page emphasize the child's difference and separateness from the adoptive family, and the juxtaposition seems (to me) to make it seem as though the \\"but I have ....\\" sections are supposed to be in compensation. So - I think I would have given this 5 stars if the text had emphasized the shared parts and commonality between child and family, while making the differences obvious in pictures only or else not starting each page with the difference/separateness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snappy Dialogue; Great Characters","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. A previous reviewer has provided a synopsis of the story, so I won't repeat this.

We get around this by pouring the soymilk in a separate pitcher and letting the soymilk settle a bit before drinking. This way, the grainy parts of the milk are on the bottom of the pitcher.

Is it because he plays a real instrument and doesn't go on stage with 10 dancers doing their overly choreographed and tired moves? Is it because he employs a talented drummer like Omar Hakim and doesn't resort to sampled and/or looped drum tracks? Is it because record companies think all the world needs are 3 minute pop tunes you can dance to, regardless of how mindless they are?

This album has a nice mix of electric and acoustic. Morroco is a great acoustic number. The Embrace is a soft jazzy number with one of the coolest solos. The tone on the solo is awesome, even though the playing itself is nothing major. Kiss My Axe is a cool rocker-type tune. Phantom and Global Safari are also awesome songs with great guitar playing.

I keep hearing his first single on this CD played and I was like \\"Well when is his CD coming out! I can't wait to get it!\\" I really really loved his first CD. That CD helped me through a very hurtful and difficult situation but this one sounds too computerized and contemporary. I personally need that gospel feel with strong melodies. I like a little comtemporary sound but not too much. And his voice is so beautiful he doesn't need any sound effects or any enhancements what so ever. Hopefully the 3rd one will be better. I only like Praise on the Inside and Operator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not receive my Order","review":"I am yet to receive this product or the other that I purchase through you company.

Thank you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It at All","review":"J Moss's previous CD was very good. He has a unique sound to his music but it is unbearable to hear it on almost all of the tracks on V2. My favorites are \\"Praise on the Inside\\" and \\"Operator\\" and the rest is forgettable and I want to forget them. Buy his first CD because it is better in every way and it has more variety than the annoying songs that blend into one lump of annoying on V2. This CD makes it seem as if he tried to hard and the only reason there are two stars are those two tracks. I wonder what he is thinking with this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit too club for me","review":"I like upbeat praise and I enjoy many of the tracks on this CD. I like Jump Jump and I'm Not Perfect. These songs are about having a praise through circumstances and doing something proactive. However, there are some songs that even though the intention is to point to God there is way to much emphasis on the worldy aspect and I think at times the message is lost. The Florida track and Let it Go do not have the same spirit as the rest of the CD. J himself admits that the song is on the radical side. I understand that there are some songs that are for bringing people into the church and maybe these two are for that purpose. Overall, I my tween son loves the CD. If you are a worshiper you may want to pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Another R&B album in disguise...","review":"Beats, they're all right. Lyrical content... sounds like another r&b artist who couldn't make it in the secular world so they decided to try to become a gospel artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gospel R&B at its Best","review":"I absolutely love this CD. J Moss' voice is out of this world. Not many can be compared to this brotha. This a very contemporary CD, but it ministers to me. J sings about real life issues that many young to middle aged people deal with. The music is edgy and keeps you hangin' on for more. J is such a tremendous artist. He could have left Kirk Franklin off of the second track. The duet with Anthony Hamilton is phenomenol. I would recommend this CD for age group 18-40."},{"rating":"2","title":"All That Matters is the Message","review":"I seen some previous reviews, and all I can say is all that matters is the message. I really wish that we all could look past the outer and look at the enter. His message about the struggles of life and surrendering of ones self to God is the only thing we should really be thinking about. I have always been a fan and I prefer his more slower tempo songs, which are mainly worship music. He is a person that I can turn on his CD and I dont have to jump to certain songs. When it's time to praise, I praise, and when it's time to worship I'm ready. I thank God for MEN like him who do whatever it takes to let people know that GOD is the only way, and he gives you inspiration to keep going no matter what's going on around you."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"j moss has a new style of gospel music to reach the younger generation. wonderful man of god. very blessed!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Off the hook!","review":"This CD is awesome! I am a person that usually has to listen to a CD a few times before I like it, and even then I only really like about half the songs on it, but V2 exceeds my expectations because from the first time I sampled it I was hooked! I have been waiting for J's new album for quite some time and now I see that it was well worth the wait. I highly recommend this CD for people that deal with youth in the church because while it is gospel, it has an R&B feel that allows the youth to relate and want to listen to the songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hip-hop or gospel?","review":"This CD is not as good as his last CD.

Have a blessed day!! peace love Phil 4:13 from The Holy Hustla!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I DON'T LIKE THIS","review":"I do not like this cd at all. J Moss is one day going to have to face the fact that he is 40 and not 19. He has a boy group under his wings and he really should leave the HIP HOP to them. He is a real singer, and folks want to hear real music from real singers. This album is incomplete and leaves you wondering why you purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"I bought this cd a couple of weeks ago and listen to it every day.

It is well written and well-organized. I have the larger format hard copy, which shows off the 180(!) excellent photos of a large variety of both new and old carpets, and the people who make them. The quality of the photos are the best I have found among the many carpet books I've read and looked through. At the back are two informative 2-page maps showing the main carpet-making areas of Turkey, the Middle East, China & Mongolia. Note that this book is not a complete lexicon of carpets, so it is less useful for someone who wants to look up a particular carpet name, spelling, or style.

No hype, no spinning guns, no blood splattering about, but honest footwork conducted by a dedicated team looking for answers. The cast is good enough that French and Saunders made a funny parody of it and was merciless on \\"Boyd\\" the Inspector of the team. Excellent cast even in some uneven scripts that are forgivable due to the total sensibility of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Crime Investigation Show","review":"Not at all a major fan of crime series and certainly not of the past years \\"virtual rape\\" by hit series such as CSI (and its multiple off springs) I very reluctantly opened up for series 6 of the show recently. In Denmark each double episode is shown together with no commercial interruption so it actually takes a similar form of a movie (80 minutes in all).The episodes I have seen so far have been more than decent with very creative plots and story lines and an amazing ability to avoid perfect Hollywood endings, troubled main characters and interesting use of technology (forensics).For a reluctant crime series watcher like myself 4 Stars basically explode my scale ... If you are even remotely into this kind of thing 5 stars will for sure not be enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"British crime drama doesn't get better than this!","review":"Waking the Dead is a fantastic series.

In this CD Chuck brings us Joy to the World again, putting his spin on both the tradional and \\"new\\" versions--all in one cut! It is amazing. And his rendering of \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" gives one goosebumps. Even though this song is not thought of as a traditional Christmas song, Chuck makes it into one.

Though composed in the 12-tone style, it contains the same degree of lyricism and rhythmic drive that other, non-12-tone pieces have. Ax gives this concerto what it deserves- a highly sensitive performance that shows the concerto is a true piece of music rather than the product of a mechanical compositional process.I'll admit I bought this disc primarily for the Schoenberg, but have enjoyed listening to both Liszt concerti as well. Though these works are at times looked down upon as inferior pieces, Ax reminds us that Liszt opened up an entirely new world of piano technique and sound.

He has not fallen asleep in it yet so I cannot comment on the \\"bobble head\\". It has a good crash test rating. I can't say anything negative about this carseat; however, I do wish I would have purchased one with the harness system for up to 50 pounds ... they just seem to be more safe and secure (especially for interstate/highway travel). Otherwise, for just driving around town, you can't beat the quality or comfort of this carseat for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good.","review":"Just purchased this 4 days ago. My daughter is very tall for 3.5, so we no longer fit in the belts of a car seat. I had a car seat that was a convertible, but due to the bulkiness of the car seat, I have given that to my husband and I took the new seat.Great price. Easy to assemble. Fits in the car nicely. Reading lights are a great idea. Many times my daughter wants the car's interior lights on while I am driving - so we will be using these. Also, now that it's not so bulky, she can do the seatbelt herself. The other seat, she could only undue it, which wasn't the safest. It is much easier for me now that she can buckle herself in.My only gripe so far and it has nothing to do with the seat itself - is that I am not ready for my daughter to wiggle her way out of the seat while I am driving - which she pulled last night. This is more of a behavior issue, but I am thinking they should be able to design something to prevent this from happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"They left out the yellow one","review":"I love hello kitty...lol Cell Phone charms are kinda out of style but I had to have these lol.

What is this tendency for star musicians in this country like Perlman, Ax, Midori, and now Bronfman to rest on their laurels? Comparison to the impassioned live performance from Argerich-Kremer-Maisky on DG makes this version of the Tchaikovsky sound half asleep.Naturally the playing is altogether professional, and Sony has provided adequate sonics (though not a patch on the riveting DG sound). However, without total commitment on everyone's part, the Tchaikovsky Trio suffers from sprawl and waywardness, as it does here form time to time. In all, a good performance that misses the mrk for being something really special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea.","review":"This music, which I'm sure will appeal to some, left me disappointed.

The clacker must have been cardboard. I will avoid any of these plastic remakes of old wooden toys in the future. This toy is not worth the money. Even if you like it for its nostalgia.

Now, after the Clinton Scandal, I've realized that he's just a mouthpiece for the Democratic Party. He's so one sided it's sickening! I'm not really interested in the ramblings of anyone with an agenda to sell. It's obvious to anyone with half a brain that the last thing the Clinton scandal is about is sex. It's about obstruction of justice & lying to a federal grand jury, etc. It's also about the lack of integrity of the current president. Maher tries to water the issue down to lame sex jokes to take the focus off the real issues. When someone tries to enlighten his audience, he talks over them & cuts to commercial. That's why I'm not watching or reading anymore. Also, the way he slandered Ross Perot during the last election (refering to him as insane, etc.) was criminal. I think most of us wish Ross was president now. At least he wouldn't be a total embarrasment like the current president."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"While you are all busy spitting at one another, Bill Maher is probably off cavorting with Hugh Hefner and his little bunnies. Maher's association with Hefner is telling on many levels. Among them are: his affinity for the 'cool' and dedication to the depthless; his lack of meaningful personal relationships, the seed from which sprouts his warped view of society; and the maniacal influence that seems to pervade so many of his thoughts. All of that said I think that people should view Maher(and read him so that his comments can be considered naked, without the veil of cuteness). He is an example to behold. Of what? That is for you to decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good guy, So, so book.","review":"I found this book to be nothing more than an instant replay of Maher's television shows.

Bush has decreed that we're not governed by the same rules and laws as everyone else. It wasn't that long ago that Bush bashing was one of the loneliest jobs in the world.

She held me from the first page to the last. (It was for me a two day read) Her prose is so smooth I slipped effortlessly into her fictional small town and believed every single detail. The tension within characters and between characters is raw and palpable. The romance is heartwarming and felt real.

It was a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read, Good Fun,","review":"This book engrossed me from the beginning, both the characters and the locale were intriguing.

There is no new material. Practice tests are exactly the same. It is just a new cover pasted on to the 2007 book. This may be harmful to a student's test preparation because the practice tests will be easier if they did the same practice tests last year. They think they are prepared, then the actual test is much harder. This happened with my child. Does Kaplan do this with all their test books?

It has a fairly simple plot which sends the characters running around NYC one night at Christmas time - each with his or her own misunderstanding of what is going on. The dialogue is warm and witty and the actors are wonderful. There is not one bad perfomance in this film. Campbell Scott and the late Katrin Cartlidge make a very enagaging duo as they spar and flirt their way through the evening. Eric Stoltz is a great warm-hearted heel and Kelly gets a chance to deliver some great one-liners and zingers that give her character a real zest. This is the kind of small, sweet, funny film that doesen't get made that often and when they do - rarely this well. Spend and hour and a half with this one and make some new friends.

It is a semi-chick flick, but guys should like it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great puzzle for memory and motor skill exercise","review":"I got this puzzle when my son was 9 months old and he didn't really care about it at that time. Then starting around 13-14 months, he started to take more interest to this. I played with him a few times and by the fourth time, he already knew what animals were hiding behind the puzzle pieces. I was so surprised that he got them memorized that young. But at that time, he still needed help in pulling the puzzles out to reveal the animals. Now, at 16 months, he loves it and plays it almost every day. He can find and match the big and small animals together without my help and he can pull the puzzles out as he is naming the animals hidden behind them. I highly recommend this toy. The quality is also pretty good and durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy for Toddler","review":"We gave this puzzle to our 18 month old Granddaughter for Christmas. She loves it! She's still too small to put the puzzle together without Mommy but they love to look at each piece, make the animal noise and open the piece to see the baby. She also loves to carry the bucket around the house. When she's not using it, Mommy has to put it out of sight because if she sees it, she wants it! Nice bright colors and good quality. This would be a good toy for Grandma's house. I wholeheartedly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So, who's a Cajun?","review":"Brasseaux's examination of the development of the Cajun identity during the 1800s is an interesting social history, but its format leaves a little to be desired. Instead of following things chronologically, he examines changes in different aspects of Cajun society -- economic life, social class/status, political participation, crime/justice/vigilantism, folklife, etc. -- in isolation. While this does lead to an interesting, in-depth analysis of these aspects of society, it also makes for jarring reading. This focus shifts, however, in the chapter on Cajun reaction to the U.S. Civil War. According to the introduction, this was Brasseaux's original area of interest, and it shows. He does an excellent job of illuminating the general indifference to the Confederate government and the government's many attempts to draft Cajuns into gray uniforms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cajun History","review":"This is a good history of Louisiana's Cajun people.However, it only mentions the Great Expulsion fromNova Scotia."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO!

It does shred just fine and never has jammed, but definitely has an industrial-strength whirring when it's running. One major problem: the auto shutoff sensor quit working after about a month of use and now it runs continously until you switch it off. I'd rather have gotten a quieter unit with a larger wastebasket."},{"rating":"2","title":"safe product","review":"I love the safety lock feature on this shredder, as I have young children in my home. Also, the instruction manual suggests using vegetable oil to grease the cutting blades, so I am happy that I don't have to purchase a special type of oil. However, I am a little disappointed because the confetti cuts are larger than I expected. It probably isn't anything to worry about, but I was expecting square shaped confetti rather than rectangle shaped confetti."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I am far from impressed with this shredder. The automatic feed function broke the first month. Despite never feeding it more than 3 light sheets of paper or 1 heavy sheet of paper at a time and cleaning/oiling it monthly or more, it has died right before the 2 year point. In addition, the can portion is ridiculously small and the shredded paper constantly backs up and clogs the shredder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"You get less than you pay for with this.

Anyone who enters the Dreamtime with the author will be challenged emotionally to find that harmony again in their lives.

But it's hard to choose--as the entire album is truly the best. If you like Japanese music, or want to learn to like it, you cannot go wrong with this delightful sampler.

Eknath Easwaran, however, has made this scripture not only accessible, but warm and inviting. The language is lucid, though always challenging. Even more helpful is Easwaran's extensive commentary on each verse of the Gita. He modernizes this scripture, and shows how very pertinent it is in today's turbulent world. Sri Easwaran is quite likeable--very funny, gentle, and unpretentious. The Bhagavad-Gita, simply put, is a book of two choices, and their consequences. It does not have a lot of do's and dont's, nor does it lead the reader to feel inferior or degraded. This book, in short, has tremendously shaped my life, and I believe it has the power to also do so for anyone who is lonely, confused, or simply wants some kind of guidance to lead them through life.

The Gita is indeed central to Hindu thought, and yet Christians can find much of value in it. Easwaran's modern translation and commentary can help any Christian who wants to go deeper into the spiritual life and follow the principles of Christ. Over and over again, meditation/prayer and service to others are emphasized, and if you have the discipline to read and apply these things to your own life it will be renewed and transformed."},{"rating":"2","title":"THe End of Sorrow","review":"Beautifully written and inspiring.

After reading one, you know what the rest are going to say.This edition is also NOT TRUE TO THE ORIGINAL SANSKRIT. It has been changed to fit our middle class sensabilities. The problem that arrises with this is that subtle and not so subtle meanings get lost or completely overlooked.

This novel, while not as suspenseful as \\"Darkness\\" nor as tightly written as the riveting \\"Storm Front\\" (which happens to eerily foreshadow the events surrounding September 11, 2001) gives the two heroines a breather in the Eternal City. Back in college I spent a semester in Rome, and I have to say this book brought it all back: the sights, sounds, and yes - taste (I think I gained 10 lbs that fall!). The falling in love part didn't happen to me, though, and so I was happy to experience it through the storytelling of this author. A light, very romantic story, that makes me want to see the old movie with Audrey Hepburn that inspired its title. I highly recommend this series of novels!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste","review":"I wish followed my instinct and not purchased this book. It was no help in caring for my hair. Most of the information is out-dated."},{"rating":"2","title":"As my Grams would say Kinard put her foot in this book!!!","review":"Lovely book by Kinard! This book gives great pictures and Ideas of how to style you beautiful \\"nappy\\" hair! Her tips on hair care are priceless and can keep you from losing your hair with crazing suggestions the \\"unnaturals\\" will give you! Also if your vegetarian or vegan her practices will not go against your standards!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"First off, kudos to any African American how-to book for females! However, I was more than a bit put off by the numerous PENCIL illustrations in the book. I would've preferred (and expected) professional and color real-life pictures. And more step by step photos as opposed to the \\"step 3\\" outta 7 steps photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next? I'll second that","review":"I bought \\"NO LYE!\\" Tuesday and returned it Wednesday. It was not nearly what I expected after all of the rave reviews. The illustrations were limited and the sections on twists was no help at all. I bought \\"Textured Tresses\\" today and love it. There is a lot of celebrity name dropping but who cares. It is well written and provides product names, numerous illustrations, detailed how-to's and a salon directory. Also there is a section on picking the right stylist and salon that I found helpful. Don't waste your money on \\"NO LYE!\\". No lie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Than Expected","review":"Some very basic information provided regarding natural hair. Not what I expected from the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next!","review":"The author turned me off as soon as she started classifying all the textures of coarse black hair as \\"rough\\". Long winded information about locs and dreads weren't what I was expecting either. We need more information and pictures of individuals with free flowing, healthy, lengthy \\"kinky\\" black hair. When that's done, we can get to the different styles such as dreads. I hope the title of the next edition is changed to more accurately reflect what the book is really about."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was absolutly wonderful.","review":"It gave me alot of ideas on how to care for and style my newly natural mane. The book examines how chemicals are actually frying your hair. Is there any way for fried hair to be really healthy? I think not! This book, unlike many other black hair care books, gives you a scientific explaination to why some of our hair care habits are unhealthy. I have learned so much from this book. keep up the good work!!! I am truly happy being nappy."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF TIME","review":"Do not buy this book. This book is filled with simple information that you already know and even worse, it has a lot of MISINFORMATION. For example, it talks about shampoo with sulfates being beneficial when anyone who knows anything about natural black hair knows that sulfate shampoo dries your hair out. This book was a waste of my time and money. Try \\"Curly Girl\\" by Lorraine Massey instead. Visit motowngirl.com, curltalk.com, nappturality.com and happycurls.com to really learn how to care for your natural black hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Lye.. was a big LIE.. NO LIE!","review":"This book was a waste of my MONEY, TIME and EFFORT. It told information that didn't have anything to do with my 4a/4b LOOSE COILS. IF you are locked, then maybe this book is for you. It wasn't a good book and It has been sitting and I haven't used it to help me reference anything. It is not one of those books you will EVER pull out again. As a natural I am looking for books I can pull out later to help me.. THIS ONE is not IT! Don't waste your money.

My hair has been natural for about a year and a half, and I love it. I didn't realize all the damage i was doing to my hair with the chemicals. The relaxing wasn't doing anything for my hair. It would seem to be growing, and then it would start breaking off again. My hair is now more manageable,and it feels great. Thank you Tulani!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes Lye!!","review":"The book was aweful!!! A joke. It was not worth my reading or time. It has things listed inthe book that anyone with common sense already knows. A waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what i expected","review":"I was displeased with the book, I felt it focused way too much on dreadlocks.

Don't get me wrong its a decent book, especially if you want to grow dreads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very natural","review":"This book is a lye. I was expecting recipes to use for homemade products, but she instead recomends chemicals to use on our hair. Totally sucked. You are better of watching people on Youtube for hair tips."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Comback for the Dyed & Fried","review":"This book is outstanding. It is hair therapy for damaged scalps, strands, tresses, locks and otherwise damaged hair with good intentions. Knowledge is power--it discusses the history and culture of our hair, composition, its' entry into the African American mainstream, styles (cornrows, individual braids, extensions, natural hair) treatments, and care for our crown & glory. Thank you, this is a precious gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is The Book For Natural Hair","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It had plenty of examples of natural hairstyles. It also showed you how to obtain them as well as how to care for them. Reading this book has definetly encouraged me to get rid of the lye and wear my hair natural."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're not into extensions or dreads, this isn't for you.","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I do not care for the artificial look of extensions & braids, nor do I want to get locked into as drastic a hairstyle as dreads, so I really hoped that Ms. Kinard's book would offer some creative options. I was wrong. She's a hairdresser but the only styles this book presented were extensions, dread locks, and knots. As a Black woman with long, thick, kinky hair, I am still searching for alternate, creative hairstyles that don't involve chemicals, enormous amounts of heat, or styles that cost so much time and money that I'll be reluctant or unable to change them easily. But if you don't mind weaving somebody else's hair into your own, or even trying synthetic or Yak's hair, this book is definitely for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Companion book","review":"I call \\"No Lye\\" a companion book, because there was not enough useful information regarding free form natural hairstyles for my purposes. This book has much more information on braiding and locking than it does on styling freedom hair. Having said that, I still give it 4 stars because I find myself referring to it frequently. Ms. Kinard gives a lot of information on caring for the hair and scalp using natural oils and herbs. She gives useful information on the ingredients contained in commercially prepared shampoos and conditioners. I love the pictures and her writing style. As far as the care of natural hair is concerned, this is an excellent book. If you want to learn to style free form natural hair, you would be better off with \\"Let's Talk Hair\\" by Pamela Ferrell."},{"rating":"2","title":"God Bless 'Em Indeed","review":"In what might seem like to some the biggest miracle since the immaculate conception, the Go-Go's have gone and done what they've been threatening to on and off for ten years now--reunited to produce a full on studio album. Taking off where they left off with TALK SHOW, crunching guitars and girl group harmonies beautifully frame Belinda Carlisle's lead vocals--Carlisle is that rare singer whose voice continues to get better with age, and she's never sounded better. Those who've heard first single 'Unforgiven' get a pretty good indication of what they're in store for--kudos for going with this uptempo gem as the lead-off single rather than a more obvious pick, such as the ballad 'Here You Are'. Other first-rate tracks include 'Apology', 'LaLa Land', and 'Throw Me a Curve'. Those smelling a potential comeback would be hard-pressed to find a group that's more deserving."},{"rating":"2","title":"God Bless The Go-Go's for this new studio album!","review":"I loved the Go-Go's in the 1980's and this comeback effort proves they've still got the beat and the chemistry to make it work! I love the fact that all five of them co-wrote a track together. Until now, the only new songs from them were the 3 then-new tracks on \\"Return To the Valley Of The Go-Go's (1994). (Check it out if you can - \\"Good Girl\\", \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Whole World Lost Its Head\\"). Even the latest effort by Belinda, 1999's \\"A Place On Earth\\" - a hits compilation - included three fabulous then-new tracks, \\"Feels Like I've Known You Forever,\\" \\"All God's Children\\" and \\"A Prayer For Everyone\\" - (check them out, too). I was hoping for a new studio album from her as well, but the Go-Go's return was well worth the wait. \\"God Bless..\\" is a blessing! My fave tracks are \\"Vision Of Nowness,\\"and \\"Apology.\\" Yes, the ballad, \\"Here You Are\\" is a nice change of pace from five gals that can really pop-rock. Bless you, Charlotte, Belinda, Gina, Jane & Kathy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS A GREEEEEAAAAAT ALBUM!!!!","review":"WOW!! THAT IS JUST MY EMOTIONS FOR THIS ALBUM. HEARING THIS ALBUM MADE ME REALIZE HOW MUCH A GROUP LIKE THE GO GOS IS NEEDED IN THE MUSIC WORLD!!!!! ITS REFRESHING , YET CLASSIC GO GOS!!!!

GO GO GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Let There Be Another Album!","review":"After hearing and being blown away by the single \\"Unforgiven\\", I decided to pick this album up and give it a listen. This album is strong throughout and Belinda Carlisle hasn't lost her charm one bit. One reason this album stands out in the 21st century is because all over the pop drivel that permeates the airwaves. I really love the hooky pop-punk tunes that makes up this album. I have to say that this is one of my favorite albums currently receiving rotation in my CD changer."},{"rating":"2","title":"God Bless The Go Go's","review":"God Bless The Go Go's is great. If you don't have itgo and buy it now, you'll love it! It's too bad The Go Go'sare not getting the attention they deserve from places likeMTV and Much Music to name just a few but then again it doesn'tsurprise me much because even though it's the year 2001 it'sstill sad to say that there are so many racist out thereagainst women in rock.

All of the tracks are solid, and Ms. Carlisle never sounded better. There are 2 tracks that really stand out La La Land and Super Sonic Slide. Both track shows that The Go-Go's are ready to compete in the current music market.GOD BLESS THE GO-GO's!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Go's \\"No Go\\"","review":"God Bless the Go-Go's, to this reviewer, is a very disappointing effort from a band that I had held in high esteem back in the 80's. You would think that after 18 years they could have come up with better material then appears on this offering. Nothing catchy here, only retread, tired or cliched songs. I for one had been anticipating this release for many a year, but I guess the old saying is true \\"Beware of what you wish for, you just might get it.\\" And what's with all the Catholic imagery? Hasn't that already been done by another all girl band?"},{"rating":"1","title":"God Help the Go-Go's.","review":"Good Lord! What happened to this once terrific group? Their excellent, sweet voices and once powerful tunes are GONE. I don't know what went wrong here, but it did. Seriously. This is perhaps the biggest disappointment of all comebacks. Well, at least so far this year. The only bearable songs \\"Daisy Chain,\\" and \\"Stuck In My Car,\\" get lost in the dull, flat songs that make up the album. Half the time it either sounds as though they're dying right there in your CD player, or it's such poor singing, it's as though they've already gone to meet their maker. Perhaps that was where the got the idea for the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special in this one.....","review":"As a teen of the 80's, I was thrilled to see that the Go-Go's were together again. The CD jacket is great! They sound absolutely identical to the way they did back then which was good to know as some artists totally change their style to their demise. As I clicked through tracks, I was eagerly awaiting to hear something grab me but unfortunately, it wasn't there. Nothing real danceable or singable...no smash hits that make you want to play it agin like \\"Our Lips are Sealed\\" or \\"We Got the Beat\\". I think I played through it twice. Better luck next time.I still love the Go-Gos but this was a disappiontment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the same","review":"I have been a big fan of The Go-Go's since I lived in Peru. When I bough the new CD \\"God Bless The Go-Go's\\" I felt that the group still very strong and deliver the same catchy songs, and I still get the same vibrations when I heard them for fist time. It is a lot of fun to hear them, just seem that 16 yeas has not pass. Go girls!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why even come back??","review":"it's hard to believe it is 2001 especially after you listen to this album?The Go-Go's are still going for the Female Beach Boys Formula in Hopes of that Hit.i can still hear echos of \\"We Got the beat\\" here.it's the same basic formula that worked wonders for them in the 80's but someone needs to tell them that was cool then but a Good Retirement Party is a Must.take the Bangles back with you unless you are only gonna play Hits??the Arrangements&predictable Instrumentation is all here&it wasn't Missed by Me.it was cool in the 80's but unless Puffy or somebody else's Rips them Off they are best left back there to me.nothing has changed then or now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blessed or Damned???","review":"Folks, there is clear reason why used copies of this CD now sell for 80 cents here on Amazon, and why the Go Go's other CDs which are literally decades older still sell for far more $; quality! There are two, maybe three decent songs on this whole release, but nothing to get too excited over. One of these decent tracks \\"Apology\\" actually sounds like Carlisle solo - clean, pretty and sterile adult contemporary. Almost zero interesting gtr solos, bass lines or drum fills either, what a drag. As a fan of the band I really wish they never released this, as it's like a black eye on their once unblemished musical reputation. My advice is to avoid this one at all costs and instead, stick with their excellent trademark 80's material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brains Turn To Sand","review":"When Belinda Carlisle was a yoot she was iconoclastic, opionated, and articulate. The Go-Go's wrote passionate songs with interesting lyrics. Now that they have gotten old they retread every musical cliche they can accentuate and write song after song spouting every cliche shoved down our throats. Why is it that the people who spout the idea of personal responsibility have the most to be sorry about? Why is it that the people that claim the most freedom are the biggest sheep? Why? Because the system is set up to wear down the brains of anyone that every had an ounce of rebellion by tearing them down until there only hope for salvation is some fairy tale. God Bless The Go-Go's!!! Zeus Bless Me!!! If you want to behave responsible and have any freedom from aversive controls stay away from this crap and start questioning the system. The only way to avoid manipulation is to understand manipulation. CD's like this are the Enemy! Complete Crap!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Eighties...Uhhggggg!","review":"When I think of the musical wasteland known as the eighties, I don't have to go any further than the go-go's to find its essence. Having no idea how to play their instruments, write a song, or vocalize, the go-gos' shooting stardom highlights the joke played on the music buying public of that era (n' sync is currently perpetrating this crime). From the gag of the go-go's to the syntho trash of duran duran, almost every band that made it on the pop charts in the eighties provided the burgeoning MTV generation with mind-numbingly bad music.This album represents an amazing phenomena from a bunch of forty-something hacks. After twenty plus years, they still can't play, sing, or write songs of substance. They were awful then, and they are still awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Eighties...Uggh","review":"When I think of the musical wasteland known as the eighties, I don't have to go any further than the go-go's to find its essence.

And, invoking the Deity with the religious artwork is just ironic, because it seems they were anything but blessed in the songwriting department as this blast of musical energy was being conceived. An extra star for the energy though! There are still worse things to listen to by far if you happen to be...er...stuck in your car."},{"rating":"2","title":"They still have the beat","review":"The latest release from The Go-Go's is excelent.They really prove that they can still rock like they used to.The songs are all excelently written.Belinda's voice is still excelent.This is still the fun catchy songs that we all know and love with a modern day twist.Songs like \\"Unforgiven\\", \\"Apology\\", \\"Automatic Rainy Day\\", and \\"Sonic Superslide\\", are simply excelent.I hope the girls stay together for a long while to put out more excelent CD's like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah!! The Go-Go's are back!","review":"Six years ago the Go-Go's teased us with 3 great new songs on their anthology cd \\"Return to the Valley of the Go-Go's\\" -- then they split again and I lost all hope of another Go-Go's record. That is why it is such a special pleasure that not only have the Go-Go's recorded a fourth album (finally!), but that they've recorded a GREAT fourth album! Everything seems fresh and fun again with instant Go-Go classics like \\"Unforgiven,\\" \\"Throw Me a Curve,\\" \\"Automatic Rainy Day,\\" and \\"Stuck in My Car.\\" Musically, the girls have never sounded so self assured. The real surprise, though, is Belinda Carlisle. Although I've always loved her despite a tendancy to get a little Chipmunk-ish on her vocals -- Belinda is in great voice, and takes command on each track like never before (including her solo records). Overall a great record that's fun to listen to.

But I tried this reunion comeback album and despite listening to it a few times, it just refused to grow on me and I ended up trading it in towards something else. I think the ladies are fine instrumentalists and Belinda Carlisle has a great voice, but the problem with this album for me was the material just didn't grab me - it didn't break any new ground for them. Maybe next time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one GREAT album","review":"When you listen to this album you get the feeling that it came out immediately following Talk Show instead of 17 years later! The songs are as great as all of their old material. You needn't worry that the girls have lost any of their abilities or talents as they have aged because this album is fantastic. For me the only low point is the song Here You Are, but that is only because it's a ballad and I like it best when these ladies rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only way to go!","review":"Been playing piano for about 50 years, learned with JT and so did my mother.

It is too bad that his talent was somewhat unappreciated during his lifetime. The books covers all aspects of Shaw's life, the good and the bad times. He was a tremendously talented, complex man but he was also a genuinely good man. He was lost to us much too soon and I will always miss him. For those who believe this book to be harsh on Shaw, I can only say \\"Read the John French book on Shaw\\". It is a terrible, nasty account of things through French's eyes. It also is an obvious attempt by Fench to make Shaw seem unstable in order to cover up his poor job as a manager of his career. French should be ashamed of himself. Do yourself a favor and appreciate the \\"..More Than a Life\\" book. It is the truth and you can get a real feel for all the talent we lost when Robert Shaw died. He was and is always remembered fondly by his fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"despite harsh portrayal shaw appears as artistic genius","review":"Having been a fan of Robert Shaw since seeing The Deep as a boy with my father and having read articles about him, I was rather dissapointed with the way his biography was written. It is often harsh and even demeaning at times. The authors appear to me to go out of their way to exploit the faults of the man, however one is still left with the impression he was an artistic genius. There was also very little time devoted to his experiences in Jaws and other movies which would probably be entertaining. The authors also spend a large portion of the book seemingly drawing their own opinions of Shaw. I am hoping to find another book on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book conveys the complexities of the man.","review":"Because Robert Shaw wanted to be remembered more as a writer than an actor, I was delighted with the indepth discussions about his literary works. They gave me insights into his writings that I may not have understood otherwise. The book also vividly portrays the many, often conflicting facets of this complex man. The authors seem to have researched their subject thoroughly, including interviews with Shaw's family, friends and colleagues. Although in many places they seem to focus on his problems, they are also quick to point out his strengths as well. My biggest complaint with the book isn't the writing, but the proofing and typesetting - both make the text difficult to read, particularly near the beginning. I can only imagine what Mr. Shaw would have to say about that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great final aria collection","review":"Bjorling's last collection of arias is definitely his best single disc. Not only is the voice still great, the Decca recording is the best sounding disc of his career.The arias and Cavalleria excerpts were recorded in Florence in 1957. The Ingemisco and Lehar aria were recorded in Vienna in 1960.The late 50's was the best time ever for tenors(Corelli,Del Monaco,Bergonzi,Di Stefano,Tucker,Gedda,Vickers) but Bjorling's talent and versatility really put him ahead of the rest.

Often when you buy a tool or appliance that has more than one function you get a compromise that does neither task well. In this case, the blender works great, just as my old HB blender did for 20 years. However, whoever designed the food processor attachment didn't test it out enough in the kitchen. The ends of mixing blades are a good half inch from the sides of the bowl, when mixing or chopping anything but pure liquids, all the food gets moved to the sides of the bowl and out of the way of the blades. I had to continually stop it and scrape the food back into the center only to have it spin to the sides unchopped again - totally useless! Also shredding cheese nearly brings the slice/shred blade to a stop.

All the Andy Hardy movies were personal projects of Louis B. Mayer and his hand is all over these movies. The Andy Hardy series was the role of Mickey Rooney's career. When are we going to see on video or DVD The last Andy Hardy movie?. The 1958 Andy Hardy Comes Home.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"enchanting and atmospheric","review":"I adored the beginning of this: 2 young French girls, Anna and Francoise, are driving through the countryside and decide to spend the night in an abandoned cottage. The music, location, dialogue and cinematography are excellent. Then Anna disappears. The film loses its magic soon afterwards and I ended up fast forwarding a lot due to boredom. But still, you should watch the beginning. I've never seen anything like it. A treat for the eyes and ears :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy!

This is an almost 900 pages book. Great pictures, maps and also very nice text. Pressed in very high quality paper also, what makes enormous difference for a distinguished coffee table book.This can be compared, without mistake, to the best reference books on the subject, such as oxford companion, the world atlas of wine, the winw bible, etc.It can be usefull for beginners but i believe that if you have a previous wine knowledge, you are the main interested by getting this.Mandatory work for any person who wants to have a complete library of the wine subject. I would definately recommend it and aiming to give as a gift to the closest friends"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome class, this is Spanish for 100.","review":"An infusion of instrumentation lays the ground for the overlying vocals as Spanish for 100 continues to reach audiences. Whether it is their similarities often noted to such bands as Modest Mouse, or just their own sense of uniqueness, this band enthuses.And although the album is not that full in a capacity sense, having merely six songs, the band displays their aptitude to play live, or to develop in studio. Hey, sometimes it takes a little to do a lot, and I think Spanish for 100 has taken Metric and done a fair amount."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great retelling from Scholastic books!","review":"A favorite from my childhood, this vivid retelling of Gaston Leroux's 1911 novel is exciting and spooky, but not too frightening for younger readers. While it deviates greatly from the original novel, the core of the story is essentially the same. It delves deeply into the Phantom's personal tragedy as he is mocked and hated by humanity because of his hideously deformed face. Full of great photos from the Lon Chaney, Claude Rains, and Herbert Lom film versions. Beautiful cover illustration of Lon Chaney as the Phantom. A great introduction to classic horror for younger readers...highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay...","review":"Well, this book was highly disapointing. I am aHUGE Phantom Phan and I absolutely love Erik, lol- but this book had a terrible portrayal of Erik.I hated how they described Erik. Erik was describedas more evil and selfish rather than loving towardsChristine. He lusted after Christine, rather then loved her. This is definitely not Gaston Leroux's version!I have many Phantom books - this one, I have to say, is myleast favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous...","review":"Buy this if for no other reason than to hear Cheryl Studer sing as she was intended to sing.

Sarah our 2-year-old did not do well with the advice given in those other books. The step-by step advice given by Dr. Fleiss worked like a charm. She is now sleeping through the night.

Not my cup of tea! ...If you co-sleep with you baby, used no drugs in your delivery, Breast feed for over a year, and have a big hang up about wanting to prove that your way is the right way then by all means this book is for you. Otherwise look elsewhere. I have purchased 5 or more books on sleep problems (this one by far the biggest waste of money) and still have yet to find a perfect one. Sometimes they just have to out grow it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I have an eight-month old son who has never slept through the night, so I have read many books on this topic! This is by far the least helpful. Everything Dr. Fleiss says (aside from his ludicrous claims about circumcision) is intuitive, but he does not offer one single bit of useful information about how to help your baby sleep through the night. I already knew that my baby shouldn't be left to cry it out, breastfeeding is best, smoking is bad, etc., etc. These are not \\"a pediatrician's secrets,\\" as the book claims - they are obvious. However, they do not address the issue or help exhausted parents. If you are looking for practical advice on helping your baby sleep, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful at all","review":"I was looking for a book with objective information on how to get an infant to sleep through the night. I was looking for a book with comparisons of the different methods available.Instead this book promotes a liberal parenting style rather discussing solutions to sleep issues, ie. co sleeping is a good thing, how a loving enivornment is helpful.Very disappointed in the amount of useful information provided."},{"rating":"1","title":"duh!","review":"This book was SUCH a disappointment!

The first group eats lots of whole grains, worries about their child's aura and the alignment of their chakras. The second group works, pays taxes, and tries to live their lives. If you're in the chakra crowd you'll love this book. It has lots of feel good/new age garbage. The down to earth crowd (like me) found this book only fit for starting a fire.

If you want real help try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last a great sleep bible!","review":"This book became the \\"sleep bible\\" of a birth class I attended when I was pregnant with my son, who was born five months ago. We really liked it because it gives extremely helpful and basic advice on how to help your child to develop healthy sleep patterns, basically how to recognize the signs of sleep in a child before they get to the screaming, red-eyed, exhausted state. It helped us first time parents understand how to respond to our children's needs in a responsible, sensible, and informed way.With this book, we were able to help our son develop a great sleep pattern, by watching him and understanding when he needed to sleep, and the importance of naps and sleep to his health and attention span. I think I highlighted the entire book with a pen! I am so glad I read this book BEFORE I gave birth to my son. We are able to protect him from the routinely inflicted hospital traumas that make sleep difficult for young boys. A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel good book but no sleep answers","review":"If you are looking for a book that will make you feel better about Attachment Parenting (breastfeeding, co-sleeping, responding to your baby's every cry) this will provide lots of reassurance.

I'd look to The No Cry Sleep Solution: Gentle Ways to Help Your Baby Sleep Through the Night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality product","review":"My strong recommendation is that you purchase this product if you are looking for a sturdy, ergonomically-designed, and relatively inexpensive device to increase your grip strength. I purchased the product to help increase my grip strength with an axe for wood-splitting. It has improved my grip tremendously. I am certain that you will be happy with this product. Also, I suggest that you review the comments from other buyers with a critical eye. Grip tape will only be needed for some people at the higher settings. For everyone else, it is not an issue. In other words, don't let that complaint deter you from buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"6 month review","review":"I've purchased the ivanko gripper 6 months ago. After reading reviews between ivanko and CoC grippers, I decided to go with Ivanko primarily because of the cost and number of different settings (approx 50).PROS- 50 settings for $36 + S/HCONS- large size requires one hand to stabilize while other is gripping- grip is slippery- size does not allow for easy travel or use in a car, etc.- package did NOT include any information on the settingsi called the 1 800 number on the paper in the package and the company rep did not have any infoi had to do a web search to find this on a grip board.After six months of use I sold this item and purchased the CoC grippers (trainer and size 1).Just received them and the quality is exceptional.Handles have a rough texture so there is absolutely no way of slippage.I personally do not recommend the ivanko and would recommend spending more money for the CoC grippers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrring","review":"I have four other Wiggles videos and this is by far the most boring video we own.

I read this as a book and was touched, but I was not at all prepared for the impact seeing the movie would have one me. The performances were riveting. This story was raw and touching. It adapted well to screen and is definitely one I'll buy on blu-ray for my personal collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie was very suspenseful and graphic.","review":"This movie was about an American New York reporter who was currently in Cambodia with his native friend. They were both exposed to the very brutal and cruel ways of the Khmer Rouge after they over threw the former president and showed exactly why this movie was called \\"The Killing Fields\\". This movie provided very vivid images that went along with the storyline, and although they were graphic they helped to show exactly what was going on in Cambodia in the mid 1970s after the Vietnam War. This movie was very realistic because it was based on a true story and it made you feel as if you were actually there. It was a good movie over all and it is really worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"A painfull but very moving story","review":"I can't attest to the accuracy of this story, but the movie has the feeling of truth. Pran's story is one of utmost horror, yet he survives somehow with his dignity and humanity intact, a miracle in itself. The American ,Sydney, (Waterston's character), is not let off the hook, by himself or the film's makers, for his fault in Pran's suffering, but his redemption and Pran's are a joy and a relief to watch. The movie is about the horrors of the war in Cambodia, and it does not avoid a realistic portrayal of such, but it is also ultimately about friendship and forgiveness. Without this very personal element it would not have the emotional impact I feel every time I watch it. All aspects of this film a near-perfect; the performances, the cinematography, and the pacing are superb. Although it is often very painfull to watch, it's also a joyful experience. May Cambodia only rise to her former glory, her people deserve it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sobering view of a to-be-forgotten-conflict.","review":"The Killing Fields reminds us what atrocities human biengs are capable of but also the resilience and strength of the human spirit. The casting for the film was perfect and the soundtrack complimented the film perfectly. Mike Oldfield created a soundtrack that reflected the mood of the movie and the orchesteral arrangements brought the scenes alive while not detracting from the performances of the actors. I feel the scene where Dith Prahn finally sights the Thai refugee hospital is a very powerful one and I feel will stay with me for the rest of my life. The Killing Fields is a great film and moved me so much as to conduct a school project on both Schanberg and Prahn. A must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Liberal Version","review":"Sam Waterston, one of my favorite actors, does a fine job. And the depiction of the hellish conditions of Kampuchea is excellent. But the movie is mistaken for blaming the U.S. for the destruction of that unlucky nation. The Khmer Rouge did that on their own, with the savagery of Mao's Cultural Revolution as their primary example. Saying that the U.S. was responsible for the actions of Pol Pot is like blaming the policeman for trying to stop the murderer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing Message","review":"This was a very moving movie and I couldn't turn away. However, the political message was bizzare. Sydney rails against the USA for its efforts in Cambodia and the bombings. But the USA was trying to stop the Communist KR from taking power. The ensuing horrific blood-bath is the consequences of the Communist KR taking power. So naturally the outrage should be focused on the Communists. If anything, the USA could be criticized for withdrawing and NOT bombing the Communists more extensively. Then the movie ends with John Lennon's love-letter to communism, \\"Imagine\\" Very confusing political message indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not view","review":"I can not review this item since I could not view it.

I guess I am stuck with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This film hasn't been sent to me yet.","review":"This film hasn't been sent to me yet. I'm still waiting to get The Killing Fields. What's the hold up? Please send immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving","review":"After speaking with a Cambodian friend who went through this experience and hearing his stories, I felt compelled to watch this. It was very moving. It helps illustrate the extent of man's cruelty and depravity, uniquely human capabilities that are not at all humane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dramatic and Powerful Stuff!","review":"This movie is an emotional powerhouse, it's climax with John Lennon's Imagine can drive anyone to tears. The film has a documentary feel, (because the director was a documentary-filmaker), and that adds to the realism. It has many harrowing scenes of violence and senseless massacre, but is it ultimately rewarding and emotionaly satisfying. I recommend this movie to drama fans. Great movie, see it. It packs an emotional wallop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality DVD version","review":"Obviously this is a very powerful movie. Unfortunately, the DVD mastering is one of the worst I have ever seen. The VHS version is the only way you will be able to enjoy this movie. The sound of the DVD slowly fades between different levels of what I would call \\"barely audible\\". If you insist on buying this DVD be prepared to sit very close to the television with the volume turned up completely. You will still miss subtle dialog."},{"rating":"2","title":"A war of disaster which created tremendous bloodshed.","review":"The Killing Fields, introduces the horror that the Cambodians experienced when Khmer Rouge troops invaded their government. Close-up reports on the war was written by an American, Sidney and his Cambodian side-kick Pran. The film contains real images of war, and horrible scenes of flesh rotten skeletons, blood and disgusting sights. This movie is very educational and interesting to watch, but not on a full stomach!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most important films ever made","review":"The Killing Fields is one of those all too rare movies, a movie that challenges you to think about what you have just witnessed on screen, a movie that has the power to make you very aware that human tragedy and persecution are very much with us today. That said, the film concerns one man's triumph over unbelievable tragedy and adversity. The cinematography is first class, and the acting is all too believable. To appreciate the full enormity of this film I would strongly recommend reading up on the events with which the film is concerned. This film is hard to fault, and the ending with John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" in the background is perfect and may well reduce you to tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is Awesome!!","review":"This is probably one of the best Vietnam movies I've ever seen. To go through the pain and determination of Dith-Prang is so amazing. I felt the movie protrayed the gravity of the situation turned toward Cambodia in a very tasteful way, but also being powerful enough to reflect the actuality of cruelty and depravation instilled on its people. Sam Waterston was excellent as Shaumburg and brought out what was probably the true feelings of the man through the experience. I've watched this movie 4 times already since I bought it, and it still evokes the same emotions within me each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"WELL DONE AND FACTUAL","review":"I was recently in Cambodia and visited the sites and museums (and the piles of skulls) of the killing fields. It always makes you aware of how thin the veneer of civilization really is when you consider Cambodians killing fellow Cambodians - according to the official count 1.7 million of their own people. The other reviewers thoroughly covered the plot of the movie and it was certainly deserving of three Academy Awards. This film will never be forgotten nor should it be. The film, and countless books, tell the story to the world about what the Cambodian people endured during the Khmer Rouge period. Shocking and definitely true-to-life drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:An intelligent look at the atrocities that occurred in Cambodia and their effects, The Killing Fields is consistently interesting for 140+ minutes (no small feat), features great performances by Ngor and Malkovich, and ends in a wonderful catharis (though one marred slightly by the inappropriate use of John Lennon's Imagine); trounced by Amadeus at the Oscars, The Killing Fields is probably the better film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Even Close","review":"The movie was good but not even close to what I experienced.

The tempo of each song flows into the next keeping even the slow dramatic tunes lively. From the opening number, \\"Forecast Blues,\\" there is a Down South funkiness that starts one's foot to instantly tapping. With funky songs like that and \\"Blues Thang,\\" to lighthearted whimsy like \\"Too Many Hats\\" and \\"Honey Lovin' Gumbo,\\" the entire CD soundtrack offers something for everyone. First time that I played this was like heaven. Sandy has a blues voice that truly stamps her as one of the most unique and memorable talents to come along -- this is especially evident with all of the \\"copy cat\\" sameness to most of American music these days. I must have played this CD to death the first 2 weeks that I had it. But, as much as I've played it, it draws me back like a good hot cup of Joe on a cold winter morning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IMPECCABLE!","review":"John Williams demonstrates his incredible technique, plus his strong control of the guitar in this CD. I also recommend the video, especially for those who have never had the pleasure of attending one of Williams' concerts. If you want to explore the \\"Segovia School\\", then Williams is your perfect choice, since he was one of Segovia's favorite students--and most successful. The repertoire chosen here is a \\"master class\\" in itself to aspiring guitarists of how to develop a program for a concert and/or CD. Great choice also for someone who just wants to listen to beautiful guitar music as they eat a gourmet dinner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!!","review":"John Williams shows, once again, his dominance of the guitar.

I was first introduced to the collection on a public TV showing of the artist in concert in Seville. The architecture of the Alakazar (forgive my spelling) caught my attention first as I was channel flipping, and the wonderful music kept me riveted to the set. Although entirely of the \\"classical\\" genre, the collection is quite eclectic, including Vivaldi, Bach, Scarlatti, and Albeniz among the composers represented. Playing this CD always makes me want to get a guitar and take lessons!"},{"rating":"1","title":"C R E E P Y ! (but flawed)","review":"Gargoyles was probably one of the creepiest movies of its era, and would probably be the best it could be except...the chase scene with the kids on motorcycles...watch the police car...it changes from Chevrolet to Ford then back again. When the film editor doesn't know the difference...that's when the mistakes occur."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the perfect \\"campy\\" movie for a lazy Saturday eve.","review":"Although the goofiness and horrible storyline of \\"Gargoyles\\" makes any thespian cringe in terror, the movie itself has spawned many a loyal watcher (at least, two that I know of -- my father and me -- but there are probably more...) I recommend this movie if you're an MST3K fan -- or if you're sick and tired of the \\"Platoons\\" and \\"Titanics\\" of this world. It'll take your mind off the seriousness of real life, if only for a couple of hours. Popcorn, cocoa, and laughter are required."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New Here, Really","review":"I do agree with other reviewers that this is a good quality DVD visually. Certainly the colour is truer to form than other releases have been and the usual problem with NTSC DVDs played on PAL machines, the blurry picture, has been overcome.However, I bought this edition for the commentary from director Bill Norton. Sadly, there isn't that much commentary and what there is deals with matters obvious to anyone who can freeze-frame the credits and check the IMDB. The only thing in the commentary of note was that Bill Norton is 67 but sounds about 27.If you already have a copy of Gargoyles on DVD, this one takes up room on your shelf for not a great deal extra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilarios B-Movie -- Fun for a Group","review":"We used to watch this movie in college, and make fun of it (especially the 15 minute dirtbike chase scene, that ends with a visibly purposeful wipe-out).

Along the way, their family learns not only geography and history, but gains a sense of what is important and what matters.In a \\"Was it worth it?\\" epilogue Cohen believes it was in fact worth it.

Too many liberties were taken by the writer(s) in terms of setting dates for the fulfillment of some of these prophesies. The production value is poor and the long drawn out filler scenes, such as the one at the beginning where a false prophet is chased down on foot for what seems an eternity, are boring and detract from the message of the film.

Watching this movie shows how much the world has changed in 23 years. It also shows how heavily current culture and society flavor intrepretations of biblical prophecy.Some parts of the film are forward looking (cloning is mentioned long before there was a \\"Dolly\\".) Computers are identified as a way to control the masses--and that may yet come to pass. However the film doesn't see the Internet and the personal computer revolution.The cold war, Russia and the fuel shortage of the early 70's figure heavily into the film's predictions of the immediate onslaught of the seven-year tribulation period. (Which the film boldly states will begin in 1982.) Opps!As a period piece, this film is interesting. It also gives pause to think about prophecies yet to come to pass, but watching it is like getting into a time machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"I bought this DVD hoping that would have events that would be closer to our times, since the description did not say the year of production, I just based my decision on the summary in the back of the case.

I liked maybe 9 or 10 of the 12 stories. If you read the book, a story that you should look out for is Spring Heeled Jack. It was about an insane creature who hopped around killing women.

The guy is the closest thing to Jimi Henrix I have ever heard. Obviously, we all know he is grossly underrated.I would advise anyone who loves music to watch this and see a real player in action.

He is definitely the best guitar player in rock and roll history. Stevie Nicks never disappoints and delivers twirls, shawls, magic and enchantment!

They do shake violently though if you walk too fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"wheels fall off","review":"The front seat is small, and the sun shade for the front seat is also small. The tray broke after only a month of use, but the worst was the rear wheels falling off. My husband was able to fix it, and it worked okay for a little while. Now however, the rear wheels shimmy and are cockeyed -so I never take it for long distances (in case they fall off again and I have to carry both kids). I'd look for another another stroller...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't take me too!","review":"This stroller is horrible. I received it as a gift when my baby was born last year(his older brother was 1 1/2 at the time). After only 2 months the back wheel kept on falling off. We returned it, but the store would only reward even exchange and not store credit, so we were stuck with the same one again. This time the tray and wheel both broke after 3 months. After our second return we thought maybe they had improved the wheel mechanism because it was slightly different when putting it together. It worked again for about 3 months until the whole metal axle in the back snapped and the wheel fell off. We took it back to the store one last time and received yet another new stroller which sits in our garage unopened in the box. Store credit would have been much more valuable because we ended up purchasing a totally different stroller with which I am fairly pleased.Three strikes and you're out evenflo. I will never purchase and or reccomend one of your products again."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE!","review":"My then husband and I thought it'd be a good idea to get this stroller because it was less than $100 at Target and Walmart, so we figured, go for it! We were going to So. Cal for the weekend and figured it'd be great to have to go around Disneyland. Ooooh goodness, no! It was heavy with my kids in there, and they aren't that heavy - my son was practically a newborn at the time and my daughter was 2 at 19lbs (she's petite). We thought it was just because we used the stoller a lot during the trip we'd give it a rest, then we started using it regularly and brought it with us the following year back to So. Cal. The wheels started bending over when my daughter sat down, it started getting harder and harder to steer... To me, it WAS worth the cheap price. DO NOT GET...

Definitely worthy of sitting on my B grade DVD shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Devils Rain","review":"I saw this movie many years ago and I still love it! The plot and dialog are great with plenty of suspense. The bodies melting into a gory mess can upset the hardest stomachs. The special effects are also great for a movie from this time,(1975). Young actors like William Shatner, Joan Prather and Tom Skerritt do a good job in this film. Excellent seens of witch-craft and Satanic worship strengthen the stories plot. Very entertaining, even for this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another trip back to my childhood fears","review":"This is another in a line of movies I have bought and watched lately that I used to watch on the late night movies that C.B.S. used to run every night. I was surprised to find that time has been very kind to this one.Long ago the book of the souls that had been claimed by Satan was stolen and he wants it back. The family that has it is in trouble now. With an all-star cast this little horror movie is more fun than it should be. Not great but I found myself getting into it all over again. If your old enough to remember it then I think you would enjoy it again, as for younger horror fans, I don't know you might like it but probably won't so rent it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"When it Rains, it Pours","review":"This is a decent horror film that one should watch late at night when the atmosphere is spooky. I actually enjoyed the film because it is something of a hidden item from the 1970's overindulgence. It concerns a small town and a strange cult that appears to be worshippers of an ancient Nordic religion. It wasn't as bad as you'd think, give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinks","review":"Despite having a star-studded cast and a cameo by Anton and Dianne LaVey, this movie is one of the worst that I have ever seen. If you want to hear the Enochian Calls recited or see Bill Shatner in one of the worst roles of his life, this might be for you, but I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven don't help us............","review":"Many thanks for dark sky's rerelease. Great quality! This film has great actors for a 70's cult classic. It even has Anton Lavey the high preist of the church of satan. Also the dark sky print has a clip of the satanic wedding. Great classic film to own if you into classic devil films!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Atmospheric cult horror","review":"I actually enjoyed this movie, but I'm a fan of off-beat horror and I liked Fuest's Phibes movies. The character development is slim to none, the plot pretty simple, and the makeup nothing spectacular, but I liked the unusual structure and pacing and thought many of the cult scenes were creepy and atmospheric. The oddball way in which the story was told made what could have been another conventional drive-in movie rather unpredictable and a little unsettling. Not to say that it's a great movie, but I think that creatively it's above-par for the genre and that many reviewers don't give it enough credit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic, sort of","review":"This is a very ambitious, artsy horror film that doesn't quite accomplish what it sets out to do, but goes somewhere interesting anyway. And what a cast: William Shatner, acting his ass off as always; reliable Tom Skerritt; Eddie Albert and his hair; and Ernest Borgnine in devil-goat makeup. This was also John Travolta's first movie role, although you won't see him behind the makeup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Occult movie of its time.","review":"It's a bit weird,creepy and scary at first especially when your a kid. but not a big deal.In hindsight a goofy movie and typical of it's time and the rage around the occult. although Ernest Borgnine is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good movie","review":"this movie wastn what I expected or maybe it was, this is just one of thoes 70's horror films with a sorry story line and nothing else.if you are a colletor of william shatner films this buy this movie or if you like the old low budget horrer then this is for you. but other wise stay away from this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satanic Fun","review":"Lots of fun, although sometimes confusing. The book explains it better. Notable for having both the High Priest and High Priestess of the Church of Satan - Anton and Diane LaVey, in bit parts. Their inclusion gives a true Satanic presence to this movie - they wrote that humor is important to Satanists. Anton was technical advisor, and you can see many of his influences, such as the trapezoid designs and the Satanic chants. Some of the Satanic designs used are beautiful and interesting. It was filmed in Durango, Mexico. The filming has interesting stories to it, such as Anton LaVey trying to teach chants to extras who did not speak English. As was his custom, Shatner did nothing to make friends with the cast, and one suspects they symbolically enjoyed his character's treatment in the film. Anyone who likes good old sci fi and horror or camp, should love this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Are The Borgnine; You Will Be Assimilated","review":"From Bob Fuest, the man who gave us Dr. Phibes, comes this campy funfest. A real treat for people like me, who crave the sight of Eddie Albert flexing his heroism. I mean, it's Oliver Douglas versus Satan. Plus, there's the Shat-man and Ida Lupino. The film is one of those engaging, low-budget, Seventies classics. Remember, the era when independent film meant something other than boring slackers griping about their love lives? This will take you back to a time when Sundance was only the name of a cowboy, and Austin was only significant as the last name of The Six Million Dollar Man. Also, sneak a peek at Anton LaVey (founder of the Church of Satan) as the High Priest. Now THIS is a movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I would've tried them sooner","review":"I had morning sickness all day and night. I was home on vacation for a week and couldnt get off the couch.

Isn'tsexuality an important part of life, whether or not you chooseto be celibate? There is not a word said about girlfriendsor lack of girlfriends when he was a layman. This too iscurious.

It has plastic that protects the screen of your ipod and prevents scratches.A huge plus that comes with this case is that you can get a hold off all connection areas without taking off the case. I can charge it and use my itrip without ever taking it off. That makes it a lot better than any of the other cases i've tried because i don't have to hassle with getting it on and off.I absolutly love this, and I am extremely happy with it.

But, since the case is made of leather, it's easy enough to cut a slightly bigger opening."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my SmartWool Socks","review":"I first found out about Smartwool socks by the mens socks. I borrowed them when I went ice skating and they were much more comfortable than my own outdoor type socks I had worn with my ski boots. The best thing about them is that the socks didn't get bunched up between the heel and the ankle in my skate boot, like most socks do. I think its because of the tighter, stretchy knit of the sock, even though they were mens' socks.Last winter I bought several more pairs of the womens socks and loved how warm they were. This summer I bought another pair for skating and this pair was lighter weight than the winter socks. These are great for wearing to work - they're thin enough to wear with a dress shoe but still warm and terribly comfortable. Best of all - they last forever. The cashmere blend socks I bought last year are pilled, but the Smartwool socks are still great - even going into their third winter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Product","review":"The shipper was excellent and even replaced one pair of socks at no charge due to a manufacturing flaw.

These have worn very thin on the soles and the left one even has a hole in the heel. It pains me, since they cost so much to just throw them away after 1 year of use (not even that as stated earlier), but it seems I will keep using the hanes and stay away from smartwool.

I was horrified...I was reading this book to my child, and at the end we both said \\"huh?\\" I was hoping to teach him about practical ways to handle bullies, but all the book told him was that he should be one himself.

Stop it!\\" If that didn't work, she could have told her principal or a trusted adult. However, to have her beat up this bully only teaches kids that it is ok to hurt others (deserved or not does not matter). What's next? It is ok to shoot kids dead because they are bullies? I do not recommend this book. No kid should be taught it is ok to hit others. In fact, Sister bear stooped down to this bullies level and became a bully herself. This teaches kids the way to solve problems is to HIT PUNCH HIT HIT PUNCH PUNCH HIT."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wrong Message","review":"This book is positively appalling.

I thought for a while after that the reason my brother beat me at sports was because I was a girl and he wasn't, not because he was nine years my senior. When he told me I wasn't playing up to my potential, I would pull out the excuse, \\"But I'm a girl!

Kaplan analyzes the movements that have shaped modern Judaism, and explains why none of them alone can address the needs of contemporary American Jews. His ideas, written over 50 years ago, have influenced all other movements, as well as giving birth to the Reconstructionist movement. This is a book that every thinking American Jew must read, whether you end up agreeing or disagreeing with his views. The fact that he had his feet in three of the four movements in American Jewish life (he was rabbi of an Orthodox synagogue and involved in the early days of the Young Israel movement, taught at Jewish Theological Seminary (Conservative), and was the founder of Reconstructionism) gives him insights into each group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent in error, instead of \\"JUdaism as Civilization\\" by Kaplan.","review":"Sent in error.

I wish the author had invested the effort to make the characters and the writing fit the time period. I know it is a paperback romance, but I wish the writing was just better in general.

His intellect and his devotion are revealed, in part, by extended exerpts from personal correspondence in Borden's family. The story is not comprehensive and the presentation falls well short of a biography. It is more a collection of disconnected anecdotes in chronological order. Though Borden's missionary zeal is well established his most important relationships are not fully developed. This makes for something less than a satisfying story. The subject, however, is a truly interesting personality with an inspiring conviction. Borden's evangelistic accomplishments are unusual and one wonders what he might have achieved had his life not been shortened suddenly at an early age."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sound quality!","review":"my favorite christmas album on cd. its great. excellent sound quality. i was glad i found it! my dad has the old cassetttes but now i gave him a cd for his car. loves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outrageous price!","review":"Why would anyone pay this much for a paperback...especially when it is soooo much less at other sites...no reason is given for this outrageous price..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goth can be funny!","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I don't necessarily think myself a goth, although I listen to some gothic music and wear gothic clothing sometimes, but this book had me in stitches for hours. I must have read it 10 times the first night I got it.Voltaire manages to make good and original points and sound intelligent while still being amazingly funny. He guarantees that by the time the reader sets the book down, she/he fully understands the gothic world, but he also ensures that they had a good time and several laughs. I recommend this to goths, mundanes, and all those in-between. Kids, if your parents are freaking out because you're starting to wear all black and whatnot, buy this book and show them what goth REALLY means...and this will definitely alleviate fears that all goths are Satan-worshipping, suicidal anarchists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Smart","review":"This book was awesome to say the least.

Voltaire does make fun of the Goth community as a whole but if you remember not to take yourself or anything else for that matter too seriously you should not be angered by this book.Also Voltaire states a good lesson in the book that you really should gain knowledge of something before you fear it, cause all in all like bats, Goths are fairly harmless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book - <3 Voltaire","review":"I love this book, I received a signed copy from Voltaire upon its release (via special order) Highly recommended to anyone who is, was, or wants to explore Goth"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Voltaire!","review":"I bought this more because I absolutely love Voltaire's music than because I thought it was going to be some fantastic book.

Okay...I know that labels are for soup cans, not people...but I think a part of the charm of this book is that it makes fun of the fact that this subculture does have to label itself, and how silly it really is. It shows that all \\"Goths\\" aren't just sad little Prozac poppers. It shows that they are also capable of incredible humor.The book is wonderfully written. I was not a fan of this man until my boyfriend got me hooked. Voltaire is a rather clever fellow.There are good articles and pictures. How to do make up. Hair, the different categories of Goth, and what their advantages and disadvantages are. How to travel as a Goth. How to have a Goth conversation (this one is rather funny.) How to dance Goth. the pictures are total eye candy too. I liked the fact that instead of a white page with black letters it is the other way around.

With them? At himself? Or at you?He looks the part, he has infiltrated your world, only to mock you and profit from you.For a true Goth who is not delusional or playing dress-up once a week at a club or school, this is offensive.Voltaire is the ultimate poseur, and look at all of the cash that you throw at him.

If a guy in an an unconvincing gorilla suit with a monster dildo masquerading as a real penis, splashing cream over a naked woman in the forest is your bag, then this is the film for you.Personally, I think anyone who (ahem) swallows this film as any kind of serious attempt to explore sexual taboos (or whatever it's supposed to be) has got to be up in the trees themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty, nasty and junk","review":"Sometimes you never know until you open the package and start playing one of these dvd's.

Who produced it? These guys must have been dropping some serious acid! The horse copulation scene was a bit too much. But the beast copulation scene was nauseating to say the least.

The scene with the beast is ridiculous and would appeal only to the sexual level of a teenager and even then only one who had never come across bestiality and found it to be erotic. The phallus in the scene looks like the rubberized end of a baseball bat with hand cream shooting out every 5-10 seconds. While the overall story line and acting is reasonable, and the two r-rated sex scenes are passable the whole point of the movie is this scene which is laughable for its lack believability and true eroticism. My copy went straight in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEAUTY AND THE BEAST vs. Benny Hill vs. Upstairs Downstairs","review":"Well, you can go ahead and start hitting the negative vote button cause I don't understand people's attraction to this movie. A horse with a large wang bangs another horse. Some people walk around an English manor and talk a lot. A whole lot. Stopping only long enough for a woman to rub her delicate part on the foot of a bed.Finally at the 61 minute mark a woman walking in the woods is chased and attacked by a large wookalar looking creature with a giant dong. She fights him off for a few minutes but finally he gets it his way...and she likes it! They continue on for a while until he falls over dead and she buries him with leaves. The End.Why all that had to take 98 minutes is inexcusable. This movie shouldn't have run longer than 20 minutes. Plus none of the women were even attractive, so outside of the monster with the spurting unit it's all completely forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"Some of the outdoor scenes in this movie are nice. However, the beast of the title looks totally fake and this doesn't contribute to the mood. Music is misplaced Scarlatti. Penderecki would have been a much more interesting choice.Nearly all the indoor scenes are stilted and unimaginative. For an supposed artist, Walerian Borowczyk doesn't know much about composition, framing and lighting, much less camera movement. Also, the soundtrack has been stripped of its French dialogue (it's not even an option on the DVD), and the English dubbing job is as shoddy as such things usually are. Watch this if you're curious, but don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in 1975...and it looks it.","review":"This reminds me of some of my father's really bad porn from the early '70s. I agree with the bloke from the UK, this is a pretty sorry affair. In fact, there is an actual scene, as he alludes, of a woman copulating with a man in an ape suit. The soundtrack is off-cue, the dubbing and dialogue is pathetic, and the film quality has that dreadful faded blurry appearance common to B-movies of that time.

But, overall, this was just a jaunt back into the 70's for some harmless, kinky fun. It started out a little slow, but the flower scene was worth the price of admission alone. I imagine the director must have a foot fetish because the final scene is very erotic in that regard. It's a little overpriced, but if your tastes run into the perverse definately check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money - stay away","review":"I bought this thinking that it would be an erotic feast. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a dismal movie, no story line, no beautiful bodies, no hot sex, nothing.The climax of the movie is when you see the heroine naked (just for a few minutes).

The story just sort of drones on and doesn't seem to have a point. There was little interaction with the women after they got off the ship and little understanding of their needs as foreigners in America; they just had the same problems that most women have in their day to day struggles. I wanted to know about the differences and how they handled them. I also didn't like that after one of the characters got a divorce, her ex and his new fiance got as much coverage (even though they were Americans), but there was never a conclusion to their problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good for Montecs","review":"No good for Montec G5 CS or the Montec Striker - they don't clip in because they are not long enough so they just roll around in the box - useless!

Many of the same situations recur. Even the bumbling fellow passenger on the plane is a rerun. The plot, as in all the others, hinges on which British spy will turn out to be a mole working for the Russians. Much of the action takes place in a divided Berlin. This was published in 1988 so the end of the Cold War was about to out-date it in a way, but it's still great entertainment.One group of Deighton fans regards this series as a falling off from his earlier stories.

It embodies all of Ford's faults and none of his strengths: even the visual framing of the scenes, something Ford is usually an instinctive master of, seems pedestrian. Why some critics have praised the performances is beyond me: the actors give the sort of performance which lets you know they're really acting. To be fair, this film is a sentimental favorite and has many fans, but I myself could hardly keep a straight face watching it. I can recommend it only to Ford fans who want to see all of his work.

It is amazingly true to the Bible. The only things I noticed different from the Biblical account was that they gave Jairus' daughter a more central role--which is a creative idea--and when Jesus is telling about the mansions in Heaven (\\"In my Father's house are many mansions...\\"), he is talking to Jairus' daughter rather than His disciples. I like the way they explain things, such as the parts they add to the Parable of the Good Samaritan telling why a priest wouldn't want to touch an injured man and why the idea of a Samaritan helping a Jew sounded so strange. They also emphasize Barabbas just enough to explain that he lead a rebellion, and they show Judas' motivation for betraying Jesus (i.e., Jesus wasn't bringing the military revolt against the Romans that Judas was expecting).The claymation is excellent, and the regular animation is an interesting effect. I've never seen both formats used in one movie. It's quite creative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable retelling","review":"I am a Christian, a former pastor and a would-be New Testament scholar, and yet I must confess that Jesus movies don't excite me a great deal. I loved The Miracle Maker, however.Ralph Fiennes gives an endearing and original portrayal of Jesus in what strikes me as a fairly original retelling of the gospel story. I enjoyed the creativity of the writing; for example, when Jesus tells Mary, \\"I can still mend doors... but I'm building something new, now.\\" The animators bring first-century Palestine to life with great vibrancy, and the diversity of accents in the cast (American, English, Scottish) really helps to give the setting a cosmopolitan feel.The only lowlights for me were the traditional animation/cartoon sequences, which didn't quite work, and were of inferior quality to the clay-animation.

Still, it seems hard to convince anyone to watch a movie about so profound a subject in claymation. It does not disappoint, and illuminates a lot of the political and social turmoil surrounding the time of his appearance very well. Very human, loving, and appropriate depiction, to my understanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For Catholic Schools","review":"The Miracle Maker is a fantastic video for school age children inparticular the lower grade levels. My children were so attentive and interested in this video! I would suggest that Catholic School teachers purchase this video it beautifully depicts the story of Jesus in such a creative way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Treasure","review":"I find this to be the second best film on the life of Jesus that has been made (the first is the incredibly moving \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\"/1977). Not only did I find the animation almost life-like, but it was completely accurate. Sadly, alot of Hollywood's versions can not say this. Because so much is left out of the bible about Jesus' everyday life (from 12-30), a lot of movie-makers feel the need to improvise. This one took from the Scriptures and blended a beautiful and fitting movie about the Son of God, even down to the crucifixion. I would highly recommend this movie over many of the other efforts made."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story of Jesus the way it should be told!","review":"THe miracle maker is an awesome telling of Jesus' life here on earth. Forget the editorial reviews description of Jesus as brooding (I don't think they watched the movie) Jesus is portrayed by Ralph Fiennes the way he lived. He was joyful in the message he had to share! THis film gets that. It also shows how human Jesus was, how he struggled with the same things we struggle with. THat was the whole point of God sending him here and this film really captures it. My son & husband also loved it. It is more biblically accurate than any other telling of Jesus life I have ever seen including The Greatest Story Ever Told."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly strong story with unique claymation format","review":"A \\"claymation\\" Jesus? How's that going to work? Surprisingly well! While artistic license is taken (if you're looking for the real deal, read the New Testament), this ranks up there with films like Franco Zeffirelli's 1977 \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" (seriously!). Caution to parents with young children: it has some very intense scenes and should defintely be viewed by parents FIRST. Well done, it was first shown on ABC Sunday night of Easter several years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, imaginative and complex","review":"Very well done. Both my 7-year-old son and I were very impressed by this imaginative BBC presentation. Very well acted by the talented cast - especially Ralph Fiennes. The claymation was of very high quality and the use of the alternative animation techniques were imaginative and effective.Having seen more than our share of animated and live-action biblical video abominations, we were quite taken by this. The music is very well chosen, the theological editing was well-reasoned, the varying emotions were realistic and the behind-the-scenes making-of story was almost as inspiring. Highly recommended - especially for Sunday school classes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful animation and retelling of the life of Jesus","review":"I bought this film after seeing the end of it on ABC one Easter Sunday. I must say it is one of my favorite films and brings me to tears on many occasion. The animation is superb, blending claymation and drawn animation to tell a wonderful story. I also liked the portrayal of the characters with tanned skin, although the British accents were funny and off putting at times, especially their casting of Peter as an Irishman always about to blow his top. Yet, I loved the complexity of the characters, especially Judas and the way they set the story in the historical and political situation of the times. It tries to portray some of the possible motivations for people following Jesus or rejecting him, reasons that are political, spiritual and sometimes class based. This brings the Bible to life for young people as well as old. I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am thankful for this wonderful blessing!","review":"The Miracle Maker - The Story of Jesus is well crafted and is entitled to many industry awards.

I saw the great reviews and love for this movie, the high quality of work that was put in to it so I bought it. The facts are all skewed and they make Jesus look like He claimed to be no more than a prophet. Then He just vanishes, we don't see Him accend to Heaven, and everyone concludes that the Kingdom of God is in our hearts, which is partly true, but they leave out that where He is going, He is preparing a place for us and will come again. So sad..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arian Jesus - be careful what ur kids watch","review":"Some will & have commented regarding the wonderful animation & remake this is. While this may or may not be true, the fundamental issue is do you want your kids to watch a heretical poorly displayed Arian Jesus who lies in the first scene & is portrayed as a reluctant human.For those who do not know this type of heresy, its the belief that Christ wad a mere human until his baptism and only then became some superior human. Kids are confused enough nowadays with everything to confuse them more with who Jesus is - the ever existing only begotten son of God. I'd try to sell this used but would hate to be responsible for any viewer becoming confused. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best telling of the story I've seen","review":"Of all the Jesus movies that are broadcast around Easter time, this one has topped them all. The portrayal of Jesus is wonderfully human, in notable contrast to the stilted performances I've seen before that were all \\"Son of God\\" but no \\"Son of Man.\\"This movie is simple enough for young children, but will definitely keep the attention of adults. People familiar with the Bible will especially appreciate the attention to detail (for example, the 12 stones on the breastplate worn by the high priest; see Exodus 28:15-20). Also, the makers of this film did not allow the tedious requirements of this type of animation to limit the physical expression of the characters. At one point, Jesus looks positively exasperated when someone calls to him to test him with a question.I think this film appeals to any Christian denomination, and maybe also to non-Christians who are looking for some life in the story of Jesus. This is a fantastic, no-frills, \\"just Jesus\\" interpretation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video for all ages","review":"When I saw this movie on tv last year, I decided that it wouldbe part of my collection when it came out.

Although reviews were strong for this book, and I believe it was a National Book Award finalist, it felt like an apprentice effort to me. The characters and situations were strange--as they often were in THE BIRD ARTIST--but not nearly as compelling. The plot was loose and slippery, and didn't cohere by the end of the novel. It felt like Norman was trying too hard to be obscure and poetic. This is a mediocre first novel, but does hint at the wonderful things to come.

But, I think I couldn't enjoy this film with any other cast.The zombies (especially Orvil), and the whole premise of how they come about is awe-inspiring! The situation is intense, and if you look past the lighting (which I though set the mood well), and get past the 70's attire, and really immerse yourself in this one, I think you'll like it.A remake was schedueled to be done in late 2006, but the director and his son were both killed in a car accident that ended any hopes of seeing a modernized version of what really is a CULT Classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN IN BELL BOTTOMS","review":"If you love camp served up with a side of cheese, then you'll love this movie.

This film is very similair to the film \\"Night of the Living Dead\\"! Even though \\"Dead Things\\" was in most aspects inferior to \\"Living Dead\\" it has a more creepy atmosphere and sound effects, the ghouls looked more terrorfying (looked like they been dead for a longer period of time and they showed them crawling out of the grave, unlike \\"Living Dead\\") and the cast seemed more humorous and fun to watch!There is somethings about the film I didn't like (Christ name taken in vain, some of the Ghouls look rather corny, and bad music), but bottom line it is fun film to watch if you enjoy low budget, very creepy, horror film of the early 70's like I do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSIC OF THE 1970's","review":"I'd hesitated in purchasing this DVD because of the 1.5 rating the quality had received, and another review that had bashed its inferior transfer.

Remember folks, this is/was a low-budget (somewhat independent) horror film, and the original master has suffered some fade, but it's exactly what I remembered it as being when the film was the \\"Million Dollar Movie\\" on Channel 9 YEARRRS ago. It's a great addition to my DVD collection, and a great source of some really chilling sequences! For the first hour, it's all talk-talk-talk, but there's atmosphere!--And the dialogue is pure camp--the clothes are SO 1970's--but the last half-hour (when the zombies arrive), the hair really starts to rise.

Laura Gould has written the charming, witty, delightful story of her male calico cat, George, and his feline pal Max in their California home. That alone would have been a wonderful book. But aren't all calico cats female? The vet turned pale upon seeing George, obviously male and obviously calico. Gould intersperses George's' life story with her own investigation into how he could have come to exist. This makes a gentle, funny, and accurate introduction to genetics, including side trips to libraries with insane librarians preventing the books from being used, to theories of sex before the discovery of genes and DNA, and to rare Japanese sources. Cat lore, history and science are beautifully balanced in this book. The second edition brings the genetics up to date, while keeping all the charm of George. A superb read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best explanation of the calico phenomenon I have ever read.","review":"Best explanation of the calico phenomenon I have ever read.

What is horrible about this 'product' is the Unbox feature used to d/l and view it. The Unbox help menu is very limited and there is no way to stage the videos waiting in quene. Those are small flaws. The major flaws are 1. d/l time is pathetic. Almost a hour for the the approx. 45 min. show and 2. I can't import or play this on an ipod product. The only reason I purchased this episode was it was not on iTunes like last season. I hope iTunes does eventually carry this season because The Closer on Amazon Unbox is a giant step backwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close it up","review":"I stopped watching at season 3.

The characters are likeable and real, with weaknesses and quirks that are subtle enough that they don't turn into caricatures. I liked that Natalie, the main character, learns to like and trust people who are legitimately annoying in some ways, since that's how life really is. I thought her development was realistic and important; she discovers that she has more control over how she sees the world than she thought at the beginning. That's a great message and an important one these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Monster in Me","review":"This is a remarkably well-written book.

It saved me from getting seriously lost many times, as the Tokyo system is truly a well organized maze of train lines/subways.

I'd recommend it though--in the spirit of keep your friends close but your enemies closer. Of course, I'm biased to a fault: both my grandfather and stepfather were part of the Pacific War and could likely have added to the mounting casualties at war's end (i.e. Iwo Jima, Okinawa). I'm not insensitive to what thousands of Japanese civilians suffered (although they supported their government more than the initial exhibit acknowledged), but I'm sure Truman wasn't about to trade American lives for a ban on the bomb.

When we cross names involved in KP saga with those cited by Shimomura in Takedown it is clear Kevin was not just another suburban phreaker. Given the details about cell phreaking described by the author on The Fugitive Game it would make sense to correlate what was going on between Kevin and those \\"talented cell phreakers\\" cited in The Fugitive Game. It's unfortunate, also, that many of the \\"crimes\\" attributed to KP on the book don't show up in \\"The Setencing\\" at Kevin's homepage, were those charges dropped before the judgement?

And this is what makes it so confusing to read. Littman's intentional blurring of fact and fiction was intended to produce a readable piece. But what is the result? By what standard is to be judged?As work of fact, the book lacks references, instead relying on its subject's anecdotal incident accounts.As a work of fiction it misses the mark: the characters are largely explored superficially, and their many exploits described too rapidly, too vaguely.

If someone unfamiliar with Poulson's reputation were to read this book, they would think he was a burgler, not a hacker.There also doesn't seem to be any description of Poulson's personality or drive, other than a vaguely described \\"Hacker Ethic\\".Don't bother with this book if you are looking for anything similar \\"The Cuckoo's Egg\\" or \\"Takedown\\".On a positive note: This book flows smoothly along, making a quick read that doesn't require too much concentration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this novel","review":"Having finished this book, I thought to myself \\"that was aterrific novel\\" and then realized that this was supposed tobe a factual book.The author creates his own dialogue, thoughts and events to make the story more appealing, but in the process, loses one important thing -- the truth.

This book is pure fluff and at best, can be used as a paperweight.Jonathan Littman has again proven to us that facts in a fact-based book are irrelevant and that spinning your own tales and attributing it to others is the way to sell things.This book has been met with sharp criticism from all the hackers involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Letdown","review":"Tough read--! This book, while informative, is very slow reading and not at all like the Fugitive Game. I should've been clued in when I read the back cover and instead of a real synopsis, I get to read two reviews of \\"The Watchman\\" and THREE REVIEWS of \\"The Fugitive Game!\\" It's pretty sad when you buy a book and there are more reviews for another book than the one you're purchasing.

So that should tell you how much fun the book was to read.The reason for 4 stars instead of 5? 1) It only comes in a hard cover instead of a paper back? At least, I couldn't find a paper back anywhere! 2) It's obvious (and Poulsen has commented on this) that the author has made up some things that Kevin said or did. However, this is obviously to keep the book interesting and make for a better read... So, don't take everything that the author says to heart, but the underlying story is still pretty much what happened from what I understand and have found to be true, anyway.Great read, thrilling, exciting and fun.

It is attractive to the eye, reasonably sturdy in its construction, does a good job actually crushing the ice and is easy to clean.Drawbacks are that is is extremely light and as other reviewers have mentioned, you really have to hold on to the top of it with one hand while you are turning the crank with the other. Otherwise you are going to see the crushed ice you have just worked so hard to produce go flying across the kitchen. In fact, I've been resting the bottom of the crusher on a folded up kitchen towel when I crank it to give it some traction on the counter. It's not a problem if you are careful, just be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle came out","review":"The very first time I used it the handle came out dumping all the teeth of the grinder and everything else into my ice.

My only suggestion is put it on a towel so it doesn't slide around when you're grinding. Other than that mine's worked great - I haven't yet experienced the 'falling apart' problem that others have.

It's a functional device that does its job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vexation on Ice","review":"Forget this ice crusher. It fails in all important areas. It only succeeds in looking cool.

There is no mechanical advantage built into its design. Really, shop around, there must be a better idea out there somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works well!","review":"I bought the all chrome color version in mid August. It has a heavy metal top and a plastic bottom which seems durable. The crusher works well and I am pleased with it. I have used it four times.

The finish on my crusher appears firm and I have noticed no signs of chipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, works awful!","review":"This ice crusher barely did just that. It was incredibly hard to turn the crank, the ice didn't get any smaller than an inch in diameter, and it jumped all over the counter while I was grinding.

After about 2 months of use, the innards fell apart. No big deal, just tighten the screw again. However, the metal blades are now rusting, the steel post is now rusting, and the outer spacer is now rusting. Stainless steel is not that much more expensive than chromed steel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good buy","review":"Great product! It creates little pebbles of ice that are required for the Mint Julep, the Lime Ricky, or any other drink that needs an ice-cold temperature. The added surface area that's created from crumbled ice causes that layer of frost that appears on the outside of the glass (or silver cup).As you turn the crank, you feel like a bartender in a 1920's speakeasy. Just keep the screw tight on the crank mechanism: Putting the parts back together isn't easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save the box that this came in","review":"Save the box because you will be sending this back.

I crush 3 cubes a day maybe 3 days per week - not heavy useage in my opinion. The chrome metal plating inside the crushing area (where the blades are) is flaking off into the ice. The handle leaks \\"dirty\\" water on the counter as I turn it. Now, that \\"dirt\\" is getting into the ice making it gray. The plating is also flaking off the OUTSIDE near the handle. ... For a ... product, the quality is very poor. I'd like an electric crusher, but alas, no one makes one anymore. I use my blender now but it's not very satisfactory unless I mix the drink ingredients along with the ice.

Also, after using it about once a week for five weeks now, last night all the cutter blades fell off into the ice catcher while I was turning the handle. Now I am trying to contact the company for a drawing of how to put this back together because I'm not gonna pay freight to ship it to them, and include $5 for them to ship it back to me!

Seemingly cobbled together from fansites, old interviews and bits lifted from Clinton Walker's far superior tome on Bon Scott, this offered no fresh insight into the band or their history. The narrative was confusing and choppy and looked like a patchwork of third hand information. A long, rambling and inconclusive chapter about Bon's death did nothing to raise the stakes. The definative AC/DC book is out there somewhere, but this ain't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new...","review":"This is just another rock \\"biography\\" that is nothing more than footage taken together from magazines and other books.

The quality is inconsistant (to many writers?) and I have found numerous typos and technical errors including code snippets that are incorrect and won't compile. For example, the section on Threads in Chapter 7 is poorly written, contains mistakes and leaves out important details like the fact that you can't directly use the lock() method to synchonrize a value type (which it implies you can).I bought this book after buying the O'Reilly book \\"Programming C#\\" with the hope that the Wrox book would fill in some gaps. However, the O'Reilly book, though it is light in a few areas, is much more consistant, readable and accurate.

I got it last week and have read the first 200 pages and I have to say that it is one of the worst written technical books I have ever seen as far as the grammar, typos and code examples - and I have a ton of technical books - being a developer for 8 years. There are typos everywhere - not just in the code samples but the actual wording in the book, some code examples work but alot of them don't - If you've been writing code for awhile you can stumble through them - but if you're a beginner or not real comfortable with OO design steer clear...I've always thought Wronx books were good and most are but this is definately an exception.

Lacey is the right hand \\"man\\" to a Mafia type boss and meets Rachel, who has a dark past herself. The two books tell how they try to build a life together, solve mysteries and separate themselves from Lacey's criminal background.

The attempts to put the comments in their historical context does not always reflect the complete events or context. It is a good starting point for some thorough research, however, and I would strongly urge anyone who reads this to check out the authors' sources on their own.

It has great sound even playing loud, and the antennae is long, but I never need to adjust it...everything actually comes in. I once even used it in the basement for a few hours while cleaning because it sounds so great.

I just replaced the 2 D size Duracel batteries for the first time last week...and that is after using the radio daily for an hour each morning and then some. The sound quality and reception was strong right up till the end...both AM & FM. The case is sturdy and has a well made feel to each feature. One handy thing is that you can mount it on the wall so you don't accidentally knock it over. Additionally, there is a built in emergency flashlight, a carry handle that double functions as an antenna, a carry strap, and a digital clock. Though more expensive than most shower radios I researched, the value is worth the splurge. If I could change one thing, however, I'd want more presets instead of only 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shower Radio","review":"This radio is all that the ads say it is.

What I like most about it is you preset the stations, and don't have to fiddle around with a dial trying to tune it (but never quite getting the station in clearly).

Poor quality.","review":"This radio malfunctioned after about a year. Pressing the + to increase the volume does not increase the volume; it changes the station and the band!! The problem occurs more and more frequently as time goes on. So, just when there is something I really, really want to hear, so I try to turn up the volume, the radio changes the station and I entirely miss what I especially wanted to hear!!I also have a Sangean pocket radio with ear buds that malfunctioned way too soon (there is no audio on the right stereo side). Then the ear buds started delivering static in both ears.Sangean products are well designed, so they make a good first impression, but they are poorly engineered and/or poorly manufactured.I will replace these radios with different brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this radio!","review":"I LOVE this radio!!!

Amazing Battery life!","review":"I've had this radio mounted in my shower since 2006. And today Im replacing the battery for only the 3rd time! Listen to it on a daily basis and the battery life is outstanding. Sound is is very good whether you're listening to the news or listening to some music. The light feature actually came in handy on one or two occasions when the power went out in my apartment. Reception is good, sometimes you have to move the little wire antenna for better reception but considering I'm living in a 1927 Prewar NYC Building, its great! Very thick walls here!After having it for years i can say that it stands up to the humidity, and any splashing of water you may have -very durable!I mounted the radio via the bracket straight into the tile wall. Never had any problems.Ive also attached a radio transmitter to my iPod to listen to my playlists over the Sangean radio.Overall a great radio I would recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the radio!!!!! 10 Stars!","review":"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SHOWER RADIO!

Would have been even better if it had an input to connect any external devices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Radio for the Price","review":"I recently purchased this radio when my Sony went kaput after 20 years of faithful service. I attempted to purchase another Sony similar to my old one, but was no longer available. First, the pros: The Sangean Shower Radio has great sound and can be hung over the shower for bathroom use (which is why I purchased it). I love that it is waterproof and also has a flashlight for emergency situations, which is cool. I like that it can be programmed to play continuously or timed for 50 minutes of play. Also, love the big numbers on the clock and radio bands.The cons: it is heavy, much heavier than my former Sony, and takes four \\"D\\" batteries versus the old Sony that held three \\"C\\" batteries. Due to the heavier weight, it would slide down the shower head until I figured out a way to balance it on the bath caddy. The Sangean can also be played without batteries, but the adapter is sold separately.Overall, a good bang for the buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice","review":"I love this radio! Sangean always makes a quality product. Heavily built. Obviously water resistant. Tunes in better than most radios, even though I left the FM wire antenna inside. Digital tuning is pretty nice. Loud enough for the shower. Easily mounted and detached from the wall. Sound quality is superior for a shower radio. I could critique it's lack of bass/treble controls and lack of low end, but it's a SHOWER radio. As a shower radio it has some cool features like turning itself off after a preset amount of time. I usually set it for 10 minutes longer than my shower and I can listen while I dry off and brush teeth.As a shower radio it's probably the best you'll ever find. If I had to nit pick I would say it would be nice if it included a weather band--but how many shower radios do? I would buy it again and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent radio for the shower","review":"This is an excellent radio for the shower. I purchased it as a replacement for a cd/radio combo that I had used in my shower for several years (that had definitely seen better days). It has great reception and great sound. I was unsure of the options to hang it, but was very happy when it arrived and I realized there are 3 different options - cord that can be used on a hook, a \\"swing arm\\" on the back that can also be used on a hook, or by a bracket that sticks to the wall with self-adhesive tape (included) which is the option I chose. I've had it for several weeks now and could not be happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money. Great Product!","review":"I was disappointed that there were only cheap $15 shower radios or the more expensive ones such as this one. However, I have been very pleased with this radio. It is loud, clear, and hasn't failed me yet. It easily hangs in the shower, I bought a suction cup hook to stick on the wall. It picks up all of our radio stations, even in the basement, and they are all crystal clear. Battery life seems good, mine still shows full power after a month or so of use. If you are contemplating whether or not to spend the extra bucks on this model, do it and you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does what it promisese to do","review":"I like it and it does it what promises to do. Only bad things I can say about it are that it is much thicker than I thought it would be. Also sound quality is not that great so I thought I did not get my money's worth. But with very few choices of wall mountable radios it is good enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Substantial in heft and price","review":"A solid, decent waterproof unit, though pricey in today's competitive high-tech market for a simple radio"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It","review":"It's not very loud, but just barely loud enough if it's in the shower with you. BUT the volume mysteriously drops every 30-60 seconds or so. I have to pick it up and dump the water of it to get the volume back. I sent the first one back and the second one was the same!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I bought this radio based on the great reviews it had on its reception. Unfortunately they must have been comparing it to really bad radios because the reception was not good. I live in an area with bad reception due to hills so it has always been an issue with any radio, but this radio could not even pick up the strongest fm station clearly regardless of how the antenna was arranged.There are not many shower radios out there, so this might be good for the category, but silence is better than stations cutting in and out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sangean H2O1","review":"Reception is really good. Sound quality is good for noisy environment in shower. Batteries have long life and clock is easy to read even when I am not wearing glasses in shower.

The sound is really good. Only problem is that the FM antenna is a wire that needs to be threaded out of the battery compartment to get the best reception for FM radio. Kind of inconvenient when on the kayak or on the beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound & Reception Quality Issues","review":"I had high expectations based on the reviews, but the sound quality is poor because there is too much base for a bathroom setting and no control. You get a booming sound and clarity is lost. I also do not believe the reception is very good either and that reduces your choices of positioning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a radio that works in the shower!","review":"Love listening to the radio in the shower - have tried several 'shower' radios over the years - so far this is by far the best.

Downsides: 1) It would be nice if it had more preset buttons; 2) C'mon people, $70 for a RADIO? I can't figure out what it does that makes it so expensive.

It seems that the child's mother, Helen (Honor Blackman), is hiding a dark secret: She has a crazy ex-husband locked away in a nearby asylum. The secret is out when the psycho escapes and returns home for revenge. He terrorizes the babysitter while Helen and her new boyfriend are out on the town.One of the first babysitter-in-peril flicks, Peter Collinson's FRIGHT is also one of the best. George gamely takes on a role that requires her to maintain a state of terror while being assaulted by a non-stop bag of horrors. The results were so convincing that she played another victim later that year in Sam Peckinpah's STRAW DOGS. Ian Bannen's performance is also a triumph. He actually makes you feel a great deal of sympathy for the male maniac."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This is without a doubt, the WORST \\"horror\\" film I have ever seen, and I've seen them all. It is slow, plodding, and outright laughable. The fact that Susan George is beautiful dosent't make up for the fact that this story was so predictable, the \\"frights\\" so laughable and the acting so pitiful.

Pete Bowen's style/voice needs to age on the reader. While the venues of Montana are as dramatic as New Mexico Bowen's discriptions are basic compared to Hillerman's. Further, Dupre's dialogue couples both the spoken word and the true thought in one statement. The comparisons are delightful once you get use to the pattern. Lastly the plot is not a metaphysical as Hillerman but spirtuality isa definitive resource to Dupre. Profanity is too gratuitous for a sly character such as Dupre but that's the author's style.

I got one very similar to this for my wedding. The biggest problem is that you have to find very small oranges or it will end up wasting a lot of the fruit. The inverted cup upon which the orange is actually squeezed isn't as large as most oranges. You end up with a \\"rim\\" of unsqueezed orange and a lot of wasted fruit. I would stick with an electric juicer or, if you must have this juicer (and I admit, it's very neat), just buy the smallest oranges you can find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Everything","review":"I've been looking for an old fashion, newly produced juicer for a long time. The \\"Mighty OJ\\" LOOKED PERFECT (yaay, I found one!), but doesn't really work. Getting a decent sized orange in is almost impossible because the handle doesn't lift the squeezing head up far enough off the basket dome. Even with small oranges or lemons there's too much unsqueezed pulp around the sides and a few seeds will hold the head too far off to get much of anything. So lots of wasted fruit.(Booooo)Very hard to get the dome out to clean.Nothing to lift it out with and the space, as said before is too small.This product is messy and inefficient.The retailer will give me my $$ back, no doubt. But I'm dissapointed with Metrokane. Did you guys try this thing? Or did you fall for the shiny chrome and elegant simplicity the product seemed to offer?(... the way I did). Most peoople won't return it (gas, time ) and you will have made the dollar. But your brand? Boooooooooo"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing juicer","review":"This juicer doesn't handle larger pieces of fruit at all well because the pressure-applying surfaces are too small. With a medium-size orange or even a large lemon it leaves a considerable amount of unsqueezed flesh around the edge, so I can't imagine using it with a grapefruit. It also requires a lot more downward force on the handle than I expected. Works great for those little Key limes, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"You would be better off squeezing an orange with your thighs. The person who designed this does not understand leverage or he may have arms like Popeye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attractive on the counter but a worthless juicer","review":"I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing this. We purchased this because we wanted a non-electric appliance and opened it the day after Thanksgiving looking forward to fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. Even with two people trying to squeeze - one pushing on the top and the other (a strong man, I might add) trying to pull the handle forward, it was impossible to budge. Perhaps this would squeeze a lime without a team of people. The only reason I rate this with two stars is because I love chrome appliances and it is pretty. Perhaps someone who receives it when I donate it to the Goodwill after only one use will enjoy using it to squeeze limes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't used one yet !","review":"I just want to note that I just had to purchase this item for the THIRD time due to damage on the handle every single time it's arrived.

Although it was advertised as having chrome construction, it was actually chrome shell over a plastic interior. It did not work smoothly when the lever was lifted and lowered in preparing to juice an orange. The price in excess of $50.00 is outrageous for this piece of junk which should not cost more than $5.00 plus free shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a piece of junk","review":"We bought this hoping that it would be a great, small, hand-driven juicer. It hardly worked... you couldn't get enough leverage to squeeze the orange. It was tinny and it felt as though you would break the handle off if you squeezed hard enough to get any juice. We cleaned it up and returned it immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old idea but lost functionability","review":"I was using an old juice king while visiting relatives and it is a great juice squeezer. I thought this would be the same but although the design is identical the function is not. The Metrokane does not have much leverage for squeeze the juice out and large citrus barely fits. I went back to my hand squeezer. The nice thing about the juice king is that you do not get all the pulp. Don't waste your time and money.

The only redeeming is that it looks good.Metrokane Mighty OJ Home Juicer-Orange with Chrome Head and Handle"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stylish, compact and useless juicer","review":"How disappointing. The problem with this juicer is that it does not squeeze the fruit completely, not even 75% I would say. Like some other reviewers said, it leaves a rim of unsqueezed pulp around the edges of oranges -- it does the same for limes. Even after reading some of the other reviews I had some hope that it would still work for limes, which we use most often. Alas, not. If you still insist on buying one of these lame juicers, I have since found them at Crateandbarrel for 39.95 -- their description touts the \\"museum-quality design\\", but tellingly says little about performance. Better to find something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great! Works ... O.K.","review":"If you're looking for an orange juicer that will look great on your cabinet, then this might be the one. But if you're looking for a juicer that's user friendly and efficient, you might want to look somewhere else (like Metrokane's Chef's Juicer). When I bought the Mighty OJ, I noticed problems right off the bat. In the first place, it's hard to get an orange in this thing. There's barely enough clearance. So, if the orange is big, you have to sort of wedge it into the juicer. Then, the handle is short, so it's hard to get a good grip on it. If you don't hold down the left side of the juicer, it'll tip over when you press the lever down and spill juice everywhere. Also, with large oranges, this juicer won't remove all the juice. It will leave a ring of the juicy part of the orange just inside the peel. If you make orange juice once a week, these things might not bother you. If you make juice every day, they could be pretty annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Metrokane Mighty OJ Manual Juice Squeezer","review":"Although I ordered the juicer in the color black, I received the product in white. If not for the color I would have purchased it locally. After approximately 6 months of satisfactory occasional use the juicer is no longer functional.

Larger ones cause the juicer cup to overflow, and a rim around the edge goes unsqueezed (wasted).Finally, despite the \\"800 pounds of pressure\\" claim, our gear mechanism broke after, say 200 oranges were squeezed. It's ironic, because the rest of the machine is bomb-proof heavy metal, but the gear wheel is some cheap-o alloy that split in half!We just purchased an OrangeX Express and hope for better luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy","review":"This is really a quite awful and useless product. I used a restaurant-grade juicer for many years, and when it died, I went looking for another. I made the mistake of buying this product.It does not do a good job. I had been spoiled by the old juicer, just cut in half, place on the juicer and pull the handle (maybe push a second time). And done. With this product, you do that, and you have to repeat, over and over and over, and still you have not extracted the juice. There is no leverage, no clearance, not enough height between the top (the operative part) and the fruit. It is not hard to clean, just clunky and noisy and I know I am cleaning something that was just totally useless.I find myself squeezing juice by hand, every morning, rather than approach this thing. The reason: I get a lot more juice by hand than by using this critter. My dislike for this product borders on personal. :)Does anyone know where I might find an old restaurant/bar-type juice squeezer?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This juicer stinks !!!","review":"This thing does not extract nearly enough juice.

My first one lasted two years so I bought another when that broke. The second one is less than a year old; the head attachment is cracked and ready to break; the handle once again is gradually disintegrating. In addition, the second one is much more shoddy than the first; the 'cup' in the top does not fit cleanly into its seating. I will not buy a third and I strongly advise against purchasing this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The One","review":"No matter how hard you press, it is impossible to get all the juice out of your citrus.

My only complaint was the overuse at times of crude language which did not always seem necessary. However, I enjoyed the book enough that I would definitely buy the next in the series.

Even if you have ideal lighting and space in the room w/ your PS2, there will be many times that your score is affected by the camera not registering hits. Some game modes work fairly well but some, like the aerobics section, fail miserably. I can't tell you how irritating it is when you're punching an orb ten times and it won't register a hit and the lighting in the room is perfect and there's no furniture in the background. Hopefully they'll come out w/ a better eyetoy camera if they make future versions of this game. It's simply too frustrating to stick w/ any kind of exercise program on here and I lost interest after a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinetic Review","review":"I consider myself tech savy.

Thats why when I heard about this product I was intrigued in that it pormised a new and innovative way to work out.That was the theory behind the product anyway. The program itself is fine. The problem that for the product to be effective as a whole there needs to be seemless integration with the hardware-the eye toy. Plainly spoken, the eye toy does not have the sensitivity and accuracy to pull this off. I have followed the instructions exactly and have experimented many hours on the lighting and also changing the background so that it may improve its performance-without much success.In execution, this turns this product into a excercie in frustration.

I have tried blaring three spotlights on myself and it is STILL too dark for the stupid camera.Another problem is space. My livingroom is a decent size and even when I get as far away from the camera as possible my feet are still really cut off - even when my head is all the way at the top.Also, I don't know why exactly, but every time I try to select things by waving my hand over it (for 10 minutes because it BARELY acknowledges any movement) it suddenly pauses itself and cannot be unpaused.

Sometimes when I don't catch the diaper right after it's \\"dirtied\\" the mess is much harder to clean up--it sticks to his skin and he pretty much needs a scrub!

He improves rapidly in his class and even writes and stars in a play called \\"Adrift in Tahiti.\\" Everyone notices the obvious difference in his age and the teachers age, well, except Andy.

Not only was the movie void of fighting, but it was flat out stupid. The acting is poor the plot is poor and the end is insulting.

The rest of the film is 85 odd minutes of garbage.'Under Siege' proves that Mr Seagal can make a good action film if he wants.

We (Waylon and I) actually did 27 scenes, however, the editors left about an hour on the cutting floor. Too bad, we couldn't see the entire full length of the movie.

This movies best performance was by the head baddie, Gailard Sartain. (Hollywood Knights, The Real McCoy) He seemed to fit the charactor perfectly.Definitely not one of Steven Seagal's best.

It is a truly lackluster suspense thriller about a militia group unleashing a lethal virus in the town where Seagal just happens to live and practice medicine. The movie takes forever to get moving and the action is sporadic. I miss the days when Seagal spent most of his screen time kicking the snot out of creepy villians with his lighting fast moves.

He has had to resort to fast motion, panoramic camera shots and bad wardrobe tricks to hide his girth. And what is with this movie? Does Seagal think he's an actor?

If you like classic rock with blues infused guitar riffs and metal soaring voice--check this out. \\"Too Cold In The Winter\\" and \\"Pretty As you Please\\" are the best. A mediocre song here and there, but a great buy.

Now don't get me wrong, I like a lot of dance and rap, but sometimes I just want to hear four guys who can really jam out doing just that.This album is pure, great bluesy rock. Just a couple of mikes, some instruments, and some amps. The instruments are superbly balanced in the mix, making the guitars come through clear but still being able to hear the bottom end of the drums and bass. The lines are based in the blues, but with a whole lot of rock thrown in. Certainly reminiscant of Bad Company in their heyday, but with a bit of a heavier sound.This is a great straight ahead rock album. This is the type of band you'd go see and there would be no fancy clothes, no half dressed chicks dancing on stage, just a bunch of guys in jeans and t-shirts with some Marshalls and their instruments. They'd plug in and they'd blow you away."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointment","review":"What a disapointment, I LOVED season one, All the women of the village and the funny way they live, then came season two, I waited a long time for it to come out on DVD.

She is a mentally challenged individual, who actually may be more sane than people think. Her character brings some of the issues being confronted by the women to the surface, but in such an unexpected way. In the U.K., this show is entitled, \\"Jam & Jerusalem.\\" I am not sure if they have aired the third season, but I can't wait for it to be released on DVD. This show also has some of the same characteristics of, \\"The Vicar of Dibley,\\" which was created by Richard Curtis (Love Actually, Four Weddings and a Funeral...).

(You think this guy doesn't have the blues? His mother died a week after he was born, and his dad was lynched by the Klan when Red was just 5). However, when he plays with a full band, it's hit or miss, usually because the sound is just too slick. Fortunately for us, about two-thirds of this disk is pure blues magic.

This seemed to fit the bill...that is, until I used it. Seems that the people at Hamilton Beach overlooked a minor design flaw: while blending (at any speed), the blade receptacle comes loose (but the base remains locked and in position) and whatever you are blending at the moment, winds up all over you! Quite lovely. So, that is why I find myself on this site today...looking for a replacement. Do I recommend this blender? Oh yes, but only if you are a compulsive cleaner and have run out of things to obsess over. The bottom line..

The first problem was that the motor burnt out within days of buying the blender. I had to sent it to the manufacturer for a replacement. Also, it has many more parts to take apart and wash than any other blender I've seen. The lid is difficult to put on, so I often get leaks. Ditto with the bottom. The torque from the blending has actually caused the blender bottom to unscrew twice. Big huge mess. It does not crush ice well at all. Even ice in smoothies stay as big chunks. Did I mention that I hate this blender? I'm going to buy a Waring classic bar blender with the on/off toggle switch. In my experience, the more dials and settings, the worse the blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy with performance","review":"I needed a new blender and was looking for something that would crush ice for snowcones and make great milkshakes.

The salesperson suggested I go with the 14 speed Hamilton Beach, as it is inexpensive and popular. He encouraged me to try it out and return it if I wasn't satisfied. I wasn't (I realized I wanted to be able to crush ice with without having to add liquid.) So I returned it for the 56400. Once I added my yogurt, fruit and ice cubes, I turned the 56400 on. Although it made a lot of noise, nothing was happening! I waited and waited. I used a spatula (once the blades stopped, of course). I used a spoon. Nothing! After several minutes, most of the ice cubes were still just that - cubes and and although the yogurt did blend with the raspberries, there were still some whole strawberries! I used a straw to suck up whatever I could, cleaned it and returned it. Now I'm in the market for a blender once again.

Along with the gore aspects of this film that could now be witnessed, ( including the creative use of a power drill as a door knob, a chainsaw during a little tug-of-war, and, of course, the trusty axe)there were other, more subtle atmospheric qualities, now apparent, and these propelled the movie that much more.

Also, there are hundreds of new code examples which simplified the latest techniques of Flash MX: thus making tasks like: how to create reusable components, draw circles, save data to disk, preload variables and convert arrays to onscreen tables, more understandable.This book is really superb.

In addition, the dozens and dozens of charts are so small they are unreadable unless you've got a magnifying glass handy. Sure, you can change the font to larger typeface, but the charts remain the same size--and that size is \\"tiny.\\"I've contacted amazon.com about this problem and they're going to get back to me if the publisher has a newer edition with clear charts and identifiable \\"colors\\" but in the meantime, I'd steer clear of this if you're buying for Kindle.

There is no measuring or calorie counting, simply making the right food choices. It has been over 2 years and I've lost over 25 lbs. my energy is up, my cholestrol is down and I have kept off the weight with no problems. I never felt I was on a diet, I never had to eat smaller portions, I don't feel the need to binge snack, because these foods keep you very full and satisfied.

I saw this guy talking about how the show's over the other day--and he wasn't even me--he was just some other person who also knows the show's over. And,the show was meant to be genuinely viewed in tandem with IFC's commercials, so it's not even like watching the original thing anyway.I could give Portlandia 5 stars, but I think I'm hep enough to know when an over show about pseudo, hipster Brooklynites like this is so overtly over.

If you like the kind of cultural lampooning of Louie, you should get on board with this.The Blu Ray/DVD packaging, though, is atrocious. My order came with a sticker that read \\"Disc made in Mexico\\" on the back, which, if removed, tears at the cardboard jacket. Beneath the slip is a cardboard case, rather than a plastic case, which feels cheap and fragile, and the discs slide into cardboard pockets, which can't be good for the media. If greener packaging means cheap-looking design, I might have to tell Mother Nature to go screw. If you're not slightly obsessive about nice-looking cases on your shelf, then these complaint likely won't bother you, but I genuinely hope that companies stray away these kinds of designs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sense of humor?

They've been cruising for years on their sanctimonious soapboxes for years without anyone calling them out for their holier than thou attitude. Unfortunately, Portlandia's target is right on the money, but the series itself is lukewarm at best. Most of the sketches are mildly amusing at best, excruciatingly long and tedious at worst. Basically, the writers (or the actors, the series feels like it's almost all improvised) come up with a funny conceit, but then drag it out for several minutes without ever expanding on it, and worst of all, the scenes/sketches don't get funnier as they progress. A lot of times they use rapid cutting to make up for the lack of content, in an attempt to make it \\"funnier\\" (and it fails).

He doesn't talk about pacing yourself with your breath at all. I have done a lot of yoga, so I generally know where my hips are supposed to be, that my shoulders should stay down when reaching overhead, etc., but he doesn't talk you through those things at all, so beginners would probably be tottering all over the place.

Not so much otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Custodians of Truth - these authors arent.","review":"There is only one piece of new information in this book if you have already read the 1st one - Rex Deus - which is that Hugh de Payan, who founded the Templars was a descendant of Prophet Mohammad who was descended from the brother of Jesus. Yet no source is given for this, typically. The implications of this are lost on the authors.Does their new informant exist ? I am beginning to doubt it. Why are the 'differences between rituals in different Rex Desu families' not revealed? Why are the extracts from the Rex Deus gospel and prayers not added to in this 2nd volume? I sense they would reveal unpalatable material for modern Holy-Blood-hounds.Worst of all there are identical sentences and even paragraphs in both books. It is a rework of background info as given before.

Move along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death in an English Village","review":"This is an excellent mystery featuring Nigel Strangeways, who is called upon to investigate poison pen letters that have been disturbing a village. There is an interesting cast of characters, including a beautiful, paralyzed woman and a vicar with a sad secret. There are hidden conflicts with friends and family members and a dramatic conclusion.The author tends to stereotype the villagers as being greatly different from the gentry, which seems to be a common English theme. However,the Chantry and Blick families are very well described and unique.Their personalities can be clearly seen.A very readable mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Blake's best","review":"I write reviews only when I feel readers need to be warned off inferior books. (I wish others would do the same more often.) I'm a fan of Nicholas Blake's work, but THE DREADFUL HOLLOW (while not quite dreadful) was an ultimately dreary exercise, full of so much tortuous reasoning that by the time I reached the final chapter (appropriately titled \\"I Hate the Dreadful Hollow\\"), in which all is finally revealed, I no longer cared.

Also, as with many of these Santas, you will proably appreciate it more if you are a train fan. I bought this for someone who use to work on trains - and they loved it.

The Bonus Features are not to be missed! Catching a peek at Sting & Trudie's Italian estate and their eco-farming is inspirational. Now onto the 25 minute Barre Routine: compared to using the chairs, this is such a pretty routine to watch that is. Watching ballet with Trudie & James did not seem intimidating. On the other hand, I worked out with The Chair Routine (25 minutes) and even though you do the same exact routine as the Barre, I found it challenging when the moves were in vertical direction and the pace was quicker. James was calling out positions fast \\"passe, chasse, arabesque, tendu\\". This is why I felt pretty winded both mentally and physically. So, get familiar with the ballet terms and positions for the feet AND arms in the Footwork Tutorial. If you had some ballet, it would be helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent workout!","review":"I thought I might be disappointed with the workout because it's only 25 minutes, but I found that it perfectly rounds out the other barre workouts I do (the Bar Method, Pure Barre and Core Fusion). Because of its deep bends and stretches and rapid pace and flow, it becomes a cardio workout if you apply the necessary focus. It is empowering, yet calming and meditative with its physicality and I need this to complete my physical fitness routine. The production is great, it's so aesthetic to the eye and ear. It's unfortunate that \\"the Buddha\\" is offensive to some. For me, it's not a promotion of religion, but rather a symbol of peace, love and harmony with the earth and does not seek to disregard anyone's religious beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the want to be dancer.","review":"This is a great DVD for anyone who has some ballet experience but needs a little push. The instruction is fast. Up to tempo of the music. Would not be good for someone who needs step by step footwork instruction. I feel like I've had a good work out at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating and Not Challenging","review":"The constant voiceover is obnoxious and distracting. I never broke a sweat, and 25 minutes is not nearly long enough to be a good ballet workout. I'll stick to the NYC ballet workouts going forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"giant buddha on the set","review":"I did not like this workout. It goes too fast and also, visually, I'm not sure why it is necessary to have the instructor doing ballet in front of a big Buddha statue the whole time. I find it distracting and annoying. I am a Christian but I would find it equally odd if there was a giant cross sitting behind the workout instructor. For me it comes off as a religious promotion and is intrusive to me. In fact, I have seen other workout videos by Gaiam productions and this seems to be the case in at least 2 other videos. I understand that they produce a lot of yoga videos and they use these types of symbols, but something about it bothers me. I don't like it and am returning it and will not buy any other of their products for that reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big list","review":"This book is pretty much what everyone says it is. It is a big list of words without a ton of intuitive organization beyond general categories like elections, politics and military. The Army has always based its test and language teaching on items culled from the news, so a book like this would be very helpful for military linguists. It's probably also a decent selection of words for any student who wants to learn how to read the news. It would probably be most useful for people who are the types who like to learn a word a day, or memorize lists. It might be more useful if it were organized like a dictionary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a list of vocab words.","review":"Not a useful tool for learning media arabic. It's really just a list of common words found in arabic media. It would be more useful if they used the words in stories, so you could practice your comprehension. If that's what you're looking for, I'd highly recommend Media Arabic, by Alaa Elgibali and Nevenka Korica. It has the vocab broken down into sections, such as Summits and Meetings, and Demonstrations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely unorganized.","review":"This book was disappointing. It is extremely unorganized and difficult to use - in fact, I never use it. There is absolutely no organizational method applied to it. It's just a random combination of media words. If it were at least organized alphabetically, you could look up words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many useful terms but NO way to reference them.......","review":"This book really needs instead to be web-based or on a CD and have a search field where the user can type in English or Arabic word/words and get any matching results. To remain in print in hard copy it would need many alphabetically arranged sections to be useful. There's just no way to look anything up. I have found the short glossaries in the back of other media Arabic textbooks to be far more helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why no index?","review":"This book has a lot of useful terms, and is organized by topic, instead of alphabetical order. What makes this book useless is that there is no index to look up any of these words. You just have to memorize them. Tough cookies. If this book had a mere 3 pages of index materials, I would have bought it for (gasp!) $15 and felt that it was worth the money. As it is, it is NOT worth the money. I'm thinking of just sitting down and making an index myself, which might help me learn the words anyway, but I don't think I'll appreciate it.If you want to memorize 1,000 words in Arabic, this is the book for you. If you want a minimally useful reference (what is so hard about having a freaking index?) this book is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but worth the money","review":"This does have many words that you could find in the dictionary, but it also has many useful expressions that are not found in the dictionary. Every time I look through this I find a new expression that would be helpful for my speaking or writing. However, I wish it was a little better organized (maybe alphabetized) so that it would be easier to reference while reading the news."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Like most resources for those of us learning Arabic, this is disappointing. Others have already pointed out the lack of an alphabetized list of the words (preferably both in English and Arabic), but it's worth repeating since that lack makes the book too hard to use. Also, I noticed that on pp. 41-42, where words for various political situations and problems are listed, the book contains the word \\"hesitation\\" but not the word \\"crisis.\\" That's a strange decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a reference book, and not much else.","review":"Anyone who has spent significant time studying Arabic on their own will know that 90% of the learning materials out there are, for various reasons, not useful. Unfortunately this book ranks among the least useful of them. Its only justifiable use is for the rote memorization of terms. I bought this book as a reference for translating news articles, and foolishly assumed it would be arranged into some sort of logical order. While the forward claims that a thematic order has been imposed within the subjects of the chapters, and asserts that alphabetization \\"has a negative impact on the learning of vocabulary lists.\\"Any decent dictionary or comprehensive vocabulary builder could replace this book in terms of content and usefulness, while offering far more to the user besides. I would not recommend purchasing this book, and will not attempt to sell it for the same reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Disappointing because it is more like a 1000 word dictionary. I was expecting more phrases and terms difficult to look up in a standard dictionary. It has many words like malik(king), malika(queen) which an average person knows already and even if not can easily look up in a dictionary.It is still however useful for a beginner as a quick reference. The book could have been improved by adding flashcards and listing the words alphabetically. A fair price would have been around $5 to $6."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey you're buying DIRT","review":"I've been to Hawaii 4 times. They have dirt there, like everywhere else. This is some of it.

I don't need a therapist want-a-be telling me to \\"be all I can be\\" or \\"pick my motivational word\\".His cue changes during the DVD are minor - basically he asks that you increase resistance slowly and spin.

Why not replace the opening theme song as well. This is the only TV series on DVD I've come across where even the theme song has been replaced. I am certain it was not for any creative reasons like they tried to explain but simply to make more profits. Shame on Stupin and gang. I gladly pay $40-$50 for BTVS and $100 for XFiles and Star Trek. But I wouldn't pay 2 cents for any more seasons of Dawson's Creek on DVD. I am an avid fan of Dawson's Creek but I will tape reruns from now on. The broadcast versions were the real Dawson's Creek.

Chances are, I already know they will."},{"rating":"1","title":"destroying a series by ruining dvd's","review":"what are they doing to dawsons creek??? why can't we keep the memory alive? why change it?they changed almost every song! what you remembered on tv, the emotions will all be gone. demand nothing short of the original, not the watered down half-assed versionfor example, the first episode has only one original song. six of the other songs for the first episode are changed.in total, over 67 songs are gone! why oh why did they do this to us?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No way/Low Quality, fans deserve more","review":"Yeah the third season is great but after lose my money buying a very low quality second season i will not continue helping universal to sell so bad DVD collection of great TV shows.Even the fans of Buffy and Angel have their seasons in a good quality and price so it's better pay more for a good thing, than losing in this, no matter how good is this season as fans of this show we deserve more respect from universal who is selling us a piece of trash instead the jewel we are waiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Why Why...","review":"I just put in the first disc of Dawson's Creek season 3. First episode comes on. Intro--I am absolutely dumbfounded when the intro music comes on. What in blue hell? I was even more shocked when the music was changed to all my favorite scenes. I still can't believe it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST OF ALL SEASONS!!!","review":"No doubt, the begining of Joey and Pacey's love, so sweet and full of emotion till the end.It will make you thrill, cry, laugh... It's the season we all were waiting for since we've watched in tv. I can't wait to have it. If you're not in love with DC yet, watch this amazing season and you will."},{"rating":"1","title":"BRING BACK THE MUSIC!","review":"The quality of the season is not my focus of a review. The fact that the studio/producers chose to take out music that drove each show and replace it with music we've never heard of and not even of that time on radio, is a shame for fans of the show. Especially the replacement of the title song. I understand needing to save money but music is one of the key reasons this show swept us away. It's a shame that the producers/studio chose business over loyal fans who would pay good money for every season's dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the show's best season!","review":"...and here it is at last! The best season of one of the most addictive shows of our time. Season 1 was just a prelude. Season 2 was even better, and it introduced us to Andie and Jack - two terrific characters. But season 3 is where Dawson's Creek really begins to fly. The ensemble of actors have perfected how to pitch their performances, and the recurring neuroses of the early seasons give way to more gripping and more truthful insights into each of their lives.Beyond season 3, things start to go slightly downhill, with an increasing number of \\"filler\\" episodes. (Anyone remember the episode which was basically an advert for a No Doubt album?!!) Thankfully the producers gave the show a glorious send-off at the end of season 6... but this box set really does represent Dawson's Creek back in its prime.If you're on the verge of buying, don't hesitate a second longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"best season ever!!!","review":"this was the greatest season of dawson's creek because of pacey and joey. pacey reveals his feelings for joey and (yay) joey feels the same way about him. this is the season the begins the BEST couple ever in t.v. history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Season Three Sans Music","review":"I gave this DVD one star because I loved the third season of Dawson's Creek. Loved it. However, this DVD seriously disappoints. The most obvious problem is the new theme song, which is not \\"creative\\" at all, but a cop-out. And for a price comparable with other television series DVDs that managed to maintain their music, it strikes me as unnecessarily cheap. Many of the scenes where songs were pivotal to the plot have been made shallow by the cookie cutter replacement music that the DVD has the nerve to bill as a \\"special feature.\\" Particularly crass is the weblink to the site that sells the replacement songs as a new DC soundtrack. And the commentary has nearly nothing to do with the episodes they cover. Kerr Smith and Paul Stupin spend time discussing his direction of an episode in a later season and his appearances in movies. Save your money and tape the syndicated run on TBS. They still have the original theme song and soundtrack."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],C={key:0},M={key:1};function H(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(o(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(o(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",C,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(N,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-9c7f07ab"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/25.md","filePath":"quotesmag/25.md"}'),j={name:"quotesmag/25.md"},G=Object.assign(j,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
