NOBODY CARES!\\" to the tune of Beethoven's 5th.Since I've seen a lot of the episodes either when they were originally on FOX or now on Cartoon Network, I find myself looking forward to the commentaries more than the episodes with each new box set.Make sure you look for the ridiculous easter egg on \\"Tale of Two Santas\\"......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I will say that the quality of this device seems to be very high - it rolls smoothly and is made of heavy-duty materials. And in the end, what's most important about a piece of exercise equipment like this is that it works and lasts a long time - which I think this ab-roller will.I have a huge problem, however, with a company that charges about 5X as much as the lower-end brands of these ab-rollers, and then provides a terrible fit-and-finish. If this product was high quality and cost $15 or even $20, I wouldn't mind a poor paint job, but for a product that costs about $70 (with shipping), and comes with peeling paint on the hand-grips and rusty/flaky washers, I think it's reasonable to be upset with the manufacturer. I won't bother to return this, but I don't think I will buy their products again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A first rate workout tool","review":"I have used three of these ab wheels all made by different manufacturers. The first one was sturdy but the grip bar was too short requiring a very close grip (my hands had to be held close together). The second one from a major national retail chain that specializes in sporting equipment and clothing also was too short and so poorly made of plastic and lightweight foam that it fell about after being used four times. This 750 Lb. capacity roller is in a league of its own!You can grip it wide or close and use it everyday for years without fear of wearing it out. The only improvement I can suggest is for the manufacturer to use a gray or black wheel which would look better than brown. You get what you pay for in life and this product is well worth the extra cost if you are going to use it a few times a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Company.","review":"The product that was sent to me was wrong, didn't even look like the picture at all.

(I would recommend the very thorough KT Coates 2 DVD's. Check her out at [...]). Still, Pantera is a pole phenomenon and I admire her athleticsm.I like the red arrows that show you where to apply pressure to the pole but the shots are often cropped too close and you miss important details. Other key pieces of info are also missing (such as how to get into an advanced pose before an even more advanced pose). And she doesn't cover transitions at all.

Have read better previous works. Believe me as I have the whole P Jordan collection.When I read books by P Jordan, I like those which tug at the heart strings and have me rooting for the hero and heroine.

Enid Blyton has been criticised for sexism, elitism and racism. I can now see the first two faults in this book. George is a tomboy, and says to Jo, another tomboy, \\"You're as good as a boy.\\" Out of the Five, Anne is the only real girl, and in this story she plays a very minor role. She misses out on the real action. The lower class paper boy is treated with condescension by the author. There is also a disturbing level of violence directed towards Jo in this book. She is beaten by her father, and twice by Dick. Although Dick beats her by mistake, she still gets injured.On top of this, she doesn't mind when Dick beats her, because she likes him. This is a very unhealthy state of affairs.As usual the action is gripping,but the author's anti-social attitudes are a real worry."},{"rating":"1","title":"No vanilla coconut or milk","review":"This does not smell anything like vanilla, coconut or milk.

The option to extend the handle is nice as it helps balance the clipper better with the 22\\" blade. You can also move the top bar to various locations, though I didn't find that to be much of a big deal after all. Cut through all the thick new growth on my hedge nicely.I hate the fact I have to keep one hand on the top bar and the other on the handle all the time to keep it running. There are switches on both and you have to squeeze both fully or it stops working. Try doing that for three hours on a shoulder high hedge. I finally got fed up after my arms went numb and put a velcro strap around the handle to keep it continually depressed. Never had this problem with clippers before. Nice unit but gave me more of an arm and upper body workout than I needed. I wouldn't dare use it on a large hedge needing a ladder.

I easily attached mine to a 1.25\\" PVC pipe with a pair of metal straps, each with a bolt for securely tightening the strap to allow me to reach higher into bushes and trees to trim them back while standing on the ground. Of all of my electric power tools, my WORX trimmer is my favorite. I have two velcro straps to easily lock the two trigger electric switches ON, so I can control the power, plugging and unplugging the power cord, when the tool is not in my hands, it's on the end of the PVC pipe.

In the hands of a novice, your gut instincts may serve as well. In fact Jean Donaldson of the SFSPCA, in a small sample of 8 dogs, had a 75% WRONG rate. Dogs that failed went on to never bite anyone and a dog that passed wound up biting. Don't just take this test as science. It isn't. Notice that the author has referenced no other authorities but herself.It is an engagingly written book, and has much useful information, but the test is very, very controversial among shelter people and dog-knowledgeable people.Take it with a grain of salt. No, take it with several grains of salt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource for adopting a kid friendly dog","review":"We used the tests in this book to help us identify a dog that would be kid friendly. The book included excellent explanations and detailed tests you can give a dog. We used them on dogs during the adoption process and found the perfect dog for us. So based on results, I would say this book was worth the time and money. It wasn't the politically correct take on dogs, which I actually appreciated. So many adoption books are preoccupied with \\"abused\\" dogs or dogs that lash out because of abuse. While I find it sad and my heart goes out to abused dogs, I don't want to take any risks with my children. This author respects and accepts that there are people like me who can't take any chances with their children being bitten or mauled. She gives straightforward advice based on that acceptance and respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Helpful Book I've Ever Read About Dogs","review":"This is the most important, most helpful book I have ever read on the subject of dogs.

I did not have a receipt and expected to be unable to return the unit, but to my surprise Summer Infant agreed to send a new unit and a pre-paid shipping label to send back the defective one. The phone call to customer service took less than 2 minutes. Amazing - and much appreciated when you are trying to care for a newborn.

With six tunes clocking in at under 3 minutes and only one over four minutes, \\"Mojo Box\\" tosses you from tune to tune, most of which come with SCOTS' usual mix of wit and double entendre. \\"Doublewide\\" is probably my current favorite track, but pretty much every tune is enough to get my fingers banging on the steering wheel and my thoughts turning to bootleg liquor and some Carolina BBQ.A great addition to any southern rock CD collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaurenteed To Cure What Ails You!","review":"The SCOTS return with a little black box fulla cures and potions that'll make you wanna get up and dance!

The Inkspots were always coming and going. One guy would sing on one album, then he would leave or pass on to a greater venue, and another guy would take his place. One CD features a very young Ella Fitzgerald track.But all in all, the music and the style, regardless of the various replacements of the original singers, stand the test of time.

While this might be nice for folks inclined as such, I was hoping the concept of \\"oneness\\" would turn out to be more omnifaith in its approach rather than dedicated one expression of faith.

That said, I have to say my father is doing quite well at two weeks post surgery. He has been relatively pain free for 10 days and recouperating nicely. This book would have been funny to read AFTER surgery, but by no means should it be read in those scary, dark days after you have been diagnosed. It will cause alot of anxiety and stress. From all I can gather, many men do really well after surgery. Don't let your love one read this book. It is one man's extreme experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tells more about Korda than about prostate cancer","review":"Unless you are especially interested in Michael Korda, I strongly agree with those other reviewers in recommending that you DO NOT read this book before you decide on treatment or before you have surgery. The author of this book is a very sad case and far worse off than most opting for surgery. This book is worth reading AFTER surgery and you have begun to recoup a little. You'll at least feel good that you're not as bad off as this self-centered schmuck.For good personal accounts of surviving prostate cancer read Bert Gottlieb's and William Martin's books. Both of these books are deeply reflective and filled with hope and useful information. Also Robert Young's Phoenix5 web site has very useful personal accounts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping","review":"This is a gripping book that starkly conveys his emotions upon learning of prostate cancer as well as his experiences deciding treatment and the process.

No wife should let her husband read this book until four weeks after his surgery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice teaching resource","review":"I love the quality of this product!! The pieces are nice and big and very bright. We bought it to use it for our church preschool Sunday curriculum.My one negative comment is that the names of the \\"Fruit of the Spirit\\" (love, joy, piece) are printed onto the different baskets of fruit... i.e. Oranges ARE Gentleness! I would have prefered having separate name plates with each \\"Fruit of the Spirit\\" so that I could assign a fruit to it (since I want to use peaches which bruise easily to talk about gentleness). The blank name plates that are provided are a bit big to cover the \\"names\\" on the smaller baskets. If the baskets were not named, I believe the product would have wider appeal since \\"non-religous\\" groups could use it too just for teaching about different fruit, or just decoration."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"Interesting and create very good environment in Sunday school class and help children to memorize the fruits of the spirit and apply it in their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suitable for Practice and Demonstration ONLY","review":"I was looking for a spear head suitable for practice and demonstration only, not for actual application of spear technique.This spear head is well suited for show and not actual combat use.I like that it is longer that typical spear heads; installation was a breeze.

What's more, there is a significant mistake that was not in the novel or the TV series adaption. Has any other Christie fan spotted it? If you recall the story, the impressionist Carlotta Adams writes the last letter to her sister excitedly revealing that somebody payed her to impersonate Jane Wilkinson. Piorot eventually deduces that a middle page is missing and one word slightly altered in order to hide the identity of Carlotta's employer. So far so good. But then in the Ustinov version her letter ends: \\"..Anyway I'm visiting Lord Edgware tonight as Jane. Will let you know how it turns out\\". In the novel the letter says no such thing. And that is the whole point. Anyone who remembers the plot will realise this is precisely what Carlotta would NOT have written. Does anyone agree? But more to the point - given the soulless style of the movie - does anyone care?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book instead","review":"I am a big fan of movies from Agatha Christie stories, but I must say that this adaptation was not one of the better ones. Peter Ustinov has played Poirot well in the past, especially in Death on the Nile and Evil Under the Sun, and even in Appointment with Death. This movie, however, inexplicably places Poirot in the 80's, thereby defeating a lot of the appeal of these other films. Ustinov himself is still likable, but the supporting players seem out of place and halfhearted in their acting. The story is actually quite good, but it is much too difficult to look past the mediocre acting to enjoy it. Christie fans would be better off simply reading the book or watching David Suchet in another version of the story, called \\"Lord Edgware Dies.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"'Thirteen At Dinner' will make you rush for dinner!","review":"Horrible!

We do not have any chlorine smell in the shower and the shower stays cleaner longer. I like the fact that I can reverse the filter after 6 months and get even more life. Every shower in my home has these and we are all healthier for it. No hard science to back up my opinion, but we had a distinct odor before installing these and it is gone now. We have used these for about 9 months now and have just bought the first replacement filters which prompted this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cartridge filled with KDF, not as good as carbon block by DuPont","review":"This cartridge looks exactly like WFSSC0501 made by DuPont externally.

Good performance so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value, filter works well","review":"Yet, not perfect. I don't have the equipment to measure the amount of pollutants it removes from my shower water, but it does take out most (but not all chlorine), and for this price that's all I really care about.

Seems to really take a lot of the hard water out, and does leave skin and hair feeling better than with regular tap water. This filter seems to have good flow for about 3-4 months. It seems to have less and less flow as time goes on. The product can get to a point were it is almost not worth taking a shower. After the filter is at this point the only option is to purchase a new one, and Culligan wants almost double what Amazon wants for one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect introduction to 20th century Italian literature","review":"This book stands on its own thanks to its rare beauty, not because of its author's imprisonment.With its lyrical tone, cristalline yet misty quality, it is a very good book to read, and an ideal introduction to the rich and varied italian literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Love it, nice taste, makes mouth feel clean....arrived as promised....would purchase again....very natural does not taste like alcohol or any fake flavors"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"The bottle received looks nothing like the one pictured; it appears to have been packaged in someones kitchen.

Worst of all his tone is sometimes condescending and often outright offensive. He never mentions the Protestants he is at odds with, say Martin Luther on the True Presence or even R.C. Sproul. He appears well versed in the Church fathers and early church history, but somehow he is at odds with just about every historian(non-catholic ones) I've ever read. Go right to the source.

Discussions run longer than the group sessions. On topics of family dysfunction, generational addiction, parenting, recovery, labels and stigma, physical, social, psychological effects of addiction, on the correlation of alcohol and drug use and criminal justice involvement and children's protective services.

This is also a gross misrepresentation of \\"the most famous person in West Virginia.\\" What about military leaders such as Stonewall Jackson, Actress Jennifer Gartner, Actor Don Knotts, Singer Brad Paisley, late politician Robert C. Byrd, and many more? If you want a real story of West Virginia research how we became a state and used our knowledge of the constitution to some what illegally split from Virginia.

Until you learn that they even victimize each other. I suppose that the film makers tried to stay neutral, and neither praise nor condemn the Whites. But the many scenes of them being cheered on by neighbors, townspeople and even Hank Williams the 3rd have the effect of legitimizing their actions.

You can usually get this at Walmart and Target for about $1.60 a piece, so I don't know why anyone would pay the $45 for 12 that is currently listed here. It would be nice to buy a pack of 12 but you have to be competitive with B&M.

One was an apartment building, the other was a standalone single-family house. When playing music from my computer, I experienced pops on the speakers in each location - even after trying all chanels and switching to different electrical outlets - and even with the speakers running on batteries!!The speakers might be picking up interference from wireless phones or sunspots - I don't know and don't care. I will end up giving these to charity for a tax writeoff. I would not buy them again, nor do I recommend you purchase them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great speakers","review":"I bought these speakers to pair with a home theater in a box system for our master bedroom. I didn't want to have to run speaker wires clear around the room for the rear speakers. These speakers worked great right out of the box and I am pleased with them. They were the perfect solution to my challenge. I especially like the ability to increase or decrease the volume right on the speaker - in my application - right on the bedside stands. The only reason I didn't rate this product 5 stars was the fact that I have to turn them off when not in use, or I get a little hum and an occasionl crackle from them. That is not what your need in the middle of the night at the bedside. I assume it is from some electrical interference, but I prefer not to have to turn them on everytime I use them. Other than that, they worked great for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior product!","review":"I'd like to reiterate T. Van Leeuwen's frustrations with this product. I experienced the same poor quality of reception throughout my apartment, even within 20 unobstructed feet of the transmitter! Clicks, pops, and static drown out the sound that is actually supposed to emanate from these speakers. And note that the transmitter may interfere with other 2.4 Ghz appliances at home, including telephones and wireless routers. Sure, these are some of the cheapest wireless speakers on the market, but no one deserves to be swindled by this garbage. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"do not work","review":"After two months both speakers stopped receiving signal from transmitter. Tried new C cell batteries (They need 16, 8 each) but each would not work. Hooked up supplied power adapters and still would not work. Also with batteries inserted the speakers are to heavy for their stands and must be held down firmly by one hand while turning on or off with your other hand. If you try to use one hand to turn on or off the speakers fall over."},{"rating":"1","title":"noisy","review":"The wireless link produced lots of noise, even when channels were constantly changed. Any kind on a electro-magnetic field produced by refrigerators, dishwashers, or especially microwave ovens rendered the speakers useless. They produce a clicking noise when the path between the transmitter and reciever is broken, even slightly. I wouldn't buy them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speakers","review":"These speakers work pretty good, have two sets hooked to my surroun sound system, only draw a problem pick up interference when microwave in kitchen is turned on, other than that I am pretty happy with overall performance and sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was good. I like it.","review":"The book was over all o quality piece of work. I like it because it deals with the challenges and questions of a yong person like myself. I find myself asking the same questions as Antonio. Also, the plot was relatively interesting and it keeps the reader going most of the time. The descriptions of the Western United States make me want to be there. I love the fact that Ultima saved Antonio's life. Although it was a good book, I cannot give it a 10 because some sections do not keep the reader going on his own will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bless me Ultima","review":"This book was the most boring, dryest, and stupid book of all time. In fact the reason I didn't burned it was because my 10th grade english teacher Ms.Gomez suggested that i needed it to pass her class. As well as it not being my book.To all new readers i strongly suggest not buying this book,however, if your into reading books that in the end turn out to be a total waste of time and oxygen used to finish reading the book. Actually to be quite frank about this book it truly was work of endless stupidty by the insane Rudolfo Anaya. Thank you for your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring.","review":"In my ninth grade English class we have read this book. No one in the class enjoyed it. The dreams that Antonio has are strange and the writing is very bland, not to mention confusing before class discussion. I could not help being bored during this book. I would dread picking it up and reading for homework. I did not enjoy this book at all, Im sure many others will agree. It is not what I call a \\"masterpiece\\" thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, but chunky, C# and .NET tome","review":"If you are into the big tome-style language books you will like this one. It's only 1,300 pages, but it feels like 2,000. The book starts with a language introduction. That's pretty solid. The object oriented material is presented well. That gets you to about 1/3 of the way through the book. After that it's a lightning tour through various parts of the .NET framework, including both desktop and web application development.All of these books suffer from the same problem, too much content. So the content is thinned out a little bit in comparison to a full book on the same subject. For example, a book just on ASP.NET could take a 1,000 pages alone. In this book it's around 100 pages. If you have the cash, buy both a C# language book, and another book dedicated to the .NET application platform you are building on.BTW, my three year old daughter picked up the book and said, \\"Too heavy.\\" I agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's up with the index?","review":"In general, I like this book because it covers a lot of material fairly systematically. As a tech writer, though, I've got one observation I haven't seen here before - I use the index quite a bit and I find that, in many instances, the page listed has nothing to do with the index topic. That's pretty bad. A reference book should have a better index."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!!!","review":"I love it! the authenticity and the shipping box, all tag with the brand.

The book arrived without the dustcover, which for a bibliophile is akin to a painting sold without the frame...or something like that. Anyway, Coppleston's 15 volume tome has been regarded and accepted as the (definitive) discourse on the History of Western 'thought' since the late 1940's, and a re-reading of Vol. 1 (after nearly 30 years) has done nothing to diminish my sense of its stature or worth. The History is not 'easy' reading, but IS worth every minute of the time you can devote to it, especially in a world that seems to treat THINKING as passe.The only reason I reserved the fifth star is I'm still ticked about the missing dust cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, I agree, too many language quotes","review":"I agree with the reviewer below, entitle \\"Translations Needed..\\" I got really annoyed with the use of all the languages without any translations.

I suppose it's tolerable to listen to it, but there wasn't any other songs that I cared to hear again. Some of the songs I even hit the track forward button. I guess there comes a time in a band's career where they've topped out and they're not going to be able to reproduce their past quality. At least REO can tour and play their older music."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wouldn't get any better than this...","review":"Please don't get me wrong. This album isn't bad at all.It's just not REO. It doesn't sound the same, it doesn't feel the same.REO is a classic and REO is all the fans wanted to hear. Somewhere, in a shaded distance, \\"I needed to fall\\" finds its way home and slightly brings back the powerful, unmistakable REO sound. But only for a split second and like a familiar face in the crowd, it's gone.It's an honest album. But maybe it was never meant to be recorded.With no computers, no fancy editing tools, the remastered version of \\"Hi Infidelity\\" is a much better choice for the hardcore REO fan. And it gets better every time you hear it. \\"Find your own way home\\" doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"First of all, I'm sorry that the truth may hurt some here. Ok, nothing's new on this cd. It sounds like Building the Bridge III or IV. Keving Cronin's voice is utterly shot. Listening to him \\"try\\" to sing Hi Infidelity is just plain painful and unnecessary. Replacing him with a good singer would lift this band to better things. Journey replaced Perry with an equally impressive singer. REO is the only one that hangs on to their tired ways. And why re-do their best selling album? Leave it alone, and don't make a much inferior offer like they did. The new stuff is ok, except for the vocals. C'mon, Kevin hasn't had a good voice since Life As We Know It. I could't relax and sit back and enjoy the songs because I was working hard trying to pretend the vocals were good. They weren't. I was expecting an exiting cd. What I got was what I didn't want to realize (for the 5th time or so); that REO is DONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"REO rocks!","review":"I have listened to this CD several times, it is REO's best work in a long time and the best with the current lineup.

The current band sounds terrific and their new album is Great. I particularly liked the title cut \\"Find Your Own Way Home\\" and absolutely love \\"Dangerous Combination\\" I wish this album would have more publicity because it is better than much of the garbage out today.Now I am not saying all of todays music is bad, but this album warrants much more attention and recognition.

Would love to see you in Richmond, VA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine for the price!","review":"I was prompted to purchase this because of the other reviews I read, and I'm glad I did. It was easy to put together, and it's a great, smooth rower. I've never tried a rowing machine before, so it took me a few minutes to develop a smooth rowing technique, but now it feels natural. I like to row while watching shows I've TiVo'd. It's quiet, so it's easy to watch TV while rowing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Urgent Safety Information","review":"The seat stops suddenly in mid-back stroke, transferring a violent shock of energy to the spine and hips---there is no way to predict when this will happen at each stroke. The seat is attached to nylon rollers that move back and forth on the I-Beam and within a week or so, the rollers begin to shred, leaving small bits of nylon on the floor. Assembly is simple, and I can see no apparent cause for the shredding; perhaps the rollers become asymmetric with use. If the seat stops in mid-stroke once, it will continue to do so on a random basis. The machine is too bulky to return and it now rests safely in the municipal garbage dump"},{"rating":"1","title":"Arms of steel","review":"This product was great for about three weeks.

It's quiet and I got a great workout. Then it broke. So I returned it for a replacement. I really liked that one for two weeks, too. Then it broke. Both of them broke in exactly the same way. There's a weld where the arms are attached to the underside of the body and that weld broke on the left arm of both the original machine and the replacement machine. I don't know if it's a design flaw or the welder of the left arms is not up to snuff, but, fool me once, I'll get a replacement; fool me twice, I want a refund. Amazon.com has been great with their return policy. The company that made the machine has been unresponsive to my inquiries. So why 2 stars and not just 1? Well, I really like the machine for 2 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap rollers","review":"I found the rowing machine fairly easy to assemble, and seemed to be sturdy and well designed. I like the motion of the rowers and it is easy to adjust the tension. The problems came when I started working out with it. I weigh 170 lbs. and the first time I used it I began to see plastic shavings on the roller tracks. The seat still moved, but it wasn't very smooth. When I got down to look at why this was happening, I saw one of the rollers had fallen apart. The inner metal lining of the wheel had popped out causing the wheel itself to roll off kilter. I took the track apart to access the seat and rollers. I managed to slip the metal parts back in place. After I got it put back together and tried again, another roller did the same thing. I still have to contact the manufacturer and see if there are better rollers available. If not It is pretty much worthless as an exercise device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting worried after 1100 strokes XXXX update now failed.","review":"no point repeating 100 reviews so just this.SEAT HAS BEGUN to wobble @ about 1,000 strokes.

Pedal broke on third use and were replaced and a full set of rollers [now I will be sent another set]. Each time, I am supposed to remove and replace the parts myself, of course. Customer service is nice and helpful and parts are being shipped free and fast - but it doesn't make this machine acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheels on seat break off","review":"My rowing machine arrived yesterday. I went to try it out and almost immediately the wheels on the seat broke off. I called Stamina today for replacement wheels. The customer service person told me that they know there's a problem with the wheels. When I was telling my story, she immediately asked, \\"Is this the 1050..?\\" Many, many complaints about the same problem. They're working on getting better wheels, but they don't know when those improved wheels will arrive. In the meantime, they'll send me the same kind, though they're pretty sure that those wheels will break as well.My advice is not to buy this product until they have a breakthrough on the seat wheel issue. When that will be is anybody's guess.And I don't think much of a company that continues to sell a product that they know is defective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you can get one with all the parts!","review":"We bought this rower and used it for about a month before one of the black plastic foot rests broke. We contacted Amazon and they had us send it back for a new one. The new came with more than half of the pieces missing.

The prospect of having to deal with the manufacturer directly is a little too scary, so we will not replace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satified","review":"This rower is great, exactly what I thought I was getting. It's a good workout - aerobic as well as a muscular workout. It was easy to put together, inexpensive, and arrived on my doorstep very quickly!

I find that I do need to wear sneakers in order for my feet to stay in the straps, but other than that, no complaints!Well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value for the money","review":"The build quality was surprisingly good for the price. The free shipping is what sold me. Read the directions closely and you put this together in thirty minutes or do like me and skim them and take ninety minutes. The machine feels quite sturdy and is QUIET. I can't believe you will find a better rower for the price with free shipping. If it only last a year under daily use I will consider it a bargain. One more bonus, it folds for storage so if space is at a premium this is the one to purchase.After several weeks of use piston developed a small oil leak which required me to put newspaper under the piston when ever I exercised. It didn't make more noise but could ruin the carpet or flooring if not dealt with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value for the Price","review":"I've used this product once so far.

Also, if you get a little off center, the seat won't slide. For the price, excellent value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact and sturdy","review":"This is great for the novice. Not so sure the plastic seat and gliding mechanism can withstand constant significant usage. Also note that there is a 250lb weight limit. Not sure I saw that in the original review.

It is well built, strong and stable on a carpeted floor. Light enough to move around so it needn't be intrusive in small rooms. My only complaint is the foot rests--my heel slips off too easily. Helps to have sharp heeled shoes as opposed to rounded, but the toe straps have to be almost uncomfortably tight. Otherwise, fine little machine. I plan to wear it out!Update 1/7/12: Wore the seat rollers out after less than 1000 strokes. I've alerted Stamina. Standby...."},{"rating":"2","title":"inexpensive workout","review":"I am sure purists would not like this inexpensive rowing machine , but for the money you get a good low impact workout in a short time. I don't know how long it will last; no major problems, just doesn't look like it would hold up in a gym for very long. I had a minor problem with the strap holder on one of the foot pads breaking and they replaced it immediately no questions asked.

I got it yesterday and put it together. Construction is a bit of a project, especially if you don't check all the little packages it comes in..I swore up and down that it was crazy for a machine like this to come without tools to put it together (fortunately I had hex keys) and it seems I was right since I finally found the included tools after assembling the majority of the machine.

I liked how it folded up for storage too.I had no issue with the foot rests. Like most cardio equipment with footstraps, this one is made to use with shoes, and once I put shoes on, I had no problems with the feet. However, about 3 minutes into the workout I started to hear and feel a grinding on the seat. When I flipped over the machine and took a look at the wheels, I could clearly see where the wheel broken somekind of support washer. I was kind of surprised the grinding came upon me slowly and gradually. When I had read about the potential problem I thought I'd be more of a sudden failure. Anyways, I returned it immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"Put this treadmill together it was working fine for a maybe 30 minutes.1) The footrests are garbage.

The Body Trac Glider is great for my type of workout, I need something to get my heart beat up (aroebic) but not hurt my back. This is the right machine for that.

I didn't check under the chair, so I used my own tools before discovering tools and parts. I should have read the reviews in more detail to catch this detail (adding the chair is one of the last steps of the instructions).I'm 5'10\\", so it works fine for me. Tension is good and seems smooth. The biggest issue I had was the pedals. I used the u-bolt trick that others have recommended. Now, my feet stay on without issue. I now get a nice workout without stopping to strap in my feet all the time.I recommend using the American madeSupermats Heavy Duty P.V.C.

However, it does mostly work, and is cheap and takes up less space than most machines. Keep in mind it is not suitable for a tall person at all.

This doesn't really do much for the legs, and while you can work up a sweat and raise your heart rate, you can't really go full out. The equipment can't handle it. The footrest straps aren't located effectively, so you really have to pay attention to your feet and even then they still slip out and you have to stop.Recently the piston seemed to lose some oomph, and I've only had the thing for a month or so. It doesn't provide resistance through the full stroke, but only through the latter half of it. I haven't contacted the company yet to see what the deal is with that.My advice; it's cheap, it raises the heartrate, it can be stored upright, it's a decent indoor workout, so it's probably worth buying if those are important attributes. If you want an intense workout, this isn't it. You might be better off with one of the flywheel types of rowers. Some of those are less than $200."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"* thought it would fit under the bed from reading specs but it is about 18\\" high.* about the 10th time i used it the right foot strap broke.* it also creaks* i would not buy it again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine if you're tall with big feet","review":"I usually find the reviews to be really helpful here and have never felt compelled to complain about a product but this machine is just too big for me.

First off, like a lot of other reviews, mine also was missing screws needed for assembly.The other problem is that the pedals are absolute junk. I can't keep my feet in them (size 9 1/2 shoes), so the machine is really unusable. Also, one of the velcro straps ripped at the seam in the first 3 minutes of me trying to work out.If the pedals weren't so terrible, I think it would be a nice machine. As it is, I'm going to try and rig something up to hold my feet on.*UPDATE*I've come up with a solution to the pedal problem. I drilled two holes in each pedal and attached a U-bolt.

If you have big feet, then the Velcro is located in the correct place. I resolved the problem putting 12 size shoes on, just to use this machine.Also, I'm a very sedentary person that wanted to improve my physical condition but this machine is not a challenge, because this machine only have ONE cylinder (the resistance of the machine) that after ten minutes of normal work it get too hot than the oil inside become liquid, therefore the machine loose all its resistance. After that you have to wait more than an hour before the cylinder get cold againI don't recommend this machine. 10 minutes of work are useless.

At under $150, you don't expect much these days. Unfortunately this was true; I got a couple weeks of (noisy) workouts before the left oar broke at the weld joint. I also had to make a modification to shorten the travel of the seat as it glides backward; it's definitely not designed for shorter people. The squeaking noise makes for an annoying workout -- so avoid late night routines.

I wanted to have and use it long enough to get a good feel for it before writing a review. Assembly wasn't bad at all. A little time consuming, but all the parts and pieces were there. The instructions were clear enough. Once using the machine, I was kind of surprised at how easy the glide is. The foot rest areas do make a noise each time you glide, but after a bit I don't tend to notice it much. It has proven to be a really great overall exercise. I can feel it in my abs, glutes, thighs, calves, arms, and chest more than anywhere. The motion doesn't hurt my wrists and shoulders, which is what I was worried about. If anything, I feel like I have a little better flexibility in those areas than I had before.(Being a full-time student I have to write A LOT!, so thus the concern for those areas.)

Really, there are not many parts though, so be fairly confident it will take around 15-30 minutes....Everything seems to work fine and I like it and am very happy with stability and smoothness ect... However, the main flaw of their design is the foot pedals!! One strap, with a very small back lip to hold your feet in. When rowing, your feet are moving constantly and help control your movements. After about 5 minutes, the straps start moving, and your feet come undone, which is frustrating. I have size 8.5 feet for reference. I'm working on a quick solution, but haven't come up with a perfect resolution yet. In any case, it is also very lightweight, and folds nicely.

Also REALLY like that all the hardware used to assemble is made from QUALITY STAINLESS !!!

The picture is perfect and the sound, guys, this just sounds awesome! No speakers on the stage, all the musicians wear Ultimate Ears custom headphones ($900) and it obviously works great! Not a single mistake, everything is so clear and Seal is just one of the best singers. How this guy can sing, that's unbelievable!Go ahead and buy, worth every penny!

James Moody is responsible for some of the most soulful jazz recordings ever made. On saxophone an excellent example is \\"Yvonne\\", a ballad by Johnny Pate that Moody digs deep to squeeze every drop of emotion from. On flute, \\"There She Goes\\" and \\"The Moody One\\" are solid arrangements with Moody's flute floating above the tight horns and forcing the listener to pay attention.The LP is only 27 minutes long and that includes a 45 second false start which is a worthless additional track.

My daughter could have asked for another model or brand, but she did research and was set on getting the TI-89. This was most useful for use in her AP Calculus and Physics classes so she checked and found that this would also be among the preferred model in her college classes.This is a seriously complicated device with a large learning curve and is likely more calculator than most people will ever need, but for those that do need these functions this is likely the right choice. I have only used it a few times out of desperation and was able to navigate the basic functions.Highly Recommended!CFH"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but not for basic classes.","review":"I was forced to buy this calculator for an Introduction to Calculus class, and I'm generally very pleased. It does everything I wished my TI-84 did, and more. For example, it will integrate, differentiate, zero functions, and display fractions and radicals automatically. The clock is nice too.Strangely, it takes a significant longer time to graph. Timing it, my TI-84 will graph y=x in around 1 second. The TI-89 takes around 4, and takes even longer to graph more complicated functions.I also takes a lot of button pushing to accomplish basic tasks. To find the sin(.75) it takes me 9 buttons versus 6 on my old calculator. Doesn't seem like a lot, but since I'm only doing basic tasks the calculator wastes more of my time than it saves.Overall, it's a really nice calculator, but don't buy it if your not going to utilize it correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calculus Useage - High School","review":"Overall, this is a pretty good calculator. However, it should be noted that it does take some time getting used to, especially when switching from a TI-83. The graphs are exceptional and there are many new options. Actually the amount of things it can do is both exhilerating and frustrating at the same time. One negative point is that when you enter in a simple calculation, like 734/87, it will NOT give you the decimal answer and will just leave it in fraction form. I hate that. Therefore, simple calculations are no longer simple on here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent calculator in most circumstances, but...","review":"I purchased this calculator for my Calculus I class and am now using it for my Calculus II class.

I've been a TI-83 user for years and love the TI-83. First, what I don't like about the TI-89. The screen is too small for what it tries to do. The viewing angle is critical. Because so much is crammed on a small screen, given the critical viewing angle, this baby is tough to read. Numerics are much smaller than the TI-83.Yes, its powerful, with many functions the average person will never need. Like Boolean expressions. If you're a logic designer this may be useful, but you shouldn't need a calculator for that. And finance?

I never realized until recently that my unfiltered public shower water was the real problem.This shower filter was affordable, quick to install and makes my skin and hair feel so much better. The only downside is that I do not want to get out of the shower... it's like a spa now. Great investment for the whole family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it.","review":"I am stunned at the number of positive reviews for this product. We have very high water pressure (our outside lawn hose nozzles never last through the summer, they always explode) and found this shower head greatly decreased the pressure. Yes, both stickers were removed from the filter, tried repositioning the filter, no help. Also found that due to the low pressure, the different water patterns didn't work...dribbled straight down. Returned it, but out shipping and return shipping charges. Have decided to save up for a water softener."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG!","review":"I bought this to filter out the chlorine.

However, I realized right away the ability to change the spray setting was broken. Despite that, the pressure was an improvement over my prior one so I kept it. About 4 months in I had the problem I've read in other reviews where it wouldn't stay up anymore, it just lays down and sprays straight down. Plus the plastic ring inside broke and it started squirting all over. Customer service acts like they'll send a replacement if I show them my receipt, but I'm not really sure I want to give this product another try anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great filter","review":"Upon first using after installation,I immediately notice difference on my hair and skin just like advertised.At first, after installation there was a small leakage, solved by using atool to make more tight on leakage area.

When I got it I followed the instructions, put it together, tightened it up and then turned the water on.As soon as I turned the water on the threading on the large end (the end you insert the filter into) popped from the pressure (and I don't even have that much water pressure) and now I can't get it apart since it popped off the threading diagonally. So it's locked together and no matter how hard I try it won't come apart.Great product Culligan!!

After that, the weight of the filter in the head begins pulling the shower head straight down. No matter how you position it, it droops straight down, so you can't aim it anywhere. This is my 2nd one, and they've both done this. I'm not sure why there are so many good reviews of it, maybe they're making this cheaper than they used to. I'm surprised Culligan would sell something with this basic of a design flaw.There is a hand-held version of this shower head that I'm going to end up buying instead, because the filter is nice to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least effective shower filter","review":"This shower filter leaves my hair more dry and snarly like. I see there are high reviews for this filter but I disagree. Maybe the reviewers are not familiar with a lot of different brands as I have been forced to do-- I live in a hard water area and I also have naturally dry and very coarse hair- a lethal combination. So, I have experimented with several different filters and the best brands I have used are Sprite, Paragon and Aquasana. So, maybe this filter reacts differently depending on your water quality and type but I did not like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like showering now!","review":"Not that I didn't use to.But I recently moved to a town that has super hard water which made me dread taking showers. I've only been living here for about 5 weeks, but within that time my hair has started to get really dry, my scalp has become extremely itchy and flaky, along with my skin. I decided that there was something that I had to do about it so I ordered this product.Oh my lord. This product is a life-saver. My skin feels noticeably more hydrated after showers and my hair is slowly starting to get back that old luster I once had about 5 weeks ago. Unfortunately, I haven't had this long enough to comment on the longevity of the filter, but I will update the review after I start seeing a decline in filtration quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleans my dirt water great!","review":"I live in an apartment building that has city water that comes out smelling of sulfer and occasionaly brown. My hair felt disgusting and I felt like I smelled like the water and was self conscious about this until I got this filter. Since I got the filter, the shower water feels so much cleaner, does not smell and never comes out brown. This filter is really great and I'm so glad I chose this one. The power and options of the shower head are also a very nice feature. The water comes out strong with a lot of water pattern choices. This is the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"It works well, I believe. I think the water smells much cleaner. I don't know if I notice much of a difference in my skin/hair.

I will not even take my medications with water straight out of the tap. Everything is filtered. I stumbled across this product and thought how wonderful it would be to take a shower in filtered water. No more calcium and who knows what else in my hair or on my skin.It was pretty easy to mount since I read the reviews and saw how to prevent the leaking. But, honestly, I cannot tell any difference in the water. I filled a glass with the water coming directly from the shower head and it tasted just like the water straight out of my tap. I would not recommend this to anyone for anything other than just a plain 'ol shower head."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think the filter does anything","review":"It is bulky and the sole reason why i bought it was for the filtering.

If only they could figure out the longevity issue, this shower head would be top notch."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not as good as others say","review":"This filtered shower head only reduces the Sulfur odor by a LITTLE, it DOESN't really help if you really have a water problem. Please be advised that the performance of this product highly depends on the incoming water quality. It ONLY works if you have a minor issue on chlorine or sulfur contamination.Most importantly, it DOES NOT reduce metallic (rust) taste in water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Showerhead for the Money","review":"I've been using the Culligan Filtered Showerhead for about four months. It softens the hard water that comes from my boiler, and eliminates the slight sulfur smell that it carried. Dry skin is markedly reduced, without a change in soap. The showerhead achieves a useful increase in water pressure, and offers several pleasant settings.Construction is a bit flimsy: this is chromed plastic, not brass or steel. Once mounted, you wouldn't know it. Water pressure has twice broken through the seal to the filter compartment. Simply unscrewing the compartment a few turns, then screwing it back in, resolves the issue.This is not a lifetime piece of plumbing, but it does what it claims, affordably and unobtrusively. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knob for spray settings doesn't turn","review":"The shower head was easy to install but the grey knob to adjust the shower settings does not turn when the water is on. It turns fine when the water is off but of course that doesn't help much. :-) The shower settings were just a bonus but I feel like the product is defective and I didn't entirely get what I paid for.

Gradually, even with a good cleaning, they become less efficient, and clogged. I've never really noticed our showerheads before, but as soon as I tried this one, I sure did.It's very sturdy, and the spray is just fantastic. Like many showerheads, it has a choice of different spray settings.But here's the best part - the shower comes with a filter that is advertised as reducing 99% of the chlorine which gets rid of sulfur orders and scale.You notice this right away. This is going to sound odd, but the water just feels cleaner, and has a fresher scent. Couple this with the great spray, and you've got a really terrific showerhead.The only drawback to this filter is that is has to be changed every 6 months. But it's worth it.I am now hoping that this showerhead will last a lot longer than my other ones. And did I mention that it's super easy to install?Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of fake postings from marketers","review":"I got this product elsewhere. It cannot do what needs to be done, which is to remove CHLORAMINES from your water. If you want real water filtration you have to use a whole house filter, combined with reverse osmosis, and it costs a lot more than this showerhead.I also want to call your attention to the many marketers who are posting reviews for products like this. You can see the ones who say amazingly glowing things about the products, but were not amazon verified purchasers. They actually are hired shills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does this do anything","review":"I just installed this and tested it with a kit that tests alkaline, chlorine, pH, and hardness.

Thanks, Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, even after almost 4 years!","review":"I bought this shower head 3 1/2 years ago when I moved to Texas and had heavily chlorinated water that was absolutely killing my hair and skin. I noticed an immediate difference, even in the smell of the water, and flipped the filter about 6 months after I first installed it, but haven't changed it since--I moved back to California 2 1/2 years ago, and left the filter alone when I re-installed the shower head at my current place. (I actually got on here to buy a replacement filter, although I don't know if I really even need one.)This is a great product with a long life, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm","review":"I've had dry itchy skin and scalp for a while and stumbled upon this product. Although skeptical of the claims, the filter works great. Hair immediately felt softer and silkier. I live in Florida and the water can sometimes have a sulphery smell that has also gone away. I can honestly recommend this product to anyone. I deducted a star because I wish it had the 1.5 gpm rating of the water efficient shower heads now available. They can save 2000 gallons of water a year over a 2.5 gpm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"Fort Worth water is not good water - its very hard water. It dries the heck out of my hair ( which is thick, brown, wavy). I wish I could share the glowing reviews, but alas, I have not yet found a cure for my dry, brittle hair that has been suffering from mineral deposits.- Water pressure: For a filtering shower head, this delivers great water pressure. The massage setting is almost like a swedish massage.- Smell: It reduced some bad smells from my water, not all.- Chlorine: I can smell that the chlorine has been significantly reduced.- Other minerals: still present.I can see that for a medical purpose, this would be a good shower head, but it seems to filter only chlorine, and not the other junk.

It's mid-December and the my skin is dryer than usual anyway but after a shower with this head it doesn't feel as dry. Our usually strong water pressure doesn't feel as strong with it, but I guess that's because it filters so much of the water.

I didn't notice any difference in my hair, definitely not on my skin and the \\"smell\\" as everyone described was the same too. The water pressure is good and its just an ok plain old showerhead.

I called the water department to make sure we had chlorine and not chloramine. That is the case and, so far, this thing does its job well. It's also very comfortable to shower under. The stream is of good strength and spread. The only thing that bothers me a little is that it's mostly plastic, including some crucial fitting parts.I'm still glad I bought this, though.---update---We've had this for years, now, and it still works very well and the plastic parts I had been worried about have not broken.

Of course, once the filter ran out, I noticed my skin was becoming irritated again. That's how I knew for sure that it was the filtered water! The only reason why I've given this 4 stars versus the full 5 is because I noticed that my shower head has gotten kind of loose after 3 years. I've tried to tighten it up myself but no success. Maybe there's something in there that I need to replace... idk, I'll have someone else look at it. Either way, I'm on my way to purchase another filter because my eczema is flaring up again.

No head/solo/head forms. Although he sometimes plays 'too many notes', it's in more of a Coltrane wall-of-sound modal way. The compositions give a warm homey feel reminiscent of String Cheese Incident, almost anthem-like, but in a good way. I've only sampled his other albums, but this seems much more successfully impressionistic.

Furthermore, some, especially \\"A Small, Good Thing\\" are less depressing and, in my mind, actually very good.Don't assume you know these stories because you've seen the film of the same name directed by Robert Altman. He said himself (in the book's intro, actually) that he took liberties with them, and believe you me, he REALLY did. You may even appreciate the stories more after seeing the film. I did, but that might be just me.Do take a look at these stories regardless, though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction to Carver's cold world","review":"This short, digestible collection of a handful of Carver's stories makes a good introduction to his work.I haven't seen the movie, but reading Robert Altman's superficial, self-congratulatory introduction suggests to me that it probably wasn't very good.Nonetheless, I guess some good came of the movie, because it resulted in the publishing of these stories together, unencumbered by the overwhelming hugeness of most Carver collections that are still found in stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good So Far","review":"I watched the movie and loved it. Altman is a master. His films have a depth and execution which other directors salivate over. I've only read the first few stories of this book so far. I'm very impressed. The stories are very short--between 5 and 10 pages each. They tie in very well to the film, but in many ways the book is superior to the film. He writes about common folk, and he speaks very plainly. It's very refreshing to see writers that don't \\"talk down\\" to their readers. People that talk down or have superiority complexes are very annoying. Especially when they are co-workers, and you work in retail.I work with a guy who has these kinds of annoying traits, and honestly I ignore the guy as much as possible. Everyone thinks he should be \\"86ed\\" from the joint but we'll have to wait and see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to a great writer...","review":"In my opinion, Raymond Carver is among the top five short story writers of the twentieth century. His stories are bold, contemporary, and never boring. This compilation - used to make the Altman film - is a superb sampling of his work. Some of his best stories are here, such as \\"Will You Please Be Quiet, Please?,\\" \\"So Much Water So Close to Home,\\" and the heartbreaking, \\"A Small, Good Thing.\\" \\"Tell the Women We're Going\\" is one of the most shocking short stories I've read recently. In his introduction, Robert Altman writes, \\"what he really did was capture the wonderful idiosyncrasies of human behavior, the idiosyncrasies that exist amid the randomness of life's experiences.\\" This is a good introduction to his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbelievable","review":"i'm sad that this is the quality of writing being offered as popular african american literature. i felt embarrassed, as if i was reading a pornagraphic harlequin romance. and the overt prejudice (basically, all white people are against black people) is just absurd."},{"rating":"1","title":"please read","review":"mr hardy's book was digusting because of how he made it seem like it was right for the man to have his little son around his boyfriend that was just wrong and furthermore it's wrong for james hardy to condone homosexuality because it is an abomination against god and all who are homosexuals will suffer with god's eternal hellfire. i hate the awy james hardy tries to condone homosexuality it's just wrong he needs to pray and ask god to deliver him from that evil spirit of homosexuality."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Go Boy","review":"This is a wonderful book. I hate romance novels but this book tells of a romance that was both beautiful and tragic. Raheim and Mitch were characters that I interact with everyday. My friends that are gay have a similar problem. Both are gay but the male in the relationship has a problem admitting what he is. Raheim has this same problem. He is gay but feels that by admitting who he is he is less than a man. Mitch knows who he is and is not ashamed of who he is. Their resulting clash made me cry. When Reheim hurt Mitch I wanted to hurt him myself. Buy this book it is a beautiful love story between two gay men. Even if you're not gay you'll enjoy this well written, compassionate book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a word of honesty about B-Boys","review":"James Earl Hardy has managed to capture, in I imagine, a from his own experience account, the most honest and surprising story of what is like dating and loving B-Boys. Hardy carefully describes the many emotional mood swings of B-Boys, where B can very well stand for Bi-Sexual, especially in confused Raheim's case. I appreciate this story finally being told, and I strongly recommend reading of other works by Hardy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I'm a huge fan of E. Lynn Harris so I thought that by reading James Earl Hardy, I would be able to add him to my list. But this is only the first book and it wasn't bad at all. I thought Mitch and Raheim's story is unique in the sense that even though they are a gay couple, you can relate to them and put yourself in Mitch's shoes and think from a woman's perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously Disappointing","review":"I'm depressed at the thought that this novel is held up as the definitive black, gay experience. It's poorly written, juvenile, and the end moral is disgusting--the main character goes back to his man after he gets beaten up. Not to mention the obvious issues that the author has with white people that runs throughout the entire book. Interestingly, he has much to say about how white people are horrible, but fails to meaningfully address homophobia in the black community and shamelessly objectifies working-class and poor urban black men. Don't waste your money on this childish trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISTURBING!!!!","review":"This book was (sexually) too graphic for me. It left nothing to the imagination. I couldn't even finish the last couple of pages as Rahiem and Mitchell made-up. I'm not homophobic, but the vivid pictures of two hard bodies rolling, grabbing and thrusting were really disgusting. Don't get me wrong; I loved E. Lynn Harris' books and probably because they weren't so vivid and they let you paint your own pictures in your own mind and they (pictures) didn't stay with you and they were just better books and I also agree with another customer whom said they became ill every time they read the word \\"jood\\". Although I am curious to read Rahiem's point of view. I just don't know if I'm curious enough to buy it. My girlfriend said she'd probably pick it up and I'll wait to read hers. My next book money is going towards the last two Lynn Harris books that I've missed. Sorry, Mr. Hardy."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO JOOD","review":"This was the absolute worst book I have ever read. It was incredibly juvenile and I simply became ill every time I read the word \\"jood.\\" It was not very realistic, I was sick of reading how they kissed \\"down\\" and the way Raheim reacts to Mitchell in one scene is downright disturbing! Would it have been done this way if this were a story about heterosexuals? There's more to a relationship than sex and kissing \\"down.\\" I think if I were a little younger, perhaps 15 or so I would have enjoyed this book, however, since I am 23 years old-I have to say I will NOT be purchasing books 2 and 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Lil Bit and Pooque!!!!","review":"I love Pooque and Lil Bit's story this story is so gripping you will think that you are actually in the room and when everything is going down!

To make matters worse the secondary characters are not even interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Even Makes Coffee!","review":"My Pac-Flat does fit into the soft sock my lantern came in, it won't fit into the neoprene one though. It does a great job of redirecting the light from the candle lantern and it focuses it enough to even read by at night. My title also hints at the other way it can be used. It comes with a little card that shows you how to use the opened reflector and a drip coffee filter to make yourself a cup of hot (or iced I guess) coffee while you are out in the brush. Just invert the reflector over your cup, line it with the filter, put the coffee into the filter and pour the hot water over the grinds. It will percolate through the grinds and into your cup and brew a nice cup of Joe, not strong enough? Run it through the grinds again.Along with either the mini or the regular Candle Lantern, this is a great accessory and is easy for me to recommend to any camper or person who wants to have it handy for power failures."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a great movie.","review":"I recommend this movie to anyone who likes independent films such as Wristcutters: A Love Story or Henry Poole Is Here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very trippy","review":"Dear Whomever,I loved this tale of 4 dysfunctional characters.

It is made of cheap plastic, and under no circumstances trust your iPod in it not to get wet and get ruined. Also be aware that it DOES NOT FIT ALL iPods!!!! I have a 30 gig iPod and I cannot get it in there all the way because the wire that connects into the head set plug stops it from setting in correctly, which in turn stops me from putting in the bottom cover. Those little lights are a joke also. All in all I would have rather paid a little more money for a better built one. Also you can not navigate through your songs once you have put it in the radio. This thing is just all around CRAP!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unworthy, hard to use.","review":"This novelty item might have been useful, but it's unwieldy and hard to use.First of all, the iPod holder is a slot that you access through the bottom. You open the door at the bottom, and plug it into your headphone jack. Then you press play, and shove the entire iPod into the slot, and close the door and turn the latch. Then, you have no way of controlling the iPod again.Since it takes 30 seconds to get the iPod in, and 30 more to get it out, and there's no way to control it while it's in, this is really quite useless.And the sound is tinny and crappy.Do not buy. You'll be happier with any set of iPod speakers you can set on the counter, since you still won't be controlling it from inside the shower."},{"rating":"2","title":"radio","review":"The only thing is that you need to take the mp3 player/ipod to change song,artist,etc and its a snug fit for the Ipod Classic.

Who normally places a tall piece of furniture right in the middle of your child's room?? It has a constellation chart, which is useless, because the stars are blurry and distorted in arrangement. The colors don't change automatically and it seems to be more of a distraction to my son's falling asleep than anything. When I saw the list price for this in an airline magazine, I was astounded. I wouldn't pay more than $10 for this cheap novelty item."},{"rating":"1","title":"not again","review":"this was the second time i got the turtle, and the thing only lasted one week until it just went dead. I am not happy with the product and my son loves it but what can i do, maybe i got 2 turtles that were no good from the beg, anyways, when it worked it was so relaxing and cool for my son, unfortunately we did not have good luck with the turtles. I do recommend the product only when it works because if it does not work then you would have to pay shipping again to send the thing back =("},{"rating":"1","title":"great concept, bad execution","review":"I bought this item because it had good reviews, and looked really cool. It's a turtle with 3 different colored LED lights on the inside that are supposed to project stars in a room or on a ceiling.Of the 3 colors - green, amber and blue - only the green and blue are noticable in pitch black. The amber is almost a waisted option because you can't see it.My problem with this item is it only works in pitch black, and barely in that case. The product shots show it sitting on a nursery floor shining up at the ceiling, this is sooooo impossible. The turtle needs to be at least 2 feet from the ceiling in order to see any of the stars.A total disappointment. I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Getting Moneys Worth","review":"I bought this expecting alot more, it has 3 buttons to change colors and thats all it does. There is no movement ,no sound nothing, it just shows stars in 1 spot and 1 spot only.. Not worth the money.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Ladybug","review":"I thought this was a NEAT idea but the projector isn't as strong as I was hoping for. You have to set it on something closer to the ceiling to really see the stars/constellations. Although, that's probably a good thing if this is used to make the baby sleepy (Dont' want to excite the little one with all the commotion of the lights!) It's a cute idea and I'm glad I bought one. My daughter is only ten months right now and doesnt use it, but I know when she's older she will. Overall, glad I purchased it. Great for the Price!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cute but harmfull","review":"my 18 month old loved the twilight turtle ,that is until a part of the plastic shell broke and cut him , (3 stiches), a good nitelite for infants , but by no means is it a toy for older babies. buyer beware"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most over-hyped item i have purchased at Amazon","review":"This is the dumbest thing I ever bought.

Well worth the money. My son is Autistic and loves anything with lights. He seems to be very comforted by the light.

My daughter is 9 months old and is facinated by the stars on the ceiling. My 3 and 5 year old nieces also love it. I usually place it on our spare bed or on our bed. It also works great if my daughter wakes up at night. I'll turn it on and the subtle light is great and will automatically go off after 45 minutes. It is soft and light weight. She likes to play with it during the day, too! I would't say it is a necessity, but it is cute for a child who has everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"stopped working after 4 months","review":"Both the twilight turtle and the sleep sheep stopped working after just 4 months.

I am returning it for refund right away. Also didn't come with what they said would be in the box, i.e. 3 AAA batteries, constellation guide, etc. Normally I am a huge fan of Amazon, but this was really disappointing as now I will have to find another vendor to send me the correct product so I can try to get my 4 year old to sleep through the night!

I highly recommend it for a quieter bedtime routine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 3 year old son loves this but...","review":"This is a slick night light. My 3 year old son loves to play with it. I would recommend it with a couple of comments.First, I bought it thinking that I could control the functionality more than I am able. It is battery operated and has a set timer that the light will go off. My plan was to be able to plug it into a timer which would then be plugged into the wall. I wanted to be able to leave the light on throughout the night. He hates to sleep in the dark so as soon as the light goes out he starts calling for me. He also gets up in the morning and comes into my wife and my bedroom. The intent was to tell him that if he woke up and the night light wasn't on he could come into our room and to set the light so that it would be on until about 6:30 am.It is what it says it is. I didn't think to look to see if it was corded or only battery operated though."},{"rating":"2","title":"18 mos son loves it!","review":"I bought this for my almost 18 month old son, to help with sleep training. I didn't realize it turned off after 45 minutes. Since he is in a crib, I can't put it anywhere near him (don't want to put it in the crib) for him to turn back on. However, for him, it doesn't seem to be an issue. I can also turn it on if I have to go in his room to check on him and it doesn't wake him up. The fact that the starts don't move is great--it's not distracting--it's rather soothing.When it's not bed time, he loves to play with the turtle. He has gotten attached to it, even though the shell is hard and not soft! This was a great addition to our bedtime routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"we love it","review":"My four year old son who has recently developed a fear of the dark loves this turtle. He is excited to turn off the lights now to see the stars. The only thing to be aware of is that the entire shell is hard plastic so it is not really a cuddle toy like I thought it would be. We just set it next to his pillow out of his way but close enough for him to reach over and turn on if he's scared."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Night Light","review":"I bought this for my 4 year old and the turtle for my 15 month old. They both love them. The stars don't show a constellation, they don't move, and yes, as other reviewers point out, aren't all that bright. BUT, the animals are cute, these are easy to turn on/off, and in a dark room they project just fine. We found its a great part of the bedtime routine and help signal that its time to sleep.For a 5 star rating I would have liked brigher stars and animation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Perfect","review":"I initially purchased a lady bug and turtle for my 3 month old and my 2 year old. My 2 year old just absolutely loves this and needs to have it on before bed. I have read some bad reviews as far as implementation, I totally disagree. I place this at the bottom of my daughters bed and it illuminates perfectly. She has a pink room so the red doesn't show up very well, and my son has a blue room so the green is hard to see in his room, but the other colors are bright. My older son (5) now wants one of his own as well. I initially only bought two thinking that he had outgrown the night light, but he loves it. I would highly recommend if you are thinking of making the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lady Bug Constellation Night Light","review":"Really neat little night light for a childs room.

The colors were blue or green. It helped them to get to sleep. It does not work at all after a few months.

My 1yr old loved it, but it died on us really quick. Tried to change the batteries that I believe were included, but you first have get past the screw securing the batteries. That required using a scewdriver and needle nose pliers simultaneously. Once I had access to the batteries I found they were corroded in there pretty well. I tried to just wipe it down, but new batteries just didn't work. Then I tried to take the whole plastic compartment out in the hopes of giving it a better cleaning and seeing if there was something else wrong, only to find out the rest of the screws were basically just holding back the stuffing and there is no way of taking it apart. Just threw it away at that point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Night Light","review":"This was a great purchase. The batteries last forever long. The choice of three different beautiful colors worked out well. The turtle is in my little ones bed and she can easily use it as she pleases. The auto shut off is long enough for her to wiggle about and fall asleep comfortably. The stars look great and give a warm light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for Kids","review":"I bought this for my niece and it turns out that my sister dog had a blast as well, trying to catch all the stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but enjoyed","review":"This is a very simple toy concept. It doesn't play music, it doesn't spin or move it just shines tiny little stars all around the room but my son who is 2 now has loved it since birth.

Sometimes it's the simple stuff that makes a child's eyes light up. 3 color modes, batteries last a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight Turtle","review":"This is a great toy.

The green and blue/purple colors are brighter than the amber color. I found that my son likes to play with it when it's on the blue or green colors and the amber color makes him sleepy. I purchased this for a friend's 5 month old and his older 2.5 year old brother loves it too. My son's grandmother said she would like one for her room at night! I love it because I think it will hold the attention of children at many different ages - not a toy your child will play with once and never look at again.

The light pattern fills the room with gentle light and doesn't disturb the baby's sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our daughter loves it","review":"The turtle itself doesn't look like much, but the stars it makes on the ceiling are great. It only works at night when the room is very dark, but that's when we need it. Our daughter was always fussy going to bed and we tried mobiles and music and stuffed animals, but this is the one thing that really helped. The stars cover the whole ceiling and some of the walls. She loves to look for the moon, which we would move by turning the turtle.Now she's older (2 years old) and still goes to sleep with it on. Now she can change the colors by herself and she picks it up and moves it around so the stars move around the room. We bought some more to give as baby shower gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!! Granddaughter loves it!","review":"I bought two of these. One for our granddaughter's first birthday and the other for a granddaughter due Nov. 22nd. The one year old LOVES this turtle. She drags you to her room, points to the ceiling and tries to say stars. The parents of the soon to be granddaughter, turned it on and spent an hour laying on the floor looking at the stars and picking out the constellations.This little turtle seems to be a big hit so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight Turtle","review":"Great idea when a friend is going to have a baby. A girl I work with is expecting her first child in August and I bought this for her. I hope it creates wonderful memories for the little one. Who knows, maybe it will generate a curiousity for astronomy or something like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Multiple Defective Units","review":"We got one of these as a gift and liked the amount of light it put in the room when we needed to check on our son. However it was tempermental when the batteries needed to be changed. I had to shake it and tap it just right to get it to come back on after a fresh set of batteries. Finally it wouldn't come back on at all so we wrote it off as a bad unit and ordered a new one.We first tried lithium batteries immediately out of the box so we wouldn't have to change the batteries as often. The lights would not come on at all. However, it did work with the included generic AAA batteries. Those died after about a month and of course the turtle would not turn back on after a change. Tried lithium ion and several sets of standard AAAs but no luck. I won't be buying another turtle light. I will also stay away from the sea turtle and ladybug from the same company, and I recommend you do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulbs burn out quickly, cannot be replaced","review":"This would have been great if it wasn't a disposable junky toy.

But about 2 months ago the blue light went so faint you can't use it. A few weeks later, the green light faded. Now we can only uses the red, which she doesn't like. I took it apart looking for a way to change the bulb, completely enclosed. Checked the reviews online, found out there is no way to change the bulbs. Went and bought the brand name this time for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice one!","review":"It is nice to have for a good night sleep not just for kids, but adults.

Our rooms are pretty dark, so the red, green, and blue colors all show up beautifully. There is something magical about staring at the stars in your bedroom and my kids and babies absolutely adore this product. I wish I would have bought it sooner when I saw it on the shelves at Von Maur a few months ago.

We kept it out of reach (set it on the headboard) and she loved it. It makes a soft glow, adds just enough light, and the star pattern was fascinating even when she was just a month old. Best of all, it turns off automatically when you doze off. Now that she's older, she loves to help \\"turn on the stars\\" to get ready for bed. The tween and the 4 year old next door love it so much they had to have one. And... the cat loves it, too.

Now my son is two and I finally bought it for his birthday. His reaction has been amazing. He adores this turtle. He carries it around daily and sits in our long hallway with it on, star-gazing. At bedtime, he cannot wait to turn out the light and see the moon and stars appear on his ceiling. While he's always been good at bedtime, now he actually asks to go.As other reviewers have mentioned, the green light is really the only one that shows up clearly. The blue is a little too dark to show up, and we have a hard time seeing the orange light at all. The hard plastic shell feels a little more fragile than I would have expected for the price, although it has certainly shown no sign of wear, having been dropped many times.The most important thing about this turtle is my son's response, and I could not have asked for a better one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Nightlight","review":"It is a good toy.

When it first arrived, it was during the day and not dark enough to see the stars. We took it into our bathroom and spent half the day in there looking at the stars! I recommend this to any one with little ones, and especially if they love the moon and stars. It would really help babies and toddlers who are having sleep issues. They could learn to enjoy bedtime w/ this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star shaped night light--yes, but forget learning contellations","review":"I was eager to get this starry sky night light for my granddaughter for Christmas, so I just tried it before wrapping it. Both my husband and I are dismayed that the turtle needs to be placed closer than the 5-6 ft. from the ceiling to see enough to look for constellations, and even then, the stars are all the same size ( unlike the photo shown when I searched Amazon), making it MUCH harder to detect the constellations with the turtle than it is in the real sky! Pretty bad for a toy we're told will teach kids 8 constellations. I just spent 30 minutes piling boxes up in the middle of my big living room and lying on the couch searching for stars I know well. Found one--maybe two--only. This may be a cozy night light, but it's badly designed for finding any stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last....","review":"This really is pretty cute and neat the way it lights up the ceiling with stars. However, unfortunately it didn't even last a year before all but one of the lights went out on it and it wasn't used that much. They are LED lights inside which if were of a decent quality should have lasted for years. The paint on the shell also scratches pretty easily. For these reasons I have to give it two stars since it is just going to take up space in a landfill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure where the hype is coming from.","review":"I was SO excited to get this for my 2 year old's birthday. Then, when we actually tested it out, I felt horrible for giving it to him. The stars barely show up, especially the 'orange' one. Even in the darkest room, it is not impressive. Any bit of light and the stars are near impossible to see. My son has not showed interest in this and it has been almost a year now."},{"rating":"2","title":"star size surprise","review":"After my mother-in-law had a textured ceiling put in her bedroom, she missed the glow-in-the-dark star stickers she had always had in her room. On a whim, I bought the Twilight Turtle for her. There are plenty of stars filling her room, and she loves that they turn themselves off after she's fallen asleep. My only surprise - and small disappointment - was the size of the stars. I expected half-inch to inch wide points of light, like the stickers on my daughter's ceiling. These are closer to three inch, large, definite five-point star shapes. I was disappointed, at first, but then realized Twilight Turtle is billed as a night-light, so the larger size stars make sense. I would definitely recommend this toy to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Lady bug.","review":"my 3 year old loves this lady bug. so far so good. the battery life lasts a good while. after a while of the light being on it turns off automatic. i would be cool it would come with some music such as a mp3 port."},{"rating":"2","title":"So cute!","review":"I originally bought this as a gift and was going to return it but my daughter really liked it so i kept it. It's kinda cool cuz of the stars and it's different colors plus it was a pink ladybug! I like the timer on it so i don't have to worry about getting up to turn it off,that's a plus for me! I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"eyes open?","review":"I wanted the purple turtle because it's eyes were open in the picture shown. In other places online I've seen what looks like the same turtle, with eyes open and others with eyes shut. I wasn't certain how this would arrive. So I was pleased that the purple twilight turtle I ordered DID come with 'open' eyes. The classic mocha twilight turtle from amazon arrived with closed eyes (again, as shown). This isn't truly a big deal, but it mattered to me- so I thought this info may be helpful to others as well. These turtles were given as gifts, so I can't attest to their performance or durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it.","review":"I really love this product. We put it in our little boy's nursery and turn it on as we rock him to sleep at night. The amber colored lights don't show up at all, but the blue and green ones do (although the blue and green lights look pretty much the same.) It provides such a sweet, comforting atmosphere. We love it. Our son is too young yet to enjoy it, but I'm sure he will when he's a little older.I've never tried to actually look for any constellations so I can't evaluate that part of it. But for the purposes that I use it for (as a night light and to create a comforting atmosphere), I love it and would DEFINITELY recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My toddler loves the Twilight Turtle","review":"When my daughter was an infant, Her crib mobile projected stars on the ceiling. She went to sleep with it on every night. When she got too old for the mobile, I looked for something to replace it. The turtle was great. It projects stars onto the ceiling. You have three different colors to choose from (white, blue and green). A simple push of a button turns it on and a slide swtich allows you to change the color. My daughter is now two and turns this on by herself every night.You do need to place this in the middle of the room to project on the entire ceiling. I have it on an ottoman in the middle of my daughters room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"We had the same issues as others, it sucked down batteries and then shorted out. We would have lived with the fuzzy stars as our 17 month old daughter just liked the lights, but I won't be replacing it to have the same thing happen again."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad..","review":"It is dull and blurry :( I'm going to try getting my friend some fresh batteries, but it was weak out of the box. I'm so unhappy with the lack of clarity. It was a gift and I thought it would be special, but instead it only works when it is like 2 AM and the room is completely darkened.EDIT: September 2011I was so wrong! This thing is great. The room just needs to be completely pitch black and raised from the ground. Beautiful. I retract my initial judgement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best night lite!","review":"We now have 2 of these - they are so calming and neat to look at.

She loves it. I would recommend this or any of the other dreamlites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a full time night light","review":"I bought this expecting to use it as a nightlight for my child. The light turns off automatically after 45 minutes and there is no way to set it to stay on all night. There is also no AC adapter provided which means you go through batteries quickly. If you are expecting a nightlight that casts stars on the ceiling and can plug in and stay on all night - this product is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Nightlight for child, Stellar Show","review":"I have one for both of my children. I like that there are different color choices on the lights. The stellar show projected onto the ceiling soothes my kids for bed. Does not take much battery power because I haven't had to change them yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total disappointment","review":"This product didn't work from the moment it first arrived. Only the red light would light up not the green or blue. It is the first thing I have ordered and been totally disappointed with and had to send back. Not worth it at all- wish I wouldve read all the reviews before buying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Great","review":"All of the reviews I read say that this is a great product. We received ours yesterday. I bought it to help sooth our 8 month old when we put her to bed to get her to fall asleep faster on her own. She has white walls and the colors didn't show up well at all, even when I placed it on her night stand. The stars were too dim for her to take any interest in it. I turned on the red light, it only lights up the shell (which is more than the other colors do) and put it in the crib with her. She watched the glowing ladybug for a few minutes. My husband moved it to our room and placed it on the dresser. We could see it a little better but some of the stars just looked like wedges. It would be a great product if the lights were brighter, had music and turned."},{"rating":"2","title":"turtle","review":"My 11 yr old really enjoys stars & constellations so this turtle has been a fun night light & also gives her the enjoyment of learning about the stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after a couple of months","review":"My son loved it until it stopped working after a couple of months of use. Two of three LED's are no longer functional. Manufacturer did not reply to emails. Don't let the pictures and text fool you, it looks nice but this is just cheaply made crap that breaks during normal use. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lady Bug","review":"The Night light is very cute, soft and practical. Very light, my son loves to play with it. The light comes in different colours.It was a very good decision to buy the product. I actually got 2, lady bug and the turtle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect night light","review":"This night light is the perfect one, light up the room just enough for the kids, but not overly bright. It almost project to the whole ceiling from one corner of the room and the battery seems to last forever. Has 3 different color to choose from so it pretty much universal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best gift ever!","review":"Possibly my kids' most favorite gift we've ever gotten them thus far (and our kids have quite the variety of toys). We bought this for our boys for Christmas and they LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!!! My youngest (who is 2 yrs old) won't go to sleep or even take a nap without his turtle on. I was sure they'd like it when we ordered it for them, but I had no idea what a hit it'd be. Yeah, the gold light is hard to see but it's no big issue...and not a deal breaker by any means. Great for kids of all ages - heck, even fun for adults. I wish I'd had one when I was a kid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stars alla Turtle","review":"We just picked up the Twilight Turtle for ourselves and the Twilight Ladybug for a friend. The turtle is great, no complaints here. Regardless if we put the turtle on the floor, window seal or dresser we get and excellent display, it all depends on what size stars you want. At any level the turtle emits a nice pattern of stars and they are crisp, much better than expected. The turtle arms and legs are fluffy and the shell portion is light, and not at all bulky. I do not think this item would make for a good snugly friend. The illumination is bright enough for my wife to leave on at night to check on our infant without being bright enough to wake him. I think it would also do well for little ones who are less fond of being alone in the dark. Our friends were also very excited and said they had never seen such a nicer thing. I will be purchasing another turtle for my sister and her baby. You will not be dissapointed!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not last the first week","review":"We bought one of these for our 4 year old daughter. We got it on Monday and by Thursday one button was stuck in and the on/off button would not turn on. I tried to force it on and the button broke off. Most of the reviews on here look good so odds are yours will last longer than ours. Our daughter is pretty good about not busting things up so I do not think it failed from abuse. Good luck to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Made Disposable Turtle","review":"Our baby loved the turtle, until the lights began to fade. When we changed the battery the screw stripped, but we managed to open it by spinning the screw with a pair of pliers. The new batteries had NO EFFECT. It still doesn't work after changing them twice. We've had this for 7.5 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for your child","review":"I bought this for my son when he was about 8 months old. He absolutely loves it and asks for the stars every night (he is now 2 yrs old.) He likes to change colors of the stars from blue to green to white. The blue and green colors work best- the stars are the most clearly defined... but the white are still nice, if a little blurred at the edges. The stars are cast on the walls, ceiling and even furniture that is above the level of the turtle. Make sure the room is dark before using! Overall it is a fantastic product and would buy it all over again- I think I'll buy another one for our other child who is due this summer. It is such a lovely way for a child to fall asleep, very calming and fosters an enjoyment of nature. Now that it is Spring and the days are lasting longer, my son goes to bed while it is still light out and it's difficult to see the stars, but if you have dark window coverings, they will be seen just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"This little turtle creats a MOOD","review":"My Daughter and I LOVE this. I actually saw this before I was pregnant and loved it because I love Turtles. I always said I would buy this. I know that it's a bit pricey for what it is, but I justified it by making it my daughters gift for her first Christmas (she was only 1 month old). I put her to bed with it turned on in blue light and play soft relaxing music. She honestly goes down pretty well. It casts starts across her crib and up her walls and both my mom and husband complimented on how soothing I made her night time. the only thing is that the Amber light doesn't seem to work well in showing the stars, but there is Blue and Green. There is actually star constellations that it casts and it comes with a little book showing which ones they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Night Light","review":"I had been waiting to get one of these for a long time, and I don't even have kids yet! I just thought they looked adorable, and I'm planning on having children in a few years, so hopefully this will work out one day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great (and CUTE) basic nightlight","review":"I love this turtle. We got it for our son, who loves everything about it (stars, moon, and turtles-- what isn't there for a boy to love? it would be even cooler with a spaceship, but that might anger purists). The amazon price is the best we've seen, even with all the Christmas sales going on right now.Many people complain about either the single color of stars at a time or the low level of brightness with the amber stars... here is my alternative take on it:The availability of one hue at a time and the difference in brightness between the hues allows us to vary the brightness we want the \\"nightlight\\" to be. Some nights our son needs a little more encouragement to sleep-- that's when we use the less bright amber colored stars. It provides just about enough light for comfort and the stars are faintly lit on the wall, but ut's dark enough to really encourage sleep.I love is simplicity-- less room for failure or breakage. It's a perfect kids' presen in my book. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Turtle","review":"I got this product for my nephew because he was afraid of the dark. But now with the twilight turtle he likes to go to bed now and even takes it to bed with him. The turtle even sleeps with him on his pillow."},{"rating":"2","title":"The kids LOVE these!","review":"I bought this for my nephew (age 3 at the time) and the ladybug (Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Lady Bug) for my niece (age 1 1/2 at the time). They both LOVE them. They've had them over a year now and they both are still intact and going strong, in spite of being tossed around daily by young children. The stars are nice and bright, and there are about a zillion of them! Money well spent, and another big point for their favorite (okay, their only) Auntie. ;-D"},{"rating":"2","title":"in love with this night light","review":"as a mom of two very curious babies i came to the frightning realization that a plug in night light for them was not going to work so finding this ladybug was a god send for me! they both absolutely loved it we had it for nearly a year befor it had a accident with a drink and shorted out. the batteries normally lasted me a good 3 monthes before needing to be replaced. overall i woule recomend this product to ABSOLUTELY ANYONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it !!!!","review":"My parents bought this for my then 10 month old last year at Christmas ..... we love it !!!! The turtle is laid of the top of his bed so that he can see the stars while he is trying to fall asleep. The turtle isn't really something for them to play with rather a night light. All 3 of the colors can easily be seen on his walls and ceiling. We love this so much that I would actually like to have one for my room !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Swaddle your little one in a blanket of stars","review":"This little ladybug doesn't need another five-star review, but it certainly deserves it. We live near a major city, so light pollution makes star gazing impossible. It's nice to be able to share with my kids--even if only on this small scale--the sense of wonder you get from staring up into a clear night sky.Also your cats will FREAK OUT if it put them in a dark room with this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE","review":"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my daughter (9 months old then). She is absolutely fascinated by the lights. It is now part of our bedtime ritual to sit in the rocking chair in the dark and illuminate the stars on the walls and ourselves, switching between the green, blue and yellow colors. After I put her down, I leave it on and she falls asleep with the stars all around her. I highly recommend this. I look foward to teaching her constellations when she is older. The map that is included is really neat. My husband even wanted to know if I would get one for our room!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Dreamlites","review":"My 3 year old daughter really wanted a Dreamlite, however, I had read some negative items about the company selling them. So I did a little research and came across the Cloud b products that are IDENTICAL to Dreamlites. Most important to me, being sold from a reputable company. I purchased the Twilight Ladybug Pink and my daughter absolutely loves it!!! She also thinks it is a dreamlite - Mommy does it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I want one of these for our bedroom!","review":"The first turtle that we received in the mail had a defect (couldn't get the battery panel open), but this thing still gets five stars because it is just that cool. It is an awesome nightlight - just the shell itself - and then it projects a whole sky of stars all over the nursery ceiling and walls. As my husband put it, it's the kind of thing you totally would have wanted as a kid (and who are we kidding, as an adult). There are actual constellations formed by some of the stars on the ceiling, and the toy also comes with a little book, plus the turtle itself is adorable. This may be my favorite toy for kids that I've seen so far, and I can't wait to share it with our little one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent birthday present!","review":"I had this item delivered to my granddaughter's home for her birthday.

I have never been happier buying something offline than I have when this arrived!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not as bad as reviews say","review":"We got our turtle yesterday and no, the stars don't move and the yellow stars don't show, but my five year old loved having blue stars all over her room. The amber starts would only work if you have very, very dark walls, so they are pretty useless. Finding the constellations can be done if the turtle is in the middle of a large room. I don't know if it was an earlier model that people said the stars only showed if it was right next to the ceiling, but ours works even if it is on the floor. Granted, the stars are more detailed the closer you get, but I left it at the foot of my daughter's bed and her room was covered with stars. So the look of enchantment on her face was worth the thirty bucks, plus the turtle is cute. Also, please pay attention to the age recommendation--it truly is for three and over. My one year old would probably stand on it or drop it and the shell could be damaged, so it is for older children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware - IMITATION PRODUCT from ZEETRON","review":"BUYER BEWARE! Don't buy this product from Zeetron! Don't make the mistake I did. I assumed when purchasing a \\"Cloud B Constellation Twilight Turtle\\" from Zeetron that I would receive just that... not so. They instead sent me a cheap fake. I received a Merry Twilight Turtle Star Guide\\" instead which is super cheap and doesn't work correctly. When I contacted Zeetron about the issue, they told me they would refund my money but not the shipping charges, plus I would have to ship the item back at MY expense when it's THEIR mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, bad implementation","review":"We were so excited to purchase this product as a nightlite and more. Out of the box the turtle seems very well made. The lights eminating from its back are quite bright. Herein lies the problem. It seems that in order to actually notice that the lights coming from its back are stars and to see all of the constellations, the turtle, according to recommendations, must be placed high on an object in the center of the room. Who has a dresser or something similar in the center of the room? Placing the turtle on the floor diminishes the stars so that the lights simply look like fuzzy indistinct shapes on the ceiling. Putting it on a dresser near the wall also doesn't work because the full constellations won't appear on the ceiling."},{"rating":"1","title":"We are on our 3rd one...","review":"I saw this and had to get it for my daughters room. Well she is 10 months now and we are on our third one...this is not a good thing. The first one we got shorted itself out and we tried to fix it but forget it...also we must have gotten an older version because the second I bought was awesome- was so much brighter and you could make out the stars. The second one did not last very long and this one sucked down batteries and again shorted out with in two months. We received one as a gift for christmas- which was fine...so far it's worked but still sucking down batteries. It's super cute and when the batteries aren't dying the light is perfect. Make sure you get a newer model if anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected","review":"I had been very excited to receive this item, but was seriously disappointed when I turned it on. Not only does the turtle need to be close to the ceiling to see the stars clearly, but it also needs to be near the center of the room. I am considering hanging it from the ceiling by fishing wire!!!! My second complaint is that the shell is plastic and pretty fragile. My son has already broken off a peice of the shell into a very sharp fragment. Don't waste your money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"total waste of money!!","review":"Don't waste your money on this product. It looks cute but that is it, ours did not look like the one pictured the face was black not grey on both of them. It does not take aaa like it says on the box instead it takes AA It started falling apart the first day we got them. We bought them for our 6 year old twins for their bday. Within 2 days they broke completely and all they did was take them to bed with them and hold them at night. The red never showed up at night. Save your money and buy night lights and glow in the dark star stickers and put them on the ceiling. A word of advise from a very unhappy customer.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"I purchased this for my son because as a newborn it helped him to have a little light to focus on in order to get sleepy. Now the turtle, after 7 months, has become part of his nightly routine - more for his Dad and I to use as a night light to help us put him to bed. We assume that it will ease his fear of the dark in the future as well. We love that there are three color options for the lights as well.We go through batteries for the turtle about once every two weeks - BUT we use rechargeable batteries which don't last all that long, so we can't speak to how often you need new batteries.Our friend's daughter loved the turtle while visiting, so we bought her the lady bug for Christmas. I would buy this item again if mine broke, was misplaced, or if I had someone else to buy it for - love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, adorable, nightlight","review":"I purchased this for my 1 & 3 year old nieces who share a room.

In fact, he loves it so much that he uses it night after night...which means I end up replacing the three AAA batteries, literally, every two to three days. I tried using rechargeable batteries as a means to save money, but, of course, they didn't last as long as Energizer or Duracell batteries. We then bought a DreamLite doggy, and it lasted several months before needing new batteries. So, yes, this turtle is great, but only if you don't mind the cost and inconvenience of replacing batteries multiple times a week (and, if you have a young child, you know how obnoxious it is to fuss with something like batteries right at bedtime)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I bought this for my seven year old son who has high functioning autism. He has had issues falling asleep his whole life and this product does wonders for him. It really calms him down and helps him fall asleep faster.

Couldn't be happier with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!!","review":"I bought this for my infant. She is 5 months old and I thought she would get a kick out of the lights but my eight year old loves it just as much! She loves looking for the constellations on the ceiling. She will study the book that comes with it so she can pinpoint all the constellations! It has been fun for the whole family! I would buy this over and over! We just love it! And it's awesome because it has an on and off switch. And while we mostly just view the blue the girls really enjoy all the color options! =o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute","review":"We bought this product for my son's room to give him a little help when putting him down for bed. The Turtle first off is really cute and soft (besides the shell) and lights up bright enough to hit the entire room. I love the three colors it offers as they are bright enough to be seen. I love the most that it turns itself off as it runs on batteries and I do not have to worry about them running out."},{"rating":"2","title":"starry nights","review":"The light is easy to turn on and off. My son can change the colors by himself (at 16 months). It helps to create a calming distractions to get him to lie down and look at the stars.

It also had a lot of fuzzy coming off it, but I love the little turtle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO Loud!!","review":"I purchased this Cloud B Twilight Turtle for my 3 month old and 3 yr old nieces. The stars are okay but the \\"soothing\\" music is anything but soothing. The ear piercing music was was so loud you could not hear someone talking that is standing right next to you. I have looked it all over hoping that there was a volume control but there wasn't. We tried to take it apart to put a \\"muffle\\" over the speaker but there isn't a way to take it apart without breaking it. MAYBE I got a defective one but I would DEFINITELY NOT recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"This thing is sooo overrated.

And the light colors clash with the design of the toy - no yellow or natural light option."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay but not captivating","review":"The turtle lights up and projects stars on the ceiling. That's it. We have the 'endangered species' version, so ours actually has 5 endangered animals on the shell that can be light with a backdrop of light (only lights up on the turtle, no projection) in addition to the 2 color projections of stars.The reality is that this is a very boring, very simple night light. Don't expect anything more. We got it as a gift - I would NEVER spend as much as it routinely sells for. The shell is hard plastic, so it's not like it can be cuddled, either, FYI."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I love it! I had bought the ladybug for my daughter when she turned 3 and that was almost 4 years ago! Her's is still in great condition! now I bought the turtle for my son... I think i'm going to buy one for me! i'm very glad they made another critter so both kids didn't have to have the ladybug :) thank you CloudB!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute","review":"This was as cute in the picture as in person. I like that the shell changes colors with the stars. Its super soft and I like that it has a switch in the bottom that turns it off so the buttons on the top don't get accidentally turned on.(you can't tell by the picture, but the back has 4 buttons, a little moon to turn it on and 3 round buttons to change the color. I also like that the batteries are beneath a latch that is screwed in so my kids can't get them out and lose them. Its a little smaller than the DreamLites but I like the design better. The stars shine sharp and fill the whole room - walls and ceiling. The only complaint I have is that there is a slight delay when you push each button to change colors. Nothing is wrong with that, its just the design of the electrical system. Very happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Night Light","review":"My daughter has a couple of these and loves them. She loves pushing the button to turn them on, and then pushing the other buttons to choose the color of light each night at bedtime. I know some others have said that the lights burned out not long after purchase, however I have not found this to be the case with ours. We have had both of ours for over a year, and they get used every night. We have only changed the batteries twice. Maybe the others got defective items. I would recommend these cute little critters to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toddler loves it","review":"MY 3 year old niece loves this. She turns off all the lights in rooms just to see her Ladybug do its thing. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our 23 month-old really likes it!","review":"We've had this light for about 1 month. The turtle provides perfect ambient light for our son to fall asleep. The features I like are:-3 color options-LED bulbs (so you know they'll last a long time)-Battery operation so the child can have it in bed-Auto-off feature (I think it's 45 minutes)The only thing I don't like so far is that the plastic shell seems fragile, and I worry that it could easily be broken if your child rolled on it or threw it from the crib to the floor (which has happened once, and surprisingly it didn't break).Overall, though, this has been a wonderful help in getting our son to sleep. He loves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the \\"Must Have\\" items for children","review":"I purchased this turtle for my 3 1/2 year old daughter as she transitioned to her big-girl bed. She absolutely loves it. She hugs it and sleeps with it. In fact, her 5 1/2 year old brother loved it too, so I ordered him one. They sleep in bunk beds and use these turtles every night. The stars broadcast well no matter where they are placed. The batteries last a long time (over a month and still going). They even play with the turtles during the day. A very comforting, cute toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the design- disappointed with no ac adapter feature","review":"I really love the night light - it's cute and etc- but it works on the batteries - and i don't really want to use it since i'd have to replace the batteries every week. I wouldn't recommend it for every day use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Granddaughter LOVES Her Ladybug!","review":"I bought this for my 4-year-old granddaughter. She loves it! Unbeknownst to me, she saw it on a commercial and had been asking her Mom for one. I sent this to her along with two different ones for my grandson and my newest granddaughter. It's nice when you can find gifts that are truly enjoyed! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful but pricey","review":"We love this night light! My husband, baby and I are currently in a one bedroom and so we all go to sleep watching the Twilight turtle. I think it is too expensive but I found a good deal on Amazon with Amazon's free shipping and a Christmas gift card. We use it for naps, play, and night sleeping. The colors are great and really project onto the walls and ceiling. I highly recommend it if it fits within your budget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure Thing","review":"Each of my three year old nieces got one of these Night Lights when they were born. They now put them in the bed with them. Still loving the stars. My newest niece is only 6 months, but she is also fascinated by the light show. Well made, cute and popular. Very good choice for a newborn or later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This product is great.. My 2yr old LOVES it she falls asleep with it everynight. She even had to carry it on our trip out of state to visit her nana. I would def. recomend this product for everyone that has toddlers or even younger children."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a kids toy, not a planetarium","review":"My three year old loves her lady bug, it keeps her company as she falls asleep. The stars don't really look like stars where the light hits the ceiling, there are no recognizable constellations and I don't bother setting it up on something to elevate it. The batteries last forever, it shuts off automatically after so much time and, most importantly, it makes my little girl happy. The lady bug casts a crescent moon shape among the stars. Each night I position the moon in a different area and the last thing she does before she falls asleep is finds the moon on the ceiling. Any toy that can make a child happy on a daily basis is money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cloud b Twilight Turtle","review":"I purchased this night light for my 3 year old daughter. She absolutely loves it. She can easily turn it on or off from her bed even though it has a timer. The stars look very nice even though we do not have the light centered in the room. We haven't looked for the constellations yet but will do so in the future. Would suggest to a friend to purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy we made this purchase!","review":"We got this for our two boys who share a bedroom. They are 9 months and 2.5 years old. We love that it turns off automatically after 45 minutes and the boys seem to enjoy it. My husband and I do too. Sometimes we turn it on and hang out in their room for awhile.... Way more fun than a nightlight! I like the blue setting the best, it's super soothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves it! Wonderful product!","review":"I bought this as a birthday present for my 2 year old. She doesn't mind playing in the dark, but when bedtime came she wouldn't let us turn out the light. That hasn't been a problem since we got her the twilight turtle. She loves going to bed and looking at the stars. She tells us to close the door to make them really glow. In fact, one evening when we got home she went to her bedroom to play and I foolishly went in and turned on the light for her. As it turned out, she had just turned on her turtle and was enjoying the stars until Mom blew it and turned the light on! I was thoroughly reprimanded!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful night light","review":"I bought the Twilight Turtle for my niece's birthday. She absolutely loves it.

After 45 minutes, the light goes off. I didn't find out about this product until I visited a friend who had one - I wish I had found out about this product earlier. My ten-month old loves it and so do I. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic gift","review":"I've given this night-light turtle to 5 different sets of parents for a baby gift and they all love it. Especially the dads love it, it must be something about the constellations. Now I want one for myself, but I don't have any kids so I have to think up an excuse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big hit with my four year old","review":"I was amazed to see that the stars, when displayed, are so vivid and sharp - not just fuzzy dots that vaguely look like they have a resemblance to a star. My four year old loves sleeping with it (and staying awake...). It's been a good learning tool as well, which has sparked his interest in 'outer space'."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't sleep without it","review":"this is great - it fills the room with stars, it's safe, does the same thing as a nightlight but my 2 year old can turn it on himself, and at some point it will even be educational because he'll be able to learn some constelations.he now needs his turtle every night."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT CLOUD B PRODUCT","review":"When I received this item I was disappointed to find that it was not a Cloud B product as advertised.

Amazon is sending me correct product - do not waste time/money ordering this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it sounds","review":"I purchased the Twilight Turtle only after reading the reviews of how great of an idea this was, and I am sorry to say that I am disappointed. I was under the impression that it alternated between the colors, which it does not. Also the amber light is not bright enough, I had to hold it a foot away from the ceiling to see the stars and this was in a pitch black room. The product would be good if it was a little better thought out."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT worth the money","review":"if this thing cost like $10 i would still be dissapointed, but paying over $30 or $40 for it is just silly. try to buy it used, or wait til they improve it. you have to find somewhere to put it where nothing blocks its light path, which is hard in a small baby room like mine. it's good for doody if you have a textured ceiling, even slightly. and as someone else said, the \\"amber\\" is barely visible. I bought it a week ago, and have even tried just turning the lights off and playing with my 9-month-old with it -- so basically i just bought him a really expensive toy. wish i hadn't bought it online -- i'd return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This was a great gift for my friend's autistic child.

You can change the light color too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our 2 year old daughter loves this!","review":"My daughter loves to use this while going to bed. We spend time talking about the stars and looking for the moon. I gave it 4 stars because the red is difficult to see on the ceiling and walls. The blue and green are pretty bright and we often use it to read books with all other lights off. It can be distracting at times when all she wants to do is play with her ladybug. I would recommend this to make a child's room more fun at bedtime. It has been helpful getting her used to sleeping in her own bed alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Perfect for my 3 month old he watches it!!. Do not know what i would do without it.

When they get older they love the stars on the ceiling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased (purchased March 2010)","review":"I was skeptical to order since so many people have claimed to be disappointed... but, couldn't be happier.Ordered the desert turtle for the 4 year old. All three colors work well in the room, and I cannot believe how much coverage there is on the ceiling and walls from something so small! We have light yellow walls, and the amber light does not show up as well as the blue and green, but honestly, this is a wonderful gift and very soothing. The older boy (8) really likes it as well.It would be great if they could make this with moving stars and a wireless speaker to capture music from an iPod or MP3 player - I'm sure someday they'll do that.Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift for children","review":"My nephews loved it and share it with their younger sister on some nights.

My grandaughter and grandson each loved them! I would recommend for the ages of 5/6. A really good gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas 2012","review":"I purchased the cloud B turtle for my Grandson, who is 3, for Christmas this year. His bedroom is fairly dark, he only has one window, but we had no problem seeing all the colors reflecting nicely.I was worried about the lighting quality from others reviews but even if it hadnt been bright,which it is, Im not sure a small child would care. The fact that my grandson could switch colors was nice & he enjoyed that part of this toy. The cloth head, arms & legs are very soft which is nice. The shell is solid plastic but it still was small & light enough for him to carry around under his arm. He loved it and wanted us to stay in his room most of the time to \\"check it out\\". I saw dreamlights in stores, they cost more and I really like the cloud B better.I would reccomend this night light to anyone who has a child who loves the moon & stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Turtle is great","review":"Our 1.5 year old loves the turtle.He got it yesterday and was running around with it all day. He loves to steer the lights himself and is exited to go to bad in the evening! He stares at the stars and tells himself a story (it must be about stars I guess ;) and falls asleep. We hope his excitement will last. So fare we are very happy with this cute little thing. We called her Rita...I don't agree with reviews that the shield of the turtle is maybe not robust enough or that the stars are not bright enough. In fact I think the stars are a little bright at the moment so that we stay on the yellow color, which is the weakest one. The turtle stands on the floor in the child's room and projects stars over the entire ceiling. They are as large as tea candle and bright enough that you can see without turning on another light in the room. It is dark enough for sleeping though.Again: No complains. The turtle is even better than I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"I bought this for my seven year old brother for Christmas. He uses it as a nightlight every night, and ALL the colors work well, including the yellow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turtle constellation...Mind blowing!!","review":"I saw this turtle while finding a suitable gift for my niece who was turning 4 this year. I read the description and ordered it. She was so excited to see it. She kept asking me where I buy gifts from coz she loved it so much. She wasnt ready to share it with anyone. Now, she uses it every night.The smile on her face....Its worth all that I paid. Its a perfect gift for kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this!!","review":"My son absolutely LOVES his turtle! It shines up the whole room. We have it on his dresser and when the lights are out it puts the starts and moon on the walls and ceiling. He picks out what color he wants the turtle to be that night for bed. Mostly its green...his favorite color. He's also knocked it off the dresser a bunch of times while playing with it and its not cracked or anything. I highly recommend this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"My 2-year old daughter LOVES her lady bug. Every night we pick the color that the stars should be and we talk about them. She points out the moon not only on her ceiling, but now every time she sees it in the sky. This is a great product that encourages kids to look at the sky and learn about space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"We have had this nightlight for our son since birth, and before that we purchased the lady bug for our niece. I am not sure why some reviewers have problems with it being too dim, we have our son in a small bedroom, possibly 11 by 11, and with the turtle on the floor or a night stand it shines bright enough for us to see the stars on the ceiling and walls. We have also played with the turtle with our son, and I like that the body is soft and that the plastic has soft rounded edges. I can see him enjoying this night light for many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for kids! My daughter loved hers so much we had to get one for her best friend!","review":"This product is absolutely adorable. It not only teaches kids about the constellation, but provides a soft and cuddly night light too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good customer service","review":"As everyone else, we love the Twilight turtle. We switched to different LED light every night. Unfortunately, one of the LED light went out after 2 months. I contact the customer service and they provided some trouble shooting and then repair/replacement in a timely manner. Hope the next one can last for 3000 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke within a year","review":"This started off as a great product. But after a year, it broke. I didn't think I could return it, but come to fin out I could have within the year. :( I thought it was only 30 days. But, the concept is great, just bummed I payed $25 and it busted after a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight Christmas bliss","review":"My 4 year old son received this gift for Christmas, amongst many others. I spent the better part of the day curled up in the walk in closet as we enjoyed Twilight turtle's magic. Many gifts are captivating the first day you get them. However, this is now March and Twilight turtle continues to enchant. Everywhere my son brings him (and that is many places!) people comment on what a wonderfully simple, magical toy it is. I would definitely get this for any child, up to age 10. This 40-year-old wouldn't be disappointed to have my own in my room as I fall asleep as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome nightlight","review":"This was ordered for my almost-two Grandson. He is delighted with the ceiling stars and falls asleep with it every night. Great product and awesome service."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"I RECEIVED THE TURTLE ON MONDAY AND MY SON ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT. I'VE BEEN HAVING TROUBLE GETTING HIM TO SLEEP IN HIS OWN BED AND TO FALL ASLEEP ONCE HE'S IN THERE. THIS HAS BEEN WORKING SINCE DAY ONE. THE ONLY THING MISSING IS SOUND. I WISH I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN IT SOONER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it works","review":"It's a nicely designed product, and the finish is good too, but after about a year the light stopped working. Probably a burned out bulb, but since you can't open up the shell to change it, it's now lost it's charm. A product that with better planning could have lasted years and years is in reality designed to be disposable. That's a shame.Until that flaw is fixed, I wouldn't buy one. I know I won't buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk!","review":"This would be great if it worked. Ours worked for one night and now it will not work at all. Very dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best long-term toddler items purchased","review":"My twin boys, now 6, have had 2 of these since they were 2. They have loved these since then. Still to this day, they turn them on at night. I can only name a handful of toys that have stood the test of time in both durability and desire. Great item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best nightlight ever","review":"I am so glad I bought this for my children. It is a beautiful, beautiful night light. The stars spread across the entire ceiling as well as part of the walls, making it look truly like a beautiful starlit night. It lights up the room in a soft glow. The ladybird is cute and my kids can't get enough of the nightlight. The only suggestion I would make is that in the red mode, the stars are not that realistic, but the green and blue are beautiful, and put my kids right to sleep as they stare at their very own starlit sky. the timer is more than adequate. I have since bought this as gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"We have been using the Ladybug Constellation Night Light for my daughter for approximately two years now. She is now 2 1/2 and has not grown tired of it. She loves to pick out the colors of the stars every night. The ladybug throws red, green or blue stars up on the ceiling. The nice thing is that the night light turns off automatically after 45 minutes. Even with us using the night light daily, we have not changed the batteries yet.I now bought the Turtle Night Light for our son, hoping that he will enjoy it as much as our daughter. He turned 1 week old today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Night Light - Love the stars, the turtle design, auto-shut off, battery operated","review":"I bought 2 of these for my two kids' rooms (ages 4-9). The older ones (who don't want their room too dark) love it as much as the younger ones. We set the turtle on a dresser. The stars project very well - the green and blue/purple lit ones are brightest; the amber ones quite dim. The turtle design is so darling.Easy to use out of the box. I like that there is no electric plug in - it makes it easier to place the turtle where ever we want. Plus, with the auto-shut off, I'm not as concerned about battery usage.We don't try and identify constellations. That might be quite challenging, and success might depend on where you put the turtle as the stars project on the wall and ceiling, which could distort the configurations.Unlike some night lights that are too bright, too dim, or just light up the one corner they are placed in, this one illuminates the whole room with the right level of light."},{"rating":"2","title":"i recieved this item in lightening speed awsome turtle!!!!!!","review":"I ordered the item and recieved it the next day morning, and in perfect shape that's an A+++ for the company.The turtle came in 3 different lights and it project starts and moon on the cieling.

I bought this as a gift for my girl friend and she likes it a lot, and i'm sure this is the perfect night light for your childrend too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"A little overpriced- only reason I took away a star. Otherwise, my 4-year-old daughter loves picking a color scheme for her \\"starry night\\" every night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Torta the Turtle","review":"I would like to say this is a really cute and awesome toy. It gets my baby's attention at night when she is going to sleep. And it is also a lot of fun for me and my wife b/c we like to look at stars. Works a lot better than a night light and it automatically goes off in 20 minutes so you don't kill the batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS TURTLE!!!!","review":"We bought this turtle to help my son start sleeping with the light off, well it absolutely worked!! i cannot say enough good things about this product!!!!!!! i would give it 10 stars if i could!

One of the colors on the turtle went out the 2nd night and we returned it and got a replacement. It's been working ok so far. But then last night, 2 of the colors on the ladybug stopped working. We haven't even had it 60 days!! I wrote the company and they said the LED lights should last up to 3,000 hours...but they don't and you can't replace them. I can understand one bad egg but two? I'm sad because my kids love those and they are so cute...but they're turning out to be a total waste of money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The item was scratched in multiple places. Batteries inside the item was corroded and a part was broken off battery opening","review":"I found this item to be inadequate. The item had multiple scratches. The battery casing had batteries in it which were corroded and the casing had a part broken off.This item was not of the standards of what I have ordered from Amazon in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smelly and not a Cloud B","review":"The lights look really cool, but the product had an odor I just couldn't live with and it is not a Cloud B Twlight Turtle as you're led to believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second one :)","review":"We purchased this item because we are having a second baby and our first, who is now almost 3.5 years old, has one and has had it since she was born. This is a GREAT product. The nightlight is subtle enough where it doesn't keep little ones awake and, the automatic shut-off after 45 minutes is great because it allows for kids to fall asleep but doesn't wear out the batteries. Buttons are easy to feel for and push so when my daughter got older and was in a regular bed at 2 years old, we put the turtle at the foot of her bed and she could just turn it back on herself if she woke up in the middle of the night. I definitely recommend this for kids...and, to be honest, parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this turtle","review":"Ok, so feel free to laugh at me, but I'm a full grown adult who uses this turtle. I know, silly, but I'm just not a big fan of nighttime. I find the stars and gentle light to be soothing, so I'd recommend this product to anyone for whom bedtime is not their favorite time, no matter what their age :)Also, I'm surprised other people don't like the amber stars. It's generally the only setting I use. The others are too bright. Maybe it depends how dark your bedroom is. Mine is almost completely pitch black so the amber show up quite well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"We have white walls but blackout curtains. The blue and green lights are much too bright to fall asleep by; however, the amber is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bedtime companion!","review":"I bought this for my son to ease him into his own room( he sleeps with us). He loves it, plays with it even when it's not bedtime. We are still working on getting him to use his own bed, but I think this turtle will help the adjustment well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evil Turtle beats hare","review":"Ugh. I feel prey to the same scam as many other buyers. I received a cheap knock-off that broke in a month after light use. I didn't even realize I got scammed until I read the reviews here after mine broke and saw that mine isn't Cloud B. I expect this from eBay, but not Amazon. I'll buy this thing in person @ Target."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK - not for use with high ceilings","review":"We have 12+ foot high ceilings and nothing shows up. You have to have 8 foot ceiling, and then it will work best if it's on a dresser or something high. It does look neat when you can see it - just didn't work for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality-fell apart","review":"My son has a Twilight Turtle that completely fell apart after very little use. The turtle body separated from the shell. It looks as if defective glue was used. I contacted Cloud b and I was rudely told that I had a counterfeit product. After sending pictures, customer service told me that it was a true Cloud b product but that it was out of warranty so I was out of luck. The woman I dealt with was rude from the start and obviously had no intention of standing by their product. I do not recommend buying this product as it is very cheaply made and a waste of money. Summer Infant makes a similar product that is less expensive, better quality, and has more features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is an incredible baby item. I bought this for my two month old and she absolutely loves it. I can put her in her crib while she's still wide awake, put on the twilight turtle and she'll fall asleep while staring at the stars. I now have to go out and buy one for my three year old-- he's obsessed with it. This will definately be my new baby gift for friends and family.I read in other reviews that the amber colored stars did not show up- while they are a bit dimmer than the blue and green mine shows up just fine on our ceilings at night. I also keep this on top of the changing table (at least four feet from our ceiling) and they show up great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it! Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night light","review":"I bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter and she just loves the display on the ceiling.

It is VERY cute. She cuddles it during the day and has tea parties with it, and at night she puts it back on her dresser for bed. It has three different color options for the stars on her ceiling, and I can set the timer to make sure it stays on long enough for her to fall asleep but not drain the batteries. The stars and moon displayed are a muted, soothing tone, giving just enough light to soothe to sleep. We go about three months on one set of batteries, and we use the turtle almost nightly.With the hard shell, it's a good toy to have on a dresser - it's not soft enough to snuggle in bed, but if set near the bed it projects stars across the entire ceiling. I also like that the buttons are big and spaced enough apart that they are easy for a child to operate and pick their own colors at night.This is not a light to leave on for the entire night, but it does a great job at soothing and I'm glad we have one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So cute!","review":"I love the cloud b Twilight Turtle! I gave this to my daughter around one year of age. She is now three and still uses it every night. It is so nice, projecting stars and a moon over the entire ceiling. She loves to find the moon every night before bed. It has four buttons, one off/on and three other buttons for the color of the stars (amber, green, blue). The battery lasts forever, I can't even remember the last time I changed it. My son at 6 months of age is very interested in the twilight turtle. I believe that I will have to purchase one for him soon. This is one of my go to gifts for new babies and young ones. My husband and I were saying that we need one in our room, yes it is really that cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Just received it today. My son loves it when he saw it but after just a few seconds the light turned off. Not even a minute. We changed the battery but it's not working. Sooo disappointed. My 3 year old son said to throw it to trash. I've been a very satisfied amazon customer before until this thing happened. So sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Focus","review":"Disappointed because it needs to go in an exact location, both in distance from walls and ceiling, in order to focus properly.

I was trying to break my 18-month-old of her pacifier, and nights were not going well at all. After a couple of rough nights I showed her this thing, and she has been attached ever since. She was immediately entranced by the stars, and she snuggled with it right up against her nose so she could get a close look. She was in the middle of learning her colors so she likes to switch the colors and tell me what they are. She ends up putting the turtle in the corner of her crib and looking up at the stars until she falls asleep. No more crying for \\"Pa-Pa\\" (her pacifier). Now all she cares about it \\"Kur-kle\\" (turtle). So glad I got this thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Cute","review":"This is super cute. It comes in three different colors, although the orange one is a little too light you can't see it very well. I think they made the orange one in case the others were too bright for your children. It also comes with a book of constellations for you to find with your children before you go to bed. It ALSO comes with a lullabye CD, but take into consideration that I have not had my baby yet so I have not listened to it.

My sister told me she never even got up in the middle of the night to crawl in their bed. My sister loves it as much as my niece does. I would recommend this to anyone who has a little one who just might have a problem sleeping alone in the dark.

This was a wonderful tool for transitioning our twin toddlers from their cribs to their toddler beds. After tucking them in, we'd give them each a turtle light. They were fascinated and played with them in bed until falling asleep. It is also nice to know that they each have a light that they can control should they need one during the night.The only disappointment was the color of the fabric. It is much greener than it appears in the picture. It is not unpleasant, just different from my expectations. Overall, this is a very nice light for your child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome night light","review":"What a fun night light for kids of all ages.

They work great as nightlights and my older daughter and easily turn it back on in the middle of the night if she wakes up. Be warned though, they're battery powered. We've only had them a week, so we're not sure how long the batteries last, but at least you don't have to worry about having them where there's a plug!"},{"rating":"2","title":"like a cute nightlight","review":"This turtle is very cute and I love that it has a 45 minute automatic shut off timer since we use it for our 8 month old to help calm him at night and fall asleep. The blue and green colors are very relaxing. The amber light is difficult to see, as other reviews have written, but if you make sure it is pitch black in the room, it is okay and actually is the color I like to use more so it doesn't make it too bright in my son's room.

My toddler loved it and enjoyed the stars and color options. Unfortunately, the button you press to turn it on fell off inside the turtle after about a week of use. I was the one pressing the button when it came off, and I wasn't being rough or using excessive force. We had to shake the turtle to get the button out but couldn't re-fasten it easily. For a few days we stuck a finger in the small hole where the button used to be to activate the turtle, but then the rubber sensor fell off as well. With no way to turn the thing on, we threw it away. My toddler was sooooo sad, but it was worthless to us. Since this is overall a popular product, I suppose we just had bad luck. I wouldn't buy another one, though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointed","review":"I thought this item was so cute and the pictures that were displayed showed the stars projecting clearly on the ceiling in three different colors.

We would turn the light on and when we pushed to see another color it shut the whole thing off. My daughter is young and doesn't know the difference. She is happy to see the red stars on her wall when she holds it right next to the wall.

If it was cloud b, I don't know why cloud b advertises all over parenting magazines and online with such confidence in their product, because I had no confidence in the product I received. The turtle was made of hard plastic that could easily break. (I think the product I received actually had a crack in it). The turtle was not the color advertised, the turtle's music (is this supposed to come with music?!) was muffled at best. The batteries that came with the turtle were covered in dried acid, and the \\"star gazing\\" instructions that came with it were in Chinese.

The white lights are useless, but the blue and green work great. This is more of a night light, as the name states, not a learning toy, people planning to teach their children about the constellations should look elsewhere.

I'm returning it. I'm glad Amazon is providing free return shipping. My baby will have to fall asleep without this. These sleep aid toys are just a crutch anyway. I might get some glow in the dark stars instead. Much cheaper, no batteries required, and takes up less space.

I bought the blue one, because my son loves the color blue. When I opened the box I was a bit concerned, because the packaging didn't say cloud B anywhere on it. It just said \\"Turtle\\" and had the picture of the mocha turtle on it. Okay... I opened it.The turtle had one button depressed permanently so when I put the batteries in it flashed colors but wouldn't actually work correctly. The box was missing its batteries, and star chart. The plastic shell was scratched and damaged and the face and legs of the turtle look completely different than the image shown on Amazon (and cloud B's website.)

It took her awhile to warm up to it but now she is very fond of it. It works as a good night light to help her go to sleep. The lights automatically turn off after 45 minutes. My daughter really enjoys the ability to switch the constellation colors (orange, green, or blue) as every night she gets to pick one. We have the turtle on a dresser by her bed and the stars and moon show up well once the lights are off. Although the turtle has a hard shell, my daughter still likes to sleep with it, as I often find it under her arm after a nap. One last thing to note, when we get our turtle, initially only the orange light would work. A quick check of the cloud b website reveals this is secondary to low batteries. A set a fresh batteries fixed this problem. The turtle and all the different lights have been working well since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids of all ages","review":"I bought this for my 2 year old and 6 year old daughters. It has been a huge hit for both of them but especially my 6 year old who has recently become scared of the dark.

After sleeping with a light or tv on we wanted to get some type of night light. I was weary of this since it doesn't play music and it looked kind of generic to me. However this is the best thing we've bought our son yet. The first time turning it on, his eyes lit up and he got really excited. We use it every night now and turn it back on during our middle of the night feedings. He immediately looks up in awe and starts to get sleepy again. I've put this on a shelf, on the floor, and even in his bassinet when he wasn't in it and it's always worked perfectly. For the amber glow to work you need a very dark room, but hey that's what the middle of the night is. The amber glow also seems to be the most calming and puts him to sleep quickly. Worth every penny! Highly recommend for infants who are fussy about going to sleep at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter loves it","review":"My daughter has always liked ladybugs. One that lights up, and puts stars on the ceiling? No brainer for her second xmas.She is absolutely obsessed with it. It goes everywhere she goes the past 24hrs. She figured out the different light buttons and how to turn it on and off in the first 2 seconds. It's very intuitive. The shell is hard and feels fairly sturdy - she hasn't thrown it yet but I'm confident it'll hold up. The plush is quite soft and cuddly, which is a big part of why she's always holding onto it.Couldn't be happier with this purchase. Absolutely a toy she'll love for years to come. As is, she doesn't like lights in her room when she sleeps at night, so it's mostly a before bed light show for her which is great too, keeps her in a good mood. But in a few months who knows? They change all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't turn on.","review":"I purchased this as a gift for my 6 year old. He opened it in the afternoon and put it aside until bedtime on Christmas night. He ran down to grab his turtle at bedtime and it didn't turn on. We even tried replacing the batteries that came with it and...nothing. A very disappointed little guy on a special night. I went to process the return on amazon and it told me they'd replace it for free with shipment due in over a MONTH! Unacceptable. I'm sure it's adorable when it works. So far, not so happy.Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought","review":"I purchased this thinking it would be just a cute little inexpensive present for my daughter for Christmas.

All in all a great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"parts missing, and just a pricey nightlight","review":"Firstly I am very irritated because clearly this was a used/returned item that Amazon forgot to check because only the lady bug was in the package - no star guide or adoption certificate - and the top and bottom of the box were taped up. And hte only way to get the parts is for me to send everything back and then get a replacement - NOT USER FRIENDLY! No sorry or any sort of an apology!Overall, it's basically just an expensive nightlight, but also wouldn't give enough light to really allay a child's fear of the dark. The stars are pretty but are hard to see unless it is totally dark in the room, and therefore, not good for someone with a fear of the dark. Plus, as other reviewers have said, the colors don't show up very well.So apart from the issue I'm having that it was incomplete to begin with, if your child is afraid of the dark, just buy a plug in nightlight and a soft toy for them to cuddle. They can't even cuddle this because of the hard shell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrived in time for Christmas","review":"I ordered this item for a co-worker who just had a baby.

He loved it, it became his regular night light. He favored the green, but over time, the light got dimmer and dimmer. The blue seemed brighter, so we started using that, then the same thing happened. We put in brand new batteries and no change, but the amber light still worked, so we started using that one, which now of course is fading to nothing just like the others. We opened the panel at the back to see how we could replace the lights only to find that you can't, it is self contained, you'd have to tear the thing apart to get inside.

I like it because it is a good alternative to a night light (which my son would climb out of bed and try to pull out of the wall) and it turns off automatically after a long while. This turtle can take a beating too, as I have seen it tossed town the stairs, thrown out of the crib and jumped on and it still works. I buy Twilight Turtle as gifts for my friends that are expecting. You can't go wrong with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Nightlight!!!!","review":"We LOVE this turtle! My 3 1/2 year old twins are completely in love! It is helping ease the bedtime fears and is also fun for our infant daughter (who thinks it is a stuffed animal). I must disagree with other reviewers who complain that the stars are not projected unless the turtle is on a dresser in the center of the room. We have ours on a dresser (so it is high up) on a wall in the bedroom and the stars project around the room just fine. Of course, some of the constellations are distorted, but my youngsters don't know that. They just are excited that there are stars and a moon on their ceiling! I guess if you are buying this for educational purposes you will be disappointed. However, it is great for entertainment purposes and, if you are so inclined, you can put the light in the center of the room to project the constellations accurately. Great product! Buy one now!

She uses it every night, takes it on trips with her, sharpest it with her friends. The only problem is when the lights get dim due to batteries being worn down.

Well, while he loves it, he's still sleeping in my bed! My 7 year old loves it too so he's been sleeping with it on. Everynight after we read a book, I put it on and we look at all the beautiful stars and moon. His favorite color is blue and it looks amazing reflected on the ceiling. It's also very peaceful and almost magical!"},{"rating":"2","title":"got it fast!","review":"almost stepped on the package when i opened my door the next morning...lol.. it works great!! my kid wont be able to use it for a while, but i have it and momma likes it too!!perfect! just as i expected!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"adorable","review":"We previously purchased a turtle/tortoise version of this for our son several years ago and love it. When I saw the ladybug, I had to have it for my daughter. They have improved the functions of this since the first model. You can turn it off without waiting for the timer or opening up to where the batteries are installed for the master switch. Also the stars are bigger and brighter than before. These Cloud B nightlights are the coolest out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE it!","review":"I absolutely love this turtle. The stars it projects on the ceiling are really amazing. I don't even have any kids, but I got this because the children I nanny are awestruck by things like this. It has been working great since I got it, and I love the three different colors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping it simple","review":"When it arrived I was a bit underwhelmed by its simplicity. I guess I thought it would be more high-tech. Obviously I am not the target market. My 4 year old nephew adored it! Because it is simple he can work it by himself. It was by far his favorite Christmas gift out of a literal sea of Christmas gifts. He carried it around everywhere he went, and still does - a month after he got it. My sister says it is helping him to stay in his own bed at night instead of trying to sleep in hers. Wonderful, simple, sweet, useful, favorite toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"17 month old loves it","review":"I did a lot of research between Dream Lights vs. Cloud b Twilights and am so pleased that we decided to go with Cloud b Twilight for several reasons. The plastic is very strong and durable, the stars are clear and bright on our ceiling and walls and it automatically turns off after 45 min (which is perfect to make sure it doesn't turn off BEFORE the kids fall asleep). The stuffed animal part is very soft and I love how it is educational on teaching our kids about constellations. Most of all, our 17 month old son loves it and its became part of his nightly routine of turning it on and choosing his color. Highly recommend this for any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muscial Night Light","review":"This musical night light was perfect for my grandaughter. Wanted to do away with the crib attached music and this was perfect for her to use and age appropriate. It is now her favorite bedtime must. After 2 years of use, it is still going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very friendly and easy to use","review":"My son loves to grab the turtle and play with him when it's bedtime. The only thing i wish it did was rotate or move so that the stars would keep his attention and help him fall asleep better. The light output is great on this thing though. It will illuminate an entire room if you set it out in the open."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I received this item and it does not work or come on at all. I replaced batteries and it still will not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was damaged and of poor quality","review":"Well, it got here fast enough and was a good deal, but it looked like it had been kicked all over town, packaging damaged, product scuffed, the thing that holds the batteries in doesn't snap on at all. I felt like I was giving my daughter garbage, instead of a reward for sleeping in her own bed and putting herself to sleep. What a piece of crap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Use this every night for my daughter; it's my go-to-gift!","review":"We used this every night in my older daughter's room when she was 2. She loved changing the colors and looking for the moon. We now use this in my younger daughter's room (age 22 months), and she loves it just as much. I've bought this for 5 other friends as bday and baby shower gifts because I know their kids will love them (confirmed by them!). It's a great gift for both girls and boys - young and old. It's a great nightlight, and I love that it automatically turns off after about 20 minutes. We haven't had to change the batteries for months for this reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Gift for young children","review":"This was a birthday present for my 3 year old granddaughter. She absolutely loved it as did my 12 year old granddaughter. They both sat for hours looking at the stars and constellations. I think I will be purchasing another one for the 12 year old! Good idea and lots of fun for small children. This is an excellent gift for any young child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sleep experience","review":"I have purchased 3 of these for different grandchildren, and they love them. They make bedtime a new fun experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift.","review":"Grand daughter loved it. It does everything it says and looks beautiful on the ceiling and is pretty just sitting on the bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"My baby loved it too. She likes to play with it, and it has 3 different colors of lights with different intensity."},{"rating":"1","title":"BROKEN!","review":"Well I bought this item as a gift for a 2 year old. Had you asked me a week ago if I was happy with the product I would have said yes indeed. However, after less than a month after purchase it broke. Only the red light setting works and the stars are strangely no longer visible. LESS THAN a MONTH. Nice. And she's two, so she doesn't understand why it broke and why I won't be buying her a new one. No way."},{"rating":"1","title":"My son won't sleep without it but there are some major flaws","review":"I can no longer support this product. My son loves his turtle and won't sleep alone without it. However, I have had issues getting batteries to work in the turtle, only brand that was working for me was EverReady. I emailed the company and they basically responded that this is a known issue with \\"some\\" turtles especially with Energizer and Duracell and they offered to send me one pack of batteries. I am going to be calling them to discuss this further but just be prepared that you too might get one that only accepts certain battery brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks like a junk","review":"I bought this night light as a gift to my 3 year-old niece. I assume that all kids are in love with stars and oceans or cute creatures. So i though this twilight turtle would be the best gift since it has gotten so much great reviews as well and it even suggests \\"ideal for ages 3 to adult\\". However, it was not so much as i expected it to be - not so dreamy and fascinating. Instead, you cannot even see the constellations clearly at all. there was no music and the light is so faint. the piece just looks like a junk in the room. not too impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing great","review":"Very disappointed! It's basically a light under a plastic shell with holes in it. I expected an option to signify each constellation, but it's just cut out holes. not happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent service and product","review":"We purchased two of the Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Lights, Lady Bug for our two 8 year old great granddaughters and were delighted with the product and the shipping service. These Lady Bugs were actually more than we had hope for and we couldn't be happier. They are educational as well as functional, and we highly recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves this thing","review":"My daughter loves this little turtle. She needs it with her every night at bedtime. The yellow is pretty light on the walls/ceiling but the other colors work great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inconvenient but Fun","review":"My infant nephew and toddler daughter both love the constellations this turtle projects onto the ceiling. So does my adult brother-in-law. I don't love that to get the full effect you have to place it in the middle of the floor where you later trip over it, but it's a small price to pay for a happy, engaged child. Works great as a night light too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"turtle","review":"My 13 mo. old seems to really like this turtle. Only complaint is that the lighting is not bright enough. Needs to be on a surface close to walls to view the stars. Could be improved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"Cool. Great for putting kids to bed. Puts off just the right amount of light and stays on just long enough for kids to go to sleep. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A blessing from the stars above!","review":"I bought two of these, one for my 4 year old son and one for my 1.5 year old daughter. I commend myself for this purchase because both my children love their Twilight Turtle. It has become a part of their bedtime routine. Not only is it educational but it is also of quality construction. The turtle's body parts are so soft that my toddler loves running her hands over them. And the Twilight Turtle is also able to withstand a great pounding because my daughter also loves to throw it around and knock on different objects with its shell. Believe it or not, it hasn't even chipped and it still functions as is expected.Well worth the money. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a night light which gives the child comfort; and as the child grows older and more cognizant the turtle becomes multi-functional because it is also educational. It is fun pointing out the constellations to my 4 year old son."},{"rating":"2","title":"My wife and I love it","review":"I bought this for my girlfriend - (now my wife) - ~4 years later we still turn this on above our bed every night!"},{"rating":"2","title":"light up turtle","review":"We like this a lot except for the fact that it turns off after 45 mins and my son\`s screaming till we go back and turn it back on....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night Light Turtle","review":"My 2 and 4 year olds love this. They fall asleep with it on and it automatically shuts off after awhile. I like how it came with batteries and is easy to use. The stars/moon clearly project on the walls and ceiling. It was a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died two days after I got it","review":"Lady Bug worked beautifully...for one night. Changed the batteries, followed directions, no results. If I didn't have a sleep-hating baby, I'd probably have the wherewithal to return this thing. It's impossible to change the lightbulb (or even get to it, just to see if there's a loose/dirty connection). I like being able to fix things without disemboweling them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lighting effect is cool, battery life is terrible","review":"This is a really neat toy, it looks adorable to my 5 year old, the blue and green lighting is really cool. I agree with others that the yellow color is not very visible. However, this light is a constant pain for me. The batteries only last through 3 nights and I did verify that it shuts off after 20 minutes. I bought rechargeable batteries so I am not throwing so many away, however the compartment for the batteries is so tight that it requires a small flat head screwdriver to get the batteries out. This can require some hunting around in my house. A note for the design company that If you design it after a turtle, make it a little larger so you can use C or D type batteries, not AAA batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Thing I bought for my Toddler","review":"Love - Love - Love this product!! My 2.5 year old was resisting going to bed until the Twilight Turtle! Our bedtime routine now includes the turtle with stars/moon & she practically jumps into bed so she can lay there and fall asleep! I've been so pleased I wrote about it on my blog and facebook page and had several other friends/family ask more about it so they could buy one for their kiddos. Great Product!The blue light shines the best & green is pretty good too. The orange light requires it be really dark to show up, but its my favorite for sleeping because I don't feel like it keeps her room too bright. However, I let my daughter pick what color each night and none seem to be too bright. She always falls asleep without making a fuss now! Quiet as a peep! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"so adorable","review":"I am 9 months pregnant and saw this in Fit Pregnancy magazine. Went to the company's website and it sold for $35. Found it on amazon for $15 less. And got it today. COuldn't be more pleased with it. Hell, my husband wants to put it in our room instead of the baby's room."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great product!","review":"My daughter loves her nightlight! It's not so bright that it keeps her awake, but it keeps her busy until she falls asleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great.","review":"I bought it for my 2-year old daughter. She loves it. We would find the moon together every night. It's fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really cute!","review":"I've had this night light for my daughter little over 6 months now and it works really good, it's really cute. It's had 3 different lights, but in all honesty it's kind of a waste seeing as how the setting \\"blue\\" looks better than the other colors. All in all it's a very good product I recommend it to all mommies"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep Tight","review":"This is the best gift to give any new mom or any parent of a child. In fact, I even bring it in to my room often and play with soothing celestial sounds.Wonderfully relaxing for all ages, this gift was given to my little one, and now we own one for each child's room and give them as gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, Love, Love - You need this.","review":"This product is so fantastic I have bought three of them, one for each room my daughter may fall asleep in. We have the pink ladybug, the red ladybug and the twilight turtle. The stars are so sweet to look at and provide a nice nightlight for the little ones. it's really cool that the stars actually show constellations and the story book that comes with the package is fun.The auto turn off feature is great and seems to be the perfect amount of time for my daughter to fall asleep. It's small enough to be portable (we schlep it to grandma's house regularly) but a good size for kids to cuddle with too. Some of our friends came over with their kids, who are a couple years older than ours, and flipped when they found the ladybug. This is great for infants all the way to pre-teens. Heck, even my husband and I will put one in our room some nights because it's so fun to look at.I highly recommend this. You need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful product!","review":"My daughter (3 yr old) saw her cousin with this item and had to have it. She absolutely loves it and it helps her feel more comfortable in the dark. Thanks Amazon for offering this unique item at such a great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twighlight Turtle is wonderful!!","review":"Our little 2 (almost 3) year old LOVES this! She is fascinated with the stars and even at her age, she is now able to find Orion's Belt in the 'galaxy' on her bedroom ceiling - it has encouraged her to look at the stars at night when she is outside too. Nothing but positives - easy for her to use - and it shuts off automatically after 45 minutes - so she goes to sleep with the stars, but we don't have it running all night. I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"1 Year old loves it","review":"Thought my year old was a little too young for this but he LOVES it. He pushes all the buttons to turn on/off and changes the colors. He looks at the stars on the ceiling and oohs and aahs. The brown/yellow is a little too dim for the ceiling but if he has it in his crib this is perfect when he goes to bed since it's not too bright. Great price too - cheaper than in the stores!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"It has to be very close to the ceiling--maybe 4 feet away--for it to look like stars on the ceiling. I had to hold it up high. The batteries came with it, so they were fresh batteries. I was very disappointed, as it was a gift. If it was for myself, I would have returned it. It seemed like it would be really cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible experience with Amazon","review":"I ordered this product for my granddaughter on Saturday and received it today - totally amazed at the speedy service. However when I opened the box I discovered that the batteries were not included and the Storybook, Adoption certificate and Star Guide were all missing. Clearly this is a returned item!This is the first time I received a sub standard item from Amazon. In fact I tried to make sure that it is sold by Amazon to ensure I receive good product and I am very disappointed. I do not know what else shoud be included in the box - all I received was a turtle that would not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"only lasts 3 nights","review":"I got this for my baby shower, but my 2 year old son LOVES it!! I loved it also until I realized that I had to change the batteries every 3 nights! Batteries are expensive. My son asks for his stars every night, but I have to tell him that they are broken. I'm extremely disappointed and think it is horribly designed if it only lasts 3 nights, and that's even when it turns off automatically after 45 minutes, so it really only gets less than an hour and a half of working time before the batteries need to be changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior quality?","review":"About a month ago, I purchased 2 of those ladybugs for my boys. The kids love them; the only problem is that they seem to be poorly made: I had gotten 2; neither one was very bright; then the green light went out in one, less than one month after having purchased them (apparently you can't replace the bulbs). I went through Amazon and the replacement came in last Tuesday (brighter than the first one); I returned the one with the broken light by mail today - and just now the new one (which was much brighter than the first two) wouldn't turn off nor change colors when pushing the buttoms on the wings. I then turned it off completely and now it won't turn back on at all.As stated above, the kids love them, but I don't want to have to continuously return them, so I am going to research other ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright vivid colors, our girls love it!!","review":"We purchased the lady bug version of this back in December 2010 for our 3 year old daughter. She has been going through the night fears disliking the dark very much. When we received this we were so excited and she just LOVED it! We went through all three colors, and the blue one was the one that worked the best..our daughter calls it purple of course, and it's her favorite one. :) The green is her second favorite, not quite as bright as the blue, but still wonderful. The red was not really visible..we never use that one. When we first bought this product, we had issues with the batteries having to change them quite often, but now not so much. I haven't changed the batteries in it for a couple of months now...and it's still going strong.**UPDATE**Almost 1.5 years later, this product is still going strong. We have 2 girls now and we have one in each of their rooms. They both just love this product. I would recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and bright","review":"I bought this for my second daughter's nursery; we still have 5 weeks until she's due, but in the meantime my first daughter loves playing with it so much I need to hide it or we'll have to change the batteries before the intended user ever gets to enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicest Gift for Kids","review":"My grandson is afraid of the dark and this great little invention solved that problem and saved on electricity in the meantime."},{"rating":"2","title":"NITE LIGHT TURTLE","review":"I PURCHASED 2 OF THESE TURTLES FOR MY TWO GRANDAUGHTERS AGE 7 AND 9.

I bought it almost a year ago now and had no problems with it. Still works great and has been through a sick episode and cleaning with soap and water. Her favorite color is the blue since its the brightest and shows up the best. The green and red colors are much lighter especially the red. I love the automatic shut off timer, its enough for her to fall asleep. All and all great product and she loves it which is the most important!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved at first, until it stopped working","review":"Bought this nightlight for my 3 year old who was developing a fear of the dark. We were very pleased with this product for about the first 3 months, then the green and blue lights (which we primarily used as they were the brightest) started to fade. So we switched to the amber about a month ago, and now that color no longer works. In fact, nothing works now, despite changing the batteries. I am very disappointed, as this comfort item that we relied upon to help my daughter get to sleep has stopped working for no apparent reason. I expected more from this product, as it wasn't cheap and looked like a good quality product.

It does create pretty stars on the walls, NOT on the ceiling. It does have to be pretty close to the ceiling to get a reasonable effect.I purchased two, and both have a radius of about 3 feet.I place it on my son's night stand, which is pretty tall, and it barely reaches the ceiling.Too pricey for what it does... which is not much.Very disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cutest nightlight ever!","review":"This nightlight is a little bit more pricey than the other styles - but the color choice was perfect for my daughter's room. We are very happy with the product. It is so cute and I feel better that she has a nightlight with no bulb to worry about. The star show on the ceiling and wall is gorgeous.

The title should be Attributes of Successful People, but it does not seem to be about intelligence, nor does the author seem to have a consistent meaning for the term intelligence. At times he expands his generally valid complaints about intelligence tests to include acheivement and all other tests, despite the fact that they presumably measure acheived knowledge and not ability or potential to learn. There is little to explain why he settled on just his three types of intelligence (analytical, creative, and practical) and at times, he seems to be implicitly accept some of Gardner's, such as spatial intelligence."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Lawyer-Storyteller Recounts Tales of Smalltown Cases","review":"A wonderful book full of captivating stories of real people who come into contact with the legal system in rural Vermont.

We have endemic ant colonies in our yard, and while I have no qualms dispensing granular and liquid death around the outside of the house, I would prefer something less toxic inside. The Safer product is nothing short of amazing. The original formulation had mint oil as an active ingredient, and now they have switched to limonene, which gives a citrusy smell.I am surprised it is not carried more widely. I have never seen it in Lowes or Home Depot.Safer Ant & Roach delivers a double whammy. It kills ants (and other bugs) on contact. And it serves as a repellant.

My two cans arrived arrived today and is NOT the same at all. The active ingredients pose a danger to humans and pets, whereas the active ingredient in the Victor product is lemon oil.

We continued to shake it in between sprays. We initially sprayed an entire area of our kitchen where we see them most, enough to where our entire house smelled like mint for about 12 hours. Then we went outside and sprayed the exterior. 2 days later, we saw 2 roaches. It seemed to stun one roach enough to manually kill it. When we sprayed the rest of the can on the other roach, it finally died after about a minute. I thought \\"Kills in seconds\\" meant that it would kill in a few seconds, like under 30, but I guess the company was rather liberal with that.

Compared to the HP one that my friend has, I believe this one is definitely superior. Overall, it is easier to manipulate with this one. One big advantage the TI has over the HP is when computing combinations and permutations: for the TI the fast keys are in place, whereas with an HP you would need to run the formulas manually which is extremely time-consuming. I give this one two thumbs up for people taking the CFA exams.However, one drawback I want to mention is the fact that sometimes the pressed buttons aren't entered; you have to plug in the numbers and symbols pretty slowly in order to be 100% sure that all of those are entered in.

In terms of actual design, the only thing additionally I'd ask for is perhaps a second line on the LCS for reviewing calculations algebraically.But there exists one huge problem. While the buttons give a very positive *click* when you press them, it seems about one time in 10 or 15 the key press fails to register. As I normally touch-type on the number pad, it renders the device next to worthless. The only way to ensure you calculations come out right is to stare at the screen after each....and....every....key press. That might be great for high school kids taking a finance class, but it is worthless for the \\"Professionals\\" the product name would imply might use it.The only thing keeping this piece of junk from getting a single star from me is that yes, it does technically work.

There are a score of Tori-alikes (or Toriaokes, if you will) our there, but Vienna surpasses all and forges her own, unique sound and vision. This is a lovely, beautiful, moving album that shows her expanding on her first album and even, in my opinion, bettering it. If you like Tori Amos, you'll love this album. More importantly, if you like good, intelligent music that comes from the heart and speaks to the heart, you should own this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cup of Tea for Anyone...","review":"...If you've ever had a day that is just perfect for a hot cup of tea, or coffee, this is the album to play. Her vocals are as soothing and comforting as a warm blanket on a snowy evening, and the piano complements it perfectly. However, her talent is not relegated just to the recordings studios. Her live talent engages the audience that takes them beyond a passive listener and takes them to the point that they become and active participant in the musical celebration.In this album Vienna becomes a story-teller with tales that are able to move you to question without thinking. She speaks with the lips of a truck driver returning to his hometown on \\"homecoming\\" and allows the words of a pregnant single girl headed towards an abortion clinic on \\"shasta.\\" her wordplay is eloquent and tangible, as her tunes go from a light, jaunty \\"harbor\\" to the slower, melodic and touching \\"anna rose.\\" a definite buy for anyone who shops for music looking for comfort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated...","review":"This chick is overrated.

She reminds me of Laura Nyro and Essra Mohawk, which is a huge compliment in my musical universe.Her music is very personal, bewitching, and immediate, backed by the enthralling colorations of her piano orchestrations. On the TV special, she tells the very interesting stories behind each song. I consider her to be a major musical find and I will follow her career.

At first, I was really excited about this phone because it has a cool look to it. However, the actual operation of the phone is just plain lousy. The volume is very poor, and the placement of the ear piece is awkward. You have to hold the phone up to your ear a certain way in order to adequately hear the speaker on the other end. The ergonomics of the handset also make it uncomfortable to hold. It's like holding a block -- there's nothing that makes this phone ergonomically pleasant. The buttons on the keypad are difficult to push, and I've often had to redial a number because I did not push the buttons down hard enough. Also, while the hand unit does sit on the base properly, it seems to be easily knocked over. I'm not impressed with this phone whatsoever. Its \\"coolness\\" has worn off on me, so I'm going back to my old Panasonic.

Each team picks their best player. Marks's team picks Lester, and Darren and Debbie's team pick Skank. The first person to throw-up loses. If you read this book you can find out who wins.

At first, I myself did not believe that these events actually happened. Only when I asked my own family, did it occur to me that the events in this memoir are a vivid painting of how it really was living in Vietnam in the years that followed the war. Because of this novel and my curiosity, my family has been pouring me with endless amounts of stories about their experiences, most of which are exactly what the author of The Unwanted talks about.

I thought the author to be an easy (and honest) story teller. Too often in these types of books the author makes him/herself out to be perfect. Not the case in this book.

Despite the best efforts of his loving mother and grandparents, they could not shield him from the discrimination and hatred of other Asians -- which included neighbors and extended family members. From adolescence on, Kien struggles to get himself and his family to America, and is thwarted numerous times, nearly dying in the process. Even though his existence is close to horrific at times, Nguyen maintains a good sense of distance, so that he doesn't get overly emotional or whiny.

The retelling of Arthurian times as seen through the eyes of a peasant-turned-knight was inspired and intriguing. Mr. James has obviously researched his subject well. The reader can taste the dust, sweat and blood of an ardent knight as well as feel his honor, valor and love of chivalry. This is a book I did not want to end. One can only hope there will be a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing Look at Arthur's Court","review":"The promos on the jacket did not do justice to this story. The book does an excellent job at describing what it could have been like for knights in the age of Chivalry. It covers loyalties, honor and courtly love in a twist of conflicts, conscience and love, all weaved masterfully into the Arthurian legend. The book is a bit lusty at times, but this adds to the story instead of detracting. Although I read almost anything Arthurian, this book sat on my shelf for a while, due to a lack of interest, had I known how good it was, I would have read it much sooner.

Lorin and Camille are wonderful companions as I follow their inspiring voices on the CD. Listening, I feel a sense of passion, aliveness, tenderness and adventure as I foray into the personal, creative, parts of my self these meditations encourage. This is easy. It's like I've stumbled on to some key secrets into myself ...with a little bit of help. The book is a great refresher (i leave mine in the car)... poetic and direct.

So far she has not been wrong and he has become a strong and beautiful bird since being seen by her. The best advice I can give any bird owner is to ALWAYS take your bird to an \\"Avian Vet\\" and believe their expertise over any book! Books are helpful but not always correct. The reason I mention an \\"Avian Vet\\" is because they specialize in birds. You wouldn't go to a foot doctor if you had a cold, so why would you take your bird to a cat/dog vet? There really is a difference and it shows in how they handle and understand your bird. They are sometimes hard to find, but worth looking for.

This book is intended for novices to cockatiel keeping. Teaching novices improper terms is confusing to them when they start dealing with people in the know.This and the fact that Vriends has authored (or been credited authoring) books on goats, bee keeping, ferrets, long-haired cats and various dog breeds, among others, makes me wonder if he has ever owned a cockatiel and whether he has any real practical experience with any of these animals.Yes, he does have a handful of post-graduate degrees, but why is he ignorant of certain simple, common terms connected to this species? Probably because he has a contract to pump out as many \\"expert\\" animal books as he can.

As a make-up artist myself, I was intrigued to hear so many stories that resonate with my own, more current, experiences. My only real complaint is that the book contains very little in the way of detailed explanatiuons of how Mr. Ashton created his make-ups or products used.

A thin plot routinely sets the mood for great payoffs, but then proceeds to miss ever-so-slightly with the punchline, like it knows how to be funny but is afraid to fully commit. It boasts a tremendous cast of supporting actors, drawn from no less than a dozen genuine classics, but Jeremy Piven fails once again to graduate into a reliable lead and that front-office vacancy leaves the picture feeling hollow. A grab bag of potentially funny ideas and situations that don't always deliver, it's the kind of flick you might expect to catch on Comedy Central at 3AM. Very similar to Wet Hot American Summer in that respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES!","review":"This movie is hilarious. The fact that some people don't see that is kind of ridiculous!

This movie can only be described as being some awful attempt at taking the the humor from Anchorman (idiotic and over-the-top, but still funny) and trying to make it work with used car salesmen. The storyline is pathetic, and you notice this right off the bat. Within 10 minutes Piven gives some pointless speech on an airplane that ends is cheers from the passengers and him motorboating the stewardess - believe, my summary of that scene is ten times funnier than actually watching it. Plus, as usual, Piven simply tries to play \\"Ari\\" as this is his only talent. Oh, and his female sidekick is nicknamed \\"Babs\\", just like his business partner in Entourage.

The spray modes were lacking a bit; the modes would blend together.Overall, the idea and the head are good for the price. But don't use the provide coupler. It will fail and you'll have to hold the sprayer all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tooooo heavy.....","review":"Culligan makes good products and the showerhead is obviously very well constructed, the problem is, is too heavy. So much so that there is no shower holder that will hold it up. I was manipulating it and it fell on my face and I now have a very fat lip. The shower with the cartridge inside weighs almost 2 lbs.

I had read numerous reviews, but was able to install without any issues, no leaks, no cracking, etc. The spray and choices of different sprays are very nice and I am happy with those. The only thing that I would like changed is that after placing the shower head in the holder it does not point out into the shower stall, but points down and back, more toward the wall where it is installed. It is still possible to stand partially under the spray to some extent, but you end up being very close to the wall and the water handles. Some sort of adjustment pin for the shower head would be nice so it could be placed at the desired angle. The hose attachment for the shower head is nice and long, and it is easy to remove and return the shower head to the holder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good filter, shower head could be better designed","review":"Shower head mounting bracket broke after a few months of use rendering it useless.

One would think that a product that supposedly comes with a 5 year warranty won't need the type of upkeep that requires remounting it in 2 months (and not being able to shower at a time that is likely to be inopportune one for you) - instead the mounting this thing has is of the same poor quality as the cheapest chinese shower heads off ebay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great warranty!","review":"The hose to the showerhead got punctured.

My hair was softer, fewer breakouts on my skin....Then, it started to just trickle water out, so I figured that I needed to change the filter, which I did. Ever since then, even with the new filter in, water won't come out full-force and is MISERABLE to take a shower in. I am not sure if there are clogs or mineral build up inside where I can not clean it, but WHAT A HASSLE! I am thoroughly disappointed in this product and would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't make any noticeable difference","review":"didn't make any noticeable difference to my hard water.

Still plenty of soap scum, no increased lather, no improvement to hair or skin. descent as a showerhead but too heavy for it's holder."},{"rating":"1","title":"too heavy","review":"I cannot get it to stay up it is too heavy for the bracket so I had to take it down and would like to return it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good at filtering water, but heavy headed making it impossible to point where you want it","review":"This product was effective at removing the chlorine, no odor from the water out of this product compared to the chlorine odor coming from the nearby sink. However, having the filter in the head made it heavy. The hang up cup has the ball type swivel similar to other showerheads. The added weight meant the head constantly tilted the swivel ball all the way down with the shower head hung in the cup. I had to stand with my nose against the wall to get the water on me. I looked everywhere for a hang up cup that does not have the swivel ball and the only ones I found were more expensive than this showerhead. I ultimately replaced it with a sprite filter and a cheap shower head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Head heavy","review":"Head heavy no way of adjusting shower head so that the water sprays correctly on you. No I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"I tried this showerhead to find that the water pressure became really slow and it was like showering outdoors on a misty day. I didn't notice any difference in my skin since I thought the filter would help reduce the amount of minerals in the water that dry out your skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Design","review":"The ball joint is not strong enough to support the shower head so that the showerhead points directly at the ground. Because all of the joints are cheap plastic, there is no way to tighten things enough for it to actually support the head. I should have read the reviews more carefully, this product is cheap and not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I have purchased two of these. The first one had numerous problems with the filter clogging. I had to keep turning it over and I find replacing the filter very difficult. It's virtually impossible to pry out of the shower head.

I won't be purchasing a third."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad holder design","review":"The quality of the shower head is good. However, the shower head holder has a big flaw.With the filter in place, the shower head is too heavy for the ball joint. The shower head keeps pointing down.Does anyone find a solution to fix the ball joint issue?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could be better","review":"We have very hard water and I hated it after moving from a home that had a water softener installed. This filtering shower head seems to be an improvement but I haven't noticed anything dramatic just yet; time will tell. We're not crazy about the cheap plastic bracket used to hold the shower head and the weight makes it droop and point downward as some other reviewers have commented. However, I've found that once the water is turned on the pressure makes it easier to adjust and stay put so it hasn't been a big deal.I do love having the removable handle, which is why I bought this model instead of the other Culligan one that has awesome reviews but is stationary. It makes it easier to shampoo and rinse my young daughter's hair at bath time and that was worth the minor inconvenience of re-adjusting the direction for normal showers."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"This shower head has been nothing but trouble. I bought one back in sept. I sent it back because the head flopped forward after installation. I would have to hold in in my hand to get wet because the water would spray towards the wall behind the mount. I couldn't hold it for too long because it's so heavy. So I sent it back and got a replacement. The replacement is now doing the same thing. Yesterday the shower head flopped forward and fell off the mount hitting me in the face. I'm lucky I still have all my teeth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"parts that hold the shower head can be break easily","review":"I saw others review about shower head fall off but because I care more about filtering, I ended up buying the product. However, after using 6 months, part that holding the shower ball got cracked and no longer able to use. It says 5 years warranty, so I tried to contact and I was connected to voice mail and even though I left the voice mail, they never called me back.So, if you want to use if for long term, better find other products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Softer Water for Less","review":"This Culligan HSH-C135 filtered handheld showerhead is very good.

I had to run out to Home Depot to buy a new shower handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in 2 diff ways","review":"This broke after about two months. The piece that screws onto the pipe--chrome plastic nut--cracked on installation. It still managed to function for a while. Then the ball joint from which that controls the angle which the shower head sprays stopped working, so it failed to stay upright, causing it to crack further. The filter worked OK, but it was a big waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fix Heavy Shower Head","review":"This is a fix for the heavy shower head holder for some,,,others may not like it. Push the shower head all the way up and look at the swivel attachment where the pipe comes out of the wall. Take a small plastic tie wrap and pull it around the connection with the buckel at the bottom and let the head rest on it...tighted the tie wrap and trim to the buckel. You won't be able to see the tie wrap without leaning around to the back of the pipe. Now the angle of the shower head is no longer straight down but at fixed level resting on the tie wrap. Hope this helps someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"This shower head unit broke upon installation. It is not crafted from very sturdy materials, so I had to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"The shower head is so heavy that it won't stay up when showering. I contacted culligan and they had no remedies. When I said I guess I'll have to return it, he said that sounds like the best thing. They really need to fix this, big design flaw!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy With This Product!","review":"I am very pleased with our new filtered shower head. As others have stated, I noticed a definite improvement in the softness of my skin. It is also so comforting to know that my lungs no longer breath in chlorine fumes throughout my daily shower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"The weight of the showerhead was too much for the ball joint. It just kept falling straight down. I tried as much as I could to tighten it, but no luck. It's just a really cheaply made showerhead. I took the advice of a friend and didn't read the reviews here which I typically never do. Bad idea, as it looks as though others have had the same experience. I returned it and Amazon was great, as usual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be made better","review":"This would be a great product if the part that connects to the shower pipe was made of metal instead of plastic. According to the instructions, you are to use a wrench to put the part on even though you are screwing plastic on to metal. I just used my hands to put the part on and it cracked (even though I used plumbers tape as instructed). I went to home depot to see if I could find a metal replacement for it, but they don't sell them. I did however find a plastic replacement which I purchased for $5. I like the product itself as my skin and hair feels better and soap lathers better, however they could have made the part that screws on to the metal shower pipe METAL instead of plastic. Poor design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful as HAND HELD but won't stay in place in bracket","review":"We got this shower head this week and I should have paid closer attention to the fact that it says HAND HELD in the item name. The shower head seems to do well at filtering chlorine but we can't actually use it as a main shower head (to stand under, etc). It isn't adjustable and kind of flops downward because of gravity so unless you stand directly up against the wall, the stream doesn't go on you. We have two shower heads in our shower so we will keep it and install it on the one that never gets used but I wouldn't recommend this as the primary shower head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Purchased about a year ago. Made of plastic so it cracked when tightening the connection during initial installation. Very disappointed.

The water smells better ,our soap seems to lather better also.Only complaint is once we got a bad filter. I don't know if the filter was old or what. but if you open the filter box and the stickers fell off the filter it's most likely no good although when they are good they last a good five to six months .You will notice not much water strength.J&R took it back at no extra cost and shipped new one. fortunetly we had a second filter because showerhead won't work without filter which is another bummer,But I would not hesitate to buy this showerhead again.so make sure your prepared get two filters."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does the job but...","review":"Pros: The Culligan HSH-C135 was really easy to install. I didn't even need to call the plumber or a handyman to replace my old showerhead. From the picture, there aren't many components to snap the filter and shower head. My old shower head also uses a flexible hose so that it was just a matter of unscrewing off the old one and screwing the new one in. It was also nice that a teflon was provided that I don't have to go out buy one. The water that comes out has nice clean feel to it. When I get off the shower, it doesn't feel like there are still some suds left.Cons: Because the water has to go through the filter, much of the pressure gets reduced. The same amount of water comes out but the direction is more downward than really spraying out. I tried fiddling with the settings. Sadly, I couldn't improve the water flow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Not so bad if it lasted more than a month. I would expect at least a year. This product is poor quality and won't last long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not such a good deal.","review":"The weight of the shower head caused the entire head to sag down, preventing the adjustment of an appropriate angle.I really wanted this showerhead to work out for me (for the sake of the filter), but, I suppose with the quality of the product, it's no big surprise that I have to send it back. The plastic parts simply failed to support the bulk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Showerhead - I'll never use another!","review":"Hello All:I have seen a few negative reviews on here and I can't for the life of me figure out why.

The only thing that really irratates me about this item is that the most important part is made of plastic. the part that the handle hangs on needs to be attached to the half inch pipe coming out of the wall. the part is plastic to metal. it's also undersized,which makes it crack in half. especially after you apply the tape to the metal pipe from the wall. I couldn't use it and had to use the old one,which is plastic,chinese plastic,but a little thicker Culligan should get there s**t together and do some improvement.

This book provides the most comprehensive review of physics avalible in prep books, and it provides numerous examples and MCAT style physics questions with thorough explanations. Even though its MCAT style questions are more difficult than the actual exam, it greatly prepares testakers for the challenges they face on the real exam. In my physics classes, I did not do particularly well in them, and this is the reason why I purchased the MCAT Physics Book. Before I used this book to study for the MCAT, my physical sciences section was a 9; but after preparing myself with this book, my score jumped to a 12 on the MCAT. I highly recomend this book for everyone, especially students that had little physics or did not do well in their physics classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solutions are wrong","review":"This book is very practically laid out and appeared to be an efficient method of studying, but for those who are actually meticulously going through each problem, you will notice many errors. A few of the solutions are mislabeled. Other mathematical formulas are not properly written or rearranged. I have ofund 4 errors in this book and I'm only on Chapter 3. And those are only the ones i have caught. I would not buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar compliment to other programs.","review":"I recommend this to every student who finds the physics aspect of the MCAT the most challenging. For my first rough go around as a junior on an AAMC pre-test, I scored a 13 on the Biological sciences (my organic chemistry is pristine), and a 10 on the Physical sciences, the massive chasm being a result of solubility/phase chemistry and archaic physics topics (my modern physics is also pristine). This book, which I received three days ago, has illuminated several issues. If you have problems with:: Centripetal force, banking, cars; gravitational force; and reading graphs & knowing when to utilize the area under the curve, this will compliment everything taught in the Examkrackers or Kaplan versions. I actually recommend this PLUS Examkrackers Physics, as they seem to compliment one another where I had areas of weaknesses."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the better mcat book","review":"the review are short and to the point...which is what you need for physics given that you understood the concept during your prereq classes.all the topic in mcat is covered in this textbook.there are lots of problems after every chapters. the problems were adequate...most of them are easy to medium levelsI would like to see more hard mcat passage so i would be better prepared for the real thing.

While it may not be as visually pleasing as Examkrackers, it is more thorough in both explanations and practice problems. The chapters are divided into small, manageable segments which can accommodate a variety of study schedules. This book could likely stand on its own for most students, without a need for a full-sized textbook for reference.

I thought that was just way too far. I would never beat my dog, but giving him a light tap so he isn't ripping my fingers to shreds and drawing blood is by no means abusive...There was good info about shaping and positive rewards but many other trainers teach these same concepts.

On many occasions, he closes off vowels, and fakes vibrato, and often uses vocal tricks to get by. As Ball tries to cover pop songs, attempting to be stylistic, they come off as trying really hard, and not letting his voice flow nearly as well as he does in broadway tunes i have heard him sing. Basically, Michael Balll has a voice that can do certain things, but still relies on tricks to get him through lots of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"GAG!!!","review":"I was so very impressed with Micheal Ball in Les Mis that when I saw a CD of his \\"Very Best\\" in the store, I didn't hesitate to buy it and hurry out of the store to listen.

I was disgusted when the CD opened with \\"Hot Stuff\\"!!!! Puhlease!! That was so completely gross that I almost threw the CD away. And was it really necessary to record yet another renditition of \\"My Heart Will Go On\\"? The movie was atrocious and the song isn't far behind it on the way down the garbage chute. Better luck next time Mike!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing!","review":"Buy this CD if you want to hear an amazing voice sing familiar tunes from Broadway and the movies!

That about sums up the power and soul that can be felt just by listening to this CD. Mr. Ball shines in every song he does. Pop, Broadway, Rock n' Roll, you name it, he can sing it. The selection of songs is perfect. He blends tenderness (The Way We Were/The Rose), and wordless emotion (Prepare Ye the Way of the Lord/Gethsemane), with just plain fun (Blues Brothers Medley).

It was hard to decide among the few that were in stock. The reasons I chose this album: to hear him live, the excellent mix of his old classics and new songs, and to pretend I actually get to see him live. His voice has grown beautifully, making his old songs like \\"One Step Out of Time\\" and \\"Love Changes Everything\\" sound new. One can really hear his range on this album with the different genres of music from show tunes to rock & roll. It was a very nice surprise to hear him perform his first written song, \\"Someone Else's Dream\\", which was really good. I highly recommend this album, you won't be disappointed. My only disappointment is that I have yet to see him perform live."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible CD!!!!","review":"FINALLY Michael's music is making it to the US!!

She devotes a chapter to each concept and offers relevant examples to show aspiring tech writers how to apply the concepts to their own work. This is not just a grammar book; it is a well thought out set of tactics that help generate a worthwhile technical document.

In this book Kochman makes many broad generalizations that, while he may consider them true, are belied by the way he phrases them.

Yamaha was perfectly willing to repair the issue, but also was okay with me fixing it with super glue and avoiding the hassle of shipping them back (without voiding any warranties.) So, if you're in a similarly hot place, you can probably expect similar issues, but it was an easy fix and the speakers are still completely functional."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst outdoor speaker for its size, ever.","review":"These are the worst speakers I have ever heard, and are unable to be driven by any amp under 100 watts sufficiently.

Had to send them back, there also MASSIVE in size, and don't produce what they look like they should. Dont always trust the reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Me","review":"I should have paid attention to the size of these speakers because they are way too big for my needs. While that's not the fault of the speakers, their size and the mounting brackets severely limit where and how you can mount them. I wanted to mount them to the soffit of my home but the only way to do so would have them pointing straight down. I then considered different ways to make them work but I think that they would stick out like a sore thumb. I haven't even connected them to a stereo so I cannot comment to how they sound. Back they go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yamaho outdoor speaker","review":"I use these speakers for my enclosed back patio (35 x 10). Amazing sound quality for the price. I also setup a logitech bluetooth wireless adapter and the sound is still amazing. No noticable loss in audio over bluetooth using these speakers. I wasn't expecting these speakers to have ANY type of bass, but depending on the song; the bass is clearly heard (WOW). These speakers perfect for my setup. I didn't really want a boom box playing too lound of a sound that would force my neighbors to hate me (LOL).When i'm outside at the sides of my house (out of the enclosed mesh back patio), the sound is clear as a whistle (which is pretty clear). I hear the sound every when i'm in other parts of my back yard. For $99 bucks for the pair of Yamaha's, you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mounting these speakers","review":"I agree with all of the other posts (which is why I bought these speakers) that yes, the sound quality is awesome when considering what we paid.The reason I posted a review was to help with the mounting. As you've read, the mounting bracket doesn't allow you to hang these speakers under an overhang and tilt them down, like towards the pool or patio.But after going to a lot of trouble to build some hangers, which worked out really nice, I noticed THESE SPEAKERS HAVE A SCREW HOLE IN ONE END THAT ALLOW YOU TO MOUNT THEM WITH ANY UNIVERSAL SPEAKER MOUNTS. They will hang in a profile position, but with the speaker mounts could be tilted downward.I wish someone would have mentioned this in previous posts, would have saved me a lot of work making a homemade device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speakers that are small with Big sound","review":"excellent sound quality, deep resonating bass coming from a pair of small speakers you can hide away indoors or out on the patio, finally a great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Best Buy","review":"The highs are crisp and the bass is good, overall a nice warm sound. This is surprising considering that these are outdoor speakers. Be aware that these are 6 ohm speakers, so you need an amplifier with \\"guts\\". My 100 watt Sony would overheat and cut off. However, the Harmon Kardon with 55 watts played these speakers superbly, its just not in the wattage.Mounting the speakers vertical or horizontal with the enclosed brackets may turn out to be a misnomer for some consumers. The direction can only be controlled in the vertical position. This is important in high mounts with the need to point the speakers downward. Of course you can just devise your own mounts. Overall , these are a great speaker and carry a terrific low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I did research on Bose, Klipsch, and JBL outdoor speakers. I stumbled across these Yamaha speakers for a fraction of the cost of the 300-400 price tag I was looking at with other brands. I bought them thinking the risk was low.

They sound great and fill the whole pool area with nice sound. I have had them for two months and almost from the beginning the grills keep falling off. They are exposed to the sun outside and the glue seems to keep melting with the heat and humidity of the weather in St. Louis. I have contacted Yamaha to see if there is a way to keep the grills from falling off. I am concerned about their durability for outdoor use and do not like to see the grills sitting on the ground every other week. I have another pair of infinity speakers and the Yamaha were cheaper and sound as good or better but the infinity seem more durable. If nothing can be done to keep the grills on these speakers I'm not sure I would buy them again.

I was not wanting to spend hundreds of dollars on mid-range brands, Bose, Polk, etc - some of which they had there. Sure they \\"feel\\" sturdy, heavy and quality built but they're expensive for something which will take outdoor abuse. On the flip side, I didn't feel comfortable with the cheapy Insignias they had there either. I didn't need thundering bass or extensively loud music. My yard is only about 34'x40'. Sure, you can get better quality sound out of some of the units mentioned above. However, for the price, the sound quality of these speakers are a sensational value. Clarity is very good, bass is adequate for their intended purpose and mounting was easy. For the money, you can't go wrong.

This works!","review":"This address book is lovely, with country home drawings, and good quotes to brighten your day, and nice little details everywhere. I like its size, not too small, not too big--it fits nicely in my desk drawer and hand. Best of all, the space for addresses isn't labled for telephone, email, etc. Which means I can fill it in the way that is convenient for me. That is important, since many addresses take up more than the traditional three lines alloted by most address books. There are five lines per entry, spaced like a college ruler notebook. There is an extra lined page at the beginning of each letter of the alphabet, for personal notes. There are plenty of refill pages, and space for notes at the end. The only drawback for me, is that there is no pocket to insert loose notes or cards.

I saw this, and I just couldn't say no. They've already watched a couple, and loved 'em. Definitely a good buy, although I sometimes wish it was cheaper, I understand you can't pick and choose. There are some good and familiar actors, if you keep up with this type of genre, and it's always a great feeling, seeing them.

Remember those?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lethem Style at Work","review":"With a Jonathan Lethem novel, you're never quite sure what genre you will be reading. Motherless Brooklyn is, on the surface at least, a mystery, with a PI as main character. The Fortress of Solitude is an epic that spans thirty years and encompasses all that described the 70's, 80's and 90's--drugs, war, racial relations.Lethem's latest, Men and Cartoons, is a mixed bag of nine short stories. From fantasy (\\"Super Goat Man\\" and \\"The Spray\\") to futuristic (\\"Access Fantasy\\") and surrealistic (\\"The Dystopianist, Thinking of His Rival, Is Interrupted by a Knock on the Door\\"), what you will find in this collection is Lethem's incredible style of writing, his imaginative and creative way of turning a phrase, and his realistic dialogue. Characters are vivid and memorable, and subject matter is often dark and disturbing, many times encompassing social satire and the human condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kafka as Super-Nerd","review":"I was disenchanted with this (Lethem has a wistful Plathian (or lover-of-Plath-lovers) side which he suppresses in favour of the brassy Brooklynite - see my review posted erroneously over on amazon.co.uk) but then I got to The Dystopianist. My kinda guy - any story with a non-human species as our accuser is good enough for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny/weird *and* funny/ha-ha","review":"In the nine stories collected in MEN AND CARTOONS by Jonathan Lethem, one line that comes back to me with a smile is a man describing his old high school buddy: \\"He'd become some combination of an artist with the temperament, but no art, and Thor Heyerdahl without a raft.\\" Lethem's creative effects are powerful, but he wears them lightly. There is no sense of showing off. And he has a great ear and comic sense. Most importantly, the stories will catch you at the end; they don't just fizzle out into smug nilhilism. I have deducted one star only because of the incongruously thudding coda."},{"rating":"2","title":"A crisis of what was then and what is now. Great story.","review":"I picked up this book on a cold, rainy evening in Brooklyn, NY. I remember reading Jim Defilippi's \\"Blood Sugar\\" many years ago and thought I'd see what \\"Duck Alley\\" had in store for me. This book was read during my AM and PM commutes on the NYC subway; a perfect place for the characters of Jay Tasti and Albert Niklozak to work their story into my daily grind. I liked how the flashbacks (which take place in Duck Alley, Long Island, in the 1950's) juxtaposed youthful ideals and boyhood shenanigans with a current adult crises. These flashbacks allowed me to develop separate ideas about the young Tasti and Albert vs. the adult ones and it made the current day story more complicated. At the heart of most stories, is a crisis. The crisis in \\"Duck Alley\\" is awkward, muddy, and ultimately, surprising. I always love a good surprise.

Apparently ignorant of large swaths of Haiti's history, Rossier is reduced to manipulating archival news footage and mis-translating interviews to attempt to prove his poorly thought-out thesis. Rossier, a Haiti novice who spent little time in the country while making his film, is apparently unaware or uninterested in letting facts complicate what he no doubt finds such a compelling narrative. Better, perhaps, for viewers to have a look at Asger Leth'sGhosts of Cite Soleilto have a more realistic depiction of life in Haiti during recent years, or to search out a real documentary talent like Alex Gibney'sTaxi To the Dark Sidefor the kind of compelling political filmmaking that is so obviously beyond Nicolas Rossier's rather amateurish grasp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste","review":"I have gotten this book every year for a while now, but this years edition was terrible because it did NOT have the recruiting profiles of the Top 44 as they have and years past and that they CLAIM they do now."},{"rating":"2","title":"a long time between reviews","review":"its been a while since this album was reviewed. i came across it while looking for the track 'hot rod lincoln' and discovering that les claypool did a cover. this is a cool album! there's only one or two songs i don't particularly like. i'm from australia so the whole nascar scene is a little alien to me but who doesn't like fast cars and heavy metal! coupled with the fact that i've only just recently seen 'talladega nights' it adds up to a fun experience! highlights for me are type o negatives 'highway star' and les claypools 'hot rod lincoln', naturally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great early worldbeat","review":"This is one of the earliest worldbeat albums recorded, originally released in 1983, and features the powerful vocals of Zairean Bony Bikaye and keyboard electronics by French-Algerian composer Hector Zazou.

Guesting on this album is American guitarist Fred Frith on one track and other, less well known musicians who play guitar, clarinet, sax, and percussion.This is a companion piece to another, also (now) sadly unavailable CD, Guilty.

Therefore, I find it extremely annoying that the directions tell you how many of what size shapes to cut for her quilt, but don't say what the finished block sizes are. Of course, I can figure that out, but why make me do all that math istead of including such basic information?

They provide step by step (3-step system)lessons, so you won't feel lost even if you don't have any previous music knowledge at all!

I took it to my daughters piano teacher to see what she thought- she said it was ok for maybe 6-9 months but the sound was just to off to be a long or even medium term keyboard. Compared the sound of this to my neighbors Yamaha YPT-320 and there was NO comparison sound wise. Returned this and bought the Yamaha.

I used it for the first time today, and while I liked the size and seal of the cup, and the fact that the cup locks onto the base, I am not at all confident that this will last...I was afraid it wouldn't last through the blending of the first shake!

Unfortunately, you wont know which its going to do until you turn it on.I would gladly go out and buy the $80 kind now rather than this piece of junk.

Lincoln's in-depth analysis of both the Civil War, the events that led to it, the figures and personalities involved, and the events it directly led to is both praise worthy and impressive on all literary levels. The only criticism I have of the both is that at times, mostly when dealing with complex economic issues, Lincoln seems to, but doesn't in any way, he only gives the illusion to, contradict himself. But I would certainly overlook this if considering to read this book, and if parts seem unclear, reread the passage to fully grasp the content. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in foraying into the Russian Civil War!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and accessible","review":"Lincoln provides a strong narrative, exhaustively researched and well constructed. Very easy to follow, this book investigates the aftermath of the October revolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hard read about a hard subject","review":"The Russian Civil War has not attracted the kind of attention from serious historians that it deserves. W Bruce Lincoln gives a solid account that reveals just how near-run a thing it was for Lenin and the early Bolsheviks. The book is too long, but contains fascinating (if sometimes confusing) insights into the motley crew that made up the various White Armies opposing the revolutionaries who could have, and perhaps should have, won out. How different the world would have been then! Also interesting is the account of Allied efforts to overthrow the new regime - the war-weary democracies played a dangerous game and their efforts were half-hearted, mis-timed and unpopular. Churchill was particularly vociferous in his condemnation of the Bolsheviks, a stance that was to cause him great difficulties with Stalin later. Another bloody chapter in the bitter history of the long-suffering Russians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very informative","review":"I bought this book expecting alot of insightful information, but most of the contents are very generic.

I was pleasantly surprised by this band--both its live show (opening for Muse) and their CD. At their best, their live show carries echoes of The Velvet Underground and Led Zeppelin, especially Johnny Borrell's onstage presence, which harks back to Robert Plant's frenetic clapping and body narration.Quite a good show, and several good tracks on the CD, especially \\"Golden Touch\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Lies\\".They were also the first Indie band that I have ever seen improvise during their stage show--and oftentimes the improv was as good or better than the song in which it was played."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and getting better","review":"A cocksure lead singer, not afraid to let you know how great he and his band are. Makes you cynical until you hear the tunes and boy do they deliver. Although they certainly took their cues from the Strokes arrival in Britain in 2001, the band has a wide eyed look at the chaos of the London scene that charms all on its own. Great songs aplenty, what the Libertines might sound like if Pete got straight and didnt go out of his way to derail his own songs. New UK single Somewhere Else is an anthemic rocker that promises greatness is at hand for Razorlight."},{"rating":"2","title":"razorlight","review":"i got one of these songs (golden touch) on a mix cd and bought the whole album immediately. they sound like ted leo lost his political consciousness, went girl crazy, then hooked up with the libertines. if that helps. this band is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Dylan....","review":"Dylan may not be the prophet of the 1960s, but maybe Razorlight is truly a shining light of 2004. Sort of a vague rehash of early 1960s pop music and early Punk, Razorlight doesn't really impress on the first listen and when first seeing them. Some of their best stuff seems to take off where The Clash left off. \\"Don't Go Back To Dalston\\" and \\"Golden Touch are wonderful songs. Razorlight has a penchant from going to slow and quiet to a really big sound. There is intensity in right amounts on this record and their live show. Worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"barely adequate compared to their live performance","review":"I caught this band when they played with Gratitude and Jimmy Eat World in Chicago in Nov, 2004 and they were amazing -- full of punk attitude and rock swagger with abundant talent and energy to back 'em up. Whatever shortcomings they have in solidness of some of their composition are easily forgiven during their live performanaces.The album, however, is a different story. For the most part, the vocal sounds somewhat muted and underpowered, with the instruments often overpowering the voice, and the band seemed to have chosen the safe path of polishing up and smoothing out the jagged edges on the recording -- this strategy seems to undermine their style in a lot of songs.Nonetheless, the band is exceptionally good and despite the shortcomings of a studio album, there are plenty of good songs to make this a solid purchase. I've been playing \\"Rip It Up\\" and \\"Golden Touch\\" over and over again for days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw Power","review":"This group shares a lot with The Libertines : a tendency for badly produced songs and bragging about how great they are; as to Razorlight, I must confess, this holds true enough. This is rock at its rawest, and even so, they find the genius to pen a song as beautiful as \\"Golden Touch\\". The punch of \\"Rip it up\\" is also amazing, makes you wanna jump like crazy. \\"Stumble and Fall\\" is another favourite of mine, but the whole CD is worth it. It was a real good surprise this turned out to be far better than the highly-praised Libertines second outing. Maybe the critics are looking at the wrong direction"},{"rating":"1","title":"Saw these guys live -","review":"and they just suck. They opened for Muse, who made them look like complete amateurs. Their material is boring and sounds consistently bland - no identity whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I first saw Razorlight on the Live 8 DVD and really liked the two songs they performed. In addition, the band had a pretty cool stage presence. Consequently, I rushed out and bought this CD fully expecting to be mind blown. Unfortunately, I was nearly put to sleep. Folks, in the big picture of the musical universe, there's minimal talent on this CD - anyway you look at it. To make matters worse, Johnny Borrell claims to be as good a songwriter as Bob Dylan. Anyone in the music business dumb enough to make a statement like that has lost all credibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"British CD surprise","review":"The first time I heard \\"Golden Touch,\\" I was shocked that neither I or any of my Brit pop-loving friends knew of them. Razorlight is just too good not to be widely known. Lead singer Johnny Borrell has a phenomenal voice, when combined with a sound derived from a traditional UK rock upbringing, expels glorious music that any rock aficionado should appreciate. The CD is one of my favorites and what I consider my luckiest musical find in a very long time. If you like good, straight-up British rock without the hype associated with contrived bubble-gum bands, this is a must-hear album. But let's just keep it our little secret."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice find","review":"The thing I love most about these two albums is that they are what the are. No hidden meanings. No special message about thinking for myself. Nothing but pure 80s rock. No filler, all killer. This is a take it or leave it kind of band. Dirty rock with lyrics about sex, drugs, rebellion, and more sex. Everyone has at least one guilty pleasure and W.A.S.P. is mine.This collection is an excellant buy. The first two albums in there original form togther at one low price. The only thing I did not like is the absence of the song \\"Animal\\". It appears as the first track on the Peaceville remaster of the first album; however, not on this. As far as the other bonus tracks I could care less.

It's also about having fun, and about great beaches, and other great places.It's about the journey of one man, but I recognized my own mistakes in life, through Napoleon's, and I also learned that my mistakes, were very natural, and educational, and they shaped who I am better than my successes.Not too many books make you think this much about yourself.Give it a try, you'll enjoy the journey.Overall, I envy the ability and sheer deterination of this man to do what he needed to do, and survive the trials and tribulations of life after divorce.

Simon Schama's comprehensive study of this nation and period explores and details anything that could possibly be asked about the seventeenth-century Netherlands. This is a tough book to break into, to continue forward into once the task of reading it has begun, and its density will put many people off. It lacks the approachability of say a David McCullough or Stephen Ambrose book, but if someone wants serious information about its subject matter, there is no other more complete source that I know of than The Embarrassment of Riches. To read this book is to come away with an intimate knowledge of the Dutch Golden Age, and that's a high compliment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tulipmania, Beached Whales, and Family Life","review":"I've lived in the Netherlands for four years, and found this book to be both delightful and illuminating. Particularly for expats living here in the Netherlands, it sets a good base for understanding Dutch life-- but I think it's the sort of book that anyone who loves history would enjoy.Embarassment of Riches focuses on almost every element of Dutch life-- political sphere, standard of living, role of women, treatment of children, moral taboos, legal standards, attitudes towards money and so much more.

Before I began reading the Diary, I read Claire Tomalin's \\"Samuel Pepys, The Unequalled Self\\" which is excellent! She quoted extensively from the Diary as well as providing the historical and personal background that is crucial to understanding what and whom Pepys was writing about. There are entries that she quotes extensively, for example Monck's move against the Rump Parliment on February 11, 1660, which contains more information than the \\"selected passage\\" in the Diary. Aside from a very few meaningful passages, this edition is filled with short snippets of trivial activities of the day.

But Bittlestone's book, instead of a grueling epic, is a quiet, beautiful story of information-age discovery. It shows how incredibly far an intelligent amateur can go when backed up by the power of our technology. Bittlestone attacks the mystery with the might of GPS location finding, LandSat photos, internet advice from true experts...and a little true Sherlock Holmesian deduction. (He even quotes from Holmes a few times!) The photos are beautiful, the logic is elegant, the science is very educational, and the conclusion is convincing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting historical detective work","review":"Any admirer of Homer's Odysseus will love this work.

If you pumped it enough the gun fired and was really cool, but the 5 minutes of pumping up the gun wasn't work the 5 seconds of firing you got out of the gun. Once you fired the gun once all of the air was out of the gun so if you didn't pump it enough to get all of the darts to shoot out then you had to start all over.

I pulled the trigger for a second, three darts fired, two misfired. I pulled the trigger again, out of air! I pumped it back up about 20 times... pulled the trigger... guess what? I couldn't fire the remaining darts! This is the design flaw in the gun... Since the clip drops back into the gun, the gun cycles back through the already fired darts and air is lost through each of those empty slots.

The item description was a little misleading when they mentioned the queen 'on hand'. This is a very well made and beautifully dressed toy...but it is an awkward finger puppet. It has a small opening on the back of each arm to insert fingers...and one tiny hole in back of head for a fingertip. The rest of your hand is exposed behind the doll. If I were looking a queen doll this would have been perfect. But I was expecting more of a puppet. I will return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"My mom ordered this for me, because I liked medieval stuff.

Ms. Dickerson tried to make Jennifer have problems with not having family roots therefore she was so sad and frightened that Micheal wouldn't want her. I think Micheal's character should have been a little more forceful. He seemed weak and unsure of himself. The situation with Tawana was kind of stupid. What man would believe that he impregnated a woman that's a known liar. This book just didn't strike any chords. She wrote alot about nothing.

If is cheap and not able to withstand normal daily bumps and wear. My first one lasted about 3 weeks before breaking. Both break where the clip attaches to the holster. The plastic is very light and not durable.On the positive I like the phone case and the feel and fit of it. I now use on my Note 2 and Galaxy SII. However, I have splurged and purchased the Seidio belt clip. It 3x cost but holds up to daily use much better. Fortunately the case works with the Seidio holster. The Seidio does not offer the texture and easier to drop.So, if you want a nice phone case and not concerned about belt clip then buy it. Or mix and match as I choose to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice but broke it in 3 days","review":"I'm not the most gentle person on equipment. This is a nice try but the clasp holding on the belt clip came off in my hand the first day. I was able to snap it back into place fairly quickly. Three days later I seat down in my car the holster hit the seat belt and the holster belt clip plastic broke. Game over.Believe even gentle people will have a problem with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it broke :(","review":"I chose this rating because I really liked the look and feel of the case. It didn't make the phone feel any bigger and it gave the phone just enough weight and grip for one hand operation. It was nice to have a holster that doubled as a kickstand which rotated for landscape or portrait viewing. What sucks about this phone is the holster setting is flimsy and broke from me trying to set it up to watch something on YT. I have only had this item for a week! I also ordered one for my husband and on the first day his holster popped off. It has since popped off numerous times and although its easy to pop back on its very annoying to him. He wears his on his belt which means everything is falling on the ground. I usually kept mine in my purse or pocket and thought mine would surely out live his. NOPE!

I can just barely squeeze it about a little ways up my forearm. And if your slick with sweat these things are going to fly right off.On a good note; they are very comfortable as long as your arm isn't turning purple. They feel much better than wrist weights. They aren't ichy or hot. It is actually very easy to forget they are their. That being said, get two for each arm, their pretty light. But they are just about perfect if you already have hand weights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mystery","review":"I enjoyed the author's \\"Black Maps\\" a lot, and found his newest book just as good. John March is a sympathetic hero, whose alienation from his family and occasional penchant for violence hint at a difficult past. The plot of this novel is a good one; it moved along well, though sometimes I wished the author would not so thoroughly describe every room that March enters. I also felt that girlfriend Jane's ambivalence about March's profession was not as well presented as it might have been. First she's with him, then she isn't, then she returns at the end more as a plot device to get March out of trouble than anything else, and then she is gone again. I'd like to understand her better, and see the two of them in a real discussion about his work. However, I cared about her and about March: that is tribute to the author's skill.Finally, I hope the author will at some point go more into March's past, and show us how he became the man he is. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"barely passable","review":"It was not a complete loss, but it is slow moving, boring and some parts are annoyingly unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Spiegelman Sparkler","review":"While some reviewers here lament what they think was a slow and aimless plot, I found this book to be well-done, fascinating and riveting. It's refreshing to occasionally read a thriller that is not slam-bang, unrealistic violence and action on every page. This is a well-thought-out, well crafted piece of work that moves strongly forward. The characters are well-defined, the place descriptions (mostly New York)are vivid and real and human interplay between the good guy and possible bad guys is compelling. All of which leads me to my opinion that Spiegelman is truly a master of the genre. In other words, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and look forward to reading many more Spiegelman sparklers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Spiegelman's first book \\"Black Maps,\\" was one I very much enjoyed. I wish I could say the same for this. It wasn't bad, but it seemed to plod along, without much happening, never being terribly involving or suspenseful. For me, part of the problem was that I never really cared about any of the characters except Jane, Marsh's girlfriend, who was the most interesting one of the group and received a bad deal in her relationship with Marsh. Maybe I'm tired of perpetually angst-driven, commitment-phobic protagonists. So while it wasn't terrible, it was definitely a disappointment. Read \\"Black Maps\\" and, if you do read this, wait for it in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow boat to nowhere","review":"This book appears to be a description of how independently wealthy people live in New York, and, oh, there's a \\"mystery\\" or something going on.

For the real tabs, search online for Lisa Loeb guitar tabs, where you can often find people's renditions that are much closer to what Lisa's playing.

The loudness is the same at 15' in front as 5'. The loudness at 90 degrees to the side seems almost the same too. I have recommended these speakers to several friends since I have installed mine.

Basically, it is about a $10/speaker premium that I think is worth it.These Yamaha's don't disappoint.Pro's:- Speaker teather that connects the speaker to the mount while you deal with wiring and final mount. Wiring is easier and you can't drop your brand new speakers when installing.- Build quality robust plastic and brass mounts. Appears will do well outdoors. Mine are under eaves so I expect long life.- Sound quality is good, mind you these are outdoors so my expectations were low, but the sound is good thus far- Bookshelf or wall mounts capable.- Good value for the money.Con's:- wall mount allows for adjustment up/down or left/right depending on which way you mount the bracket.

They simply don't produce enough volume or bass that is adequate for outdoor listening. These speakers were to go outside along the wall by our pool but as soon as we turned them up loud enough to hear them as background music they got extremely fuzzy and just sounded terrible. if the volume is turned down they are ok. but nothing more. just ok. i was optimistic after reading other reviews but these AW150s just didn't' live up to the hype.

Unfortunately, I'm not hearing what they're hearing. I listen to mainly hip hop, electronic, and soul. The bass is entirely inadequate for hip hop; it sounds roughly like a boombox's speakers turned way up. The sound is also very hollow, with vocals seeming to come from behind drywall. Also, I'm using these indoors in a small room, so I can't blame it on the sound being washed out by outdoors noise and wind. Simply speaking, they just lack that crispness, tightness, and depth that I expect from decent speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not of good quality","review":"I did not expect that these would turn out to be so very bad.

Also, I found an old Aiwa speaker system (only 40 watt) but connected these and it sounds good (decent base/treble) sounds like any other radio if it were outside.WARNING: I did do a little homework and you have to know what ohm your speakers are.

For the money they are the best I've heard.

Considering we have Polk indoor speakers in our sunroom and AR303As in our home theater setup in our family room, we knew the great quality we would expect to receive from the competitors. Wow! The quality of the construction and the quality of the full-range sound in these OUTDOOR speakers are absolutely amazing!If you have a few extra dollars to spend, may I suggest the Yamaha 350w.

At his best, he can really deliver a hard blow to the mind.He is not at his best here.There are some lovely snips--Cry! Cry! What shall I cry?--but they are buried in a story that manages to be both pretentious and pedestrian. The novelist, who may-or-may-not be Golding-esque (I don't know the man and am not reading to guess whether or not this is autobiographical), is a stereotype of a drunken writer dithering around Europe and having a nervous breakdown. There's nothing either sympathetic or interesting about him. His surrounding circle is equally vacuous, and the plot, regarding a biographer chasing him around to get a story is... well, dreary. It's not a complex story and I understand the things Golding means to say, but all in all, he does not say them very well.A pity--the words really are quite nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear & Concise Overview of Complex Process","review":"I recently received a copy of Successful Practice Sales and was very impressed with the clarity the book brings to a very complex process.

When it came time to use them (during a power outage), one would not even turn on (in spite of the light that had remained on for that entire time showing that it was getting juice). Because we had heard such great things about these lanterns and have trusted the Coleman brand in the past, of course we had tossed all the packaging (making a return impossible - ugh!).The other one -- ho hum. The light that was emitted was nice and bright but the lantern itself feels very cheap and plasticy.We will spend more the next time around -- for something so important (be it for a camping trip or power outages: It's important to have light to see), we were silly to scrimp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I purchased this lantern in 2007.

That light doesn't come on at all and the lamp doesn't work.Now would I buy another one? I don't think so.

When it came I really liked it, but it did look cheaply made and a little rough to use. When I actually got the real Salux, I realized just how much of a difference there was between the two. The Leyjie is thinner, lighter with cheaply sewn seams. It also more abrasive and produces less lather than the original. If you aren't sure which one you have look on the pack to see where it's made. Salux is made in Japan, Leyjie is made in China and the Salux washcloth has the logo sewn into the seam as well. The bottom line is that the Leyjie is too expensive for what you're given."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH.

I can't stand the hotel bath towels that are never long enough to scrub my upper back. Besides that, the towels are too soft to provide any scrubbing power.So, I carry one of these nylon bath towels in a Ziplock bag and keep it in my shaving kit. The towel dries out in about an hour (time for breakfast), then I put it back in the Ziplock bag and I'm ready to go.The towels come in several colors -- blue, pink, yellow -- should that matter to you.

As I understand it (and I may be wrong) Salux is a specific brand so to say something is Salux when in fact it does not say Salux on the package would be false advertising.

I wanted something lightweight and compact since I only take a backpack for a five-day business trip. I cut six inches off this washcloth and used a lighter to sear the edges so that it would not later unravel. What I wound up with was the perfect facial cloth for home or a tolerable washcloth on the road which weighs 6 grams (0.25 oz) and rolls up to about the same size as a lighter. The remainder lives in my shower and still performs its intended duty perfectly.

I have tried the conventional loofahs and they soon fall apart and become a mess. This wash cloth is rough at first for those not used to it but it makes your skin feel much smoother and cleaner. It's easy to ball up and grip with your hand and then open it up to clean your entire back area, which can be hard to do with a loofah. I'm lucky since I can purchase these at nearby, Korean-owned stores for about $2.00-$2.50. Great product!

Don't tell the author of this book, but Mardi Gras is actually FUN! Reid Mitchell makes it sound like one long dreary class war. And he gets his facts wrong. The chapter about gay Carnival, around p. 144 or so, is full of errors that anybody could have fact-checked for him, and total misunderstandings of the New Orleans community.

Don't feel bad if you can't do any of the above, the book covers that situation. From there, in a user-friendly, color-coded format, the book helps you design a program that fits your needs.I bought the book thinking it would help me design a weight-training program for myself. It isn't that advanced. All of the resistance training it contains can be performed sith just your body weight and some common household items (such as water bottles).For a complete novice, this is where to begin. If, like me, you're a little more advanced, but want help in setting up a weight-lifting program, then I recommend Weight Training Steps to Success by Baechle and Groves."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous book!","review":"This book helped me with some difficulties I've had about prayer and God --in general.

Instead the greatest role of the opera from vocal point of view, Giovanna Seymour, here offers the unique possibility to listen to the performance of a too much underrated mezzo like Maria Luisa Nave who deliverd always her best in this role starting from the production of 70's with Olivero and Domingo.

It is however, wobbly after assembly. The hardware can easily be stripped during assembly as it is trial and error getting the seat and foot rest positioned exactly right to accommodate your child. It is suppose to be fully adjustable and grow with your child but how can you do this if the hardware strips out after initial set up. How about real screws and no allen wrenches. The leg partition strap is not really useful and my son can easily climb in and out. It needs a better restraining system. The seat and back cushions are also useless as they just get filthy and slide around. They can be washed but I just elected to not use them after the first day of use. I would recommend trying a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our family loves it","review":"This is the third high chair we've tried and so far it's the best one. It's very easy to clean, looks great, and easy to have our daughter sit at the table with us. The only problem was that the screws were stripped by the time we were done assembling it which will make it very hard to adjust it. We'll have to buy new screws before we attempt to adjust it for her as she grows. Other than that, it's very stable, sturdy and easy to use.

He is now eight months and I am shopping for a better highchair. I didn't have any trouble putting it together and in the beginning it seemed fine. Now that my son is getting bigger and more mobile this chair is a safety hazard. He can turn completely around and possibly slip out the back. He has very chubby thighs, so I had to lower the seat to get him in and out easily but now he could slip backwards out of the chair. I can't take my eyes off him for a second while using this chair. Sometimes I stand him next to the chair and put the Cheerios on the seat for him to eat because that is safer than sitting him in the chair!The chair itself is falling apart after 2 months use. It's too low for our table and our baby sits with his nose at the edge of the table during meals.

There is page after page of nude couples in sexual position; every body part exposed entirely. Personally, I'd prefer illustrations for such a thing to be drawn out, or use a computer generated model w/ a lot less detail or such.It seemed to be a lot about trying new positions too...Holding onto your spouse's pressure point for a period too.... seemed awfully.... clinical.I think I prefer just to find those points naturally over the years; which we have been doing.... and leave the clinical side & the pornographic side out of our marriage.-Just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Band, Great Music","review":"You can compare these guys to a lot of truly great contempory rock acts...REM, Interpol, The New Pornographers, Wilco. I think they speak for themselves. And nowhere better than on this one.

They're a phenomenal live act, and I'm thrilled they're putting their best feet forward on Slow Politics.

I was raised a non-Calvinist Southern Baptist, and suddenly my pastor was preaching about Calvinism. I did quite a bit of research before I found Journey, so I already had a basic understanding. In the beginning the narrator had so many of the same questions I did, I was sure I would find information that would help me accept the doctrine. But the deeper he delved into the doctrine, the more I was reminded of the phrase, \\"It depends on what is, is.\\"I would recommend this book to anyone who is just beginning the study of Calvinism. It didn't persuade me to become one, but at least I have a better understanding of where they're coming from."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Big Bang of Astronomical Data","review":"Proper and overdue credit is paid in this book to Henrietta Leavitt, but the story the author tells is more the story of two generations of astronomers from Edward Pickering to Edwin Hubble and beyond, who proved chiefly by observation that the universe was not merely our Milky Way but an immensity of such proportion that even the idea of an omnipresent deity seems ludicrously tiny. The stress in the title should fall on the word Stars. Author Johnson is careful not to dishonor Miss Leavitt by exaggerating her central importance or by overdrawing her martyrdom as a \\"glass-ceilinged\\" woman in a male-chauvinistic era. Leavitt's life was fascinating indeed, though little documented, but Johnson's tale is not a hagiography. It's a tight, lucid history-of-science in 130 pages, a perfect book to read on a transcontinental flight or while waiting for George W to acknowledge a mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"An honored place on every woman's (and man's) bookshelf...","review":"No study of history - no study of scientific discovery - is complete without recognizing how women helped shaped our knowledge of the world, the heavens and society. As more and more women, such as \\"Miss Leavitt,\\" are recognized for their dediction to scientific discovery and other endeavors - just imagine what wonderful insights we have yet to learn! Too many of these stories remain untold.

The book gives examples of applications where better methods would have tangible uses. Like being able to identify objects in a video stream. Or recognising human faces.

FULLSCREEN,NO PRODUCTION OR AIR ORDER and the 3 worst episodes from SEASON 1!!! for God's sake...whats wrong with this people!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that bad, but should have been better","review":"Of course I preferred the complete season if it was available. It is not bad for a season start, but the publisher should have selected better episodes for this package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even tempted","review":"I prefer to see season 1, season 2 etc. If I buy this than why would I want to be a season and have duplicate episodes. I also think it would be a good idea to have a down loadable file sample of movies or TV shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Want Seasoned Sets!!","review":"I just can't believe that Warner Bros. still are putting out 3 episodes at a time. This is an incredible series but it's not getting the type of DVD justice it deserves. Sadly, the Justice League gets no justice!! We fans demand seasoned sets to be released."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS DVD!","review":"It's an understatement that many of us feel ripped off by WB's attempt to unfairly empty our wallets. If we refuse to buy these horribly priced episode dvds and at the same time purchase the available full season box sets that are of value then we can make some headway. They are in the business of making $$$. Slowing their cash flow will force them to give us consumers' products we demand or risk losing our disposable income. Die-hard fans of this series and other series must convince every parent to withhold from purchasing these dvds until full seasons are made available. C'mon WB, we love these shows and will pay for them. We only ask that you don't rape our wallets. Give us the full season box sets much sooner."},{"rating":"1","title":"WB Get it together! Don't buy this disk!","review":"Honestly, I have no idea what WB is thinking! Putting a measly three episodes on one DVD is just a greedy and obnoxious way to irritate fans of the series. ATTENTION WB executives either put out the entire series season by season onto DVD or just stop all together. This is just crummy, cheap, and annoying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's really a shame ...","review":"This is one of the worse cases of price-gouging I've seen in quite a while.Personally, I LOVE the JLU tv show and I wouldn't think twice to pick up a box set (if they'd just release one). However, to make fans of the show buy it (basically) episode-by-episode, is really ridiculous.I'm sure there'll be a box set at some point, you'd do better to save your money until then. If you need a fix in the meantime, these discs would make better rentals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give us fans Boxed Sets!","review":"WB is doing a very, very poor job with the DVD release of this GREAT, GREAT, GREAT show! They don't realize that the fan base for justice league isn't kids! WE WANT COMPLETE SEASON BOXED SETS! Do not waste your money on this and save it until WB caves in and releases complete seasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Very Good Disc...","review":"Not even a 'good' disc. I am appaled that WB is still releasing this three episode BS.If they think that they will make more money by releasing 3 shows at a time, I have news for them. I REFUSE TO BUY ANOTHER JLU DISC UNTIL THE ENTIRE SEASON IS AVAILABLE! CAN I GET AN AMEN!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WB Rip Off","review":"WB - Either Step up with the option to buy the entire season at a time (Widescreen please) or don't bother. This is a good show and deserves to be put out with the entire season as well as extras. You are trying to develope a franchise with Batman Begins and the new Superman movie stop with the shortcuts already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warner Bros. just doesn't get it.","review":"It's amazing how WB execs simply refuse to cash in on the season set phenomenon. This disc is pure garbage in terms of content and an insult to fans who are willing to spend money on their product but simply aren't given anything worth buying. Only 3 episodes? I am boycotting WB until they give the public season sets or at least a better value for our hard earned disposable income."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an excellent direction for the series","review":"All of the Justice League series is among the best of all action animated series. JLU opens the doors to the entire DC universe and the production quality is second to none. Smart, well written, brilliantly animated and the best voice actors in the business."},{"rating":"1","title":"A time to complain","review":"After finding out the release style the WB has for the JLU series I felt I had to complain in as many places as possible. It was very nice to see the Starcrossed series released in wide screen format all together...but to remarket this series in a way that loses the majority of its fanbase?...stop that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The WB (2) TWO THUMBS DOWN!","review":"The point is the WB wants money from fans - delivering poorly - They are affraid of giving the fans seasons - because they don't have enough money coming in from the cartoon network.They are the worst when it comes to giving the fans what they want - without the fans the WB would be nothing - yet they must take advantage using marketing tactics.

These pillowcases are 100% polyester and although they appear nice, smooth, and shiny, I feel instant static in my hair when I lay down and I wake up looking just as disheveled as I do when I use my flannel pillowcases.

It felt like polyester instead of satin."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertizing?","review":"You look at the picture and see two sheets and two pillowcases.When you read the fine print its just two pillowcases. I was rather put out when I received only two pillowcases for so much money. I thought it was a good bargain when I bought it only to discover it was not what the picture demonstrated.

Too rich for my blood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Well, even though DLink offers the 650W/K (650W w/CF-to-PCMCIA) on their website you cannot get drivers for anything other than PocketPC. I wanted to get this item and a CF-to-PCMCIA converter and use it in my laptop and my handheld, but DLink does not offer the drivers. Also, from the research I've done it looks like this card doesn't work with a lot of other wireless access points because they are using an old driver with antiquated security. DLink is nothing more than a reseller of hardware so there is an obvious lag in their driver support. I will probably be returning my 650W CF Wireless card and DI-713P Router/Switch/AP since their tech support has been less than abysmal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Larger than necesary, poor range.","review":"I'm returning this unit. It's too large to truly be flexible with a Pocket PC, the range is very limited, and it requires a Compact Flash II slot while others only require a CF I. I'm going to purchase the Socket Low Power CF card instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is for entertainment purposes only","review":"To be honest this book isnt much of anything. Good thing it was cheap. This book can give you some good lines to say but all it does is give insight into a ghetto society. If you grew up in certain neighborhoods this book will not tell you anything you dont already know. there is no science into mackin women and you cant put it into words and write a book. The only thing this book is, is a hustle. This is how the author's mack, his way of makin money off people who want more women or to be a pimp or whatever of the sort. Im not mad at him.

Simply put, if you must read a book about \\"how to mack\\" then forget it...you'll never achieve that so-called status. It's a dubious achievement at best. How about books to teach young men how to get extra money for college or how to own their own businesses?

What type of women there are....what type of MEN there are...and what type of MEN get what type of WOMEN...WHY...HOW...WHERE...WHEN...blah blah blah. Clear examples, concise tips, scenarios, everything a gameless dude needs to better his game. It works, I read it, and my game and awareness (peeping game) has developed substantially.

Trust me, I'm a black man, I know. If your looking to pull some hood chicks this book might give you a little insight, but if you want your game to be universaly recognized this book will teach you nothing. The only way truly build your game is to get out on the scene and gain experience. Contrary to what the author wants you to believe, not all men can be \\"night club macks\\". You are either born with a certain charisma or your not. You have to get in were you fit in in this world and once you find out who you are you can then zero in on the type of women whom your personality suits, and at that point you can begin to hone your skills.

It is just the little things that you do and don't the separate the macks from the everyday square brothers. After I read the book I started contemplating on past relationships and saw where things started going wrong. Then I went back to see about when I met a women for the first time and the things that I said that put me into the categories that were listed in the book (Square/Professional). The author does men a huge favor by breaking things down on how to protect yourself from some of the female predators that exist in our society. Well all I have to say is Tariq keep up the good work, because I defintely appreciate it and everything you have written is true."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Mack's game is tight!","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Learn about the importance of having confidence in yourself to achieving true Mack-dom and that to play the game, it's best to comport yourself with honesty.In short, the author provides straight-forward, easy to follow advice on how to transform yourself from a \\"trick\\" to a \\"Mack\\" and have more success \\"steppin' to the ladies.\\"Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tested and Passed","review":"Excellent book.

Mine worked for the first few months and now it takes hours to vacuum four rooms. Luckily I have hardwood floors or it would take days. The vacuum stops working after about 10 minutes and needs to &amp;quot;rest&amp;quot; for nearly 30 minutes before it will turn on again. I've cleaned all the filters many times, but no change in behavior. I spent alot of money on this vacuum hoping it would last a long time. I'll never buy a Hoover again."},{"rating":"1","title":"recommend you keep shopping","review":"Bought it - worked fine for about oh say 2 months. Then the long cartridge filter (the one that looks like an automobile air cleaner filter) needed replacement because despite thoroughly washing it after each use it begins to smell like a football locker room after awhile. Think you can find that filter anywhere closeby - not! Scoured the country. Everyone sells the vacuum but no one sells this filter. Finally had to special order it via a Hoover Distributer in the closest metro area.There's more - - About two days after purchasing it I found the same machine about... cheaper that where I bought it and it also included a... special attachment that the one I bought didn't have. Now the latest is that it has quit working altogether. Oh the motor runs and the power head bar twirls but there is no vacuum - you know sucking that makes the whole thing run correctly. Like I said - keep looking and scratch Hoover from your list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover Windtunnels - Very Bad","review":"I'm very disappointed in it's performance. I've never seen a vacuum smoke so much! Whenever it gets close to an object that isn't attached to anything (blankets, rugs, etc.) it automatically destroys it and begins to smoke and stink! It has already destroyed 3 rugs at my home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor Burn Out","review":"I used this vacuum for 2 years and had the motor burn out before the first year was up. It was still under warranty so Hoover replaced it at no change. Thirteen months later that motor burned up. I pitched this machine in the garbage. While it was working it did a good job of cleaning and I liked the attachments."},{"rating":"1","title":"the absolute worst vacuum ever","review":"i purchased this vacuum about 3 months ago and since then, i have had it in for service 3 times, before i finally took it back. the brush mechanism strips often and then the brushes won't rotate. i had to have the brushes replaced 3 times!... too much of a hassle considering the only place i could have this done was at an authorized hoover dealer 20 miles from my house. on the positive side, the cleaning power was terrific. it is very heavy and very noisy. very difficult to clean stairs, as well. there is a \\"motorized brush\\" attachment for stairs, but it worked about half the time and the hose for the attachments isn't long enough for a full set of stairs. i have never had a hoover vacuum before and bought one on the recommendation of a friend (what was she thinking?) ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"strong vacuum","review":"i am impressed with the cleaning strength of this vacuum when used as an upright. however, was disappointed with the stair attachment beater brush. also, the cover for the attachments broke the first time i used it, and won't stay closed. overall, a strong competitor for upright use... but i am now looking for a hand vac for the stairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is always Broken!","review":"We have owned this vacuum for 8 months and it has broke 4 belts. We took it to the Hoover store--they were nice enough to replace the belt and brush--but once we took it home it promptly broke again.

If you want a vacuum you can count on, this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Craptacular P.O.S.","review":"This thing is a piece of ummm...garbage (POG), to keep this review in my style and G-rated. Mine was actually good for a few months and then we had to replace the filter, after which time it slowly started to clog EVERY time we used it. Now I find myself having to take it apart with a screwdriver to clear the inner hoses so that it won't keep spitting dust out when I'm trying to clean up because of the clogging business. I hate it. I want a Dyson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Impressed","review":"This machine is powerful, well made, and really gets the job done.

During my 2 week long business trip, my wife was sick with the cold/flu and was over it when I got back. 3 days after my trip, I vaccuumed the house and emptied the bagless canister for the first time outside. I also cleaned the filters. What a mistake that was! Dust was floating around, sticking quite easily all over the plastic canister through static electricity and even got into my lungs. I coughed, of course. But the cough didn't go away. I coughed when I had to painstakingly rinse out and dry the canister with water. I coughed through the night when I slept. I coughed in the morning with my stuffy nose and aching limbs. I coughed for the 2 weeks that I had the cold/flu. So, the Hoover bagless vaccuum has great sucking power and awesome HEPA filtration, but be wary in cleaning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great suction but......","review":"I have owned Hoover Wind Tunnels for awhile now though this is my first bagless one. The suction is dynamite and it is actually very easy to push but pulling it back is a little more difficult. The one very bad part is emptying the dirt cup. It is a messy job and the filter is always full of dirt requiring you to not just tap it to get it clean but to use a paper towel the clean between each and every fan fold. All in all it is a terrific vaccuum especially if you have pet hair and crumbs in the carpet."},{"rating":"1","title":"motor shot!!!!","review":"bought this item aug of 2001.moved in new condo labor day weekend and started using the machine. well....last weekend on saturday the vacuum started smoking and quit. even though IT WAS A YEAR TO THE DAY that it broke, i bought it a month before on sale and didnt use it until I moved in. $ 250.00 down the drain and hoover wont work with me.

Gotta keep ur customers happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Vacuum but use caution","review":"This vacuum is as good as can be expected for a new vacuum, although I have two burns in my carpet resulting from the use of the attachments. You may want to reconsider if your home is not one that will enable you to rest the vacuum on a non-carpeted area at all times while using the attachments. Per a technician, the only way to assure this does not happen is to NOT leave the vacuum running on carpeting while using the attachments. The company clearly states in the manual that leaving the vacuum running on the stairs while using attachments \\"may cause extensive wear and tear\\" but they do not tell you that it may burn a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good At First","review":"I have a 2&4 year old and Great Danes. I vacuume everyday. This vacuume does a Great job if you empty the canister and replace the hepa filter everyday. Other than that is SUCKS in a bad way. It smells like rubber everytime.

Oh yeah I have only had this Hoover for a year!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vroooom!","review":"Yup, this vacuum cleaner is noisy, but I don't really care about that. What I really care about is how well it works. I have two longhaired indoor only cats. Our canister vacuum did a \\"so-so\\" job of picking up their shedded fur. In fact, just like another reviewer on here, I had vacuumed with my canister vacuum the day before I got this new one. I could NOT believe the amount of cat fur and other things that ended up in the dirt cup! The powered hand tool is also wonderful. I got the extra long hose too, which is great for the stairs and other hard to reach places. The cats are terrified of this vacuum, but then again, they ran away from our two previous ones as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Windtunnel performance little more than hot air","review":"My wife and I happily purchased the Hoover U5750-900 Windtunnel Upright Vacuum Cleaner from Amazon in October of 2001. We paid $279, clearly a tad more (unhappily) than it's selling for right now. But its cleaning power was highly praised in a leading consumer magazine. We used that machine perhaps a half hour a week for less than two years before the motor simply burned out. Our carpet was cleaned quite well thank you--briefly-- but so was our wallet--all too quickly it now seems. We have since learned that motor burnout is not uncommon with this product. Sad to say, neither is buyer burnout. We wouldn't even consider another Hoover product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"We have only had this vacuum for about a year and a half. It worked well the first few months, but I soon learned that cleaning and emptying the filters was a pain. I could only vacuum my downstairs then clean the filters, wait over night for them to dry then clean the upstairs. Never had to do that with the old one. Now, it has quit sucking (which is not good when you are talking about vacuums!) I've unscrewed everything, cleaned out every possible hole, and it still is not working very well. We have a long haired cat who causes a lot of our carpet dirt, but it never happened with my [other] vacuum! It seems that the dirt has to travel up too many pipes to get to the bagless part. This vacuum is a pain in the rear! I cannot believe we spent [$$$] on this thing! Sorry, I'm venting because I just got done taking the darn thing a part trying to unclog it AGAIN and it overheated and won't even turn on now."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"The vaccum was great the first week or so. We have had it for a year now. The thing is louder than a train running through the house. It looses suction all the time. The filters are always clogging. Not to mention the cost adds up replacing them. Oh and the belts are ALWAYS breaking on it. We've gone through at least 2 belts a month since we bought it! Other vaccums we've had we NEVER had to replace the belts! It smells & it's dusty. It doesn't work on hardwood floors as it kicks all the dirt back at you! All the tools have broke. We've replaced the hose on it 2 times. It tears along the part where it attaches to the vaccum.The vaccum finally died today....out in the trash it will go on Monday. Don't waste your time or money on this vaccum!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the first day-bagless vacs are a step backwards.","review":"This was great for about the first week that I bought it. It cleaned up stuff I never knew existed in my carpet. Then as the paper hepa filter began to get clogged with dust and other things it quickly lost suction. Banging it out frequently only worked for a while, then I had to purchase a new filter at $30. For the two years I've had this, I had to replace 2 filters a year. That equals $60. More then the $50 they claim you save annually by not buying bags.It also doesn't do hardwood very well, sending the debris all over the place. It is also incredibly heavy, so for elderly people or folks who can't lift heavy objects, it's not good.On the plus side the selection of attachments is very good, and it comes with an extra hose for long reaches. But as the filter gets filled and the vacuum loses suction you'll see the tools and wands work less and less well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did I wait so long to buy this?","review":"If you are thinking about a new vacuum, stop your search, this is the one you want. Yes, it's expensive and even somewhat heavy but it is worth every penny. Like one of the other reviewers, I too vacuumed prior to putting this vacuum to use and THOUGHT I had the house pretty clean. The unit has a great see-through chamber where all the dirt and dust is collected. This is handy as you can tell when the chamber needs to be emptied. I had to empty it after the first use! I found myself vacuuming several days in a row mostly in amazement and had to empty it again several days later after finally getting to one last room.The attachments are easy to use and store away nicely although I would have liked to seen somewhere on the unit to store the extension hose, but where to put it? So, no points off there.Don't hesitate, but it now. You'll love it as much as anyone can love a vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I owned this vacuum for less than a year before I threw it out in the trash. We purchased a vacuum that was 1/3 the price and cleans our carpet 10 times better than the Windtunnel ever did. For me, the problem with the vacuum was the windtunnel seal -- it seems as if air was leaking out from the WindTunnel area, though our local Hoover service rep didn't think it was abnormal. Nonetheless, I've been much happier with my much cheaper vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clog Heaven!","review":"Horrible design where dirt glogs easily and you can't get inside to clean!

What a mistake. (Guess I was suckered in by the ads). Anyway, while assembling it (with the assistance of the painters who were painting the interior of our house before we moved in) - I was immediately struck at how cheap it looked. Everything was made of plastic and didn't quite fit right. (Even the painters commented on that.) Since then, I've been extremely disappointed by the fact that the hose keeps coming off. Also, the clip that holds the pipe in place has been broken off by a minor collision with a door. Hair is continually stuck in the brushes and needs to be cut with scissors and drawn out manually (yuck). Also, the suction is way less than desirable. All in all this is without question the WORST vacuum cleaner I've ever owned. (I'm 50 years old and have owned quite a few in my life!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Vacuum EVER!","review":"Suctions dirt on carpet only, kicks it around on hard floors, and sounds like a twin jet engine airplane. The sound is deafing and your hands hurt after a while from the vibration. You can't get close to edges with the upright and the hand-held hose doesn't have enough suction to pick up anything. The plastic parts are fragile, and the handheld rotating brush is useless. The bagless part is too small, so it fills up quickly, and the Hepa filter clogs fast too. A rip-off even at $1.99!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks to be me the sucker who bought this sucking machine that sucks NOT!!","review":"My wife and I bought this unit about a year and a half ago needless to say we had to buy a new vacuum about 6 months ago. I cleaned this vacuum after every cleaning and it worked good when we first bought it for like $250 or so. But after awhile the unit started stinking all the time. It doesnt seem like the carpet height adjustment works or something. Smells awful. Belt came off after first 6 months and i got it working again. Well now the suction is horrible even from the hose. Now I have a dyson and it works 150X better. Hoover used to be a good brand but I guess like everything good things always change and in Hoovers case it change for the worse.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, don't do it.","review":"I purchased a Hoover Wind Tunnel Vac and a Hoover carpet cleaner at the same time based on Consumer Report recommendations.

I took the fairly new vacuum to a local shop to be repaired and she explained that the current products \\"ain't your mom's Hoover\\". They're made in China and each year gets worse. They repair all makes and most are Hoovers. Please avoid. She said Simplicity is the only US brand anymore. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Windtunnels start well, but don't last","review":"I've had two Hoover Windtunnels. The first one lasted two years, and the motor burned out. Sears told me it should have lasted longer. I bought another. It did last longer, maybe 4 years, before the motor butned out.

So now I'll probably get something more reliable, maybe a used vac to keep the price down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great at first.","review":"Worked great when we first bought it, It would work so well in fact that every time we would vacuum it would take up all the loose carpet fibers as well. after about 7 months the motor has started to smoke and it stopped picking up everything all together.

It worked great for the first few months picking up my dog's hair and anything else on the floor. It did feel like it was moving itself for the first month or so. Emptying the canister can be gross because you have to get the stuff out by hand sometimes. Cleaning the 2nd filter in the bathtub can be a little gross but when you do it works better, but every time you clean it, the performance gets worse quicker than the last time - I am feeling like I need to wash the filter after every room I clean. I have had this for a year and I am defintly looking for something with a longer life than this one for what I paid for it.

I have transferred hundreds of songs from LP ontoCD and it's great to load up 25 discs and have 30 hours of music. On \\"random\\" mode, it selects a disc and a track from each ofthe 25 and then begins a new random course. I would have no use for a remote control model. The volume and bass controls are through the Aiwa and I do have a remote for it. I will treat the disc rack area and the hood enclosure very delicately.

The only downside to it is that it is battery operated instead of cord, so it can run out in the middle of an 'experiment'.

Many people cant get the 400X magnification working, but the trick is to put it so close to the slide that they're almost, if not, touching.

I considered replacing the switch myself, but it doesn't make sense to have to fix a brand new product. Overall this looks like a pretty decent microscope for young kids. Not going for a third try with this microscope."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Instructions","review":"The microscope is great and fairly easy to use. But it came with no instruction booklet! You really need an instruction booklet for a microscope. I checked to see if the company had the booklet on line - not this model. But I did find lots of people who never got the instruction booklets with their microscopes. Now I have to see what I can do about getting the instructions. I would not order this item unless you already know how to work with slides and microscopes. Chances are, you won't get directions!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective out of the Box","review":"I purchased this product for my 5-year old son. After returning two other junk models, I was thrilled when I found this microscope, which was rated #1 for microscopes for kids. Upon taking the microscope out of the box, I could already tell that this was a better microscope than the previous two. However, after installing the batteries as instructed, I turned the microscope on and the power switch fell out. I immediately boxed it back up and am sending it back to Amazon for a refund. I guess I shall continue my search."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Lab Duo-Scope is really a toy","review":"First realize that this microscope is in the toy section. Although description says that the recommended age is 9-18 years, it is not even appropriate for that age range. If your kid or you are into serious scientific research, this will be a waste of your time. Having only one crude eyepiece, it is really difficult to look through this for more than 10 seconds. It is a real strain on the eyes, so don't expect to be able to do any observation for an extended period of time. It's only good for a quick glance. Looking at some of their samples wasn't too difficult, once you found the right setting, but looking at cells and bacteria close up will take a lot of effort. The lens are also plastic, which means they will scratch easily, so don't expect them to last very long. Again, if you are serious about what you want to do, I would recommend something professional, more powerful, and easy on the eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great buy","review":"This instrument has quality features I saw in much more expensive units.

They are using it weekly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice microscope.","review":"Purchased for a 7 year old for Christmas. She loved it. The pre-made slides were much easier for her than making our own. We've looked at all kinds of things. Lots of room to grow with the toy becuase it included dyes and blank slides that an older child could use. Only thing I can figure out is how to get the described magnifications. I can only figure out three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for entry level...and beyond","review":"I was looking for a microscope both easy to use and durable. I followed the other reviews to decide to buy this one and I am really glad. I really value the fact that this microscope has two lights: one to study slides and the other to watch hard objects. My daughter (10) analyzed several flowers and made discovers by herself which I know will be highly motivating when making exercises at school. My son (8) started with the slides. The ones included with the microscope are really neat, but you may by other ones just for the sake of more fun. In my case I bought slides from Konus human body slides. We also enjoyed analyzing the broken geodes that we bought at the same time. I would strongly reccomend this product to any parent that wants to stimulate a kid with a durable easy-to use and motivating science toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total junk","review":"After several battery replacements this thing will simply not work. The light will come on only on occasion. It was a Christmas present for my daughter and the total disappointment she showed with this thing will stick with me for years to come.Just garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"design flaw?","review":"bought this after reading the good reviews for this microscope.There is a fundamental design flaw (unless I got one with a mfg defect). Objects seen through the eyepiece appear laterally inverted. When I placed penny on the stage with the 'Lincoln side' of the penny facing upwards, Lincoln's face points to the right in the penny, but when viewed through the eyepiece, the faces points to the left!! This lateral inversion makes it very counter-intuitive and difficult to get the desired area of interest into the field of view in the eyepiece.Needless to say, it was a frustrating experience for my kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy recycle plastic, DON\\"T BUY, Break easily","review":"This item is made with cheap recycle plastic from China, in the old time, a microscope would last for life, but this thing today from China lasted two days and the screw-on magnified glass where you view with your eyes broke off because of cheappy plastic. Overall. dull gray colour, cheaply painted, all the parts are cheap looking plastic. Eye scope broke in two days. Do not buy it. Many good reviews here are probably from seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to ruin a Holiday, birthday etc.","review":"My son is very interested in science. So get him a microscope right? The Christmas gift idea was ruined since the light projection switch stopped working on the first day. Now I have to contact the manufacturer, probably ship it back etc. You would think that the product would last more than 1 day.I enjoy shopping shopping on Amazon and have done so for quite some time. The company should dump products that don't perform. Now I have to haggle with the manufacturer through the warranty process in the morning. What a great Christmas gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first scope","review":"I did a lot of searching for a microscope for my 7-year old daughter. I almost bought a USB scope but glad I didn't. I'm pretty impressed with this one. Focus is firm and very smooth. Optics are sound and the upper and lower lights make this very versatile. LED lights are easy on the batteries and no cord is needed to operate. The high power is not usable from above but this is stated in the manual. The slides and include equipment is a nice starter package. My 7-year old is THRILLED with it and I'm pleased with the value for $50. I'm sure we will get many hours of exploration with this scope! The only thing this scope is missing is a good carrying/storage case. The inclusion of that would make this a perfect item!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Lab Duo Scope Microscope","review":"Got the toy in time for my kid's recognition day at school. He was amazed by the toy's capability! The magnification was okay up to the 10x option but image is a little blurred when you crank it up to the 400x. Just be careful when rotating the magnification knob, it might get loose easily. Also the light below the slide blinks a bit . Sort of loose I guess but with proper adjustment, it will work fine. Get more of those pre-prepared slides for continual enjoyment with your kids. Great scientific experience for them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for Kids, but Check Thoroughly","review":"I ordered one of these for Christmas for my daughter. Unfortunately, I didn't check the box before Christmas Day. Turns out, the one we got was missing the eye piece. Unusable without. So, I sent it back.The next one I received had the eye piece, but the light switch would not easily turn on in position two. After some use, it got worse, to the point we couldn't turn the light on. So I returned it again.The third one is fine. No problems. I also bought two extra to give to my daughter's science teacher, and those were fine as well. So just be careful and check when you receive it."},{"rating":"2","title":"first microscope","review":"This was a Chanukkah gift for a grandchild.

It has a very artificial, vitaminish flavor. Having said that, tastes are subjective, so you may like the flavor. Given my experience, though, I'd suggest that you buy one of these in a store and try it before purchasing a whole box of them from Amazon.If you're looking for chocolate flavored PowerBars, I'd recommend either their traditional chocolate bar (tasty, but also very sticky) or the PowerBar Harvest Whole Grain Energy Bar (very tasty, and neater)."},{"rating":"2","title":"a technical review of this product","review":"what can you say about vacuum bags?...they came on time...they fit...they work.

I bought the cover to keep rain and moisture off of my winch, but I found that on hot and humid summer days I would take the cover off only to find that my winch was literally soaked with moisture. Even though there hadn't been rain for several days. Because of this I started to use the cover only during the winter months to keep snow and road salt off of the winch.2. The cover rubbed against the grill of my jeep due to it shifting around a bit at highway speeds...after several months it rubbed the paint clean off in certain areas.

I am a serious collector and I have hundreds of decks. This deck could have been so good. The book is filled with informative information which is a credit to the creator to the card deck. The deck however is filled with murky indistinct images. The crystals they are supposed to portray are not shown in any way that a rock lover could draw inspiration from.

If you believe having a Stephen King book in your attic or watching a scary movie can bring a plague of demons upon you and your house then maybe you are gullible enough to believe this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark and Disturbing","review":"There is something dark and punishing about this book. I guess I should've gotten the clue from the cover... not an uplifting vibe. I suppose there are some Satan-obsessed finger-wagging scolds who might enjoy it. But frankly, the best way to do a spiritual housecleaning is to banish intolerance and introduce love and joy into the home. Demons can't hang with the light and goodness of all that.

Surely there are items in one's home that can be a defilement. The Smith's help point us in the direction in asking the questions, \\"is this worth keeping in my house?\\" Their writing made me ask myself that very question. And I was convicted of what to rid myself of.On the other hand, I feel that Smith's are a bit fanatical in their writing. The book sometimes felt more like a horror story. I admit that If I wanted to scare myself in a good ghost story, I would pick up this title and read it once again. (Remember the days when you sat in a darkened room with friends or siblings and tried to tell the scariest ghost story.) Spiritual House Cleaning did just that for me.As a previous reviewer mentioned, unquote, \\"they seemed to be conjuring the spirits themselves.\\" Sometimes, I feel the Smiths were looking for ghosts.

It has taken something that is true and stretched it out of proportion.While it is true that there are objects that bring demonic oppression and invite demonic activity, it is usually easy for a Christian to cast unwanted demons out by pleading the blood of Jesus and taking authority over them.This book makes it very difficult to get away from the demonic since it lists all types of things that it assumes are cursed like Harry Potter. I highly doubt Harry Potter is a tool of the devil; he's got plenty of much better tools to work with like ouija boards and movies along the lines of Hell Raiser.While I will agree with some of what the book says, most is not even close to being true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just A Quick Read, But A Manual For Life!","review":"I've come to trust books written by Eddie and Alice Smith because they use scripture to back up the statements they make. I've read other books written by them and have always been blown away by the no-nonsense way they capture the attention of the reader. As they share each example, excitement begins to well up in you because of the revealed truth of their statements.And this book is no different. It is clear, concise and PRACTICAL. So easy to read and understand. It is not difficult at all to relate to many of the examples they give of people not understanding that the small, minute decisions we make in life can and do have far-reaching and eternal ramifications.This book is a road map to freedom on many levels.

The finishes looked like someone had taken sandpaper to them in various areas. Not only that, but the entire products appeared cheap & not constructed well. They need to go back to the drawing-board with these salt/pepper mills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done, engaging show","review":"I really enjoyed this show. It started off a bit slow - I was lukewarm about the first couple of episodes, but by the 4th episode it really hit its stride. A lot more character development than is typically seen in the spy vs. spy genre, and it grapples with the always interesting concept of the inherent duality in everyone. But, there's also a lot of action (with excellent production values) and tech so it can be enjoyed on that level as well.As you know, the series was cancelled, so it ends with a non-resolved cliffhanger. Still, it's well worth getting especially if you're a Christian Slater fan. His performance as \\"both\\" the stars of the show is excellent, and the supporting cast is also quite good (for the most part - a couple of the performances are just adequate).It's a shame that this was cancelled - I would absolutely love to see another season!

Although the show was great, if you buy it, you'll be greatly disappointed to find, as many NBC series go, there was no ending to it. It is one that they left completely unanswered.

Most military books I have read deal with specific combat operations or tactics as that seems to be what people expect when they think of the military. Like going to go and blow up a bridge or something.There are a lot of people in the military and most of those that serve have jobs other than combat operations. It is interesting to read about a military job that specifically does not use combat operations in a hostile military environment to acheive military goals. Like going to go and repair a bridge or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Little Read","review":"The only disappointing thing about his book is that apparently there is so little interest in it.

We love Masha Mason and all of her performances in the TV, movie and on stage. Her performance in this movie is by far her best. The dialog is witty and moving as all Neil Simon plays are. The quality of the video is more like that one finds on VHS tape, but we are not expecting a modern DVD with all the extra stuff, and HD quality anyway.

I just wanted some time travel escapism, and it certainly fit the bill.Character development is good.

My hangup is the packaging. The box that the set comes in looks great, but inside the box is another story. Instead of forking over the cash to revamp the entire set for this release, it seems that they instead scrapped the season sets, pulled out the DVD cases and stacked them in this set.

This collected the very best of the entire series knowing that the fans would clear the shelves. Seeing that they struck gold, they went ahead and released season 1. Season 2 followed, along with seasons 3 & 4, and not a word of a complete series box set until the damaged was done. Why? Simple. Milk the people dry!Hats off, Universal!

It does OK with crumbs and such but is lacking the power to clean drapes or furniture. Hoover makes a commercial version of the Portapower that has a lot more power. It comes with a 30ft cord, stainless steel wands, and has a shoulder strap that makes cleaning furniture and drapes a breeze. You can use a cloth bag or the more low dust paper bag. If you're looking for something with just a little more power than a Dustbuster, the Portapower II is the one to get. Otherwise, go for the commercial model."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed out loud","review":"I want to be Macy or do I want to be Faith? Either way it would be great to be so witty.

This little \\"twist\\" was entirely predictable from the beginning to me and now I regret wasting about six hours reading this. Not only that, but the main character Macy was a raunchy little slut. Reading about someone who constantly drinks, does drugs, gets sick, and then does so all over again gets very boring, very fast. It was poorly written and did not deserve the exciting review on the back cover since nothing really happens in the entire book. That's right, nothing happens besides Macy wandering around making herself too intoxicated to stand up and hurting the wimpy people who are naive enough to show her some love. The only funny part of the entire book was the museum incident. The rest is boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, Sad, and sometimes Sexy","review":"I rarely laugh outloud, when reading a book.

Most of them are good ones with good intentions.I had previously lived in two haunted houses: in the first house, I was attacked by one demonic spirit and saved by another spirit of an opposite kind.

I thought Leslie Rule would be compared to her mother as an author, Ann Rule, when writing came into play. However, I find that they both write in different manners and that Leslie Rule's writings are somewhat boring, wandering and not very interesting at all. I was also disappointed in the fact that Ms. Rule doesnt seem to have a paranormal/parapyschology background like some other writers do. This is a book that I laid down and did not finish.

She seems to believe just about everything she is handed, with a lot of \\"imagine if...!\\" type of space wasting speculation,not terribly interesting. Additionally, the writing reflects this breathless viewpoint and is over the top with a lot of exclamation points. She could have used an editor to tone down much of this bad writing, which only detracts from an already weak starting point.

The songs are brilliant, moving and they sound great. Tracks like Entropy, Shell Full of Sand, Sweetest Misery, and Sin Again are probably my favorites but the whole album is excellent. Some tracks have trip hop elements, there's some spanish guitar, some great lines of synth to snort and the vocalist has one of the best singing voices I've heard in quite awhile. It's a very powerful album that anyone who considers themselves a fan of goth music should have. This isn't some Sisters or Cure clone.. this is something fresh and something that avoids any of those cliche stereotypes that many of the newer bands seem to cling to. If you're into cheesey vampire songs this won't be your thing but if you like moving music that has depth you'll adore this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old and outdated","review":"This book is very old and outdated.

This is a collection of original hits from Crusaders who are all individual stars now including Joe Sample, Larry Carlton, Wayne Henderson, \\"Stix\\" Hooper and Wilton Felder. The grooves are evident in every tune. To me, the sound is a bit dated and I enjoy the modern versions more.

I picked up \\"Far Cry\\" based on its review in the NY Time Book Review in 1986 (front page coverage). If you simply accept Mrs. Hawkins at face value you will fall in love with the setting, the time and Mrs. Hawkins approach to life.Perhaps the book has a special place in my heart because I read it in a hotel bar overlooking the Arno in Florence while my pregnant wife was resting upstairs. I still reread the book and remember the bar. Funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky and Entertaining","review":"Set in the mid-twentieth century London publishing world, this is a quirky and enjoyable read. The book is structured as a flashback, as Mrs. Hawkins looks back on her youth, working for a minor Kensington publisher. She looks back from the comforts of her retirement in Italy. As a young war widow Mrs. Hawkins lived on a small salary reviewing manuscripts for her employer. Her duties led her to an ongoing feud with an untalented hack writer, who believes firmly in his own merit, but whose clunky prose Mrs. Hawkins dismisses. After brandishing him with a somewhat amusing moniker, she becomes the target of his revenge. Their ongoing feud reveals to Mrs. Hawkins a seedy underbelly of the publishing industry, one that she may unknowingly expose. The ending is both bizarre and entertaining, and the characters are originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my cup of tea","review":"This book didn't live up to the high recommendation that caused me to buy it. Set in the 1950's, the social mores in the book come from the 1980's, when the book was written. Passive voice dominates the book and very few scenes carry the reader into the story--we're told what happened after the fact. The author's chatty style defines the main character well, but half way through the book I wondered if there was a plot connected to the book, and why I bothered to read it. The plot finally shows up on page 141 (out of 189). I'm glad that others have enjoyed the book, but I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a bore..","review":"Try Barbara Pym instead...or Penelope Lively. THis was so boring I didn't even finish it, and its not that long!!

Try \\"Excellent Women\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun with well developed protagonist.","review":"This is a very English and appealing comedy. The protagonist, Mrs. Hawkins, is an overweight, very competent widow in her late twenties who works in publishing and lives in an inexpensive rooming house. Both settings provide their share of characters. All of these characters are quite believable, and fun to know (except for the evil Hector Bartlett). At the same time, while Mrs. Hawkins is a warm, nice person, she sees things and people quite clearly and stands up for herself. She is also a fully realized character, which is what ultimately makes the novel worth reading. My one complaint is that in making a happy ending, Spark sees fit to hurriedly make one of the characters (you know which one) a person who is wonderfully exceptional, and also a bit out of place in this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive!

I have used it for about three weeks now, and I trim about twice a week. The blades cut cleanly and with ease. The adjustment is sturdy, I haven't been able to get it to slip to another setting. My old MB30 would slip constantly.The smaller trimmer is noisy, and the blades don't seem to be as sharp or as clean-cutting as the large blades, but since I don't use it for anything but detail stuff, it has been good.The blades are smooth and stay clean. The only complaint I have is the trimmings go everywhere. I hear that the only way around that is a vacuum model, but I haven't found one of those with the smaller trimmer.

Highly recommended! Also, being able to use it while plugged in is a key feature.Cons: Does \\"shave\\" very closely.I use this trimmer to, well, trim my beard. It is great at that!

Golden age heroes fighting WWII, a Nazi \\"Superman\\"... The Golden Age has done this all before, but much better.The art might have saved it, if only I could tell who was who. There faces all seamed the same, and when they are in plain clothes there is not much else to determine one from the next.Plus, The Golden Age was much more emotionally involving than Liberty Files. You give more of a damn about them when you see their growth and torment.The two stars may be a bit harsh, but I'm always disappointed when I see characters with so much potential being redrawn into a bland version of a previously good comic. Check out The Golden Age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kennedy Toole this isn't.","review":"I picked up this book because of Kennedy Toole's name and New Orleans were on the book cover. When I read that the main character, Gus, gets his chaplin job through a lie and a lark I thought I was in for some fun. About halfway through I realized I'd been had. The characters were one dimentional and the author was pushing them around where he wanted them to go, rather than be lead through the story. I thought there was great potential for some humor with Cuban brothers who wanted to open a Wal-Mart version of a botanica. But the humor never came. I kept waiting and thought the Jazz fest scene would finally deliver a gag but no luck there either.

Larson -- known in fine Western fashion by his initials -- has written the official, scholarly history of Wyoming filling a huge gap in published literature about the state. Primary source material about Wyoming abounds, but few of us have the time or training to find it and then plow through it to make sense of it. Anecdotal information and imagined histories are also widely available, but few of those are reliable if you want accuracy or even the slightest bit of objectivity. Places built on myth -- and Wyoming was born of a number of them -- are wonderful, but they shouldn't be exempt from a more scholarly treatment like this. There are plenty of guidebooks, such as \\"The Wyoming Handbook\\" in the series published by Moon, that give you historical \\"color\\". But for a fuller, more realistic picture of this fascinating place, Larson is definitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of information, but encyclopedic instead exciting","review":"I bought this book to add more to my upcoming trip to Wyoming in October. I was hoping to read exciting stories from Wyoming's past like the adventures of the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang. However, this book is very encyclopedic and dry in its presentation of Wyoming's data. The information on the weather will be handy, but I could have done without the pages upon pages of data on soil composition and historical costs of cattle. This book is certainly full of information, just don't expect to be entertained by it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Soundtrack, S***ty Price","review":"I've always loved Death Note, the manga and the anime.

Most of the ideas in this book must be repeated every time someone new arrives.

The characters are to die for, and the way that Mia Ikumi slowly draws you in towards her work just compells me!If you are into deep, flowing story lines, then this manga is most definately not for you. If you enjoyed Sailor Moon or Magic Knight Rayearth, you will definately enjoy this work, for it has the same elements; magical girls, love, super powers, cute costumes, etc...If you enjoy light, happy reads, then this series is for you! But I do have a WARNING for you! Every manga ends with a cliff-hanger, so you will have to buy all seven books to see the end! I do tell you this, it is money well worth spending, and the lesson taught will stick with you even in your everyday life.

I guess I outgrew it or whatever but back when i really liked it i bought the whole series and wasted my money........ kinda. There are way too many americanisms in it, like \\"Let's Rock!\\" And other pathetic retarted phrases such as that which WERE NOT in the original version. You can tell in many ways that Ikumi Mia COPIED Sailor Moon in many parts. They are way too much alike in many ways but Sailor Moon has a much more deeply involving story line and all that nice stuff.I would definantly recomend this anime, however.

Normally, any shogou manga never strikes me as something I want to buy, but perhaps the cat girl on the cover had something to do with my interest...Anyway, the series is your standard super-girl style storyline with the interesting charateristic that instead of simply using a transformation amulet to put on a sailor suit, they instead change into animals (albiet in an extremely low key way). All in all this part of the series is standard, however, what I beleive this series has is a very interesting plot-line that evolves from the characters having animal DNA in their system and no longer being truly human. Its a very nice catch. There is an anime for this in Japan currently, and is being released in fansubs. If you enjoy this type of super-girl anime I would also reccomend looking into a series called Azaukin Cha Cha."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic cuteness dipped in chocolate!!! :3","review":"A cute, fun story about a normal, love-sick girl who gets mixed with cat DNA along with 4 other unlucky (lucky) girls.

It's a really cute series that is pretty much appropriate for all ages despite alot of kissing! It was a pretty good story line, although some things just seemed a little corny. The main character, Ichigo, is twelve, (Although she looks like she could be 15!) and has a huge crush on her classmate Masaya. When on a date with him to a museum, she is merged with the DNA of an almost extict wild cat. Suddenly, she meets new friends and has all these 'sailor moon-like' powers that she is supposed to use to fight off aliens who are trying to take over the planet.OVERLY CUTE. Pretty corny, but it makes up for that in cuteness and romance. (Although, one of the most corniest things in the whole series is that Masaya ends up liking Ichigo for no specified reson too so they both are like, officially in love at age twelve.)Happy Reading,-Ky"},{"rating":"1","title":"Saccharine pushed beyond reason","review":"If you like magic girl books which are entirely predictable this is the book for you.

First, the \\"hard floor tool\\" is clumsy and will not pick up fine dirt like sand or kitty litter. Second, recently(March 2011), my upright vacuum died upstairs so I got the never used WindTunnel power nozzle attachment out to use. Nothing. I took the part off and reattached it again and this time it turned on. I then turned the vacuum off to move to a different location and once again it refused to work. I took the attachment off and on many times, but could not get it to run again. I purchased this vacuum because I have an older Hoover canister that worked really well and had great attachments (not like these cheap ones). The only reason I order a new canister is because the body/hose of the older Hoover is literally falling apart. The motor is still running strong.

In \\"Simply Christmas\\" Shirley hits the mark dead center on December 25th. This is a delightful rendition of traditional Christmas music; past and present. The best example I can give is to equate this to a well done interpretation of the Star-Spangled Banner,(ala Whitney Houston) as opposed to attempts by many who destroy the original's traditional beauty. Shirley has created a unique balance of keeping alive the love of your favorite Christmas memories while creating a glimps of future holidays full of hope. It's old. It's new.

Even regardless of size, it sounds great. I think $50 is a little steep considering some used amps you can get for that, but if you need something small...VERY small to just have around this is probably the best thing you'll find. It actually sounds better than a couple practice amps I've used in the past.After messing around with this little amp for a while, I've found the overdrive is almost non-existent. You need to turn it up almost all the way to get any that resembles an overdrive sound. I got a replacement since the first one I had didn't sound right and the second one sounded a little better but not nearly enough to justify the purchase. I've just returned that one and will be buying a Fender mini amp instead.

Still, like the previous set, this one is of a piece, excluding both 'King Of Pain' and 'Wrapped Around Your Finger', which I consider essential Police singles, and 'All This Time', which is simply one of Sting's best solo records. Thankfully, on the other end of the spectrum, the Puff Daddy remix of 'Roxanne' is gone.

It reads like the main moment in a movie! There were a couple of glitches in the book, though. The first one was when \\"nitrous oxide\\" is mentioned when it should have read \\"nitric oxide\\" and the second one was when \\"plasticity\\" was apparently confused with \\"long term potentiaton\\". I have the hardback; maybe this was corrected in the paperback though. I am sorry, I'm picky like that.

Here is my opinion about the F2300 Floor Polisher---- It worked 5 times. Then one buffer did not turn. I took it apart and there is no belt, but PLASTIC GEARS. The PLASTIC GEARS/ a blue one and a white one/ were already worn down so that the buffers would not turn, even though the motor still worked. This is a piece of junk that is no better than Hoover's floor scrubber that only worked once for me. Don't waste your money on Hoover products.If you send them for service they come back no better.

First, the trail maps are accurate and clear. From my experience, accurate trail maps are hard to find. The author not only provides accurate maps, but he also provides distances at key intervals and often draws alternate routes. Second, each trail map is accompanied by a text version of the trail, describing the terrain and the exact mileage at regular intervals. This data is useful if you are riding with a cycle computer. Although the book covers only 25 trails, this book is a must-have for all NJ MTBikers. Directions to the park, history, and other information is also provided.

Driving directions to the spots and explanations of where to park, whether or not there is a fee... it's got everything you need to know. He really did a good job of researching the book and a nice touch is the inclusion of other nearby sites (relevant to the place you pick).One possible improvement: There's a map of NJ showing all the sites, it would be nice if the page numbers were listed there and the trail ratings were also included on the map.

Ms. Staples choice of format, the classic portraiture, is exactly what these astonishing animals needed to go from the rank of breakfast suppliers to natural wonders. Her careful choice of backdrop and revealing lighting open the reader to a new and hidden culture.

Also, the factory remote/key combo DOES NOT FIT in the keyhole when you use the Putco handles. You must have a non-remote key if you wish to use the key entry.

The instrumental and musical diverity on this album is what makes it so incredible, with sharp guitar (even a few solos), rich bass, bongo, banjo, and even an organ. The album shows how Guster continues to evolve and mature, reinventing themselves and even writing deeper, more meaningful lyrics. There are more uptempo \\"rockers\\" on this album, tracks such as \\"The Beginning of the End\\", but Guster absolutely shines on their mid-tempo numbers such as \\"Hang On\\". The balance created throughout the course of the entire album shows you how diverse Guster's sound is, and makes you realize that this is Guster's most ambitious release to date, which is amazing, considering it is probably also their most accomplished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Direction, Again","review":"Add me to the group that gives Guster credit for not continuing to try to remake \\"Lost and Gone Forever\\" over and over again, but this is not the best use of this band's talent. Ditto: where are the harmonies? Ditto: I understand Joe doesn't want to be tied to the bongos forever, it limits their sound, but the drumming is too generic. Gentlemen, this album makes you sound too much like everything else that's out there, and believe me, that's a BAD thing. I was a fan of Guster in the first place, because you were different. Now you sound like an amalgam of the top 20 bands on the college charts, but without being interesting.

Keep It Together had some nice moments but also showed signs of a major label trying to make a unique and interesting band conform to some narrow-minded idea of what people want to hear on the radio. But I thought that perhaps the success of that album would give Guster some leverage to make the next album their way. ...sigh... I guess it was not to be. This album is so uninteresting, uninspired, un...Guster. Where are the harmonies that were a trademark of their earlier albums? Where is the interesting percussion? Ganging Up On the Sun could have been made by any run-of-the-mill alt-commercial band. Of course, even with the mis-guided production, great songs could have saved this effort, but the songs are almost all uniformly dull. I think my wife's comment said it best: \\"I've heard more exciting music in an elevator\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downhill spiral from the original days...","review":"Ever since they took Banjoe-Joe on, and changed the dynamic of the group their music has gone completely downhill. It has become very generic and not nearly as good as the original stuff. Parachute, Goldfly, and lesser so Lost and Gone Forever, were the only good albumns. L&GF; was the album that helped them get traction on the Pop charts adn you started seeing them play larger venues. Then Ganging Up on the Sun came out, and it was a huge nosedive.I miss the old Guster, the original \\"Gus\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Guster's Best, But Still A Great Album","review":"In my opinion, this doesn't QUITE live up to the incredibly high standard of most of Guster's previous work, but that certainly does not mean its a bad record. On the contrary, its quite a joy to listen to. If I hadn't heard any of Guster's other work before this I would probably give it 5 Stars, but knowing what they're capable this falls JUST short of the mark. Truly if I could, I would rate it more of a 4.5, I still highly suggest buying this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Glad to Have My Guster Back","review":"I discovered them with Keep it Together--which I loved. Then I went backwards. It's nice to know that Guster hasn't done the same thing. They have grown, matured--musically, lyrically--and I couldn't be happier. Manifest Destiny has a catchy hook, and One Man Wrecking Machine just draws you in from the first note. The Captain and Lighning Rod also have great sound. But nothing can top Ruby Falls, which takes Come Downstairs and Say Hello (from KIT) and escalates the emotion, the drive, and the vocal energy. But overall there is a new-found power to the music, with its rich layers and tones, yet still maintains the vocal harmony we've come to love. Guster is just plain great. Ganging up on the Sun will play on my iPod all summer long--and beyond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought this for 1 song","review":"Bought the entire album for one song, \\"One man wrecking machine,' and I should have just bought the mp3 single."},{"rating":"1","title":"one good song","review":"I enjoyed one song on this CD; that's why I bought it.

I was horrified. The Japanese are portrayed as narrow-minded. He makes fun of their broken English. The Japanese girlfriend is the sterotypical submissive Asian woman. The plot is extremely far-fetched. The main character lacks sympathy. He's taking advantage of this girl and then has no backbone when standing up to her family. He hasn't even called his own parents in three years but the father is supposed to be a jerk even mentioning this fact. The most disturbing part of the book is a man named Samuel who's married to a Japanese woman. He's portrayed in a very unsympathetic light and I found the whole role he plays and thinly veiled anti-Semitism.The main character is glib and self-serving. The book is very superficial.

Soundblaster help was no help, two requests were answered with1)a fix to disable some XP operation which uses CPU to handle power management. Their suggested methodology resulting in having to reformat and re-install XP2) A request for the list of IRQs. Are they serious, this is still problem in XP? Anyway tried changing in BIOS, no effect.Bottom line is the card I had, SB live, worked fine.

I marked the card and returned for repair/replacement. After 4 months I received the same card back, not working. I was then sent a 5.1 card that I couldn't hook-up to the front panel.

The first item to break was the power switch plastic cover within a few days. The way I used it after the power switch broke was to stick a paperclip in it to push the small metal contacts together. The feel is very fragile, small plastic pieces all over it. The trimming guides clips break off very easily all but one of the clips that hold them to the head broke. Not even worth it for a cheap buy. Stay away from this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best I've read on Reinarnation","review":"I consider this the best book I've read on the subject of reincarnation. The book is filled with detailed evidence of the reality of reincarnation which is hard to dismiss. Dr. Wambach took large numbers of subjects back into past lives via hypnotic regression. The information brought back by the subjects was often extremely detailed, including what utensils they ate with, what they wore on their feet, etc. Further research on her part could verify these details matched historical records, even when the places and times remembered by the subjects were very obscure. Her research also dispells the common misconception that people always remember being some famous preson like Napoleon or Cleopatra since the vast majority of people remembered living very common lives. These are just a few examples of the fascinating details included in this book.I highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to read about truly scientific research of reincarnation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book in Search of a Purpose","review":"I am torn with this book.

However, since there is little quality information available about alternative treatments for osteoarthritis, I knew I had nothing to lose. What a lucky decision! Karolyn Gazella really presented a wealth of priceless information in a compact, and extremely easy to read book! Ms Gazella melds the expertise of Jason Theodosakis, M.D. concerning the use of glucosamine, in its several forms, with her own hunger to find answers to difficult health questions. I have read other books authored, or co-authored by Ms. Gazella and this one ranks right up there! Karolyn never presents a treatment as a cure-all. She always drives home the fact that any product is a part of a larger whole, and she isn't afraid to tell you what that \\"whole\\" is.

This is much more than the usual boom-chucka stuff I find in many books. It gives three pages of varied, and increasingly challenging, examples. After several weeks, I still go back to these pages to practice.The accompanying CD is fun to listen to these experts playing.

No one can read a book on Catholics or Jews and think that they are now converted! These conversion can take years. Voodoo books go wrong by trying to outline Voodoo like Wicca. Voodoo can take decades to understand before your ready to practice. I have been raised around Voodoo from a young age and even I am still trying to get to a point where I have everything down pack and can safely call on Loas and perform spell work.

The comedy is fresh, well-delivered and very, very funny. Having spent so many years in the business, it would've been easy for Slagle to simply assemble some \\"greatest hits\\" and slap them together. It would've been a decent album, but Europa shows us a brilliant comedian in transition, easily moving from established bits to risky, aggressive pieces that finally, after all these years, showcase Slagle's true talent and ambitious nature.

Levy justifiably employs broad working definitions to the concepts of New Left, labor, and social activist unions in examining the activities of the component groups within his focus. Unions and new leftists met frequently at the flash points of civil rights, anti-war, and other fronts of the 1960s, but ongoing relationships involving the United Electrical Workers, the UAW and various new left organizations also characterized the period, as Levy demonstrates. The drive for participatory democracy had many friends, as Levy's superbly documented account testifies."},{"rating":"1","title":"12 Volt connection cord overheats.","review":"During the first year Igloo replaced my 12 volt cord twice due to meltdown.

The songs are uninteresting, the lyrics are trite beyond words and the vocals are...UGH!I'm not expecting trained, professional vocal work here, nor was I expecting anything spectacular, but I did at least have the reasonable expectation that if you're going to put out a CD of yourself singing you should at least sound better than the crowd at karaoke night.Hell, I'd rather listen to Bette Davis sing Whatever Happened to Baby Jane than listen to this guy sing between the note and slide down the scales with not the least attempt at control.NOT worth the penny it's selling for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, well made but a little small","review":"I also thought I would have plenty of room. I use a Wah, compressor, distortion, boost pedal and a tube pre-amp and it is fairly well packed. Part of my issue is I cannot put the boxes right next to each other because I am using batteries and I need to back the input jack out a half an inch so it doesn't drain. Am saving up for a power supply which I am not sure where I am going to put it, underneath maybe?Thought of building one of my own but then there's the case issue, but for now this provides a good solution, I prefer the stompbox quality over those multi-effect boards. The velcro seems very adequate in holding everything in place. The only thing I would warn about is making sure you can get a flat surface on the bottom of you effect box to apply the velcro. The wah pedal has its own feet and the bottom is raised making contact only possible on the feet. The carrying case is extremely handy and well made so for now this has been my gig setup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Awesome, loving the product, great quality, cheap and i love it. Sounds awesome, Very durable Very durable Very durable Very durable"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulls my hair out","review":"I bought this haircut kit because of all the rave reviews, and the integrated vacuum. The latter works ok, even though the occasional hair goes through the screen and gets stuck. The biggest problem was that it doesnt cut well and actually pulls my hair out. My friend had bought one as well, and has the same problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good, but small basket","review":"This haircut kit is very good and cuts the hair evenly. All the functions are easy to understand and use. The only problem is that the box in which the hair is collected after trimming is small. So it needs multiple cleanup while using it. However it couldnt have been bigger coz then it wont be able to fit into our hand.A small amount of hair falls outside if you cut the hair and the box gets filled. So to avoid this situation, you have clean it up as soon as it gets filled.I would definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"just right","review":"This item did exactly what I thought it would.

I would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"product pulls when goig against the grain","review":"I bought the product to keep my hair at the shortest lenght possible . Product does what it's designed to do, but pulls when going against the grain. Possibly dull blades or slow speed in cutting."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple and mostly clean","review":"We bought this about two months ago and have used it two maybe three times. It works great as long as my husband's hair is clean (his hair is thick and if it is a little greasy it is hard to cut.) Occasionally I see little hairs on his shirt while I am cutting. It isn't very loud, and that surprises me since we used Wahl hair clippers previous to this and they were loud! We like it and for the cost of it, it sure is better and cheaper than him going to the barber!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Haricut Kit ever owned","review":"I used this haircut kit since 2008 and loved it. I need one now and Remington does not make it any more. A year ago, I even called Remington company and made a request to them to remake this product. I don't think they received enough requests to start manufacturing this product again.If anyone who reads this review has a used and functional piece of Remingtion HKVAC-2000 Haircut Kit and willing to sell it, I would buy it from them. Please reply via comment and I will respond. Serious sellers only please. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Product!","review":"I started going with the close cut hair style back in 2000 so I've used a variety of devices. Until I got the HKVAC-2000 I was never very impressed with a trimmer. Then I got this baby and took it for a test drive and I was sold! This is by far the best thing I've ever used for cutting hair. I even use it to cut my 4-year-old's hair, sometimes while he is watching TV, it's that easy to use! I've been using it now for several years without incident.Razor sharp cutting blades, hair catching action, easy to clean, an assortment of attachments, relatively quiet operation (not as loud as a hair dryer), easy empty hair cartridge, adequate cord length, lightweight (the weight is in the wall-wort), and reliable.You can't go wrong with this one! Highly recommended. Pays for itself in a matter of months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but still messy.","review":"I purchased this a few years ago, it does a good job, but still leaves a considerable mess.

Beware of pricing, I bought this product 2 years back about $30 to 35 and now online (with some seller) it is casting $99.00, definitely it doesn't $100.00. Beware buyers!!!I can give more stars to this per my usage, but it is not as strong as other products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I've been using this trimmer for 9 months, using it to cut my own hair. In general it does a good job. I don't get \\"professional\\" results - no one would think that I just came from a barber. But after cutting my hair, I just don't look like I need a haircut.The trimmer is relatively big, so it is not ideal for precision work, like around the ears or sideburns. I bought a smaller trimmer for that. But for simply cutting hair it's perfect. The vacuum really works, the trimmer hasn't clogged, and has probably saved me over 200 bucks, while making my life more convenient.If it busted tomorrow I'd buy another one in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product","review":"I'm well pleased with this vacuum haircut kit. My 5 years old son likes it, too. It used to be a hassel to cut his hair, but not anymore. We all enjoy it. It has different length you can chose, no need to oil the blade, the vacuum receives his hair quite well. I could finish his hair cutting in 5 minutes, for there is no need to brush away the hair getting in to his neck. Now even my husband wants me to cut his hair, and it works well, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"much better than clippers","review":"i got this for my husband at christmas and he loves it. it's much better than regular clippers. he shaves his entire head and not one hair touches the floor. saves him so much time since he doesn't have to sweep up after he's done. but it does sound like a vacuum! i had no idea what he was doing the first time he used it. the only problem he has is when he gets down to his neck area where the skin bunches up. other than that he loves it! highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy clean up but not for anyone but kids","review":"We have had one of these in our house since my son was born and he is 5. It is awesome to cut his hair and it all goes into the vacuum and is easy to dump.. very easy clean up. The cutting of the blades sometimes leaves streaky marks on his head but he thinks it is cool. Sometimes it pulls his hair when it is too long instead of cutting it. We use it only to cut his hair and if you want your kid to have anything but a buzz cut I wouldn't purchase. For us it works because he likes it like the cutter cuts :)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have used it on my 2 boys for 3 years now and love it!!!","review":"This is the best way to cut kids hair. I have not had any problems cutting my 2 kids hair with this since they were age 1. My 2 sons hated getting a haircut and we would have to bribe them everytime. When I bought this and they saw how their hair went inside the cup and not all over them, making them itch they loved it. Because I give my husband a haircut every 6 weeks or so and my boys every 2 months, I do have to replace this every year. I figure that in just one month of cutting their hair buys this shaver, so I have no problem with it. Also my husbands hair is super thick and that may be part of the problem also. Either way I love this shaver and hope they never stop making it. You will not be disappointed!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great haircutter/vacuum combo","review":"Great home haircutting system. The blades are very sharp (don't use on skin that is not taught and watch out for moles on scalp.) Vacuum catches almost all the hair. Should empty hair catch chamber after each cut for optimal efficiency."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased with clippers and vacuum!","review":"Just cut my husbands hair for the first time and we were both very pleased. The little vacuum part is awesome! No hairs to vacuum up with the big vacuum and none down his neck.Very pleased! Used the 1 inch size which is the largest length and happy with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent product","review":"This machine has lasted me 6 years. Today, after 6 years, the blades still work but the electrical plug isn't in the best of shape. I have to wiggle the wire to fix an intermittant power problem. If i manage to position the wire in the right spot, the machine turns on and works just fine.But overall, I've been incredibly pleased with this product. It makes no mess, is durable, and does its job flawlessley. I'm ordering a second one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice vacuum hair clipper","review":"The unit is a little larger than I'm used to using, but I will get used to it. Love the vacuum idea and it works good, only a few stray hairs were missed. Did a great job cutting hair. Great vacuum clipper for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product!","review":"I never have left a comment on Amazon before. But this haircut kit is what I been waiting for. The few hairs that escape are no biggie. I can give myself a quick trim AFTER the shower. Normally I would wash my hair-then cut-then wash/rinse my hair a second time to get all of the little hairs still imbedding in my hair out so I can style it. If you have really long hair and plan to cut hair off over 2\\". It might not fit in the vacuums nozzle. Besides the cool vac feature, it does a clean job of cutting as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shaver shaves!","review":"This shaver works very well, cuts rapidly and evenly, needs no oiling as some others do, cleans easily, and retains the hair in the vacuum receptacle which is easy to empty. The only drawback I have with it, and would have appreciated knowing up front, is that the deepest guide is only one inch, so if you want something longer - oh well. Also, if you want to return it - it will end up costing you nearly as much as the kit (no postage refund, you have to pay shipping back and 25% restock fee) so it's not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remington HKVAC-200 Precision Vac haircut Kit","review":"This is the nicest haircutting unit I have used.

In a fit of craziness, I asked him to cut my hair! The results were very good - with a little practice I think we can get a great haircut, and some concentrated time together as well. Only problem - my hair was fairly long and the longest comb was a 1\\" - sure wish they had a 1.5\\", but I can't find where you can buy accessories on the Web. My hair is shorter than I'm accustomed to, but very even all around. My son was very proud of himself!!Anybody know if you can get a longer comb for this thing?? It's a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is great","review":"It is quiet and keeps the mess to a minimum. Very little of it escapes. No itchy hair and a whole lot less noise means my boys actually enjoy getting their hair cut now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Key feature leaves you down","review":"The Remington works fine as a trimmer; however, the vacuum feature leaves a lot to be desired. The vacuum was the primary reason I was willing to change from my current cordless trimmer, and it does not do an adequate job.As stated by another reviewer, the trimmer relies too much on gravity to capture the hair in its vacuum. Too high a percentage of hairs simply get blown away by the exhaust. There may be fewer hairs to clean up, but they're scattered over a wider area. Cleanup time was not reduced nearly enough to justify the addition of a cord."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage kiddie toy, do not buy","review":"This looked like a good idea but...Every clipper I'd seen before use AC power, not low voltage DC power. Result motors are not very powerful. Next on first use some hair managed to get into the vacuum motor compartment and promptly got wound up in the motor, jamming it. Worse there is no way to disassemble it even partially to clean out hair that WILL get inside so it's lifespan is very questionable.Lesson learned. You don't need special clippers or trimmers to cut your own hard, all you need is a quality set of clippers with a set of cutting combs for various desired lengths of hair.Do yourself a favor and buy some real clippers, not this kiddie toy junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seemed really good but started pulling hair vs cutting it","review":"I've actually purchased two of these over the years. Had one for at least a couple years and it was wonderful. But I noticed that it started pulling my kids' hair now and then which, naturally, would upset them. And when they don't enjoy getting their haircut much in the first place, this is annoying. So I thought it was because it was old, so I bought a new one. And right away it was doing the same thing. So then I thought it was because I was going too fast. But it still will give a quick grab and pull on the hair now and then. I don't really know why this is, but it's the only thing that prevents me from giving it 5 stars. It's worth buying, but only because it's the only hair trimmer with vacuum built into it on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Junk!","review":"Was not happy with this at all. Threw it away and purchased an Oster after about a week. Cheaply-made, awkward, and only sucked up about 50% of the hair that it cut AT MOST. When no attachments were used, the blades were not adjustable and nicked my skin a lot. Maybe it works better for long hair, I don't know, but this does not work at all on hair under half an inch long, including facial hair. Basically, it was just a piece of junk.

Both Dr. Sankey and wife, Kathy, are licensed acupuncturists well respected in the Los Angeles area. Kathy served on the review board for licensing in California.If you really want some eye opening insight into new healing techniques, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to gain basic understanding of Eastern healing methods and their roots in the Oriental school of thought. His explanation of the mathematics involved, i.e. Sacred Geometry, melds Western thought into the spectrum of the healing arts. You don't have to be a doctor or acupuncturist.

It will turn any matress into a comfy pillowtop and it seems to hold its shape and I've been using it for about a month now.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it lays on top of the mattress and doesn't have any elastic or straps or anything to prevent it from shifting.
