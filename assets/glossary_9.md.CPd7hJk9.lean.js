Nowhere in the DVD set (there are 5 DVDs) is there any mention of the individual episode content. No such information is on the back of the case; there is no booklet or flyer accompanying the DVDs; there is no indication on the individual DVDs as to what episodes are included on a given DVD. Worse yet, the DVDs aren't even numbered 1-5; thus, there is no easy or logical way to determine the content of a DVD without inserting the DVD into the player and perusing a menu. Thankfully I found a fan-based Psi-Factor website that does provide such episode information, but was certainly annoyed at the waste of time having to track down and print information that should have been included with the DVD set to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rising Sun","review":"This book deals with everything from murder to racism. It especially deals with the ongoing battle of business between the United States and Japan. Just when you think that you know what is going to happen next, a whole different thing happens than what you expected. What's great about this book is that it is non stop action from the beginning to the end. Whether it's a high speed chase or bodies that are found in swimming pools to people jumping off of buildings, this is the book toread if you are looking for these kind of things. Now that I have read this book, I know how serious the Japanese feel about business and believe me, they take it very seriously. If you are looking for abook with lots action, this is the book to check out. You won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor excuse for a thriller","review":"Rising Sun was a terrible read. Crichton uses one device throughout: the old hand knows everything an hour before the young guy and slowly reveals it to him. It's tiring and monotonous. Never mind the even more monotonous lectures on the differences between American and Japanese business cultures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique combination of a \\"who done it\\" and a \\"tech.-thriller\\"","review":"The ultimate combination of a \\"who done it\\" and a \\"high-tech. thriller\\"- Crichton satisfies the die hard fan of bothtypes of novels. It's friday night, the Grand Opening partyof Nakamoto building, and no one would suspect that a herrendous murderwas being committed on the 46th floor. Through sophisticated technology, the Japanese doctored the original recordingof the murder, concealing the true identity of the murderer.The two detectives, John Conner and Peter Kelly, are entangledin a race against the clock, following many disappointing leads.Is American technology modern enough to uncover Japanese doctored tapes? Did the Nakamoto corporation play a role in themurder? The novel's twist ending can not possibly be uncovereduntil the last 30 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't come true","review":"Many of the predictions in this book about the Japanese \\"taking over America\\" by buying it up have not come true. Indeed, with Japan's current economic decline the alarmist tone of this book is quite laughable. I remember reading it at the time and being somewhat skeptical, but in 2008, this book has almost no relevance except as an example of fear-mongering from a prior decade. The mystery story itself is only so-so. Stick to Jurassic Park or the Andromedia Strain."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Book","review":"This book is a ridiculous, repetitive piece of propaganda; in the middle of the novel, the story is virtually dropped for some 100 pages in favor of endless examples of \\"Japanese corporate treachery.\\" While the examples provided are apparently true, they take on racist undertones when Crichton utterly fails to separate \\"Japanese corporations\\" from \\"the Japanese.\\" I'm sure Crichton would object to being judged by the actions of Nike, McDonalds or Microsoft. Propaganda aside, the thriller aspect of the novel is a snore, and Crichton's writing is mediocre at best. The most outstanding characteristics of his prose are his odd usage of punctuation and the awkward lack of contractions in dialogue. This novel is insulting to the intelligence and a waste of time and energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Japan-Bashing Drivel","review":"The plot of this book serves merely to support an amazing amount of Japan-bashing. While I understand the context of the time - when Japan seemed to be buying up the whole of America, the lack of subtlety that Crichton uses to get his point across is disturbing. Like another reviewer said, he puts what seems to be prepared stump speeches in the mouths of all the characters in the book. Even worse is the obvious stereotyping of Japanese: the only Japanese character who seems to have any redeeming feature is a half-American woman who hates Japan as much as Crichton does.My advice is, if you value objectivity and good literature, give this book a pass and save your money - I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this book","review":"I am Japanese and I think this book is a disgrace to my family's heritage and all of the principles that I stand for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder, corporate takeovers and kinky sex.","review":"A very intriguing book where a Japanese corporation tries to cover up the murder of a blonde with very odd sexual preferences.

The book only took three days to arrive, and is in exceptable condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PLOT BUT WEAK THEME","review":"This book is a great crime story that beats CSI and Law and Order. But it seems Crichton has run out of ideas. The whole \\"Japan taking over America\\" caution takes away significantly from the action."},{"rating":"2","title":"different style for author-tight gripping mystery","review":"~~~~Be aware that you won't find Crichton's insired science fiction here.~~~But you will find a carefully plotted suspenseful mystery, interesting characters, and a fascinating glimpse into the culture of Japanese business in American seen through the admittedly prejudiced eyes of the detectives.The interactions of the special liason team, called out to deal with crimes involving foreign dignitaries, and the walls they run into as both the Japanese business hierarchy and American celebrties close ranks to hide crucial information, makes a fascinating, taut, well placed mystery,~~~~Crichton's attention to detail is evident even outside the sci-fi world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"I found this to be one of Crichton's most disappointing books. When it was published, it may have found an audience that could relate, but with a currently different economical situation, most of the story is too outdated for a reader to appreciate. The mystery is thrilling, but Crichton ruins it with characters like Graham, who fits the racist anti-Japanese stereotype, and Connor, the enigmatic, all-knowing Sherlock Holmes. Even Connor treats the Japanese like a bit cruelly, referring to them the way a scientist would describe the characteristics of a strain of bacteria. I can see how certain qualities of Asian culture can be annoying, especially in business, but had Crichton written with a bit more diplomacy, his book would be a lot more popular today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, Michael Crichton, wow...please stick to science-type thrillers! Dripping with XENOPHOBIA","review":"Wow, Michael Crichton, wow...please stick to science-type thrillers! I'm a big Michael Crichton, and this book simply rubbed me the wrong way. The murder mystery is okay, not spectacular, and, more importantly, it is completely overshadowed by the sheer XENOPHOBIA this book is dripping with. This book is so saturated with xenophobic themes. At the same time, you get the feeling that Michael Crichton fancies himself as some kind of expert on Japanese culture and business practices. If it wasn't so irritating and misplaced, it would be kind of funny. Frankly, this book needs to come with a disclaimer: WARNING - EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE EXPECTING A MURDER MYSTERY, BE AWARE THAT IT IS SECONDARY TO BEING A FRONT FOR MICHAEL CRICHTON'S XENOPHOBIC VIEWS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got to hate it when history proves you wrong","review":"The author was in good company when he wrote the book. Unfortunately, for him, things did not turn out as he had predicted. The economic postulates of this book are quite obviously, flawed. The United States was not bought by Japan. If they were indeed fighting a war with us the \\"bomb\\" we hit them with was the dot.bomb. Of course that had nothing to do with the ten year decline that they have been experiencing. One wonders who will be to blame for the next round of economic malaise.As far as the story itself goes, it is well written and interesting. There are a number of plot twists and turns and the reader is kept guessing. The dialog was authentically vulagr. Overall not nearly as good as some of the author's other works but a fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A guilty pleasure","review":"\\"Rising Sun\\" is one of those books I hesitate to bring up in a casual conversation. It is dated, racist as hell, and unashamedly nationalistic. Having said that, it is a well written and exciting story. Although on an intellectual level I detest Crichton for writing this book, my hands couldn't put it down and I read through it all in one sitting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Read","review":"This novel was suspenseful, however, there was a lot of time spent on how the Japanese will destroy the American way of life. This concept is not terrible, except that the writer did not develop this theme deeply enough. Also, at times I felt that the writer rambled.A good read if you're looking for simple entertainment"},{"rating":"1","title":"engaging, but soggy and dated","review":"Crichton departs from his usual formula in \\"Rising Sun\\", and the changes are not good ones. Instead of casting his big-plan-gone-wrong plot in some arena of science - scientific history, scientific future, medicine, technology - he chooses politics. Perhaps the story worked when it was first written, but ten years later it comes off as reactionary and outdated.Worse, instead of focusing on the nuts-and-bolts action of his story, Crichton makes a foray into more emotional territory with a first-person narrative that includes multiple love interests and parenting issues. He fails, however, to make his character either a believable man or a believable Crichton hero.But the book is not a failure: Crichton does still succeed at what he's always been best at. \\"Rising Sun\\" is an entertaining, quick read with plenty of twists and turns. For readers seeking only a quick thrill, the book offers more than enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the movie","review":"I never thought I would say that, especially with a Crichton novel, but this one was really not as good as the movie. The plot wasn't as deep, the characters weren't as developed, the suspense wasn't as great. Perhaps I am just a bit off-set by the lack of science fiction, a staple in most of his novels. Perhaps I just found this story _too_ believable, and the characters _too_ real. In any regard, it was a great book, but not one of his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Homework Helper Challenge Mazes K-1","review":"I purchased this for my 5-year-old granddaughter.

As are the \\"The Rage\\" (precurser of Columbine High School?) and \\"The Long Walk,\\" which is a King horror story at its most basic. \\"Roadwork,\\" is not quite as good as the rest, but it is still worth a read.

The story I find the most disturbing is \\"Rage\\" which introduces the reader to a High School Loser and Geek named Charlie. One day Charlie has decided he has had enough and murders a teacher in cold blood. Perhaps King thinks that this is every High School nerd's Untimate Revenge Fantasy. If so I do feel sorry for the way that King views teenagers. Then the reader sees Charlie take a group of his clasmates as hostages and The Stockholm Syndrome Develops , namely the hostages begin to feel an empathy for their captor. The interchange between Charlie and the School Psychiatrist is very unbelievable and most certainly only a figment of King's imagination. After the tragic events that occurred at Columbine High School one begins to wonder if this book should even be on the shelves of your local bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOUR GREAT STORIES FROM BACHMAN AND KING!!!","review":"All the stories are great.

The Long Walk made you feel that you were there with the walkers, but the ending was a bit of a let down. Of course I didn't like the ending of Tolkein's Lord of the Ring either because I did not WANT the story to end. Road Work is an interesting tale. If you want to read some decent Stephen King read a collection of his short stories like The Bachman Books, Four Past Midnight, or Different Seasons. His recent novels sort of suck.

The stories range from ones about those who gave their lives to save others to those who did all they could and wish they could've done more. The author describes unlikely heroes - like those who help a wheelchair bound officemate out of the Twin Towers - as well as professionals who did their jobs with total selflessness - like the group of nurses who happened to be in DC for a conference and ended up working the triage unit at the Pentagon. If you only read one book about the events of September 11, it should be Heroes. It is a wonderful testimony to the human spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"This smells good (fresh and clean) and it does the job.

It's only saving grace is in fact the nearly 17 minute bonus track that was tacked on for the re-master release , but even that isn't enough to give it the nod of approval . Over all I was very dissapointed as I am with all of his studio releases . If you REALLY want to hear how talented this man is , then skip the studio releases and pick up his LIVE recordings ......There are three official \\" Frank Marino and Mahogany Rush \\" live albums and ALL of them are OUTSTANDING !!!

There was no change. After the next 7 days off, I didn't want to give up, but still was hesitant to increase the dose. But mid-way during the next 3 week cycle I upped it to twice a day- the recommended dose. Within a few days my night sweats almost completely vanished - and the few I've had have been mild.

I advise you to check with your doctor to make sure you can use the product. The low amount of progesterone in this product is safe for the majority of women. I hope you try it. I also use phytoestrogen from the same company for the same reasons. One half teaspoon rubbed once or twice a day to the soft skin of the arm or legs is recommended.

Alot of the \\"mysteries\\" are fairly obvious and you know who will be killed but there are some twists in the end.The story does move along and rarely drags. But it is never exciting enough where you can't put the book down. And it never pulls you into the PI's world. The writing style is a poor imitation of other detective novels.The novelty of the book is that the PI is a woman. But the way the book is written, it doesn't really add anything to the story.

I don't think V.I. is in the least like Kinsey Milhone, in fact, she is more like Sam Spade, and I appreciate her for it. The Warshawski novels get progressively better, with Killing Orders as the worst, for its hints of bigotry, and Guardian Angel as the best, for its humanity.

Little Joey Farr, Cathy Sharpe, Charlie Stewart, Lillian Briggs, The Uniques. etc. and a lot of sloppy, dopey novelty tunes, often with charmingly sub-par performances. Can't be beat. For some reason there are a bunch of prepubecent child artists on this one... Maybe there was a big vogue in paying to have your kid \\"cut\\" a record, back in the Elvis era. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hawkwind - 'Hawkwind Family Box' (Cleopatra) 4-CD","review":"Here's one I wasn't aware of until here recently.Basically,you get four(4)separate Cleopatra-label CD releases.They must've once again made their own special 4-CD box/holder as they've done in the past with other titles.Disc one:Hawkwind-'Psychedelic Warlords';disc two:Nik Turner-'Sphynx'(the 1993 re-recorded version),disc three-Nik Turner's 'Prophets Of Time' and Spiral Realms(Simon House's project)-'Solar Wind'.I remember purchasing each of these CD's separately.However,if you happen to be a new/er Hawkfan,this title is a REAL steal.See my review of each of these four discs.Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Elsewhere for Light Recipes","review":"I bought this book used and, after having read through it thoroughly, have come to the conclusion it would be overpriced at 50 cents. Almost every recipe calls for hard to find ingredients. Many are neither low fat nor low carb. A few recipes even call for deep frying. Unlike every other cookbook that provides nutritional information, this one gives the calorie/fat/carb counts for the entire recipe, not just a single serving.Also, the \\"witty anecdotes\\" from the author (which were one of the things I was really looking forward to) come across as very pompous and self-agrandizing. Mr. Giobbi finds fault with everything from the spelling of broccoli rab to the poor quality of chickens available in local stores.An absolute waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted writing style, no examples","review":"I don't think the other reviewers actually read this book. It is a very difficult read due to the authors' dry writing styles. Essentially it reads like a legal brief. When you get behind the verbiage, there's really not much there. A whole chapter was wasted on an XML tutorial that made little sense. There are also no real-world examples, despite mountains of code. The code examples only show what the language binding looks like in C++, no other languages, because the authors only know C++ (from their bios). Almost nothing about Java, perl, or the web in general was discussed. If you want a technical re-write of the specs and useless examples only in C++, you can get it out of this book. Otherwise wait until more books on the subject show up, preferrably written by experienced authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absence of java examples frustrating","review":"This book is basically Microsoft propaganda for their Biztalk.If you do MS Biztalk and use exclusively MS tools, this is your book.The soap spec in the appendix was the only useful part of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly detailed, but info stops about 1958","review":"Very very detailed on the history up to about the 1920's and then speeds up and skims over everything beyond that. Essential to the Victrola and 78RPM collector. Very scientific in its information and also includes quotes, interviews, and tons of information available nowhere else on mechanical/electrmechanical audio reproduction. Also covers in detail the introduction and development of 33/45 discs (titled \\"The War of the Speeds\\"). Stereo and the post-crystal/ceramic cartridge era is very minimal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely dry, sterile and boring.","review":"The first Tinfoil to Stereo contained many errors, but it was a fun book to read. This one was written presumably to correct the first one but in the process all the meat was removed leaving only unpalatable bone. To make matters worse the book ended in the mid 1950's leaving one with the feeling that the second half was missing.I collect phonographs for enjoyment and to have fun. This book induced thoughts of a totally sterile environment which abounded with facts sans enjoyment. If you found the previous sentence enjoyable, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for all ages","review":"Although the book was written for children, as an adult I found it very interesting.

This movie was the worst example of an instructional video I've ever seen. The two main characters were obviously straight porno \\"actresses\\" and not into each other at all. The entire video was dubbed over with annoying music, I'm sure, to mask out the direction by the male writer/producer/director. This movie is nothing more than a male FANTASY of what two women would do together. It is not even close to a true representation of one woman pleasuring another. It rates lower than a \\"B\\" movie - I'd rate it an \\"F\\". I gave it a one star because the system wouldn't let me give it zero stars (or negative 5)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"This movie doesn't make a lot of sense. The motivation of the principal actor remains completely unclear up to the very end of the movie. In addition, he looks more like a US Marine than a Native American.

I have not even had a chance to use them and they are all defective.

Handle is nicely \\"Knurled\\" to prevent slipping though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and Switch","review":"I ordered A Flash II but received a knife half the size advertised. It was small enough to be a key fob. I was charged the same amount as the knife that had been advertised so keeping it would have been ridiculous.

I received my refund but the experience left me leary of AMAZON \\"partners\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blade Did Not Open","review":"I obviously have a defective unit because the blade is locked down and will not open. The blade safety is off but the safety slider does not quite cycle as clean as it should, meaning it is stuck in the \\"safe\\" position. Also got a Trident from SOG to see which I like better and it opens fine.Quite surprised that a new knife from a \\"premium\\" manufacturer would arrive unable to open. You would think for the price they would at least have someone open and close each before packaging to make sure they work. Missing a small defect I could understand...but something so fundamental tells me quality control is grossly inadequate. What else did they miss?Mine is going back for good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Present for Dad","review":"My dad isn't a technology nut, nor a hardcore knife-guy, and he loves this thing. The easy-assist blade release is awesome, and your can lock it if there are kids around or you just want protection.Admittedly, for $40+, you'd think you'd get a slightly nice plastic shell. That's my only beef. It feels like a toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great knife for the price.","review":"For the price and blade quality, you can't beat this knife. It has a great edge. I'm not to crazy about the pocket clip being on the butt end of the handle but its a nice low profile so I can live. The handle is comfortable and thing. The blade is a little thin for my taste but that also helps with it being light weight. Overall I would recommend this knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Great","review":"I originally ordered a FlashI. It was okay, but just a little to small. The Flash II is awesome though. It is the perfect size, not giant, but by no means small. The price was also great, the SOG website sells it for a great deal more than what I paid here. I would def. recommend this knife to anyone who needs a knife for regular daily use."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great knife at a Great price !","review":"I have used and collected a number of knives over the years. I have to admit I am Totally Brutal to my knives and I find out quick if a knife is well made or not.In my honest opinion My SOG knives especially my Flash II knife is a great knife to have!These knives are well made and well designed with a great life time guarantee, Not too many knife companies give you a lifetime gaurantee and shapening too! No other knife company besides Cold Steel will give you more Bang For The Buck !I've Never Ever had a problem with any of my SOG knives and I'm sure you will find the same true too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasure to open","review":"I bought the Flash II from Amazon.com more than six months ago and enjoyed the folder very much. I use it as a mundane utility knife, but I can just sit there with a smile on my face and open the knife again and again.The sharpness was good out of the box. I torture the blade by opening envelops and cardboard boxes. The knife stayed sharp fairly long before needing a resharpening. (side note: all serrated knives will take longer between sharpening than straight edge just because serration gives more cutting surface)I like the Flash II over the Pentagon elite because F-II has a handle shape that helps prevent my hand from slipping onto the blade. I only gave four stars because the zytel handle does not feel solid. the handle does not have a metal inside. the whole handle is synthetic so may flex.SOG makes F-II very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't pay extra for shipping","review":"Don't pay extra for faster shipping.

I have had my flash 2 for about a year now and I absolutely love it. I have cut through copper wiring, used it as a flint striker, cut meat etc. and it had kept a razor edge through all of that. I did find that the locking mechanism for the spring assist system favors dry operation(opposed to oiled). In my experience, oil only helps hold pocket dirt and fine sand in the lock. 5 stars to SOG for another great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"This knife cuts very well after you sharpen it a little but has lasted about a month so far of continued use.

However, I will tell others to go find a different knife. There is one huge problem with this knife that makes all of the positive characteristics obsolete. While the blade is locked in the open position there is about a 1/4\\" amount of play. The movement in the blade is not side to side, but up and down or in a open and closed direction. The amount of movement has increased with time and I will be getting rid of this knife entirely. I don't think I will ever buy a SOG again because of this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree a very good knife","review":"I agree with the majority of these reviews. The open assist it great. The zytel handle took a little getting used to, but the reduction in weight makes it worth it. I have carried a Benchmade knife and this knife in my pocket.

I have practice opening it with only one hand.The clip works great. I have only tried this part out once and not on jeans.The price has gone up since I bought it last week.

One of the main features i was looking for when purchasing a knife was the spring assisted opening mechanism. This feature is very, very cool. I cant imagine purchasing another knife without spring assisted opening.I have had this knife for about two years, and no longer carry it on a day to day basis. This knife was a little bit bigger than expected. Especially living in California, i felt like i was carrying around an illegal blade... not only the blade length, or that the clip hides the knife, but the fact that it opens like a switch blade.The knife is very high quality, and is fun to use and play with. I can still kinda see the scar on my thumb from the first night i had it lol. Other than the size, my biggest gripe would be the look... i can tell its high quality, but it really does look kinda plasticy.

His best work comes when he is at his most inventive. For some reason he continues to suppress his progressive sensibilities, and most of this album suffers for it. Wetton's voice soars on songs like \\"Starless\\", \\"Thirty Years\\" and others where the structure is not so formulaeic. His voice rings flat on pop songs which weren't written to contain it. The exceptions are the two instrumentals (which should not stand out on an album showcasing the vocal talents of Wetton, \\"Arkangel\\", \\"Magazines\\", and a beautiful reworking of \\"Woman\\". If he needs to do pop songs, he should probably do what his other art-rock comrades do, and pick a bunch to covers that can stretch his talents, rather than try to write \\"cute\\" phrasings, and catchy choruses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't insult the Prince","review":"True Prince fans will find this CD as an insult to The Artist Formally Known as Prince. If you are going to do a tribute make it worth while. While most of the songs sound like 80's retro techno..only two songs save this CD. Adeva does a funky dance remake of 1999 and Rebecca Romin Stamos does a great (lesbian) version of Darling Nikki. The rest of the songs are truly a waste of time. There is no heart and soul in cuts like I Would Die For You, Pop Life, or Controversy. I do give a hand to Buddy Miles for his take on Baby I'm a Star. 3 out of 13 selections does not provide a real positive tribute. Next time get some real artist that can sing to real music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come, not as bad as everybody says","review":"I thought this was a fun album!

And of course they sound 80s...most of the tracks were recorded in the 80s or by 80s bands. So get over yourself, and succumb to the joys of a trashy remake of a Prince song into dancey New Wave. It's fun! Definitely a party album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Slap In The Face For Prince","review":"I am a Prince fan and I found this cd very insulting. When I see a band do covers I like them to add some originality to the song so it doesn't just sound like karaoke.But in this case the only good songs are the karaoke songs. The artists variations on Prince's songs are painful to listen to. The joke that Ice-T calls \\"Head\\" can only be described as a car crash with an angry pimp.It should not have happened. Rebecca Romijn Stamos' version of \\"Darling Nikki\\" is sexy,when you think about it,but when you hear it... Rebecca is so Tone Deaf and sedated sounding when she sings that she makes Fiona Apple sound like a caffine addict with perfect pitch!This is going to sound sexist but Rebecca Romijn Stamos is one woman who should be seen and NOT heard! If you are a Prince fan you should buy this album,unless you want to respect yourself in the morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Gary Numan doing a Prince song?

Old ideas without any sustantiality","review":"I read quite a few books on demographics and their effects on the economy and our financial structures. many different writers have explored the correaction with dj. dan just basically bases his entire (yet short with big fonts) book on this old idea and use simple data to justify his 'theory'. at the same time, he ignored other different factors and how they would play a role, minor or significant. yet at the end, he simplifies the dynamics of the world economy and made a simplistic prediction.I am not agruing the impact of demographics, and i also have similar concern. I would also throw out those simple ideas or facts in casual conversation. However, i would expect a lot more of thoughts, opinions, and proof from a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Dow Snap Back","review":"Although I agree with Mr. Arnold's ultimate conclusion and found his demographic research useful, it should be apparent now that the increase in the DJIA, which the author asserted \\"must happen,\\" has not materialized.Where has all the money gone? Another new bubble has been created- this time in real estate.I suggest digging your financial foxhole now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money","review":"You do not need an economics background to write a book like this but the ability to construct a logical argument or a knowledge of history would help. The author ignores even the most basic understanding of monetary supply, fractional reserve banking or GDP. An annoying book demonstrating the authors ignorance and little more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting theory but...","review":"This book is short and easy to read. The author has an interesting concept that the stock market follows the number of Americans at their peak buying age. His graphs and explanations on modifying factors make everything fit. I agree that some correction of our economy (inflation, recession, or worse) is likely in the future, but I feel other factors (energy issues, our national debt, terrorism, etc.) will come into play that he has not taken into account. I also don't agree with his investment suggestions and feel they may be reckless.If you're concerned about possible bad times ahead, this is one book that may helpful, but I better liked the reasoning and proposals on what to do in Stephen Leeb's bookThe Coming Economic Collapse: How You Can Thrive When Oil Costs 200 Dollars a Barrel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This \\"book\\", if you can call it that, is a waste of money. It would better be described as a pamphlet with a cover on it. Instead, I would recommend Harry S. Dent Jr.'s book, \\"The Next Great Bubble Boom.\\" Both come to the same conclusion that 2009 is the beginning of a bad economic downturn, but the Dent book provides much more rational detail as to what to do about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Forgotten Man","review":"The book is excellant and provides detailed perspective on how the 1929 depression was extended by the misguided policies of Hoover and FDR. As someone with the middle name of Delano, it sure dispells the myth that FDR is a great American hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing [short book]","review":"The author basically has only one theory to discuss in this [short book], and once presented in the most simplistic of terms, he does not feel the need to discuss it further. His theory is that the DJIA can be predicted based on the numbers of 45-54 year olds - \\"big spenders\\" as he calls them. When the numbers of this age group goes down, so will the economy. The rest of the book describes in overly dramatic terms (complete with excessive exclamation points and bold print) just how bad the depression will be when the numbers of this age group declines. The author predicts the worst depression in history will occur sometime after 2010 (when the numbers of \\"big spenders\\" will decrease significantly.) Then he throws in a paragraph or two about what to do before the depression (invest in stocks) and just prior to the depression (sell your house by 2010 and invest in Treasury bonds.) That's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool Cover, Fun Writing Style, No Actual Content","review":"I was drawn to the book because of it's fun approach to what are often dry subjects. What I found on the inside were a few good jokes and lot of shallow assumptions. I can't see a benefit to anyone that is seeking any sort of actual understanding of the issues discussed. This book will serve the truly dedicated that are seeking solely to reaffirm their faith, not to actually learn. If it were not for the humor in the book I would have given it one star. If you must buy the book, get the Kindle version, at least you will save a few dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poet Lady","review":"John Shore has knocked the walls down between here and There. A soliloquy by, ahem, GOD? It's crazy, it's totally pretentious, it's dangerous. It's wonderful!

It's inspiring to read Christian books that are funny and lively yet deep, as this one is.

I highly recommend to anyone who is non-Christian and wanting to learn more about Christianity or as a gift for a Christian to give a friend who wants to learn more about the faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"outdated","review":"Back in the 90's I would have found this book funny.

In fact, I spent this last year or so convinced that I was an atheist. Recently Istarted asking questions about my faith and why the people close to me were such strong believers and I was eventually directed to the works of John Shore. This book more specifically answered my questions and strengthened my faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"High marks for intense plot and scientific imagination","review":"_The Forge of God_ was an astoundingly good book. Bear writes science fiction much in the way Tom Clancy writes spy fiction: with rich descriptions and detail, and complicated plots that lead the reader through even the heftiest of volumes with ease. _The Forge of God_ relates the story of alien machines landing on Earth. Fortunately, Bear doesn't succumb to the basic \\"Good Earth people defeat the evil alien invaders\\" plotline; instead, the reader is left guessing as to just whom are the heroes and villains in the novel. It can get scientifically involved in places, especially when describing theoretical transportation modes based on quantum physics. Nevertheless, the characters were well-formed and realistic. As with all Bear's works (Blood Music, especially) _The Forge of God_ has a highly atypical ending that left me very satisfied and refreshed by its ingenuity"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sci-Fi","review":"I read this book on a suggestion. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. Great science backing up the fiction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and disturbing. Have read it again and again.","review":"One of my favorite books. Aliens stop by to visit, and we don't know why until it is WAAAY too late.

The technonogy combined with involved charitization create a mix which is challenging and enjoyable for any sci-fi fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow slow slow","review":"Oh my gosh this book is slow. I made it half way through then gave up. By then I had taken to skimming with short pauses to read when it got interesting. If you like fast-moving action then I can't recommend this book to you, at least not the first 200 pages. There are a few interesting developments in the first half of the book, but it's mostly extraneous description and dialog that do not advance the plot. Endless speculation about what might be happening. Long descriptions about characters that I don't care to read about. People talking on and on pointlessly. It's maddening because you want to know what's going on but that core part of the plot unfolds very very slowly. I read the back cover of the sequel, Anvil of Stars, so I know how Forge ends but I have now unfortunately lost any enthusiasm for these two books."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a critique of the text, but the presentation.","review":"After being told that I should read this series I decided to do so. I previewed this digital edition, and then purchased the full version. I'd noticed some grammar and punctuation problems with the text. Nothing major, but errors still. After a coup1e of chapters it became more obvious what these errors appeared to be: 0CR problems with similar characters being confused (B becomes 13, for example). Every chapter, every sub-chapter had some of these and they became increasingly annoying. It's as if either the publisher didn't bother proofing this before submitting it, or this was not submitted to Amazon by the actual publisher.If you're a pedant and/or don't appreciate lazy publishers, pass thi s one up and pick up the paper copy.A Note, three examples of the errors have been intentionally inserted into this review. If you spotted them immediately and/or they annoy you after you spotted them, get the paper copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Girly-men burst into tears as they await the apocalypse","review":"If you want to empathize with weepy girly-men as they await the apocalypse, this one's for you. This chick-lit story tells us all about every minor character's emotions, appearance, attitude and thoughts, even when they don't matter. Passive, helpless men burst into tears at the slightest excuse. Characters are acted upon, rather than act to survive. The aliens are never shown and their machines are harmless. There is no attempt by humanity to survive. Everyone just sits around singing hymns, pontificating and looking at the scenery. The suspense at the start of the novel promising so much is squandered in meandering and meaningless plot twists, none of which goes anywhere. If you are one of those who want to slip into the skin of decent, strong characters striving to survive in a world gone mad, then trySisters of Glassor early Jack Vance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodbye, Earth!","review":"There are a number of books that deal with the topic of how humans will face the future once there is definitive proof that \\"we are not alone.\\" In The Forge Of God, Earthlings don't get much time to mull this over.Space transports suddenly appear on the planet. The entities that emerge from these transports are not identical, and carry different messages, of hope or utter destruction. Who do you believe?Contrary to the Star Wars-type planet busters, planetary destruction is not a simple process. Greg Bear plots out a process and mechanism for this. Are we that powerless? Are others that powerful?In The Forge of God, readers are introduced to The Law, which is a major part of the sequel to this story,Anvil of Stars. I didn't even know the book had a sequel, and that discovery was pleasant. The Forge Of God itself reads as a complete, independent story.Enjoyable as a story, not as a prediction of the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good hard SF, fast-paced and intelligent","review":"An enjoyable read, hard to put down.

The likeness is of an exhausted, emaciated Elijah Wood. At first glance, he looks rather odd because his neck is a little longer than it should be, but then that's because the head is hinged so that his chin can almost rest on his chest; nice touch for posing him in Sam's arms. He comes with a sound base that resembles a small island in the lava flow from Mount Doom. There are pegs which fit the holes in his feet and he stands very well. But I was disappointed that he only has one quote, albeit a good one - 'I'm glad that you're with me, Samwise Gamgee, here at the end of all things' - and he's still wearing the one Ring around his neck. Still, I purchased both of the M.D. hobbits and as they do look just terrific together, I'm happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best.","review":"Kent continues to produce great adventure, history, and unforgettable characters in this 14th installment of the Bolitho series.

It didn't do this (try reading Fever 1793, a fictionalized account of the yellow fever epidemic for this) but it did provide an excellent historical account of yellow fever and the attempt to deal with it. The book sometimes rambled, giving the history of where people were born and such, that was not important to the historical accuracy of the book but it was not annoying enough to make me stop reading. This is not a light read - I have no medical background and struggled with some of the terminology but found it a compelling account.

Since they had the model down, why not simply move the school to another location, appealing to a Bill Gates - a Bill Cosby, Sidney Poitier, Oprah, Steve Jobs, etc. - to help set it up somewhere else?

The clock did not change over.Tech support for the company is weak. The company did not respond to emails. We called them and left a message on an answer machine.

Explanations are not well stated and example problems don't help when you get to the homework.

I doesn't explain concepts in a way that makes chemistry seem exciting; it attempts instead to couple chemical concepts with various human contexts (e.g., \\"Properties of Gases -- and The Air That We Breathe\\"...it's like this for every chapter). There are no given pathways to external sources to learn more about a concept. All deep connections chemistry has to other subjects (and to the world in general) are lost.The only good thing about this book so far has been the fact that concepts and terms are clearly found in the page margins.Overall, this text book is pretty bad.

I will buy the DVD. However, it all had a \\"been there/done that\\" vibe to it. The Enya selections sounded like Enya's arrangements, \\"Theme From Harry's Game\\" sounded like Clannad, and all the arrangements sounded like reprised Riverdance. Those aren't bad things, of course; the ladies and their voices/playing are lovely and the chorus and musicians are excellent. It just sounded to me like 5 new performers doing Enya, Maire Brennan/Clannad, Katie McMahon/Anuna, Eileen McMaster/Carol Lavelle, etc. They most certainly did it well. For me, \\"There's A Place For Us\\" (exquisite) and \\"You Raise Me Up\\" were more exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Lip Sync","review":"As many others have commented the bad lip syncing just makes it seem so...well, fake.

I want to see performers singing a song not pretending to sing a song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comments on the Celtic Woman DVD & CD.","review":"IF YOU LOVE GOOD MUSIC YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH THESE GREAT ENTERTAINERS!

That being said however, I have to say that this is one of the most boring, vapid, souless performances I have ever seen!It was almost like Celtic Muzak! And they even had the nerve to take one of the Divine Sarah's songs, Nella Fantasia, which she convinced the composer to allow her to turn into a song, and take all the passion and pathos that Sarah's voice brings to it and turn it into a real yawner!It was kind of like watching a group of lovely robots with perfect voices sing.The only song I even came close to liking is You Raise Me Up, which seems to be the only song that is sung with any feeling!"},{"rating":"1","title":"way overrated.","review":"I watched this and found it to be way overrated and you could tell it was all lip-synced."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the......??","review":"like listen to singing robot, no matter how different, every song just like the others. singing like spring rewind clock tunes, so mechanic and so deadly mindless."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Subtitles/Closed-Captioning","review":"I saw Celtic Woman on PBS which was closed-captioned.

The visual was amazing! I saw a portion of it on PBS and decided to purchase it so I could see it in it's entirety. My 6 yr old daughter loves it too and is always singing the songs. We also bought the cd to hear those angelic voices in the car. I would definitely recommend it especially if you enjoy Enya and the like. I am not a music critic,just a regular person who found this DVD performance to be quite enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best New Group in Years","review":"I was fortunate enough to catch part of them on PBS late one night. While enjoyable (even through a 4\\" TV speaker) I was too sleepy to catch it all. When I heard they were coming to Seattle, I decided that would be a nice thing to take my wife too. I have never been more right. The beautiful clarity of their voices and the tones which lift ones spirit were amazing. I felt like I was listening to the voices of angels or at least a group of 4 female vocalists each with natural talent surpassing Celine Dion. We bought the first CD we could find.Ignore the criticisms of the few musical snobs on here that don't appreciate beautiful sounds. I love everything from traditional Celtic to New Age to Classic and this music merges some of the best from all those genre's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful performance.","review":"Celtic Woman is absolutely mesmerizing.It's not a show for hardcore Celtic music fans, who might not appreciate the stylized sets and lush orchestration. Rather, it seems aimed at those whose introduction to Celtic music was in Riverdance.Any fan of any type of music will be amazed at the voices of the featured vocalists. They effortlessly glide through vocal ranges that make you think, \\"This is what angels must sound like.\\" The songs run the range from soothing to haunting, with some lively moments in between.Despite the polish, Celtic rythms and melodies are at the core of the entire show. This may introduce many more people to Celtic music. Hopefully, it will make them want to hear more.I bought both the CD and the DVD. While the music stands on its own, it is GREATLY enhanced by the visuals of the show. That, in no small part, is due to the fact that all of these women are absolutely beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the fiddle player gets 5 start!","review":"I hate having to give this excellent DVD 4 starts, but I just want to hear more of that fiddle player then it gets 5 for sure.While I ilike all the girls voices, it's when they perform together that the magic really happens, and when the fiddle player starts to play those fast reels I just wanted to dance around the room. And I'm 53 so that's quite something. My wife thinks I have gone mad. My Irish roots was long lost but now I feel like going back to Ireland again and reliving it.Also trying to find if the fiddle player has a solo album but doesn't seem to be one on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celtic woman- a gift for the trained ear","review":"It is rare to hear such superbly trained voices! This CD soothes the trained ear that longs to hear quality singers. The music is fun, enchanting, haunting, inspiring... it will surely delight your soul. If your ears are weary of listening to dime-a-dozen vocals you will want to restore your faith in current talent by listening to this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angelic Voices","review":"This was worth every penny. M��av and Lisa's vocals stand out the most to me. 15 Year old Chloe has a great clarity to her voice, but her voice can seem thin at times. Great traditional Irish music, and modern music. M��ir��ad Nesbitt soars on fiddle just as she did in Maichael Flately's \\"Lord Of The Dance\\" and \\"Feet of Flames\\". I totally recommend you see the DVD and then get the CD for the music. If you are a fan of angelic voices and celtic music then you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality of course...","review":"How could it not be!

When my Mother passed away 3-25-06-Those were chosen to be played at the closing of the service. The words and music was very soothing and beautifully done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs for creativity","review":"As an insomniac, I was flipping through my television one night and caught the middle of the PBS special featuring these artists and songs. I was so swept up in the songs that I immediately got onto Amazon.com and ordered it for myself.I have been thrilled with the songs and often use the CD while I'm painting and drawing.

It is truly a treat for the ears. the only thing that is a slight dissapointment, is that they did not include one of the songs from the concert, which was one of my favorites. My favorite song on the CD is Nella Fantasia, sung by Chloe Agnew who is all of 15, and has a voice like an angel. I also really loved the voices of Lisa Kelly, and Orla Fallon, who also plays the harp beautifully.I recommened this CD to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celtic Woman Review","review":"I really enjoy this CD for three reasons. One, it is exactly the music I so much loved hearing on KCTV one evening, which is where I first heard about Celtic Woman. Second, the harmony and voices are so skilled, clear and generally joyous. Third, the instruments played are many, and give me a real sense of being there with everyone while they created the music.

I purchased the CD of just the music and was disappointed that not all of the music from the show was indluded on it.

A joy to watch over and over or to just play as music while working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I love this DVD. I was so impressed with Lisa Kelly's singing (especially \\"May it be\\" that I went on line and ordered her CD from Ireland(the one she talks about in her interview, titled \\"lisa\\"). I checked with Amazon but they did not have it. They have a CD titled Lisa kelly, but it is not the same Lisa.I watch parts of this DVD almost every evening, right after dinner and the news.

As I watched the women sing I thought something wasn't right. That's when I realized they are lip-synching! Why pay for a dvd to watch woman mouth along to the cd? Might as well just get the cd.

I was not overly impressed. 80% of the songs on this album have an orchestal accompanyment rather than a celtic one. \\"May It Be\\" is nicely done in celtic musical style, but the rest of this album is forgetable. TRUE celtic music can easily be found elsewhere, and if you are looking for it here, like me you will be sorely disappointed. The magical music of Secret Garden or Yanni makes Celtic Woman look amateurish and very cheesy by comparison. Sorry, these babes just don't do it for me. Worthy of 2 stars, and that's being generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Celtic...New Age at best!","review":"I agree with the last reviewer. This is tripe. Sickly sweet voices and over produced, with every bit of character ironed out of these songs. This rendition of Siuil a run is pretty sounding, but you don't get any feel for the loss or sorrow expressed in such a set of words...it just sounds like a \\"muzak\\" version to me.Pity...some of the women DO have good voices...but they are just so \\"soulless\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good representation of Celtic music.","review":"If you're looking for ambient music, buy this. It is not Celtic music, at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"PBS scores!","review":"This CD is an excellent example of why some of us have stopped contributing to PBS. Why do I bother to review something I find so irrelevant? Only because the term \\"classical\\" is used by the Amazon reviewer and others. There is nothing remotely approaching classical music in this compilation of dental office Muzak; no potential buyer should be conned into thinking there's classical music here. Even Lawrence Welk would have been ashamed to put his name on drivel like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the a capella Somewhere?","review":"I was listening to a pledge drive-rendition of this show in the background while working on the computer, and was all of a sudden rivted by the four-part a capella harmony on Bernstein's \\"Somewhere\\". Wow! Concert? I will go! I went to buy the recording, but that number is not present. Huh?? I listened to the rest of the show, and I would say 75% of it is powerless elevator music. Sigh. I would spend much money to go listen for hours to these women sing spot-on harmony like that on Somewhere, despite the lack of open throat. There was so much could have done here. I just don't understand it. Who picked this music? Who picked what was to be included on the CD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stays with you","review":"Days after listening to this CD I can hear their voices in my mind. They have a rare gift for song. Not just the simple emoting of words but that rare conjunction of harmony and spirit.Each could stand alone as a master of her craft, but together they synergize into something more. A fusion of styles centered around the Celtic tradition. Though the word \\"Celtic\\" fails to do their genre justice because they expand far beyond that boundary.While those looking for traditional Celtic music may not find what they are looking for here, anyone who enjoys classically performed music should find something to love.And if you have an eclectic love of many styles then at least try out the samples. There is a good chance they have something to offer you.All I truly know is that I love listening to the music, and I love the way their voices stay with me. I hope you enjoy this music as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music presentation","review":"Celtic Woman, is such a beautiful and quiet concert of music.

Music is very important to me because I am a trained vocalist. This dvd shows almost no difference between the vocalist and the musicians which is rare and unique.I personally enjoyed the style and freedom of espression given to the musicans. They have the privildge to gift to us the style of song that was before now handed down by generations, from grandmother to granddaughter or son. It is a wonderful gift of tradition, old world story telling, and newer music we are all familiar with. The arrangements are beautiful and insightful and full of the celtic color and flair. I would recommend it to any parent who has a child in a orchestra program or who has any interest in music. It gives a unique view of expression with the violin that is awesome. All the arrangements are well done and easy to listen to and enjoy. A must have for any celtic in spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing - Music from Across the Sea","review":"Heard this at my sister's in Dublin recently.

My personal favorite was You Raise Me Up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lip-Synching Galore","review":"After watching this DVD several times, I am disgusted at how pre-recorded this concert really was. These women don't even sing on this DVD, they lip synch more than any other artist that I've seen. Even Britney Spears attempts at least ONE live song, as horrible as it may sound.These women take the marketable Celtic concept and deliver a DVD that rips off customers. Yes, the music is beautiful and ethereal; no dispute there. But if you're going to put on a concert, sing the songs live to your audience. I hope these women can really sing in the first place and were just suffering from acid reflux.I give this DVD one star because of the money I paid for being ripped off with lip-synched vocals and pre-recorded performances. These \\"Celtic\\" women should be ashamed of themselves. Absolutely ridiculous. I saw something similar to this on Saturday Night Live a few months ago with Ashley Simpson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Live or pre-recorded?","review":"I have watched the \\"Celtic Woman\\" DVD concert several times and I have very serious reservations about the singer's vocals actually being live. It certainly seems that they are actually lip-synching to pre-recorded tracks. Observe carefully, and you will see there are many times when the sound of the voices do not match the gesticulations of the singers' lips and mouths. This would explain the lack of animation on part of the singers, and also the artificial, melodramatic tone of their facial expressions as they 'sing'. It's a total misrepresentation, and a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harmony with voices of angels !","review":"I bought this CD after watch the Celtic Women perform on stage.

Chloe Agnew start the concert a beautiful young lady only 15 years old at the time set in motion a singing event that the heavens themselves stood still to listen to. The full orchestra that played while these lady's sang gave a sound that put the angels in heaven on notice that you can be replaced.

You can tell when the cameras zoom into where the bow is sliding in the wrong directions along the strings. If the microphone had been turned on, it would have picked up nothing but screeches. It seemed that her role there was to provide flashy displays of flailing hair.I like Enya's music and performance. I might have liked \\"Celtic Woman\\" a little better had I not seen this \\"concert\\", but just heard it. But then, what I would hear are diluted versions of the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Lip Syncing.","review":"There are no real performances here. Pretty ladies standing there not actually singing. Kinda boring. Music is fine if you like Celtic Yanni, but there's no reason to watch as there is no actual singing.

Fake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vegas on the River Shannon","review":"I bought the DVD. Individually, they are very good, perhaps even great. But the concert didn't work. Visually it was awful. Too flashy. Think of Danny Boy. A song invoking fraternal love between rural lads and fear of parting by violent death, sung by women in glitzy dresses on a Vegas-style stage? Come on! When they sing, they don't seem to know what to do with themselves so they kind of wobble around. The cameraman-ship was 2nd rate. Audience pan shots reveal a lot of folks sitting on their hands. Closeups get too close. The blond fiddler played great but the very regular swooshing of her long hair seemed too affected, especially when playing slow pieces. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid and saccharine","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewers who point out (rightly) that this is not Celtic music, and that the performances are weak and uninspired. The PBS show was mildly entertaining for a few minutes, but it became obvious quickly that these interpretations of traditional music are more \\"lite commercial pop\\" than anything else. The derivation from Flatley's shows was obvious. Also I agree that PBS has so diluted its offerings in fine arts with this, Andre Rieu, Andrea Bocelli, Charlotte Church, and other \\"pseudo-classical\\" performances that it is deeply disappointing.Instead of this drivel, go for music with real substance, including really traditional Celtic music (without the soft haze of easy listenin') and the enormous treasure of art music (renaissance, baroque, classical, etc.) which reward repeated listening with new discoveries. Other reviewers have made fine suggestions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dull and cheesy","review":"As a big fan of Enya, Lorenna McKennitt and other celts, I was very dissappointed with this CD. These women's voice have no depth or character, they sound like 12 year-old boys. Doing covers without adding anything new or intersting is a waste of money. Especially the cheesy remake of Orinoco Flow. I was very let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavenly","review":"This CD costantly holds your attention it has a mix of rhythms and is lifted by heaenly voices.

As a fan of REAL Celtic music (Chieftains, Altan, et al.) I too find this an amazingly bland performance. The vocals are uneven - Lisa Kelly's voice, for instance, is pleasant and warm enough, but Chloe Agnew, who seems to be touted on this CD as a headliner, is no Charlotte Church - her teenage voice is thin and tentative. The orchestral arrangements are at times sappy and overblown, sounding like \\"Riverdance Lite\\". Some of the instrumental work is competent, like Orla Fallon's harp and Mairead Nesbitt's fiddle, but it's not like I haven't heard better elsewhere. My overall impression is this was an assemblage of pretty faces whose primary purpose seems to be to create another popular PBS pledge-drive special. Pardon me if I offended anyone - if this happens to be your cup of Irish tea, please indulge. As for me, I'm going to put on an Altan CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!!!!!","review":"Wonderful, fresh voices combined with skill and talent.

What an experience! Being the driver, I couldn't see the concert, but didn't need to because it can stand alone as a wonderful experience without any visuals.

This is the first book I have read of this author. I chose this one because it is supposed to be one of the best.

In this case, she seems to have veered too far in the other direction. Outlaw's characters are well-developed. The plot is convincing, fairly suspensful, and bolstered by excellent research- another of Johnson's trademarks. But, while the love scenes didn't lack for sweet, they certainly lacked spice. Also, the ending was unnervingly abrupt. After setting up a complex political intrigue full of legal traps, Johnson unravels it all in just a few pages. I'd love to see Johnson find a happy medium between this and some of her steamier, sexier work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evil man not of god","review":"Mike Murdock is not a doctor of anything except deceit.

Just like three decades ago, I finished the movie depressed about the human condition. Let's hope some of the bizarre practices have died out since then; however, I did read where the Cargo Cult in the Southwest Pacific is still around. This is a great movie for Boomers. Younger people may not believe anything they see because it's too different from Hollywood's view of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just for shock value","review":"I saw this movie when I was in high school - it was bad then and it is even worse now that we all know the scenes were manipulated for their shock value. Taken out of context, many practices would \\"shock\\" those not of that particular culture. Rather than explaining things in a cultural context, as a true documentary would do, this movie (it's NOT a documentary) merely exploits and enlarges xenophobic tendencies.If you decide to watch this anyway, be sure you do not have children around. It would traumatize many - it traumatized adults when I watched it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Think Other People's Customs Are Strange, Take A Look At Your Own","review":"Very amusing time capsule of various cultural practices as captured in snapshot views in the early 1960s, delivered in a bemused fashion which now comes across as having a campy and retro appeal. The deft juxtaposition of scenes from Asia, New Guinea, Western Europe and the U.S. is clearly meant to challenge you to recognize that ALL cultures have practices that are bizarre or ridiculous, including the supposedly 'advanced' nations.Due to increased travel and the general level of 'cultural sophistication', most of these depictions will be quite a bit less surprising now than they were at the time of the film's release, but with the heightened awareness of the idea of animal rights in recent years, the scenes of violent animal slaughter will probably be viewed by many as more shocking and politically unacceptable today than they were 45 years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the faint of heart","review":"I saw this movie back in 1967 and was grossed out at the vile things that were done to animals.

Let me just say at the outset, I was so disgusted physically at certain points that I did almost stop watching. But, I persisted, hoping to find some redeeming qualities in the film. Sadly, there were none to be found. It is pure exploitation of violence and mildly prurient material against a backdrop of badly patched together scenes and no overarching theme.It jumps from subject to subject, and many of the scenes would be laughable if they weren't so maddeningly inferior. The only thing I've seen that gave me a similar feeling to this is clips from the show Bumfights. Being a horror movie fan I don't often sit in judgment on things like this, but in this case I'll make an exception.

If you've never believed in the power of music, Gary Jonas' <i>One Way Ticket to Mighnight</i> will make you a believer. This is a frightening yet redemptive story that makes you believe in and care about a seemingly unlovely hero in Roy Porter.Everyone battles a sense of chaos in their lives, only Jonas has made it larger and more dangerous than life. Roy and Jim battle through personal as well as mystical demons in order to find their peace.It's fast pace and colorful characters also make it for an engrossing read, so don't start reading it without making sure you have plenty of time to finish it. You won't regret the time spent with this book or this author.

There's the slow blues (\\"Falling Tears\\", \\"Mean Ole Blues\\") that Dawkins is a master of, but he also does well on up-tempo songs like the Magic Sam-style \\"Mid Nite Boogie\\". There is also a very fast instrumental, \\"Kotten Field Jump\\", a style of song that Dawkins has used many times before.Once again, Jimmy Dawkins comes up with another fine CD to add to his fairly large discography.

The videos show good science, that is, science being done properly from the initial question or questions, to conclusions drawn from the available data. This often leads to additional questions, but that is the nature of science. Older kids love these videos! The videos make science more real to them and they get to see the scientific process occurring on topics that are in the news and impacting their lives.

It was strange to watch, because I felt like I was watching a student film project which attempted to use a series of dramatic devices and failed. I think that the director must have been a fan of David Lynch, because there were some things that were reminiscent of his movies-- doppelgangers, blue and red lighting, and pale brunettes. But the movie is basically a logical sequence of events, not a Lynchian dream-trance, and the stylistic execution is not effective.The main reason to watch this movie is the plot.

Her favorite word is fu**, and she loves to exude this with physical traits...if you get my drift. Avoid this.

The best scenes are when Lindsey is onstage."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a Reach","review":"There have been so many movies and TV series produced in the last decade or so that feature the brutal murders of young women, it's difficult for any of them to come up with a novel twist. This movie goes out on a limb trying to reach for some new solution. You have to suspend your disbelief somewhat and be tolerant of some loose ends and muddle in order to buy what's happened here. But the basic idea raises some interesting questions.This movie also tries to distinguish itself with a couple of protracted pole-dancing scenes. These scenes would have been even more protracted but for some sensible use of the cutting room floor. If you are holding a bachelor party, you might want to check out the complete erotic dance sequence in the DVD bonus materials. Otherwise, the amount of terpsichore and torture that are left in the film, tip it dangerously close to exploitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow. It was that bad.","review":"Hmmm. Where to start... I love B-rate movies and I love me some Lohan, but I don't think I could have ever anticipated how bad this was. It deserved every Razzy it got.

Lindsay Lohan, from MEAN GIRLS and CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE DRAMA QUEEN and HERBIE and JUST MY LUCK. Here, we have her doing a more dramatic role. Dramatic in this case means she gets to pole dance and say the 'F' word a lot. I see nothing wrong with doing more adult roles, but come on, Lindsay, read the stinking script first before you accept a part. I just wonder what they could have done to make this film worse than it is. Even if seeing Lindsay Lohan less than fully dressed is your idea of worthwhile viewing, I say pass. She doesn't look that good in this film. Even tortured and mutilated, I couldn't feel sorry or really care about her character(s). The film moved slowly, was poorly photographed in dim light and at times was incoherent. I would not even recommend this for a one time rental. In conclusion, I hope Lindsay gets better parts and her career picks up. I like her. She doesn't need to do this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must Like Lindsey Lohan","review":"First of all, don't even touch this film unless you are already biased and are smitten with Lindsey. With that said, the film is not total crap but definetly not good. The violent parts are really unnessary but there is a hot sex scene. Really, the best thing about this dvd lies in the bonus features section. There is an extended strip scene that is worth the cost of the disc itself (especially if you buy it used like I did). Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unintentionally HIGHlarious!","review":"I gave this movie one star for being messed up and a train wreck.

This movie has the story line quality of a mystery novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What??","review":"I know who killed my Sunday night...About two thirds into the movie my boyfriend and I are trying to figure out if this was some kind of joke. EVERYTHING about the film towards the end (the 'twist', the cheesy horror music, the acting - and yes that does get worse, etc) is so thrown together and amazingly awful that any merit the first hour could have given the movie is shot. It was like the director ran out of money and just threw together something so he could technically have a movie. I don't even want to try to understand the point of this film or if there was any artistic value in it. I basically think the point was for Lohan to parade around on stage doing a number much resembling Britney Spear's Gimme More video and people would pay to watch it because she was in it. Obviously I am disappointed because it did begin with much promise. I am just amazed somebody thought this was okay to release to the public."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Advice: Skip It","review":"I was in the mood for a little Lifetime movie last night and this was on. My advice for anyone in that boat: Don't waste your time on this one. It is a stinker. Lindsay Lohan used to be a cute, kind of fun actress in her younger days, and from watching this, I can't even imagine what's happened to her. This is one ugly film. It doesn't make any sense, the acting and writing is drivel at best, the movie is really dark and disgusting with very little redemptive value as to the time spent watching it. I admit, I didn't finish watching it, but I am so glad I had better judgement and turned it off-I watched enough to realize that this movie is just a gross, bad way to spend any amount of time. Some Lifetime movies are mindless entertainment to while a way an hour or two in bliss while eating a few snacks and having tea or whatever, but this one should be avoided as being one of the stupidest movies made-even for the Lifetime network's standard of movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"mixed feelings","review":"This movie had a great premise, and the story itself was unique and interesting. With the right screenplay, the story would have really shone. However, some parts of the story were rather flimsy, and the ending... meh. If the story was significantly adjusted in some parts, then the movie would have stood a serious chance. As it is now... no.

It's absolutely ridiculous with huge plot holes you could drive a truck through, but I managed to stick with it to the perplexing ending! Quite gory for this type a film with lots of bloody dismemberment scenes and has quite a few totally unnecessary (Lohan) strip pole sequences, so obviously put there to keep guys from falling asleep.....it doesn't work!

Second of all,this movie showed me one thing, be carefull who you trust with your kids or with yourself. Third of all, watching this movie made me decide to find a movie where MEN are tortured for a change. If there's a movie like that, I'll find it and rent it. I love women. I think violence against women is overused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever?","review":"I saw this movie in theaters, expecting something scary, or at the very least, interesting. I used to be a Lindsay Lohan fan, despite the tabloids. After this movie, however, I can't be a fan. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Seriously, out of every movie I have ever watched in my life this was the biggest waste of time. Guys might like it because she does a stripper dance, but I was thoroughly unimpressed and disappointed. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch, what a confusing mess and this in high-def","review":"I wanted to like it but I gave up. The story is confusing and the director seems to think that changing colors from one scene to the next would look interesting - it doesn't. Miss Lohan isn't a bad actress I think but this role was just plain awful for her. And I don't only mean the second part where she is kind of handicapped. And by the way: It is not really an erotic movie. And I mention this as a guy.The higher resolution and clarity of colors make this movie actually worse than it would have been on a somewhat blurry standard definition DVD. I don't really know what else to say about this movie - let's just forget about it and watch the next one, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked it till the end","review":"I was not expecting this movie to be fantastic going into it. I am not a Lindsay Lohan fan. I bought it as an impulse buy at the store mainly for a good laugh. I put the movie in and to my surprise I actually was enjoying the movie. The acting was way better then I thought and seemed to have a decent story to go along with it... that is till the end. Now, I am not going to give this away but they ending was horrible. I am normally not the type of person to dislike a movie if it is not realistic, I mean it is a movie, but this movie's ending (last 30-40 minutes) was just so retarded it made me have a very strong distaste for the whole movie. On a side note, the alternate ending was I feel a better way to end it."},{"rating":"1","title":"She should have stuck to the high school act","review":"I might have enjoyed this movie if they would have picked someone other than Lindsey Lohan to play the lead role.

You can't sit back and just let a movie take place in your head. The many characters in small town Sicily weave their own straw into what will become a complex basket of a tale, but it's slow in coming. I wasn't trying to force memorize who was whom or who had said what prior; I just read each chapter and enjoyed the descriptions. Eventually the story becomes gripping.It's not the novel you can't put down in the first half. Rather, you can put it down and attend to life, and the more you return to it, the less long you can leave it on the table. The last quarter is where details start to spill and the secrets are revealed.There is so much of Italy, of Sicily, in the book that you do feel as though you just got off the plane from there, as if you just read a book in Italian, even after reading this English version."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Know These People And Don't Like Them","review":"I had to take two breaks from this book but kept returning. What I both liked and disliked about it is its Italianness. I loved that it felt authentic to its core and I liked the writing. I recognized the people from my own family and by their resemblance to friends who were born in Italy. This is not an American Italian story, it is Italian through and through. There is a lot of old world petty intrigue, hysteria, machismo, ignorance, manipulation, insinuation, stiffling class and gender boundaries, a touch of politics (but of course). Reading this book reminded me how much I disliked my uncles Vito and Sal. Glad I read it, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"I had such hopes for this book based on all the wonderful reviews. I am giving it two stars only because the cover design is so pretty. The author creates a main character (deceased) who is purely unlikeable for the first half of the book. She describes repeatedly how unlikeable she was from the perspective of each person of the small Sicilian town. Talk about beating a dead horse. Simply torturous reading. The family that the dead person worked for is also mostly unlikeable. More torturous reading. The second half of the book perks up a bit with a few intersting plot turns and creative plot line but still, I could NOT wait to finish this book so the pain would be over.I have to be honest, the book even squashed my desire to visit Sicily."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Almond Picker","review":"A beautifully written story that weaves together the mysterious, intriguing and tragic life circumstances of an intelligent, resourceful maid with her mostly doubtful, if not malicious small-town, Italian society.Hornby masterfully balances culture and history with a swift-moving plot and memorable characters to create a winning work of art. An important lesson that she brings home is guarding against judging others. This is a must-read for historical novel lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly orgazmic electric acid jazz.....","review":"This cd made me want to rip my clothes off and go completely insane to the muzac.

None of the remixes or unreleased tracks are especially stunning. They even omitted the cool vocals remixes of songs like Dimentia 66. As the subtitle suggests, however, this album would make a decent soundtrack for a strip club. Otherwise, it offers nothing new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad remixes of thier dullest material","review":"Typical retro glam tripe that made me stop listening to them after \\"13 Above The Night.\\" They've lost their way and explains why they've lost band members.

It is a very good primer on the history of San Francisco and The Peninsula. I thought at times it went into more detail than I was interested in knowing, but then, that's what it claims to do. A very interesting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another one of LeBaron's different grips","review":"I'm a hardline fan of LeBaron's works. Her 'Rana, Ritual and Revelations' is one of my favorite \\"new music\\" discs. This one keeps as high standards in the places where she instruments the pieces herself. Those who like the RRR album will also like tracks 1,7-9.The poetic blues/jazz tracks (2-5) is a little issue by itself, at first it didn't really sit too well with me, cos it's not really my bag that much, even though musically the performances in these songs are classy. But after some listenings I did get some clue and found something that I could relate to.However, that said, they still bothers me a little bit and I have that sense that they are quite different from the other pieces, yet I understand I'm not supposed to pick them out as they are enclosed within the whole theme of the set.The last piece is a beautiful work which reminds a little bit of a lyrical Zeena Parkins."},{"rating":"1","title":"90's new agey bollucks.","review":"While there is a lot of very good history in this book, within the first 10 pages, Padfield delivers his hypothesis on Heinrich Himmler. The man was the way he was because he wasnt breast fed. 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"I attempted to read this book several years ago and found it to be utter rubbish!! This book is worthy of the \\"National Enquirer\\" as opposed to a serious biography of Heinrich Himmler. Himmler is a subject worthy of a biography for his infamous career but Padfield's work is so full of inaccuracies on so many levels I tossed the book in the trash after the first few chapters it was so bad.A better but not nearly as lengthy biography can be found in Heinz Hoehne's \\"The Order of the Deaths Head.\\" This book however is nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"boring","review":"They were normal men and women, who lived in a very contentious time in Germany and did the wrong thing. They were not \\"evil\\", they did things that were evil. Just as bad things happen to good people, good people do BAD things.Himmler was not \\"evil\\", he believed in Hitler. What he did was evil, and he, as he should be, is held by most of the civilized world as a criminal.The deeper I went into this book, the more unbelievable I found it to be. It is amazing that people still write from a Marxist perspective, that capital is the primary motive of history. According to this book, it was the landed Junkers vs the Capitalist industialist that led the NAZI's into war and policy formation. The deeper I got into the book, the less I cared for what was being presented, and the more I wanted a biography on Himmler and less of a preaching of Marxist theory on world history!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very interesting subject as seen by a rather difficult to read author.","review":"Upfront, I have to admit that I did enjoy this thoroughly researched book. This biography has a lot of information not only on its subject (Himmler) but on Germans, Nazism in power, \\"the final solution\\", and the other leading characters of the Nazi regime, as well. Some sentences, indeed, full passages, are rather abstruse. There is a widespread use of speculation by the author regarding Himmler's motivations and actions. Mr. Padfield also engages into detailed psychoanalysis, mainly regarding Himmler, without being clear how qualified he might be on this field. Overall, this book is worth reading if you are truly interested in this historical period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of work put in, and fairly readable","review":"Padfield succeeded in writing a comprehensive biography of the number two person of Nazi Germany - both in terms of power and influence and in terms of damage done. This is no mean achievement, and putting Himmlers life story into the context of the political and military events worked quite well overall. However, the book keeps you asking for more detail on some topics, like the presumed occultist affiliations of Himmler and other Nazi functionaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent & comprehensive collection of articles surveying the current state of workflow and business process implementation","review":"I was particularly glad to see Chris Lawrence's paper on 'Integrated Function and Workflow', as I have program-managed a number of business change initiatives based on the integrated process architecture he describes. I can certainly testify to its power to transform business operations. The paper is an extract from his book 'Make work make sense' (Future Managers 2005) which explains the architecture and its potential in much greater depth, and which is available from ergonology@iafrica.com.Another paper which caught my eye was Arnaud Bezancon's 'Workflow and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)', maybe because it supported my hunch that SOA and workflow are completely complementary and not rival approaches."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Hello,\\" said the creature.","review":"I was delighted to rediscover this book when cleaning out my parents' house. It had gotten lost, somehow, in moving from childhood to adulthood and I had honestly nearly forgotten about it.Almost, but not quite. Henderson is a wonderful writer whose short stories bring to mind the best prose of Clifford D. Simak or Theodore Sturgeon. In the end, I discovered that I had not forgotten a word. The worlds of Zenna Henderson are not necessarily happy worlds. There is sweetness, and there is often resolution of a kind. But the sweetness is often bittersweet, and the resolution is not always exactly what a reader might hope or expect.Recommended for any reader who likes intelligent speculative fiction. Should be suitable for all ages.

This book is a refreshing honest approach to looking at yourself and improving how you go about making changes that are right for you. It is filled with great examples that we can all relate to. Hats off to Lassiter for a great job!

What a little gem of a book. Davenport explores a narrow band of post-war social strata in New York and provides the reader with a rare and poignant glimpse into an aspect of society surely not missed in the freedoms of present day. Almost more satisfying than the struggles of the core characters - who in the span of a week see themselves anew, or are willing to see themselves for the first time - are the sense impressions provided in large doses of a New York City long forgotten, the sights and smells, the behavior patterns, the ways of life that have broken down and evolved over the past 50 years. If you love New York and its social history, you will truly enjoy this glimpse into its past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"Very good, is the best that has been made of Elmyr de Hory.

The poems are delightful reading - so well written you don't even notice the craftsmanship. That is from me, extremely high praise. What truly sets these poems apart, however, is the quiet wisdom that permeates them - to paraphrase an example \\"the hell of thinking only what one already knows\\". The poems emphasize our interelateness and make us laugh at our foibles. All this in humourous poems. What else could you ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars, but one hundred are few","review":"I love Oumou Sangare. Every time her Wassoulou music come out from my CD player I begin a travel inside the African universe, across the Mali region. Everything is beautiful: the sharp sound of kamelngoni, the soft support to melodie of violin, the counterpoint of the choir, the delicate strenght of percussions. But nothing can be compared to the Oumou's voice. To listen her is to love her. In that voice there is all the deep charm, the fresh sensuality, the strong soul of african women.This CD is a miracle, born from the encounter between Oumou and the genius of Nick Gold's World Circuit label (who of you knows Nick only for Buena Vista Social Club?). Is the first Oumou's CD, wich sold 200.000 copies only in Africa. You can imagine the African people, without money for eating, doing the queue for buying their music and dream. Buy this CD, and then buy the second and the third of this lady. Five stars, but one hundred are few."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grind me a pound!","review":"Rich, deep, and mellow -- Oumou Sangare's voice is like a premium cup of coffee. Interestingly enough, coffee was once used to stimulate monks to prayer by some brilliant Coptic abbott. Similarly, Sangare's music has a contemplative quality to it.The music is simple enough: a basslike instrument, the low rumble of a drum, a higher violin-pitched instrument, and the firm ruler of them all, that is, Sangare's voice. The simplicity, the insistence of the rhythms, and the repetitive qualities of the music make it nearly trance-inducing.This is beautiful music."},{"rating":"1","title":"lonesome dove series","review":"An excelent set of dvds but the sleeve that they were in was a bit tight for me to get the dvds out without splitting the sleeve"},{"rating":"2","title":"Titled so approriately!","review":"My first love exerience with classical music was in a second year English composition class.

Not knowing how accurate historically it is, nonetheless, it makes for great and most enjoyable reading.Smetana certainly was passionate about music, his country, friends and family.

The rhythms are smooth and powerful and make you want to move. I find it perfect for when I'm programming. Two of the songs (Blue Lights and Dream of God) feature the lead singer from Ravenous.

No such luck. First of all, this clock has a microchip in it that sets it by time zone and is 100% NOT atomic. I know this because on those rare occasions when it did have the ability to have the time even remotely correlate to the real world time, it would change to daylight savings time before my atomic clocks would. The clock is essentially garbage after less than one year of ownership. It does not keep the correct time, it is not atomic and it makes a loud noise as it attempts to reset itself pretty much every hour. I suggest that La Crossee keep on making tweezers and stay away from clocks. One of the worst purchases I ever made. It's not even right once a day.

It didn't sync up right a way but the following morning it was perfect to the second (as compared to other digital atomic clocks we have in the house). All the hands are aligned perfectly.If I had to complain about something it would be the size of the \\"La Crosse Technology\\" and \\"Radio Controlled\\" printed on the face.

Hawaii is not in one of the four official time zones the clock services. One more reason, perhaps, why we should secede from the US.

They said they would repair the faulty clock, but refused to pay for shipping (their claims is the the minute hand could have shifted in shipping --- since the hands are balanced in the spindle, this possibility is highly unlikely).Since Lacrosse clearly has manufacturing issues (other customers report similar misalignment issues), and has poor customer service, you might want to look at a different manufacturer.

Euro Star George Hilton dons a cape and hams it up as Jurek, a horror movie director who is auditioning for his next film at his mansion and selects four teens to join him for dinner and horror film. As part of an Italian television series called 'BRIVIDO GIALLO', this is by far the weakest entry I have seen. Director Lamberto Bava and screenwriter Dardano Sachetti painfully put their actors through a lame outing filled with vampire jokes and Halloween theme park shenanigans. Horror fans definitely deserve better. Its no fault of Mya Communication, the transfer is crisp and clear and can be viewed in both English or Italian.

Each song is so beautiful, it brings one to tears. This surpasses the \\"It's Time\\" Album, only, in that one, they also have the matching sheet music to go with it. I cant wait till the matching sheet music comes for \\"Its No Secret Anymore\\". I have all of Frank Wildhorns sheet music on musicals and enjoy playing them daily on the piano. Its even better to play the music on the piano and play the matching cd at the same time listening to the beautiful voice of Eder."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE LINDA EDER! Linda is AMAZING","review":"This is the first Linda Eder CD I have and I can not stop listening to it. Her voice is wonderful, and and range is amazing. I recommend this CD to everyone. She has one of the most beautiful voices in the world. She has become my all time favorite singer. If you want to hear great music by the most amazing singer BUY THIS CD! You won't regret it! She is awesome. I hope one day I'll be able to see her in concert!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this stuff???","review":"I have been folowing Linda Eder since she was with Paul Todd (another incredible talent) in the early 80's doing the night club act.Back then that girl could sing! I have a cassette that she and Paul Todd did together. The songs Mr. Wildhorn writes for her are nothing like the songs she and Todd wrote back then. I will say that vocally she is still a million steps above todays talent like Britney or Christina. Highlights on the new cd is the ballad Vienna, and the song This Time Around, which is one of those catchy songs you feel like you've known for years and can listen too 100 times and never get tierd of it. All in all she will never put out anything as good as her earliest stuff. But if you want to hear a huge set of pipes, Linda Eder will definitely not disappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have to buy one, buy this one!","review":"I've been devouring Linda Eder's \\"It's Time\\" and \\"No Secret\\" since hearing her on NPR. \\"No Secret\\" is by far the better of the two. Being a singer I really appreciate her ability to deliver a song but what really makes this album are the arrangements and great musicians, Linda included. If you love the big band sound, updated, and great vocals this album HAS to be part of your collection. You won't miss and it'd make a super gift, too.PS - Eder is so phenomenal on CD that I've been stunned to see her in concert a few times now and with great disappointment each time. I'm sure she's great in a role on stage on Broadway, but connecting to the audience to her fans seems beyond her. She can learn this, she's a professional, and until that happens I won't waste that kind of money again - I'd much rather buy her albums. Her husband's arrangements are wonderful. Great team!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing....","review":"The title line says it all. Linda has such a breathtaking voice, and can easily put life into any song she songs, with seemingly no effort. The orchestrations on the album are incredible, and there's a healthy mix of ballads, jazzy, bluesy, and swing pieces. If you've got her self-titled album, the remake of Vienna is alone worth the cost of this. Just a stunning, stunning work. Brava Linda!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its No Secret Anymore","review":"I discovered this artist a few years back and have continued to be impressed by her massive talent as I have added each new CD to my collection. She is indeed a singers, singer. We have not had a talent like Linda Eder in our mist for many years. \\"Linda's style is classic, harkening back to an era when the music scene was populated by talents like Ella Fitzgerald and Judy Garland.\\" Her voice is electrifying, she can whisper a lyric, conspiratorially drawing you in. She can hit a pure tone and hold it forever. She can do it all. It is not often I am so impressed by an artist that I want to sit down and tell others about my experiece, but if you enjoy music and fine artistry you should own this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"LINDA SHINES","review":"NOT ENOUGH STARS TO RATE THIS ONE PROPERLY ORCHESTRATION IS EXCEPTIONAL, AND LINDA ENTERTAINS WITH SUPERB VOICE AND INTERPRETATION OF LYRIC.

I miss her softer side, which was at its best in the \\"And So Much More\\" album. Most of \\"It's No Secret Anymore\\" sounds like a really loud Las Vegas revue that Pia Zadora would do, albeit with a better voice.

I love, love Linda Eder so anything she sings is great for me!It's No Secret Anymore. I am working on collecting all of her CDs. It's amazing to me that many people are not aware of who she is.

Her latest album \\"Now\\"Nowis spectacular, I constantly listen to Linda Eder even during the holidays.Linda Eder - Christmas Stays the Same"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can ROSIE make this woman more famous? As she should be!","review":"Now that Rosie O'Donnell has 'discovered' Linda, perhaps she will reach the height of popularity she deserves. This album has highs and lows as the other reviews point out but her voice is the draw, regardless of the songs she sings. EVEN NOW, THIS TIME AROUND, YOU NEVER REMIND ME.....they're all good but it is VIENNA that has endured. I was first given her self-titled album 10 years ago. It is hard to believe she is only just getting broad recognition. And have you noticed....she's also getting more beautiful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner","review":"Linda Eder's voice, Jack Murphy's Lyric, and Frank Wildhorn's Music are a combination that I believe to be very lethal. They totally rock, anyone who says differently is smoking something. Move over Andrew Lloyd, make way for Frank and Jack. And since I have been a fan of Linda's for over 12 years, I believe that gives me the right to say so.

This CD takes you there with the same playlist, the same piano and a host of Polish performers who play their countryman Chopin's and other composers to perfection. This is a must-have CD for anyone who loves Chopin's music and other music of the Romantic Era. It represents some of the finest, even if not the best known, pieces written by Chopin and those pieces chosen by Chopin himself for his concert. For example, Chopin's Sonata for Cello and Piano in G Minor, B 160, Opus 65, Largo Movement is hauntingly beautiful and not often included in collections of Chopin's music. I know of no other Chopin CD that captures Chopin in his own time as well as this one and this concert in 1848, just a year prior to his death, speaks volumes for this great composer and his world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do It Yourselfer","review":"When opening the shipping box, the multiple pieces had all come loose from their holders and lay rattling in the bottom of their box; spent a few minutes figuring out where the pieces should go and then couldn't figure a good way to hang it on my peg board and ended up stuffing it in my toolbox.Finally, the day came when I was going to tackle a job which required 4 screws to be installed in an almost 180 degree orientation from me - the whole reason I purchased this tool. (1) The multiple pieces fell out of the tool when I was using it inside a confined space - 30 minutes wasted in finding all of the pieces. (2) The locking mechanism for the tool bits needs to be pulled back to lock but trying to drive a screw in requires forward pressure which unlocks the attachment (3) The locking mechanism for the flexible shaft unlocked randomly on its own accord.Finally I gave up and used a thumb screwdriver to do the job; what an incredible waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading tittle","review":"The Chronicles as presented by Penguin is nothing but a selection, something that cant be implied from the title.

G, his fourth solo album, was supposed to arrive in 1999, but the cool reception to \\"Nothin to Somethin\\" took him back into the studio. Let's hope the retooling brings him a hit because this album deserves it. Gerald's music has deepened over time, and ballads \\"She Done Been,\\" \\"Second Time Around,\\" \\"Baby You Are\\" and \\"Misery\\" are first-rate soul, echoing at times the best work of Womack & Womack (think of Teddy Pendergrass' \\"Love TKO\\"). The first three songs pair him with Darrell Allamby, producer of a choppy contemporary sound, but even these cuts fit with the rest of the album, which Levert co-wrote and produced. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"G stands for Grrrreat!","review":"I, as many Gerald Levert fans, had been anxiously awaiting the arrival of this CD since early November. So when March 7th finally arrived, I ran and got the CD. I was a little nervous as I ripped the packaging open, but when I heard the first verse of \\"Application\\", I knew I was in for a treat. I listened to all 13 songs with a smile on my face. Some I like better than others of course as with any artist. But I can honestly say this is a CD you can push play and not have to worry about forwarding through. My faves are Application, Nothin to Somethin, It Hurts to Stay (an excellent duet with Kelly Price), She Done Been, Second Time Around, and Misery. A true pleasure for all fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wise Buy","review":"I purchased this book after viewing one of the child educators copy in my office. After reading a few tips...

A spends its day in socialization, grooming and foraging activities. In the wild, one half of a birds waking hours can be spent in foraging. A captive bird often has limited socialization activities, spends time excessively grooming and has little opportunity for foraging. This often leads to behavior problems. The DVD's goal is to provide ideas and methods of increasing foraging opportunities. The dialog is clear, the ideas good and the video presentation well done. Dr. Echols uses Missy, a cockatoo, as the subjects of these activities. It is very helpful to see a bird foraging.The DVD is presented in four chapters with some extras. The doctor's commentary extra is very good. The information presented is interesting and goes to make a case for foraging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video","review":"Great foraging video. Came very quickly. Good quality and my parrot loves it. Helps with plucking and other destructive behaviour in birds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parrot Foraging","review":"Excellent start for introducing the idea and supplying ideas for creating a foraging environment for your parrot. Parrots forage daily in the wild and its our responsibility as owners to provide the necessary enrichment for our FIDS (Feathered Kids). Parrots are smart (I swear sometimes smarter than I am) and they need puzzles and toys to keep them busy and entertained. Also it allows for the parrot to MOVE, instead of becoming perch potatoes and getting obese because their heads are always in a food bowl. Its much healthier to use their heads and feet to look for and figure out how to get food ... just as they would in the wild."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept - poorly executed","review":"I really had high expectations for this book. I was looking for something that would provide an alternative to the PPRK-based \\"Ultimate Palm Robot\\" book. And this book does provide what appears to be a workable, if not very robust robot design that you can wirelessly link your Palm or WinCE PDA to. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the book is cut-and-paste data sheets - including some of the marketeering hype. This makes for a very disjointed read since the style of the book changes with each new data sheet and many concepts and terms are not explained well. As a result, this would probably be a difficult book for someone new to robotics. I'm still not sure that the schematic for the robot in this book was worth $20 - $30. I would suggest \\"Programming and Customizing the OOPIC Controller\\" by Dennis Clark as an alternative to this book. The OOPIC is easy to work with and the chapter describing interfacing the OOPIC to a Palm device is very well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes no sense.","review":"I had high expectations for this book, assuming that it would start out slow, with basic information, then pick up from there. This is far from the truth. The book slams you from the sixth page (literally) with seemingly irrelevant information about computer architecture, accompanied with confusing diagrams. As all of the other reviewers mentioned, the book is littered with a copied mismatch of pictures and diagrams. The book does not follow a logical thought process, nor is any of the information practical. Unless you have a BSCmpE, don't buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie, but where are the subtitles?","review":"This review is not to give you details about the film, although the film is wonderful and much can be said about it. The purpose of this review is to warn buyers that this particular DVD does not contain subtitles. I rented this movie about a decade ago (I believe it was on DVD), and it contained subtitles. If you are not fluent in French and Spanish, then I would avoid buying this DVD. Thankfully, I understand Spanish pretty well and can pick up a little French, but I missed quite a bit of the dialogue due to the fact that French was spoken in a good number of the scenes. I still enjoyed the film without the subtitles, but for the price of the DVD, they should have been included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tango Terrible","review":"Truly awful movie. I went to see it with a bunch of friends and we burst into hysterical laughter the moment we stepped out of the cinema. This pretentious one-woman ego fest was hard to swallow - Sally Porter acts, directs, dances and even sings, and does not improve the odds of making a good movie one bit by covering all fields possible. If she could play the cello she probably would have (thankfully Yo-yo Ma does the job beautifully). Strangely enough, the wanton lack of talent/ability did not prevent her from attempting any of the above. A painful experience. Attempt watching it only with your mother-in-law or bank manager, the world has enough suffering as it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: This film contains self-indulgence","review":"Other than dance, I never expect much artistry from a dance movie. This movie failed to deliver even that. I was particularly disappointed as a long-time devotee of Argentine tango who was hoping to see great dancing. Aside from a tap dance sequence by Pablo Ver��n, the dance was pedestrian at best. The plot was trivial if not disjointed; the editing seemed random; the acting was amateurish as was the cinematography. In short this self-indulgent film, which I understand was produced to fulfill the fantasies of the principles, has little to offer the general public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, average artistically, good dancing scenes","review":"After hearing so much rave, I was rather disappointed when I finally got the opportunity to see it. The story line is thin and moves painfully slow. Artistically, the film is okay, but nothing breathtaking. However if you are a dance enthusiast, it is worth seeing at least once. If you are thinking of buying the soundtrack, don't bother; without the dancing to go along with the music, you won't be able to hold your attention long enough to listen to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tango traumas....Whining, kwetching, farbissoner..oy vey...","review":"Bought the music first, lovely, delightful, enchanting...then I saw the film. Oy...some people just don't have a gift for passion, don't have the skills to enjoythe poetry of dance. Kwetching (bitter complaining...for my goy readers...) is not true emotion, it's a psychological disorder...Can you imagine her stepping onto the floor of Tango dance boite...what gloom, what sour discontent would suddenly infect the place...People would be packing up, suddenly realizing theyhave to call their dentist for their semi-annual root canal operation. Otherwise is fascinating exercise in adult onset adolescent self-indulgence..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Pompous Piece Of Crap!","review":"The dancing was probably the ONLY watchable thing about this film -- and even that was disappointing compared to some other films. My gawd!To me, this is the worst kind of film -- one that assumes it's a work of art simply because it has all the trappings of film-as-art. Yes, it's beautifully photographed, it's in black and white, it makes use of visual allegories, it LOOKS like it has profound meaning to go with the dance and the music. But, ultimately this movie is nothing more than an empty exercise in self-indulgence, dressed up an art film. I did not care about the characters, I did not care about their relationship, and eventually I can tell that the director/actress does not care about the audience.Moreover, this film ultimately lacks the depth and tension of the dance around which it supposedly surrounds itself. Tango is a tease, it has drama, it's audacious, it's hot -- precisely what this film is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice tango...bad story","review":"This film was so disappointing. I love tango. And Buenos Aires. If it wasn't for both of these elements in the film...it would get no stars. Sally Potter is so self indulgent. The story is so discredible....that we are supposed to believe this young guy has a romantic attachment to her?! Perhaps if she had cast a younger female for the lead role this may have been more believeable. The actual 'plot' was so weak...nothing happens in the whole film except she learns tango and wrecks my head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your Money!!!","review":"If you're one of those who likes to see 'artsy' films for the sake of conversation, by all means check this oddball out. If, however, you want to watch a movie to be entertained or to appreciate Tango, be advised: This movie absolutely sucked. Potter was uninspiring and passionless, her love interest was self-centered and whiny, and what was up with the legless midget shooting horrific looking models in the color shots??? In a word, the whole thing was terrible. Even the Tango wasn't very good in this one (primarily as it was usually Potter dancing, and she obviously needs some more practice!)...the one redeeming factor was the music, which was outstanding. Particularly moving was Yo-Yo Ma's Libertango. Do yourself a favor...buy the CD, skip the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 minutes of good dancing","review":"Only one interesting dance scene - the Libertango.

There are some very memorable scenes, I saw the movie a few days ago in IFC, but they still linger inside my head. The farewell scene at the airport would be a classic, as well as the 3-on-1 dance at the warehouse. I have to give Sally Potter an A+ for her effort as a tango dancer. Overall, I enjoyed this movie, it gave me a good 100 minutes of entertainment. On a scale of 1-10, I'll give it a 7.5.

I also have a problem with adding liquid smoke to recipes as a couple in this book have, it seems to have a chemical aftertaste. The game recipes are scant with only one for venison.

He is particularly fond of the Mozart and Handel discs. The stories are interesting to the kids, and they put the classical music selections into new context for me as well. I actually hope the characterizations of the composers are fairly realistic--especially as Handel appears to have been quite the angel in the lives of many orphaned children.The Tchaikovsky disc is fine, but, somehow, not anyone's favorite.I agree with my son on the magnificence of the Handel disc, but I also really enjoy the medieval tone of the Unicorn disc, which doesn't really appeal to my little boy, though he'll listen to it if I tell him it is my turn to choose.Make no mistake--these are narrated stories with classical selections woven into the stories as a rich accompaniment.

And the rainbow means \\"I love you.\\" It has nothing to do with the rest of the story.

I would definitely recommend reading a different Heyer mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"the duckdown movement iz still precise !!!!1","review":"as any hiphop critc,fan, and pioneer should know duckdown records was one of the first independent labels and its been on and poppin since 1993 they are similar to the wu-tang clan because of there varius styles and sean price is exactly what im talkin bout he's been spittin fire since his heltah skeltah days wit rockness monster and this mix cd iz worth buyin ita just le-way for his hot album monkeybarz which iz a 4-star album if you know about the duckdown movement then you'll definetly luv the album!!!1 peace all praises due to allah"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Nike Shoe As Usual!","review":"I don't know why the picture is now showing a pair of pants because these are navy and silver Nike Shox.I got these for my son because he always chooses Nike.As usual,these are great quality,great value and ultra modern style.This is the best price I could find on Shox which are usually much more.We'll keep coming back to Nike again and again.These run true to size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"In Search of Permits\\"","review":"Clifford does a good job of alternating between the story of Captain Kidd and his own search for Kidd's flagship. But far too much of the book is dedicated to a long, boring rendition of Clifford's dealings with the local authorities, his rival ship hunter and the resulting phone calls and meetings required to secure permits for the excavation of the ship. Over 90 percent of the modern portion of the book reads like: \\"Then I called the President's daughter. Then she called me back. Then we met with the minister of the Interior. He told us to come back the next day. So I rode a bike around the island. The next day we called the President's daughter again....\\" The politics is simply filler so that he wouldn't be selling a 50 page book.

The overall effect is to add brilliant color to a prized black-and-white photo. Not only are you left with a deeper understanding of wartime espionage but a respectful regard for the diplomatic corps at that period. Who could believe that an amateur servant, with the right impulse, and appropriate acting bravadoes, could upset several continents, and get his just desserts? Or did he? This was an engrossing read, a combination treasure-hunt for clues weighed against fact that is hard to put down. 50 years later the WWII victor, USA, chooses to believe the documents presented before Congress by its internal security watchdogs. Go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"the cicero spy affair","review":"I was interested more in the actual actions that concentrated on Cicero.

It provides a safe place for him to sleep there or on the floor. During our military move, we 'camped' in our house after our furniture shipped and before it arrived on the other end. The baby had the best bed in the house. At hotels this was great because I knew the baby wouldn't touch the yucky/germy sides of a hotel crib and the smaller size has the feel of his bassinet. I packed in in his suitcase for the airplane! We take it over to friends and family homes for safe naps.

I bought this item because we travel a lot and have a newborn. Our pack & play is awesome, but hard to get around everywhere. We used this Eddie Bauer Infant travel bed last weekend and we loved it!

I touches topics from when you first find our that he's leaving to if he doesn't come back to reunions. The author relates a lot of the topics to her own experience when he husband was called for Operation Deserst Storm with only 2 hours notice. There is also an eitire chapter that gives a bunch of useful resources. The book is written in a way that is is useful for whichever spouse is at home, or if both are deployed, or if you are a single parent. By no means can this replace the support group of other wives, but it sure helps you understand what is going on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"I found this book hard to follow. It was unclear to me who the audience was, it switched back and fourth between talking to children, spouses and servicemen.

When working with short hair I prefer to have a gel that is less thick and slightly more malleable. This gel is really rough to work with when you're trying to achieve any kind of a messy look. It's perfect if you have super short hair that will all be going in one direction, and you don't need to add any creativity to the matter. But if you have slightly longer hair, and you want to play with it--this gel is quite bad for that. For super tight spikes this works, for essentially anything else--it doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thrilla In Manila","review":"The Thrilla in Manila occurred when I was just 16 years old. I used to be a student in a prestigious school in Manila. I was able to go around with my friends and watch Ali jog and run every morning at around five a.m. The book of Mark Kram really got me interested because I'm proud to be a Filipino.That the Greatest fight was held in my country and also that he was able to portray the human side of Ali and Frazier. Its different for others to even fathom what really happened during the fight.Kram really wrote the Ali that he knew and idolized all his life, writing in SI, in Esquire,in Playboy magazines, I read as much as I can about Ali and I praise the words that Mark Kram used in the book, he surpassed himself this time. I bow my hat to Mr Kram. Are there any great writers around like him? I hardly think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chilla in Manila","review":"If you're expecting a Muhammad Ali or Joe Frazier hagiography, look elsewhere. \\"Ghosts of Manila\\" is a brutally honest portrait of the legendary 1975 fight and its chilling aftermath. While examining the bitter rivalry between Ali and Frazier, author Mark Kram reaches an unavoidable conclusion: Boxing destroys lives and tortures souls. When Ali says \\"We went to Manila as champions . . . and came back as old men,\\" he understates the impact of that historic bout. For both fighters, it was a near-death experience. One of the finest sports books ever written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"As a enthusiastic boxing fan, I was excited about reading a detailed account of probably the greatest heavyweight bout in modern boxing history. What I got was a writer who no-doubt has a very high opionion of his grasp of the english language. He certianly wasted no opportunity to remind to reader of it. In the end, his sophomoric writing style ruined an excellent opportunity to shed light on one of the greatest rivalries between two human beings. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Thrilla","review":"This book was a major disappointment. If books could be returned for a full refund because of disappointment with the contents, then I would immediately return this one. I liked the title and I am a fan of both Ali and Frazier and I was interested in reading more about their great third fight. Plenty is written about Ali, but I was interested in reading and learning more about Frazier. Well, 90% is about Ali and race. 6% is about Frazier and only 4% is about the fights themselves, including the third fight that the book is based on! This book could have been a short magazine article, instead it is needlessly expanded. I only finished this book because I paid full price for it and I knew that I couldn't get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written.","review":"The editor of this book did not do his or her homework. It almost seems like a first draft written while the author was aloft on booze. The pages are filled with multisyllabic words, and grand sentences that if picked apart are not grammatically correct and often are meaningless. More significantly, when you plow through the prose all the reader discovers is that Ali has been aggrandized and Frazier is bitter at how Ali portrayed him. Is this news? At the end there is a section about a seldom heard about lover/wife of Ali which revealed a bit more about Ali's past than I'd known, but overall this was not a very well written or informative book. I bought it because I remembered the article Kram had written after the Manila fight for SI. That article was great. This book is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRASH!","review":"Poor Mark Kram... so lonely at the bottom. A mediocre writer (at best) writer, writing about an amazing man -- and coming up with, predictably, nothing but his own mediocre opinions. PASS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy read","review":"I read this book after watching the Manila fight on ESPN Classic. Don't be fooled (as I was initially) by the book's size; while not the tome I was expecting, it had more than enough information and definitely held my attention.On the negative side I did find the editing to be subpar in some places which at times made the text difficult to discern. This is especially annoying because much of the book is written in a Sports Illustrated coulmn style. But overall the pace was quick and fluid.I was impressed that the author was able to debunk the Ali myth while still acknowledging Ali's talent as a fighter. Contrary to one of the other reviewers here, Kram did NOT see the Manila as just another fight. In fact, he made it plain to the reader that both Ali-Frazier I and III brought out the best(and worst) in both men and rank as the some of boxings greatest moments.Whatever your personal feelings of Ali and Frazier you won't regret reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"the author is bitter and biased","review":"The reader will get the sense that the author Mark Kram is bitter and filled with contempt. He shrewdly attempts to downgrade Ali's essence simply because of his hidden racist ideologies. Don't buy it, there are many amazing books on Muhammad Ali, written by people who can absorb what Ali emanates and can put that into writing. But this one should be forgotten. He claims that Ali is NOT a hero because he hasn't done anything worthy of that title. So to read an entire book from an author who has no understanding of what makes a human being larger than life is a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best books ever, regardless of genre","review":"\\"Ghosts of Manila,\\" is an absolute masterpiece. Not only does Kram deconstruct the Ali myth, he humanizes him. He also treats Joe Frazier in a way no one else has. Warts and all, Frazier emerges as a man of great dignity if not always dignified. This book has influenced my own writing. It is full of poetic and writerly sentences; it is not only an almanac of boxing but also a one-of-a kind view into the Black Muslims, Ali's hidden self and secret child, and the foolish self-serving antics of American journalsist and would-be pundits who swallowed the Ali jive whole. Kram is a truth-teller and like an oracle unfolds the ravages of time that turn idols into dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fit the bill","review":"For the price, this set is great.

The brush fell apart on the first use (nails fell out) and rusted in one week. The drop cloth was too thin and flimsy to be at all useful, and the thread in the large roller handle is so worn after painting 3 rooms that it can no longer be used with an extension pole (by contrast, a roller bought 5 years ago and used with heavier primer still sits tightly on the extension pole). The only items I can still use out of this kit after 3 rooms is the pan (for which I bought pan liners separately) and the smaller roll (used lightly)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Organized","review":"Useful on different levels - I like the timeline presentation, but his sayings are organized by type, too.

The book's two strong points are its sense of atmosphere and the character of the detective. Its drawbacks are (1) the murder method is extremely dubious--cyanide does NOT kill instantly with the victim making no sound, (2) the chief female character, supposedly a mature woman, acts in such an adolescent manner as to engender a desire to kick her rather than any sympathy and (3) the solution is more or less sprung on the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Undistinguished Effort","review":"As the previous review notes, the publisher of the series in which this book appears is on a mission to reprint long-forgotten mysteries. This one should have stayed forgotten.Specifically, the characters are undeveloped, the method of killing is both unlikely and scientifically dubious, the denoument is sprung with little advance support and the chief female, instead of being sympathetic, acts in such an adolescent fashion as to make one want to smack her."},{"rating":"1","title":"You won't find this on my \\"Regional Book\\" shelf","review":"Here's what the jacket says: \\"Dan Fortune, the one-armed private detective of the Edgar Allan Poe Award-winning Michael Collins novels ... returns with his most provocative, brilliantly realized adventure to date.\\" Well, I don't know about that.

It seems as if the career bureaucrats at the DOE purposely make the process as confusing and annoying as possible. As far as getting through that system, this book offers little of value. Instead, it offers good details on the various schools which will complement what you find online. Some of the detail in this book is what I would call \\"scuttlebutt\\" but it is valuable information nonetheless.The organization of the book is fairly logical- by borough and by school. Some of the discussion on Middle Schools in general is quite valuable. The price is high, but to be expected for a book of this type with a very narrow readership.

I use them in my bedroom. They do exactly what they say they will. No liquid collects on them or leaves rings of discoloration. The dragonfly is lovely. It looks like watercolor painted on porous stone rather than printed on. I would be proud to give these as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very excited to order these for my new home, however when I recieved them, I was disappointed in the print on the coasters. The colors dont come through much and it looks more like a dark smear of color. You really have to study it to see the dragonfly and the colors are very bland...nothing like the vivid colors/contrast represented in the pictures here.On a more positive note, the size is very nice and the materials used for absorption are very effective. If you want highly functional products, this is for you. However, if you want something pretty, choose a different set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swede-O Ankle Lok Lace-up Ankle Brace","review":"Super fast shipping - received within 2 days.

I am impressed and appreciative!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ankle support","review":"I use this brace to support my ankle during everyday use and it does a great job. You need to pay close attention to the instructions on how to lace it up and make sure your foot is flat on the floor when lacing it up. when sizing, if you are right on the line between two sizes you will probably want to go with the smaller unit as the goal is to make it tight. I do not use the inserts unless I'm in pretty intense activities or sports. I've got the black one, but I'm also going to order this same brace in white to wear with white shoes and socks."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice COMPACT case","review":"very nice compact case for my sony handycam, my wife can easily put it in her purse or in the diaper bag, other bigger cases you have to carry them on your shoulder which might be a problem if you have little kids and you need an extra arm, despite being compact I was able to place the camcorder, extra battery, USP cable, extra memory card and the digital camera inside the case easily, I've been using it for almost 2 years now and this case proved to be durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This is a good basic immunology book.

They have 16 tracks but only a hand full of decent tracks.

First, it's a reality check; it spares no details describing what's come to be nearly unavoidable in modern political life -- basically, all-encompassing pettiness, insincerity, and generally undignified behavior. Second, it's a heart-warming philosophical journey with the author. You get to know her and see how she's formed her opinions of the forces that shaped her life. In the end, she reassures us by arguing that journalistic integrity can survive the \\"politics\\" of politics."},{"rating":"1","title":"a sad and boring read","review":"I guess that I was disappointed. I had heard that this book was the posthumous memoir of a Washington insider and I was kind of expecting remorse, or the possibility of redemption, or something. Whatever I was looking for, I did not find it. The author seems to fancy herself clever and an expert on human relations but all I got was shallow observations and affected prose. She goes on and on, for example, about \\"V-shaped smiles\\" -- a certain insincere facial expression unique to the Beltway-- but not without name dropping the literary genius who coined the term. At times I found myself wondering, \\"Did this anecdote really happen, or is it just a device to tie into the next section of the narrative?\\" I get it :\\"Life (in Washington) is like high school.\\" I'll do that insight one better: 'Washington' is a John Hughes movie about high school -minus the entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's terrible","review":"I cannot agree more with the reviewer who panned this book. Meg Greenfield may have been a great journalist, but a great journalist does not a great author make.She never gets to the POINT.

Spend your money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful look at Washington's insiders","review":"It is a shame that I wasn't aware of Meg before she passed away. She sounded like a journalist with great integrity, something we have a severe shortage of. Her insights into the psyche's of Washington power players is useful in bringing the good old boys club down to earth. However, I had to disagree with her contention that the relationships between elected officials and the press should be personal, if not intimate. Had she still been around to see Bush junior lead his buddies in the press down the golden path towards war I think she might have changed her mind. Alas, now we'll never know. Still, her worthy words remain with us forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prose Voiceover","review":"I orginally wanted to read Nurkse's poetry to find out if he would be a person with whom I'd want to study poetry; I decided that with Nurkse, I would be studying prose with line breaks, and the kind of line breaks which leave prepositions at the start of the lines more times than should be found if one was an editor versed in poetics. The narrative nature of his poetry also lessens the poetic feel of his writing. There are some images that can stick in the mind long after a read, a darkness of sorts; however, some are cliche, like the mother crushing myrtle through her fingers . . . how many times have I read of someone (fill in name) manipulating (fill in verb) an herb (fill in name) with some part of the hand (fill in specific). It might be more interesting if nettles were the herb. Ouch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zipper unzips from the bottom, only buy if you want to replace the zipper.","review":"I have only worn this robe 3 times and the zipper started coming undone from the bottom and unzipping upwards to where the zipper pull is. I thought maybe it was a one time thing so I tried again - same thing. I have a medium, and it's a bit big on me so it's not like I'm busting out of it - the zipper (as another person mentioned) is very cheap and in my opinion, not really functional. I would only recommend this robe if you never plan on using the zipper. Other than the zipper, the robe is fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"I got this for my mother. She wanted pink and fuzzy. That is what this is when you get it. Feels wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dortmunder lives!","review":"There are very few writers who can sustain a humorous novel. It is a talent wildly under-appreciated until one seeks out those few examples of truly funny books: currently, David Lodge, last century, P.G. Wodehouse. A few others. And then there are the Dortmunder novels by Westlake, who takes the mystery genre and turns it into clever, lovable, hilarious adventures of these star-crossed robbers.This one, his most recent, returns to the level of his earlier ones, those memorable ones like the serial robberies in HOT ROCKS and \\"bank-robbing\\" taken too literally in BANK SHOT and the un-robbery of WHY ME?These are shamelessly shallow feel-good lovable entertainments: a rare accomplishment for any novelist in any period. This one, about DNA and Native Americans' casinos, is a splendid hoot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Case is so good I ordered a 2nd one","review":"I bought this case about a year ago to carry a 2TB external hard drive back and forth to the office. It was such a nice case, I just ordered a second one for my point-and-shoot camera and external flash. It's plenty big inside for camera, large external flash, SD cards, and a few other gadgets. The shoulder strap is a bit small, but is only a minor complaint. Padded well for protection and you can't beat the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid","review":"I had to read this in seventh grade. The book didn't grip my attention at all. Everything was predictable. About half way through I no longer cared who stole Kathy young. The way she was kidnaped made her a stupid person in my mind. She wasn't watching where she was walking and she let a stranger get too close. Pay attention to your souroundings and if someone gets too close be rude to them and run like hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Color!","review":"The color is exactly what I had hoped for, and holds up well, just like all the other OPI Nail Polishes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my...","review":"I agree with the other reviewer that this book did have a very cultish slant and personally I just don't buy into the whole Adidam philosophy.The author creeps me out. And I don't get his thing of capitalizing the \\"M\\" in the word \\"My\\" when refering to himself. I find sad that there are lost souls out there (ie, his \\"devotees\\") who are convinced that only \\"by means of My Avataric Diven Spiritual Grace\\" (pg 159)- can they be Divinely Liberated.I would say it ranks right about up there with packing a suitcase, putting on some Nikes and waiting to hitch a ride on a comet."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real let down","review":"I suspect Scoppotone wrote this just to resolve the Lauren/Kip/Alex triangle which came to ahead at the end of her last book.I hated the new format of each suspect revealing their fears after they'd been interviewed by Lauren and the ending seemed so abrupt - unless I missed something I was a bit bemused. The pieces of the puzzle just did not seem to fit together, it was a very shoddy denouement (if you could call it that)& not terribly plausible either.I've always enjoyed the \\"Lauren Laurano mysteries\\", however upon reading this latest one it was apparent that the author has no plans to develop the series any further as she too has clearly become bored with Lauren & Kip.Time to move on I would say & after having finished the book and read the interview at the back with Scopptone I gather that this is exactly what she plans to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing entry in a good series","review":"Having read all the titles in the Lauren Laurano series, I was surprised at how feeble \\"Journey\\" was.

It is cute, with a spunky heroine, who is not perfect in either body or personality, but is for the most part a good person. It also has some traditional fairy tale themes such as a fairy godmother and a handsome prince. All in all this is a good book to read for any girl who thinks she sould be more beautiful.The third princess is always the most beautiful, with two lovely, but mean sisters, and must over come many obsiticals to marry prince charming and find true love. But what happens when the third princess is not beautiful, or even atractive.

Still has some calssic skits like the peeper and Cool guy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is hilarious","review":"I am proud to be the first person to review this CD. It is one of the funniest albums I have heard in years. Adam Sandler is extremely talented. The sketches he wrote are vulgar but painfully funny.

Points make you chuckle, but most of it is just boring. Many of the skits are too long, with no point but to fill up time. If you want to hear Adam Sandler at his best, buy his first album Their All Gonna Laugh At You, and his second What The Hell Happend To Me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious like old but newer","review":"I enjoyed the more Psychotic and somewhat pornograghic regions of the CD, which make me laugh more but even the straight comedy stuff is funny as well, take for instance our little friend Whitey. Well his name is cool and hes 4 feet tall need I say more."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Sandler yet","review":"I picked this up the first day of release. There are a few funny tracks, but for the most part it is lousy. I am a big Sandler fan but I think he has been to busy to put together a decent album. Track 10 is VERY funny (The Champion), the Chanukah song remake is good, but track 7 (Whitey) is stupid. I kept waiting for it to get funny and it never did... the bad part is its over 16 minutes of boredom. I know he is capable of much better and I am sorry I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"ITS OK, compared to Sandlers other cd's","review":"The new Adam Sandler cd,to me, isn't all that good. BUT I AM A HUGE FAN OF HIS WORK.The Chanukah song is pretty funny but that's about it. Adam over did the \\"cool guy\\" thing big time. The skits of those are basically the same thing each time. I must admit the last one is pretty funny though. But my tip to you, buy a different Adam Sandler cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I am a big fan of Adam Sandler's and when I found out I had a gift certificate to a music store, I went to get this CD. I'm glad I had the gift certificate because it would have been a waste of my money to buy an $18 CD for one good song. I LOVE the second Hanuka song but everything else was not impressive. If you can, get your hands on that one song but I don't recommend the whole CD. It just wasn't funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to listen to","review":"This album was painful to listen to. I could have sworn it wasn't a comedy album because it WASN'T FUNNY. It sounds like it was recorded in an afternoon. Stay far away from this. Wait and rent Big Daddy when it comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited laughs...","review":"Having collected all the Adam Sandler CDs over the years, this was my last to be purchased. Even though most of the reviews for \\"Stan & Judy's Kid\\" were mostly positive, they remained relatively mixed. Other than being familiar with Sandler's style and previous work, I wasn't sure what to expect here...Most of the skits on this CD left me waiting for something entertaining to occur - but ultimatley left me asking, \\"Is that it..?\\"The \\"Sean\\" skits were mildly funny, \\"The Champion\\" track was good, but the only substantial comedy seemed to come from \\"The Psychotic Legend of Uncle Donnie\\".I'll admit, I'm not a big fan of most of the songs Sandler includes on his CDs (and \\"Welcome My Son\\" on this album was downright dumb). Ultimately, I felt this effort just didn't measure up to the better stuff released on his first couple of albums.Glad I bought this one used and cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Expected Some Humor","review":"I listen to a lot of stand-up comedy (such as George Carlin, Richard Pryor, and even Bill Hicks) so I don't mind foul language, but this album is simply trashy - even tasteless. Most of this album is silly. I like silliness...but not like this. \\"Whitey\\" is way too long...and for what? The jokes are bad! There's no payoff!What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"I went out to buy this CD earlier today b/c I have all of Adam Sanler's CDs. This CD is a disappointment though. There isn't any part on the CD that is especially funny (except for the Cool Guy parts) and many of the sketches last way too long--16 minutes for one and 11 minutes for another! Anyway, the first Adam Sandler CD was much, much funnier and thats the one to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good - Could I give it a zero?","review":"I am a fan of Sandler's movies and SNL bits, but I thought this CD was boring, long, and just not funny. It has a moment or two, but overall, it's bad. I bought it because of the rave reviews I had seen of his other records. I hope they are better than this.I listened to the thing twice just to see if there was something I was missing.There was not. I honestly do not see why some people seem to love this record."},{"rating":"1","title":"? what happend ?","review":"This cd sounded good when i heard there was a Chaunka song II on it... then when i got it, it really sucked. I mean the cool guys are cool and and so is the Chaunakka song, but thats about it. I recomend getting one of his other cd's. This just isnt that good"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly disappointing!","review":"I am a huge Adam Sandler fan, and after awaiting \\"Stan and Judy's Kid\\" I was seriously let down! I don't think I laughed even once. Maybe I missed something, but it was just NOT FUNNY! Do not waste your money like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but hes had better","review":"This cd was nowhere near as funny as his other ones. I have all three other cd's and those are really funny. This has some good skits to it but they are very long. The 2nd Channukah song was a good addition but that was probably the best thing on it. Overall though it is decent but not as good as I expected it to be. If I were you I would wait till this goes down in price because it isnt really worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great","review":"I smiled, but I don't think I laughed. It is the kind of thing you will listen to a few times and then let it collect dust. I don't see how these other people think you will be cracking up and all that josh... his other cd's were a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's Back!","review":"It's good to know that after a heart-warming movie such as \\"Big Daddy\\", Adam Sandler can return to recording scene with a feel-good song like \\"She Comes Home To Me\\". This big band style masterpiece, about a man whose girlfriend's a professional lady, is worth the price of the disc alone. You'll be happy to know the rest of the CD is just as entertaining! Ladies, pay special attention to \\"Inner Voice\\" before you ask another male, \\"What are you thinking about?\\"If you're an Adam Sandler fan, there's no doubt you'll want to pick this one up. If you're not a fan, try it out but don't expect anything mushy like Robbie Hart from \\"The Wedding Singer\\" This is hard-core comedy for adults. There's nothing to learn, no morals to the stories....just plain fun! You WILL laugh!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It has it's moments, but not a great CD.","review":"I'm sorry folks, this is just not classic Adam Sandler. This CD is not half as funny as \\"What The Hell Happened to Me,\\" or even \\"They're All Gonna Laugh at You.\\" The series of \\"Cool Guy\\" skits are OK the first couple of times, but after 4 or 5 new ones, they seem like nothing more than idle space fillers. I did find \\"The Peeper\\" and \\"The Champ\\" slightly amusing however, and \\"The Psychotic Legend of Uncle Donnie\\" was OK. But unlike Sandler's other albums, I found myself hitting the track skip button on my CD player often. Don't bother paying for this CD unless you're a hardcore Sandler fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"This is one of funnist CDs I heard in a long time. He is a great comedian. \\"The Peeper\\" is hilarious, as well as the Uncle Donnie skit. \\"The Champion\\" is by far the funniest, exploring the exciting world of golf. Anyway, I suggest to anyone that they go out and buy the cd right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even compareable to his other cds","review":"\\"Stan and Judy's kid\\" is one of the most uninspired cds i've heard in a long time. Adam Sandler's other 2 cds with skits on them, \\"They're all gonna laugh at you\\" and \\"What the hell happened to me?\\" were both laugh out loud hysterical. This cd, is just boring, and painfully unfunny.I don't see what he found funny in most of these skits. \\"Hot Water Burn Baby\\" is unbelievebly stupid. \\"Whitey\\" is the longest, and most painful time waster I've ever heard. All of the \\"cool guy\\" skits are lousy, and don't even get me started on the awful songs. The only saving grace here is \\"the peeper\\" which did make me laugh, but after the first listen, it got really old.Skip this cd and \\"What's your Name\\", buy his 2 others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why? Why, Adam?","review":"I wish to formally apologize to all of those people who believe that Stan and Judy's Kid is a good album, for you are all misguided. This piece of garbage is, at best, a disgrace to Adam Sandler and his comedy in general. He is capable of so much more..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piss poor & embarrassing","review":"As a fan who owns every album, every movie, and a few bootlegged concerts I am amazed how bad this new album is. The sketches go nowhere & leave you staring into the night in awe wondering why they were included (check out the 16 minute WHITEY, what is that all about?...seriously what is is about). How violent is Uncle Donnie? Throw some humor in, don't just run people over with a boat. I actually zoned out during the Champion and had to scan back to hear what I missed during my boredom induced daze. And the songs...puh-lease...7 Foot Man is top quality but that's it. This album would be best as a very short EP. I can not believe how disappointing this new album is. I think all the new movies drained the creative flow. DO NOT LET THIS BE YOUR FIRST SANDLER ALBUM? Buy this one when you're sure you are a fan other wise you will be disgusted with Sandler forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd should have been called what happened to me","review":"I have his other cds, and they're some of the funniest things I'veever heard. I kept telling myself that the next skit was going to be better,but I was contstantly disappointed. I even saved \\"Whitey\\" for the end, thinking that it would be hilarious. I hardly laughed at any skit, and the lines that I did laugh at just went on and on, and arent worth the time to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did such a funny man make such a bad CD?","review":"\\"What's My Name\\" was funny, and you could listen to it many times over because it was clever. I am a huge Adam Sandler fan, but this latest CD is garbage. There are some laughs, but too few, and they will not return during the second listening. This CD is a rip-off. Only the sound-effects dude put any effort into this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"Man, when I heard there was going to be some skits on this cd I got excited.

Straight to the used cd store with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave it 2 stars for.....","review":"I gave it 2 stars for \\"Whitey\\" and \\"The Psycotic Legend Of Uncle Donnie\\". These skits are hilarious! especially the Uncle Donnie one where the drunk donnie kills his 3 grandsons with a stolen motorboat. It may seem vulger but it is hilarious! Whitey is about a midgit with a high pitched voice and hates spencers. Buy this album for these two skits....better yet download and burn the album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I think its funny","review":"My favorites are the Champion and Uncle Donnie. It isn't as good as his first CD, but there are many hilarious moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst comedy album of all time.","review":"UGH! What garbage. I am an adam sandler fan and all, but this is by far his worst album of all time, it is boring, and not very funney. I mean a sequel to the chaunnika song should say it all. His first two were by far the best. After hearing this i think it is safe to say that MR. Sandler has lost his touch, forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sporadic flashes of brilliance but overall a loser","review":"This CD is not very good. There are a few places that make you laugh pretty hard, but overall, the CD is not worth the money. His last few CD's were much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH!!!!","review":"Stan and Judy's Kid, put simply, is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. It is rife with bad language, obvious jokes and boring sketches that are far too long. The entire CD relies on base humour to generate laughs - for example: there are five \`Cool Guy' tracks whereby the joke revolves around a suave man that calls his penis a ridiculous name in the throes of passion with another woman, who consequently leaves. The same joke five times, except a different name for his penis. This sort of base, obvious humour spans the entire CD - it's the sort of thing that would appeal to an adolescent that still gets kicks out of hearing swear words or obscene sexual references.If you're looking for something intelligent, witty and most especially, something funny, do not buy this CD. It's completely pathetic. Don't waste your time or money on it. Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"This is THE worst album I have ever heard. Uninspired, unoriginal and extremly bland. Adam Sandler seemed to have hit a low point with his \\"all singing album\\" but this one is better of used as a coaster then a CD. Absolute garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful","review":"Painfully unfunny. Sandler reminds me of everyone's moronic, pothead cousin who thinks that a smirk and a a few trite observations make him a comedian. This guy is SOOOO limited by a lack of talent, creativity and intelligence. Did we really need a sequel to the \\"Hannukah song\\"? He is the Yanni of comedy and this album should never have been released except privately to his family. It is just a matter of time before he goes the way of Jerry Lewis and becomes another has-been who didn't know when to stop or when he was no longer funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it Zero but I can't","review":"The surprising thing isn't how bad it is, it's how shocked some of you people are that it's as bad as it is. His whole career has been one lazy ride with silly voices and lame songs. His complete contempt for his audience is evident by each successive album and movie. When in doubt, thrown in a four-letter word! Nothing wrong with four-letter words, just listen to Lenny Bruce (I doubt any of his fans even know who he is), Richard Pryor, and George Carlin. You people are only encouraging him. He's so lame, it's not funny. He's not funny. You people are probably as lazy as he is. Just make some funny voices and curse! Whoo hoo! What's that?

Minutes into the movie, my instinct told me it would be a loser when it opened up with an overweight topless woman changing. What does this have to do anything? I asked myself. Next followed a sorry excuse for a hero with no combative skill, athletic ability or common street sense whatsoever. What the heck was he doing in this supposed ninja training? A junior high kid track athlete would have put this \\"hero\\" to shame. Ninja Vengeance was a misleading title, since there was obviously no real ninja doing much of anything. It should have been called \\"Blundering Youth Stumbles Across Rednecks\\". The acting and dialogue was as cheesy as something a double digit IQ person would have inspired. You end up not really caring much about any of the characters in this film. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar debut - I can't stop listening!","review":"This debut CD by Pocket Size is simply amazing - Liz and Darren have put together an amazing tribute to everything pop. The lyrics, the melodies, the rhythm and the accompaniment is superb. I am blown away by how utterly beautiful some of these tracks are! I have shared this album with countless friends who have found it irresistible after a few listens!I have to admit however, I did not groove on the album the first round. A few retailers were doing a \\"buy an Everything But The Girl CD and receive an up and coming artist for free\\". It certainly worked for me, even though I didn't buy the package, I certainly bough them separately to show my support of Atlantic and the artists they support.Some highlights on this album: 100% Human - tremendous pop. My favorite song on this album: Know Nothing. Stunning! Walking is great, Death of Me superb! I can go on and on...If you do nothing else this year, try this album out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have seen the future of pop...","review":"Darren Pearson and Liz Overs have concocted a stunning debut of remarkable versatility. How many albums can you name that seamlessly evoke prime-time 70's FM rock *and* 80's electropop? At the same time, 100% Human is strikingly contemporary, mixing in trip-hop rhythms with the abovementioned retro influences. Genre borrowings aside, what sticks in the mind are the insanely catchy tunes, darkly humourous lyrics and alluring vocals. Taken as a whole, 100% Human practically screams breakthrough. Make no mistake; this is the stuff of which pop legends are made."},{"rating":"2","title":"A selection of touchscreen games for every mood!","review":"This has turned out to be one of the most interesting DS games I've purchased. It's a collection of about 20 or so fairly simple games, such as dice, card etc games, using the touch screen, that are monopolizing way too much of my time. Some of them are simple versions of ones I've encountered similar versions of before, eg. there are a couple of games a bit like Yahtzee(tm), a card game a little like 21, but others are totally new, and really addictive. Love the feature that the ones you use a lot are placed on a favourites menu, right up front!

Overall it's a good value ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timed!!","review":"If I had found out that this is a timed only game, in all the games, I wouldn't have bought it. I hate timed games. If there were even some way to turn the timer off, I'd be happy. First you get this irritating ticking, like Captain Hook's crocodile, then the game just declares 'Game Over' whether I'm done or not.

We took TouchMaster on a 14 hour flight - never having played it before and both only got about 20 minutes of play time out of it before deciding doing nothing was more fun.

This one has a ton of different games and even after owning it for over 5 months, I still play it 2-3 times a week. I am always trying to beat my high score. I love that I can play each game in 5-15 minutes. It's perfect for my lunch break, or while I am in the car, waiting for the kids at school or one of their lessons. You don't have to have the sound on to play any of them, either, so I have even played it in the reception area at the dentist's office. The one really annoying thing about this game is that the on-screen instructions are not very clear, so if you don't know how to play or if you forgot, you'll have to look it up. Even so, this is still my favorite game for the DS."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only DS Game an Adult Needs","review":"This is a terrific videogame.

There are so many games on here, you forget what is on here until you scroll through it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Go-to Game(s)","review":"I purchased this game after reading all the reviews. It is a great game that I take with me almost exclusively when I go out. When at home, I play it alot, too. So many games, some very challenging, some are moderately challenging. It is great for those times when you don't want to get involved in a quest that, if you had to stop quickly you would lose your place. FYI, I am 59 yrs young and I am moderately computer adept. I would say these games would be good for everyone over 12."},{"rating":"2","title":"touchmaster is addictive","review":"Great games such as solitaire or Majhong on this cart.

The games are all pretty cheesy and after several plays I was anxious to move onto the next one. They all pretty much had the same theme and look. I wouldn't recommend this game if you are wanting something that will stand the test of time. I love card games, but this one was really lame.Added 10/14/10:My 5 year old nephew really enjoys this game. However, he seems to find more enjoyment in beating my score on each game that he plays. Ha Ha! He is a little competitive. So, there are some out there who do find this game entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"TouchMaster","review":"I love this game and it offers many games so it has hours of fun I find myself never wanting to stop playing it's a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, something for me!!","review":"I've been looking for a collection of games like this since the kids game my DH and I DS's for Christmas!! It has enough familiar games to be a good time-killer and enough new ones to keep it stimulating. I'm an empty nest mom who hasn't played video games since the 80s and this is the first game I've found that I really look forward to playing.

Previous reviews from other people warned the audio quality on the DVD was not up to par. We weren't disappointed at all. The quality was actually pretty good.All in all a good value. We haven't heard or seen this DVD since the 80's. How nostalgic is that?Thanks for making this combo available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Blondie CD","review":"I owned this album shortly after it came out in the 80's. I purchased it again recently and although many years passed in the interim, enjoyed it as much or more than I did when I orginally purchased the album many years ago.This is one of those CD's that although dated, still seem fresh and relevant. Lyrically, I feel it is one of Blondie's best works. The band matured by the point of this release and their musical content reflects that.Surprisingly, there are 4 \\"Bonus Tracks\\" included. Live versions of material played in various European concerts. This includes the odd choice of \\"Ring of Fire\\" from the soundtrack of the film \\"Roadie\\".I would not hesitate to recommend this album to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The videos are neat, but there's music missing.","review":"It's worth noting that the CD-only version of this album (Eat To The Beat) has four tracks that aren't on this one. You can buy them individually from Amazon for $0.89 each, but you may want to just get the much cheaper CD version and live without the videos.My favorite songs from this album are reproduced on the 2000Livealbum, and at least one of them (\\"Dreaming\\") sounds much better in its later incarnation. Just my opinion, of course. Incidentally, the audio on the DVD is LPCM stereo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blondie eat to the beat","review":"Here,s another classic cd from blondie .songs like Dreaming and die young stay pretty and atomic show,s the band at there very best i still own the 8track of this cd today . you will love the cd as much as i do .."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Collection Suffers Slightly From a Much-Needed Re-Edit","review":"No complaints about anything but the beginnings of each video being covered by graphics from the original release, from which the title song suffers most. (The complete video for the song \\"Eat To The Beat\\" can be found on the PINK LADY Variety Show Box Set from Rhino, as well as the complete video for \\"Shayla\\"). Otherwise, this collection is great and looks FAB and is a must for every Blondie collector. Best vids are \\"Dreaming\\", \\":Shayla\\" and \\"The Hardest Part\\"--which, along with \\"Hangin on the Telephone\\", just may be the best Blondie video ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEW WAVE STANDARD","review":"WHEN \\"NEW WAVE\\" BECAME A GENRE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANT, (STILL DON'T), BUT BLONDIE WAS CERTAINLY NEW AND THE WAVE OF HITS KEPT COMING. \\"PARALLEL LINES\\" WAS SO DIFFERENT THAT I DOUBT ANY FOLLOW-UP COULD HAVE SATISFIED THE PUBLIC OR THE CRITICS. WHAT A SHAME AS IT IS A STRONGER RECORDING. WHEN I FIRST SAW BLONDIE PERFORM \\"DREAMING\\" I LOST IT. THEN TO MY AMAZEMENT EVERY SONG IS UNIQUE. DEBBIE'S VOICE MATURED IN SUCH A SMALL MEASURE OF TIME THAT SHE SHOULD BE REMEMBERED AS ONE OF THE GREAT AND EXPERIMENTAL VOICES. CHECK OUT HER SOLO PROJECTS. STANDOUTS ARE \\"DREAMING', \\"ACCIDENTS NEVER HAPPEN\\", \\"DIE YOUNG, STAY PRETTY, \\"UNION CITY BLUES. 24 YEARS LATER IT REMAINS A MUST FOR ANY TRUE MUSIC LOVER'S COLLECTION."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Blondie","review":"Even though Parallel Lines is recognized as the best Blondie album, I prefer this one. There are great songs on this one, and I think they have one of the coolest looks of rock bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their absolute peak","review":"Though Blondie was much more a singles band, this was the one time they pulled it all together to make a near perfect album. Right out of the gate, \\"Dreaming\\" is just blinding, and reminds you of how powerful you can feel when hearing a great song. From there, they just keep going, except for two stumbles: \\"Eat To The Beat\\" and \\"Victor\\" don't really work, but that's okay. Two more incredible moments on a stellar record: \\"Slow Motion\\", and then the majestic \\"Atomic\\". Near the end when Debbie sings, \\"Oooohh, make it mag-ni-fi-cent...tonight...maybe tonight...\\" it just gives me chills. To be sure, they had amazing songs after this (\\"Call Me\\", \\"Rapture\\"), but no album reached these dizzy heights. Now if they'd just re-release the \\"Eat To The Beat\\" video album on DVD..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat to the Beat - No Freezer Burn","review":"\\"Eat to the Beat\\" - At long last they put The Videotape onto DVD.Why did they wait so long?It was Ground-breaking in its day, pre-dating MTV, and VTRs were high-end luxury electronics (and only Beta machines.)The Eventide Spectrum Analyzer as seen on \\"Shayla\\" still knocks me out. To think that it ran on a PET!30 years hence, frozen in time."},{"rating":"2","title":"VICTOR IS A MASTERPIECE","review":"This is the album that introduced me to Blondie (other than their 3 biggest hits) and what made me fall in love with Debbie. Chris' brilliant guitar playing. Clem's powerhouse drumming is phenomenal. It's amazing how some of the songs (Shayla especially) seem to boarder an arena rock sound and others seem to reference their punk rock roots. Clever, cool lyrics. Debbie continues to be a force of nature here as well.\\"Victor\\" has got to be one of THE most underrated Blondie songs. It's is jaw dropping insane. I had to listen to it like 10 times when I heard it, and am still trying to get it. Amazing. I spent a few months on this album before I listened to Parallel Lines for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never owned a Blondie Album? Absolute Favorite Blondie Album","review":"Want to know if you should own this album? - well if you like rock and roll - buy this album. I own 3 LP's because i listened to this album over and over for decades and have worn out 2 of them so i own THREE. It's my favorite Album of all time, of any album. Obviously I'm a huge fan. But if you are still wondering - well if you like Led Zeppelin, buy this - If you like the Beatles, buy this - If you like the Who, Buy this - If you like the Velvet Underground, buy this - If you Like David Bowie, Buy this. Still need convincing - put it this way Andy Warhol picked The Velvet Underground and Blondie as the only 2 bands he ever supported and worked intimately with. So if you want Artistic Greatness - this has Andy Warhol's vote - as he produced the artwork and visuals of the video for this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Blondie album!!!","review":"Unfortunately, this album is often overlooked as merely filler between PARALLEL LINES and AUTOAMERICAN. This is mainly because it didn't produce any US#1 singles. But the fact of the matter is that EAT TO THE BEAT has some great late 70's pop songs - 'Atomic' (better than 'Heart of Glass'), 'The Hardest Part' (very sexy), 'Union City Blue', 'Victor' and many more. I 'borrowed' my cousin's vinyl copy about 11-12 yrs ago and am surprised I haven't worn it out yet due to how much I play it. A fantastic album that defines Blondie at their peak. BUY IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent collection of songs.","review":"Every song on this album is great. Many people absolutely hate \\"victor\\", but i love the guys' take on gregorian chants!If you are a young punk music fan that is new to Blondie, you must get this album.The greatest reason this album is loved by fans of blondie are the credits:Deborah HarryChris SteinClement BurkeJimmy DestriNigel HarrisonFrank \\"The Freak\\" InfanteTogether, these musicians just clicked, and each has contributed to the band's collective success. Those were the days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master Craftsman of the English Language","review":"I have owned this book for nearly a year and each time I peruse it, the enormity of its brilliance astounds me again and again. Joel Allegretti is a master craftsman of language. Some of my favorites include \\"The Singer\\",\\"Regeneration\\", \\"We Tell of a Morning\\" and \\"Anthology of Hands\\", which ignite the core of the human soul. The book's timelessness is evident in the first poem, which personifies so eloquently the image of the moon. I eagerly await his next collection of poems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Howlingly bad, good for a laugh","review":"This book reads like some group of teenage roll players had put it together. If you can get past the awkward, phony, overblown language, the lack of any rhythm, structure, or gracefulness in the wording, you're still going to have to face the fact that the book has only one single underlying message:\\"Medieval stuff and Islamic stuff are really cool!\\"Author seriously needs some growing up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Handbook on how working people can change the world","review":"This remarkable book contains the Transitional Program, the founding document of the revolutionary movement Trotsky built. As you will read in this book, it was not written by Trotsky alone, but was the product of the experience of fighting workers from every continent. It was written to apply the lessons of the Russian revolution to the world, particularly to the realities of class struggle in the United States. It also contains discussions Trotsky had with American revolutionists and union leaders like Farrell Dobbs and Vincent Dunne, leaders of the great Minneapolis Strikes of the 1930s that made the Teamsters a real force in the labor movement. It also contains attempts to apply this program to the struggles of African Americans and other working people. This is a practical handbook on how to change the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"for the real revolutionary!","review":"I am in Indonesia, a country that had been under imperialism for decades.

One cannot read it without seeing its immediate usefulness today. The consciousness of the working class in this country, at this historic time is incredibly low and here is a roadmap to increasing that consciousness and building the revolutionary vanguard.This edition is especially instructive as it contains transcripts of many discussions with Trotsky, excellent introductory material and example programs for both youth and black liberation, putting Trotsky's theory into practice.The SWP and the 4th International imploded long ago but the methods by which 20 thousand Bolsheviks moved 20 million people in 1917 remain sound and are even more powerful in this age of mass communication and connectivity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Blazes by Ranch Romance","review":"This album has witty songs that are great company on road trips or whenever you just want the freedom to sing along at the top of your lungs.

The product was a little on the hard side but worse than that it had very little cherry or licorice flavor. To turn this into a pretty good product I poured a teaspoon of anise and 3 T of Splenda over the black, shook it up to coat all the pieces and then micro waved the bag for 30 seconds. A few days later the product tasted better and was softer. I deem my change a success. For the cherry bites, I did the same only with cherry extract (no anise) and also had very good results. I have a recipie for sugar free licorice if you want it email me."},{"rating":"1","title":"different item than photo","review":"I ordered the sugar free black licorice bites shown in the photo but I received plain black licorice pieces.

(Heard it on the radio.) Effortlessly powerful, clear, nonetheless inward but still unflagging throughout (which is not so common in this sonata). I don't think I have been so taken by a 'new' Beethoven pianist since Kovacevich, especially his first round in the late 1960s and early 1970s (as Stephen Bishop). And I'm not sure he ever did 109, though his 110 and 111 remain at the peak, in my view. Indeed, Grimaud resembles Kovacevich in any number of ways, including that clanging tone and color range. I must check out her 110 and the Brahms PC 1; can't take more Beethoven piano concertos, not at the moment anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why play Hamburg Steinway in NY?","review":"After I saw all these favorable reviews, I purchased this CD. Yes, the orchestra sounds good and the pianist is OK. One thing however I disliked about this CD was the sound of the piano. Before I listened it, I believed that she played on a NY Steinway because the orchestra was NY Philharmonic and it was recorded in NY, but I noticed a harsh treble range which is obvious in the 3rd movement of the concerto. I was a bit dissapointed. It of course depends on each instrument, but generally I feel the NY has richer and clearer treble and the Hamburg has rather glassy tone with more noticeable attacking noise. This one also sounds shallower. For Beethoven, I think NY tone matches better. Why not play NY Steinway in NY?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"One of the better late Nero Wolfe stories. I notice that the other reviewer (thus far) finds Wolfe irritating--of course, he's meant to be that way, which is why we are presented with Archie as Boswell to his ponderous Johnson, perhaps the best solution ever reached to the Dr. Watson problem. What is the Dr. Watson problem? The detective can only seem brilliant if his cards are hidden--but a 1st person narrative is the only way to really involve the reader in the mystery. Thus, the author provides an assistant to the great \\"Sherlock.\\" The problem is that Dr. Watson figures often seem like idiots--we're unconvinced (in a few stories) that Holmes is a genius because only Watson could have missed the obvious. Archie is competent enough himself that we never doubt for a moment that Wolfe is truly a genius--and the dialogue between Archie and Wolfe is some of the best give-and-take ever written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story but with revolting protagonist","review":"In some ways, this is a very well-written mystery. It holds the reader's interest and the ending is anything but predictable. But, there are some facets that are insultingly unrealistic. Most notably, the great Nero Wolfe can summon all of the potential suspects to his home for interrogation, and they all willingly come! My biggest problem, though, is with Wolfe himself. He is pompous, obtuse, ungreatful, arrogant. I can only marginally enjoy a mystery if I dislike the investigator; that is the case with this book. In fact, knowing now how the Wolfe character is developed, it is highly probable that I will not read any more of the series. But, if you can get past the traits of Wolfe that I describe, I feel confident that you would enjoy this book, and probably all entries in the series.

Kronos will suck you dry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absorbing","review":"Kronos is one of those science fiction movies from the 50's with an interesting story. Kronos is a huge energy absorbing alien robot that has comes to earth to accumulate all of its energy. It sucks energy from power plants to an H-bomb; as a result it grows larger and larger. It's not a bad movie, I recorded it years ago and recently purchased it on DVD and now enjoy the better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this nonsense.","review":"I've tried to like this movie since it came out in 1957(a very good year for Pontiac) but this movie always bored me. A lot of good Sci Fi movies came out in the 50s when I was a kid. KRONOS was not one of them. It's boring and dull with an ultra dumb machine as the threat. I might have been seven years old, but I wasn't dumb. Save your money and buy \\"Rodan\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Shockingly\\" bad sci-fi. Save for last if just completing your collection.","review":"Wow! I've been disappointed before, but I'm actually thinking of returning this one, as I don't think I'll ever watch it again. Many reviewers have given this film credit for having an unusual antagonist, granted, but it also has horrible junk science, wooden acting, terrible dialogue, plentiful stock footage, and it just plain stinks. Slow, painfully slow, to develop. Endless shots of helicopters circling. I couldn't wait for this to be over. If you want a movie that doesn't have a guy in a rubber suit as the baddie, track down the much superior \\"Monolith Monsters\\", which succeeds everywhere that this film fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"dumb movie","review":"Well it is a dumb movie. A giant robot like machine comes fromouter space. It walks around draining the energy from power sources on the earth. That idea may not be that bad. It's justthat the movie is kind of dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kronos","review":"This DVD would not play in any of the DVD's at home...This is one of my all time favorites....I am sorry to say I can not watch this movie on DVD.

(only because this DVD would not play)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would you believe a robot that eats the world?","review":"Kronos is a skyscraper sized robot, that comes to earth to steal out power and transmit it back to it's planet. This is a different story line (at least back in the early days of Si-Fi flicks. For a change it had not only a fairly good plot, but even had a sub-plot in volving an alien remote controled human, controlling Kronos.For all the oldie movie buffs, this one's a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kronos","review":"Service was excellant. Recieved the video before the due date and vidoe was in new condition. Will buy from this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kronos","review":"It was as I expected. Old, hokey 1950's sci-fi movie. I saw it as a kid and wanted to see it again for old times sake. While not perfect, the production quality is better than Mill Creek's movie packs. If you don't expect too much you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darn, I'm not 6 years old any more","review":"I absolutely adored this movie when I first saw it at the tender age of six. Blah-blah-blah-MONSTER!-blah-blah-blah-ROBOT! Well, I just saw it again at the age of 49 and it hasn't changed a bit. But I have.There are things here to love. The basic story is fascinating. The ecology movement is strongly foreshadowed. And much of the art design is gorgeous. Even some of the effects are beautiful. But the direction is terrible. The indoor sets are grotesque and stupid. The acting laughable. Most of the effects, especially cel animation, are abominable. Worst of all is the injection of Hollywood yuck-em-up laugh lines throughout the script. Not all of them intentional -- how shall I ever forget our romantic lead playfully imploring his wife-to-be, \\"Can you respect the guy who pulled the biggest scientific boner of all time\\"?RIP, Kronos and my childhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kronos","review":"this is one I had missed along the way. It is very different and I enjoyed it tremendously. I am so happy to have this in my collection.

Now THAT is a movie! 50's camp, and fun all the way. Acting and effects are so-so, but then most of them were! Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A delicious alternative for standard 50s SF","review":"\\"Down here we have half the atomic secret... we convert matter into energy... up THERE, they have the other half... they convert energy in matter!\\" So intones John Emery as a half-alien possessed, dying scientist in KRONOS. You can read about the plot and actors in the other reviews (esp. George \\"Jetson\\" O'Hanlon), so I thought I'd just throw in some noteworthy points about this movie -1. The cinematography is great - you have some shots worthy of Conrad Hall's work on Outer Limits.2. Irving Block and Jack Rabin - two of the creative minds behind Forbidden Planet - did a lot of the production and model work and they did a lot on limited money.3. The monster - a giant electrical energy-sucking battery that pulverizes everything with its motive power units - has to be seen to be enjoyed.4. You really, really get the feeling that this thing is alien in purpose and thinking. This is not some guy in a rubber suit standing in for the communist threat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please remake this one Mr Cameron","review":"This is one of the movies I grew up with in the 50's. I looked forward to it to appear on those Saturday morning early scifi movies on the local channels. Like \\"The Thing\\", I would love to see this movie remade by one of the special effects wizards like James Cameron only because the excellent doomsday story could be adapted very easily to modern day. The only thing that this movie lacks is the modern special effects to make the metal monster believable. The story is believable. If you think about the new Godzilla remake and compare a remake of this movie to that Mr cameron, you would see there is a fortune to be made. You would definately get the 50's audience for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice illustrations: overall good quality","review":"Im a beginner Nihongo student (3 months) and knew this was going to be above my reading level (I only know 250 kanji) but got it any way to motivate myself.

This video is a let down, with a lot of chippiness and digs at Yoko that I frankly don't want to hear. And it goes on way too long about the 'Beatles are more popular than Christ' incident. I wish I hadn't bothered with it. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"I purchased this DVD because I thought it would have some new info and some good commentary. It stunk. There wasn't a thing new added and the interviews were weak. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"A lot of old interviews from past 80's clips. The main interviewer is just going over what is in the books and other videos. I can recite the same facts as he.If you want the best video get The Anthology Video.

As everyone else has said, I have a tendency to knowck them over when I'm moving stuff on my desk around, but I've fixed the problem simply by propping them against my printer. They're VERY lightweight, and I just pop them into my backpack whenever I'm traveling."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK sound, but can't mount to wall","review":"I bought 2 sets of these speakers for a couple of PC's I have in our kitchen. The price is good and the sound is fine, but I read that these can be mounted to the wall. They can't. Moreover, they're not balanced well and tip over constantly. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention: one of the speakers died after only 2 months of use. These things are junk. I'm now looking for replacements."},{"rating":"1","title":"It did not last long","review":"Bought it for my daughter from Wal Mart 3 months ago and used it not more than 20 times.

The only problem, and a minor one at that, is that they are a little lightweight and tip over easy. If you place them on a shelf or some place that they will not be disturbed, it shouldn't be a problem. Mine are right on my overcrowded computer desk, in my high traffic living room and they are frequently knocked on the floor. That is probably more because of my rowdy family than anything else.I would definitely recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really cheap \\"cheap\\" speakers","review":"I'm no audio buff, but these are really bad speakers. They were bought to replace the standard non-upgrade Harman/Kardon speakers that came with a Dell system that finally died after about eight years of daily use. I selected them because they had both a volume and a tone knob. However... the tone knob only lets you select between \\"tinny-sounding\\" and \\"tinnier-sounding\\". They have VERY little bass and just have a very flat-feeling sound. Plus the cords were enough shorter on them vs. the older ones that we were unable to place the right speaker on the right side of the computer, and have to live with the stereo channels reversed. I realize I could buy an extension cord, but I plan to get a better set of speakers instead, because these really aren't good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does anyone ever buy Altec Lansing speakers?","review":"My speakers at work stopped working, and my boss purchased these as a replacement. He probably found them for about $15 at some hole in the wall. They're awful. If you take a pair of headphones, plug them into your computer's audio line out jack, place them next to your monitor, and turn the volume all way up, you'll have reproduced the effect of plugging these speakers in. There is no bass whatsoever. Altec Lansing has always been absolute trash as far as I have experienced, and anyone who says otherwise either has bad hearing, works for Altec Lansing, or both. Wouldn't it be hilarious if all the quality testers at Altec Lansing had bad hearing? It would certainly explain matters."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are good inexpensive speakers","review":"I bought these to listen to my MP3 player in my kitchen. They fit the bill just right. The sound is good for a medium size room at a normal listening volume. Can't really blast these, at only 6 watts total, they're not that loud. I spaced them out at either end of the window over the sink. Good stereo separation and they fit nice in the corners. However, there is not much slack left in the cord between the 2 speakers. Tone control is practically useless. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairly good sound quality.","review":"Music sounds fairly faithful coming out of these speakers, and they're quite loud enough. They look nice. I just wish that they were just a bit smaller and yet still able to sound like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like these speakers","review":"I like these speakers, but I could not give them five stars due to sound quality. They are very good speakers for the price and would be a welcome addition to any computer or gaming system but if you are really into high fidelity, then these are not what you need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful product","review":"I understand why these are no longer available.I've owned these for 3 months after receiving them as a gift and the speaker with the controls already stopped working.They are VERY unstable and ANY amount of movement will knock one or both over. After a few days of them falling over, I got some double sided tape and taped them to my desk.The sound isn't anything special. The tone knob seems to be placed there for decoration only, as I didn't noticed any appreciable difference when it was turned from one side all the way to the other side all the way.The only almost positive thing I can say about them is that they are loud, although they distort quite a bit at higher volumes.If you want good speakers, look elsewhere. If you get them as a gift, the person giving them probably doesn't like you very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gaming speakers, no lie.","review":"Based on the small and compact size i first thought that they would be little dinky speakers, but they pack a punch with a great sound quality, i was looking to get a new sound card for my computer but with these there is no need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"I purchased this item about 10 months ago. I guess it lasted enough for the money I spent on it. Although it enhances the sound of my laptop, I had several problems with it:1. Sound from the right speaker died. I was told by the customer support that I need to pay to send the item back to them, which will cost me over 10 dollars (about 75 percent of the purchase price!). I will throw these speakers away and I am not going to buy this brand anymore.2. No bass!!3. It does not stand still unless it is placed on a hard surface.Please do not waste your money and pay a little bit more to get a better speaker system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For the Money","review":"Yes, they are tippy. Yes, they're AC powered. Yes, they have knob controls that could be awkward for some.That said, they are lightweight and easy to take along and the sound quality is EXCELLENT provided you are not a \\"music lover\\" who likes to blast the bass.(Frankly, I don't think REAL music lovers DO blast the bass. And if you do, some nice hearing aids are in your future :))In sum they are a lot better quality than the cheap portables I used to use with my MP3 and my computer and cost no more. Well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough for the price","review":"I got these thinking I would get real Altec Lansing performance, since the brand is known to be really good sound equipment maker. I was looking for good quality sound, deep bass response, but not excessively loud. I would not buy this set again. The sound is clear and crisp, but the bass is not existent. Even for a 2.0 system (not to be confused with 2.1 with subwoofer) there are better speakers out there for the same price, or even just paying $10 more, you will get way better sound. Make the Altec Lansing VS2420 your first choice over this ones and you wont regret spending your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cant belive this has 3.5 Stars!!","review":"I got these at Walmart for $15.For $15, there are okay but the sound is really kinda flat and no bass to speak of. The sound also cracks at high volumes.They are also really lightweight and kinda plastic. Also the adapter is actually quite heavy which makes moving them around awkward.If you are looking a really really cheap pair of speakers and dont care about the quality then this might be for you. But honestly I would spend $10-$15 more and get a pair of speakers that actually has some decent sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speakers should last more than one day","review":"I thought these speakers sounded good for the price. Too bad I only got to use them once. One of them quit working, and the other faded in and out if the cord moved. Glad I kept my receipt!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just fine - if sound quality doesn't matter at all","review":"I bought these speakers for my computer after my old ones died. Since my family's computer has a nice surround sound system for listening to music, it didn't bother me much what these sounded like so long as it did have sound to it. And in this way, I was not disappointed.The sound itself is alright. The static is very, /VERY/ noticeable and very much detracts from most of the things you might listen to. Still, the speakers themselves are not eyesores, and it did survive moving from dorm to dorm as I went through school, so I suppose that's why I had to give it two stars instead of one. And for the money, I suppose it wasn't a bad deal. They were cheap and have worked, if not well.As far as recommending this to anyone else, if you're in my situation and just want a little sound for low cost, maybe you should try these speakers. However, if you like music and find it worth listening to without annoying you, consider something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Class Act From Beginning To End!","review":"Pointe Magazine is the finest American magazine devoted exclusively(more or less) to ballet, as opposed to other dance styles.

He really fit the bill as he looked just like a mountain man. In fact, in the movie he's the one walking down the sidewalk several times carrying a bucket. Also, he was in the scene in the street altercation scene. He loved it, the actors were great, the costume people were wonderful, it was one of the best times of his life which ended on April 25, 2007 from cancer.I can truly say as I look at a framed photo of my mountain man in his costume I was so proud of him for doing this. I am ordering a copy of the first movie for all 6 of our children for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best part of the movie","review":"The best part of the movie is when Joseph Smith is sharing his sacred experience with Nathan Steed.

The exercises are interesting, the tracks are usably short, and a continuing story line holds interest. The accompanying book has not only complete transcripts but additional grammar explanations and a vocabulary index.But what a pity there is so little overall content! It's geared to travel situations but there isn't a lot of vocabulary. Furthermore, the Spanish is Castilian (the kind spoken in Spain, not Latin America), which limits its use. The narrators have British English acdents which may pose a problem for some, though it didn't for me.If the course had about twice the vocabulary I'd rate it five stars. As it is, I consider it a wonderful introduction to Spanish and quite easy to use in your car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Varied and diverse in it own way","review":"First half of the CD is a lot of fun to listen in my opinion. It does tend to go a little emo toward the end but it's not bad. I fear that future releases will become progressively softer as is common with bands of this nature. Make sure you listen to all of the sample songs to be sure you will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 year old loves it","review":"Since I am bilingual and am bringing up my daughter to be the same, I bought this book about 4 months ago.

Now that my daughter is 2 yrs old, she knows all the words in the book and we discuss what is happening, not only the objects in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I eagerly anticipated this book, since there is so little published information on the subject, but I was disappointed when it finally arrived. It appears that it was never proofread. I read a lot, and this is the worst job of editing/proofreading I have ever seen in a book. This may sound like nitpicking, but there were places where I could not figure out what information the author was trying to convey it was so garbled. It is FULL of typos, grammatical errors, and garbled sentences.From a substantive standpoint, some of the basic info was helpful, but the pools shown in photos were somewhat 'cookie cutter' in appearance, and there wasn't the variety in pool designs I had hoped for.

Too much emphasis on project management, plumbing and electrical and not enough nitty gritty on the actual building of a pool.Found the only good coverage was on the plant types and species relating to where to plant etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"A difficult read.","review":"Definitely not recommended as a primary arranging text.

Nothing special about it. I am a cleaning business owner and noticed that the book was flawed. I would like the author to please show me where a person can get 1 million dollars worth of insurance for $250-$400 as the book states. Most people can not even get insured for that amount in any state until they have been in business for 3 years. The author left out a lot of information and I would not recommend this book to anyone who is serious about starting a cleaning business. The only thing decent in the book is the appendix, but even that is not detailed enough. I give it two stars for effort and because I am a nice person."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a reference book.","review":"If you're looking for great prose, go elsewhere. This is not a criticism, for the similarity in description makes it easy to compare places within and among states.The descriptions of the parks and forests follow such a similar pattern that the whole thing would have been presented more efficiently as a series of charts.I found the long-distance trails to be the most useful information, because it's hardest to find elsewhere.I bought this book when it first appeared, and just came back hoping for an update. Many of the phone numbers are no longer valid, in part because of the proliferation of area codes. It would be nice to have the long-distance trail information updated, as well as an update on trail usage in the parks and newer, longer lists of other reading sources.Essential is an accurate description."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for the serious music collector.","review":"Although the title of this CD leads you to believe that Agust��n Lara sings and plays all the songs in this release it is not so. Yet, the artists featured could not be better, they were the artists for which these songs were written, molded to their voices and styles.

If your are looking for a book that addresses the potential denizens of the terrarium specifically, this would make a very good reference - especially if you are still trying to decide what you want.

Fun, but about as fluffy as they come."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste.","review":"This book starts out with good intentions and then just dissolves into an excuse for the author to gloat and gush about her marriage. She uses other women's marital issues to discuss how good her own marriage is, complete negating the main idea behind the book and patronizing both the other contributors and the reader.

So much of it is not even remotely true to the Canon that it makes me think Fullenkamp had no intention of paying homage to the Canon. Among many other things, he introduces a element of religion that is not found in any of Doyle's writings. I was particularly unhappy that Fullenkamp writes that Holmes was emotionally and sexually abused by a woman teacher as a boy. Where does he get this stuff? The book has many of the problems with self-published books: misspellings, punctuation errors, use of wrong words, etc. Examples of the latter include \\"navel\\" for \\"naval,\\" \\"yielded\\" for \\"wielded,\\" and \\"exercised\\" for \\"exorcised.\\" Unless you don't mind wasting a little money on this one, don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Hype","review":"I love fishing and this book could not hold my attention for more than about 2 minutes.They spent more time in choosing the title and hype than authoring the book.

Armand's okay; Allegra is sometimes intriguing and sometimes an annoyance. There's nothing new here -- the same old characters and plots, with the exception of Oxie and his pranks, and they are not that amusing.There's not much to like; I had to force myself to finish.

If you want satire, check out Florence King."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Scathing, Sarcastic Novel of University Life","review":"This book is tongue in cheek, sarcastic, black humor. It isperspicacious in its in vitro gaze at Moo U., a prototypicaluniversity with its vapid, selfish, self-aggrandizing popula-tion all creating a reality based on masterbatory intellectu-alization. It is a solopsistic haven of harangue. The authorreally gets the sense of academia as a slick and oily place.What a grand, funny, sharp novel this is. It is peopled byprofessors, deans, students and politicians. It could be theUniversity of Anywhere. This is a great book for anyone whohas survived a university environment long enough to shaketheir heads and say, 'What the hell's happening in thisplace?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"I picked up this book because lately I've seen a lot of references to Smiley as one of the foremost writers of her generation. I really don't get it. I found this book tedious, confusing, and frankly just boring. It had the scale, sweep and ironically detached tone of a Tom Wolfe novel, but, unlike Wolfe's books, the story never gained momentum. I dutifully stayed with it for almost three-quarters of the way through, but in the end I just couldn't finish it. There is no denying that Smiley writes beautiful sentences, but that was not enough to keep the pages turning."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked Straight Man and want more, DON'T read this.","review":"In reading reviews for Straight Man by Richard Russo, I saw that Moo was mentioned as a similar book. The setting is similar, and it does feature university professors, but I could barely trudge through Moo. Despite flashes of adequacy, it seems like the sub-plots are very derived to make some sort of great tie-in at the end, which is even more boring than the sub-plots themselves. If you read Straight Man and wanted more, don't read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Academic parody for all of us...","review":"Four freshmen women, three \\"mature\\" sophomore guys they'reinvolved with, the provost, a cafeteria worker, severaldepartment and committee chairs, a new language prof, and thealmost-tenured English professor she's sleeping with, areall characters in this novel set at an agricultural university in the Midwest.

Truly fascinating and a littledisturbing when we identify with one of the caricatures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved Earl","review":"I liked this book a fair amount, I kept picturing my undergrad alma mater (UW-Madison) while I read it.

I got just way too upset when Earl was unhappy and wouldn't play with his toys."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun, and funny, but hardly literature","review":"This book was basically a mildly amusing and fast-paced piece of fluff. I agree with the other reviewers who complained about the unresolved plotlines; it's a decent book but hardly worthy of Jane Smiley."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS BOOK","review":"this book is one of the best i've read... it's funny, has a great story... anyone who has any connection with a university, and particularly with a cow college should read it... tracing perspectives and agendas, she hits the nail on the head."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"As others have mentioned \\"Moo\\" has an unwieldy cast of characters which make following each subplot difficult, as characters often fail to appear again for hundreds of pages. Though some characters are noteworthy - particular the pig Earl Butz and Smiley's grasp of adolescent dialogue is flawless, I wound up skimming until I reached the climax. Personally, I much prefer the author's less bulky books such as \\"Barn Blind\\" and \\"A Thousand Acres\\" not because I don't enjoy reading complexly plotted novels, but because I feel that if you have the knack of creating memorable characters, they deserve more \\"screen time\\" so to speak."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of my time!","review":"This book was terrible. I liked it for about 5 minutes and then lost interest. There were too many characters, least interesting of all being the professors and administrators. Maybe if Smiley had written more about the 4 college roommates I would have given it TWO stars...but I doubt it. I couldn't get past the first 5 chapters and I finally gave up. And I had never been able to not finish a book I started before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lactose -intolerant!","review":"This book starts out wonderful, and it is a lot of fun to keep up with all the characters. It wears off after the first ten chapters. About halfway through, I kept wishing for a large blizzard/avalanche to come through and put these academians out of their misery. For those who want quirky characters and great plotting, I recommend John Irving or Bryce Courtenay."},{"rating":"1","title":"confusing, too many sub-plots, too many abstract characters","review":"I must agree with evmis@msn.com-'s comments regarding MOO. I am also in a book club and picked up this book thinking it would be an entertaining change-of-pace book for the club to read. It's awful ! I have gotten to page 280 (only 157 more pages!)and after reading the reviews (amazon.com) have decided not to complete the book. I lived in Davis, Ca.

This is my first Jane Smiley novel--and probably the last!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest if you know the University....","review":"While I can imagine this novel was pretty good to most people.

While not her overall best work it certainly does strike a humorous chord."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's hard to follow a Pulitzer Prize, eh, Jane?","review":"I really do not understand how anyone can say that this novel has anymerit whatsoever. Fact, Jane Smiley is an unbelievablygifted novelist. Fact, A Thousand Acres was a wonderfulsuccess and I loved it. Fact, (whether you want to believeit or not) Moo falls exceedingly short of Smiley's previouseffort. Now, whether she was going for symbolism or not isn'tthe issue here. She ends up sounding like a soap opera.Where as A Thousand Acres was genuine and heart-felt, Moowas like a roll in cow chips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quickly becomes tedious","review":"Individual characters are interesting at times, but plot movement is very slow. And the review parameters says that I must type 8 more words."},{"rating":"2","title":"A week four, but still a good book","review":"Jane Smiley know how to spin a good story and she is a good storyteller even sometimes a great one. She is also a entertainer with a sense of humor and can craft good stories. Moo university and its inhabitants is a charming placefor those who have been to a university: For those who should have liked to studied it may give some glimpse of how universities sometimes may be no more than a place for devious intrigues and plots. Smiley has a wicked wit which in my experience describes (some of) the kind of people one finds in these kind of \\"institutions\\". Jane has earlier won the Pulitzer price for A thousand Acres, which I also liked. Moo is also a book worth spending time and money on. Though on my harsh scale it gets week 4, which is still very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing happens","review":"While Mrs. Smiley does an excellent job of delving into the psyches of the many characters we find in a college setting, I find that her book lacks any kind of plot. I read about 200 pages and kept waiting for something to happen, but it never did, so I finally just put the book down without finishing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books","review":"This book is so great, I find myself reading it over and over--and discovering something new every time! I would agree that it is VERY confusing on the first time through, but totally worth the time. It might have helped if she had put an index of characters in the front or something. Anyway, I found this book to be really funny and full of true-to-life characters and observations. Anyone familiar with the workings of a Midwestern university will be able to relate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Effort","review":"Ms. Smiley's unique phraseology is a little disconcerting but I was willing to make the effort to follow along until I became familiar with her rhythm because this is a New York Times bestseller, she is a Pulitzer Prize winning author, and the book promised to be \\"Delectably Entertaining\\" and \\"Uproariously Funny\\". The story line really wasn't going anywhere when a sex scene between two women popped up and was described in minute detail. I'm not a prude or a homophobe but I found these detailed descriptions unnecessary and offensive. In fact, the whole book, to that point, was unnecessary. I don't know if the story improved after that because I decided it wasn't worth the effort to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Characters","review":"There are too many characters in the book and it's quite hard to keep track of them after a while. I'd have liked it a lot more if Smiley had stuck to the story of the four roommates, or the guy who keeps writing essays but thinks he is a loser and wants to change majors. The professors and administrators' lives were dull and absolutely boring, and I couldn't stand it. I hardly give up reading books but MOO is one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't plow through it even if I had to.","review":"This is the only book our book group has chosen that I just couldn't even finish. We still laugh at the quotes on the cover and how unbelievable that they could be referring to this story. Maybe if I had finished the whole book, the tangle of characters and plots would have reached some point of clarity but at well over 100 pages into it, Smiley was still adding new people with very uninteresting story lines into what was already a puzzle of characters. I kept flipping to those quotes on the back of the book and the mystery amplified...Did they read this book? Is it a joke like the Emperor's New Clothes? \\"Fast-paced, Humorous, Engaging\\" ... I must have read something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many characters, not enough plot","review":"This is not a book you can read in a hurry.

The whole thing felt like one of those \\"you had to be there\\" jokes. Only in this case, you had to be an English professor to enjoy this book.Even as a very recent college grad familiar with the academic environment, I still couldn't get into this book.

After burning labelmate Roots Manuva's album into my mind I reached blindly for New Flesh. And I'm deeply satisfied. Their sound is unusual (three voices: gravel, focused robot, focused power) and at times they go into musical spaces which aren't normally associated with hip hop, with mixed results. On the whole, the lyrics are focused and strong, and the flow moves in grippingly unpredictable patterns. Ninja Tune/Big Dada is quickly becoming one of the world's best hip hop labels. This is a very worthwhile buy if you are interested in hearing hip hop from a new direction. Every artist in the Ninja Tune family is worth checking."},{"rating":"1","title":"non skid tape","review":"I put this on the ramps on my shed so i wouldn't fall ...worst tape ever it fell off the ramps in a month.. if i had gone into the shed i would have fallen flat on my face..thanks worst tape ever......cheap must be dollars store tape....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Ear Band - self-titled (Beat Goes On)","review":"Originally released in 1970, even though it's self-titled, this disc is often referred to as the 'Elements' lp.

Definitely a certain taste is required to thoroughly enjoy this reissue. \\"Earth\\" is notably the CD's best cut as I'm almost certain that I hear a cello, violin, hand drum, flute and a bagpipe. \\"Fire\\" sounds like somewhat of an open jam, somewhere in the middle east. \\"Water\\" could easily serve as a film soundtrack, even today.

I loved the idea of a sequel, and I loved being able to live in the world that Mark Helprin created for little longer, but I thought that the social commentary he was making through the Tookisheims detracted from the main theme of the book and made it less timeless. I would never advise anyody not to buy it, I think that the whole trilogy should be part of everyone's library, but my first love will always be Swan Lake, although if I come across a deep blue jar at a garage sale someday, I will pick it up as tribute to the memory of these wonderful stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one altogether--A City in Winter is a better ending to the trilogy!","review":"Oh, it should have been stunningly beautiful and creative like the first two books.

To me, this unit doesnt seem to work well. I've been out with a steady wind and the unit seems to indicate little to no wind. I got to help calibrate my Davis weatherstation and it rarely seems to correlate. The buttons are hard to push and controls are a bit unintuitive.

Oh well, it was cheap and it makes a good portable thermometer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful, but needs strong winds","review":"Fun to have. The feature set is good, while the user interface takes a bit getting used to. The thermometer and wind chill meter are useful extras. Ditto the peak, average and current measurements.The meter works well when measuring winds above 5 mph. However, when trying to measure the wind speed over the pool, the meter sometimes would not spin up. The spec says it can measure down to 0.44 mph. My device won't register less than 1.5 mph, and I have no idea how accurate it is at that point.After some exposure to wind (what a novel concept for a wind meter!), the fan bearings wear out. It gives out a screeching sound in high winds (above 10 mph), and measurements are probably inaccurate.It uses up the battery also when turned off. After about a week in off position, the battery is dead. So make sure to take out the battery after each use."},{"rating":"1","title":"problem product","review":"When I first received this Anemometer the battery was dead. I replaced the battery with new one and it worked fine. Turned it off and put it away. A few days latter I took it out to use it again and the battery was dead again. I found out there is a drain on the battery when the unit is off. So now I pull the battery out when I put it away. When I put the battery back in to use it, the unit will not power up with out fooling around with it for several minutes. It's too much work so now it's back in the box and in a drawer. This works fine when working but, I would find a different unit that is more reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chilled","review":"If you need a meter to measure wind speed, this device will do that very well. The wind speed measurements were accurate. If you are interested in temperature or wind chill, you will have to stand outside so long that you will know the values before the instrument tells you. It took about 45 minutes for it to go from room temperature, 70 degrees, to the outside temperature, 45 degrees. It is a good value for measuring wind speed, but you will chill before you get it to measure wind chill."},{"rating":"1","title":"La Crosse Technology EA-3010U Handheld Anemometer","review":"The La Crosse Technology EA-3010U Handheld Anemometer broke as soon as I took it out of the box.

You may have read complaints about a plastic adapter.

Only issue I had was that the receiver bar was too big to fit into my 1.25\\" hitch. The 2\\" metal adapter works fine. I called Swagman and they told me that they were aware this was happening and that they had measured the hitch opening on several brands of hitches and found that some are not exactly a true 1.25\\". So they had some bars made a bit smaller to accommodate the issue. They are sending me me a new bar at no cost and told me to keep the other bar in case I need it for a different brand of hitch one day.

The hitch fitting for the 2\\" hitch is not out of plastic any more as decribed on some reviews, but a metal frame. Looks like they improved that (at least in my version). We are very happy with it and already took our bikes out on it for a quick tour around a lake here. It is such a sturdy construction that the bikes did not even shake while driving...On a side note - I did try to order through \\"Amazon\\" as the vendor because of the free shipping, but they did not move their butts for four days, so I cancelled and ordered through an alternative seller at the same price, also free shipping.

The paint would not allow the rack to fit into the hitch.The rack does not hold 2 bikes with a tire on the back of the vehicle. There was a photo on-line showing a vehicle with two bikes, but it does not work with mine. (Honda CR-V)Having said all of the above, I am using it for one bike and it works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Easy, Super Convenient","review":"This product was very easy to assemble. I was up and running and on a biking trip within 30 minutes of receiving the product (yes, I actually was waiting for this to arrive so I could take my bike with me for a long weekend)...Very stable when attached to my hitch. Love the fact the bike sits on top of supports from the wheels instead of hanging. Support arms on top clamp down very tight, nothing moves...Only caution I have is even though the support arms are rubber coated, they did cause some paint wear (maybe I didn't clamp it down tight enough the first time), but this was easily taken care of by placing a piece of foam between the arm and the bike frame.For the money, this was an EXCELLENT value."},{"rating":"2","title":"HITCH BIKE RACK","review":"I have only had the chance to use the rack a few times. The first time when holding my wife and my bike the clamps and rack worked great. The second time I carried two larger bikes for males where the cross bar was higher. I could not engage the inside bike clamp on its notches because the bottom of the bar clamp did not reach down to the noches on the clamp. I had to put a C clamp at the top of the bar clamp to hold it in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat it!","review":"For the price, this is a great alternative to the high end hitch racks. Holds bikes very securely & the ratcheting clamps work great on my wife's Mt. bike with a sloping top tube. Assembly was easy.

Still, a good quality rack for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bike Rack","review":"This is a great product. We have two bikes one being a step-thru style bike and both are easily secured by the ratcheting clamps. The rack takes about 10-15 mins to put together and seems very solid. The threaded bolt that attatches to the hitch receiver takes a little longer to screw in than a pin, but it does make for a wobble free connection. The first time I used it bungeed down the wheels, but I later decided that was unnecessary and quit doing that. As long as the clamps are firmly on the frame the bikes aren't going anywhere. Small hint, if you are having a hard time releasing the clamps to remove the bike just push down on the clamp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Rack!","review":"This rack, so far, is an excellent piece of equipment. Extremely easy to get the bikes on and off.

Problem was the thickness of the paint/finish on the portion that slips into the receiver. I had to grind off the finish and repaint that portion (unfortunate as it had a nice thick finish). It fit fine after that and the unit works very well. If not for this problem, I would have given the rack five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swagman","review":"A friend owned a Swagman bike carrier and recommended it to me.

Smart product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed...","review":"I needed a bike rack that would work for my road bike and my wife's Schwinn cruiser that doesn't have a top bar. There are products that that attach to the bike to simulate a top bar so I can hang it but this Swagman bike rack takes care of the problem without the extra equipment. The rack takes some assembly but very easy in my opinion. The rack is not that heavy and attached right to my Yukon. When you set the bracket widths to your bike and snug the padded hook down, the bikes are nice and secure. The Schwinn was secure even with the low point of contact for the hook. I was very impressed with the functionality and ease of use. Would recommend for any bike but especially when you need to carry bikes without the top bar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swagman XC Cross-Country 2-Bike Hitch Mount Rack (2-Inch Receiver)","review":"I would not recommend this product. The receiver did not fit well into my hitch. It was so tight, I had to drive it in with a block of wood. I have not removed it from my vehicle since I first put it on but anticipate difficulty removing it due to the tight fit. The hold down bars pressed my brake and shifter cables against the top rail of my bike and rubbed through the paint- really bad design. The rack might work well for just a sidewalk cruiser but definitely not designed for bikes with brake and shifter cables that run along the frame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swagman XC Cross-Country 2-Bike Hitch Mount Rack","review":"All though I have not used the bike rack as yet I have put it together which was very simple to do.

Fits like a glove in my 2 inch receiver. Didn't get the locking pin (didn't think I would need it). The pin to secure it to your hitch is a threaded screw with a lock pin to secure it. Know that you will need a threaded locking pin, and that a standard hitch locking pin (smooth pin) will not fit into it, unless you can bore out the threads (if you plan on locking the rack to your hitch). Other than that, looks to be a good product, worth the amount paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"I have used this product about three times since I bought it. It has been incredible. It is extremely easy to load the bikes, and they are more than secure. I bought another bike rack a year ago, but needed to return it because it swayed about a foot back and forth. This one does not sway an inch. It is also very lightweight compared to my last rack, and easily folds up for trunk storage. I'm incredibly impressed, and I will get the extension in the future when I need it.Also, many people said there was no way to lock this rack. There is. Mine had two small holes you could place a small padlock through. The locks' presence blocks the lifting of the two support hooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Use for our two mountain bikes (one is a 29er). Works great.

The tire rails can not be secureded even with a pliers. The red rubber protecter fell of the first time I used the carrier. The lock recommended with it does not fit.

All parts were free for me and I dont have to figure out what hitch pin to use. My other option instead of the chain was to drill and tap the bike rack to a standard thread and then use a generic hitch pin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great on my Pilot","review":"After much Internet surfing and reading we chose the Swagman XC Cross Country.

The first is the gift of his beautiful daughter, Amanda. The second was his unflinchingly honest assessment of Amanda's illness and the tragic impact it had on her family.

This book is very inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"This is an amazing book written by a very special person. When our daughter was diagnosed, Amanda's gift helped us.

The Amazon listing shows a practice pad in the product photo and lists the item as \\"Remo Stand, Practice Pad, Tall\\" That pretty much tells me its a stand AND a pad. Not so. We are disappointed with the listing on Amazon. But the stand is nice, sturdy and what we wanted in a drum pad stand.We will now order the Pad as an addition to the stand. This will cost more than another listing we saw on another site that sold both together.

I'll give credit that the effects weren't to bad, but that's really the only good thing about the film, because everything else was pretty crappy.The film starts out with a group of people who just got kicked out of a party, who decides to roam the roads out in the middle of nowhere and somehow stumbles upon an old mansion, which they thought to be vacant. Little do they know that an evil sorcerer lives there with his many ghouls and monsters.The movie is filled with plot-holes, bad acting, directing ,lighting, and scripting. When we reach the conclusion of the film it's nothing special. A girl runs away from a crap load of zombies for like five minutes and a few others rhings happen.Don't waste your time with this. The story os full of holes and it's full of bad acting. It you want to see it only see it for the monster effects. Other than that it's Crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much, too fast","review":"This book presents too much information too quickly. I'm a music teacher, and if I were to teach somebody banjo, I'd use a different book. The material just isn't sequenced properly. All of the tunes are fairly advanced, and there's not really any songs that a beginner could play. All there is for beginners is boring, repetitive exercises. The material on chords and music theory progresses far to quickly for most newcomers to the subject to understand. Earl Scruggs is certainly a master of the instrument, but his pedagogical techniques leave much to be desired. The book might be useful to somebody who has some background in music and some experience with a stringed instrument, like guitar. It also has a lot of good information about the instrument in general - it's construction, history, etc. One other thing - the binding makes it almost impossible to lay the book flat, which is very frustrating when you try to put it up on a music stand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as I expected","review":"First off I would like to say, if you are new to programming with games, this book is probably not the best. It lacks a lot of explanation and throws a lot of source code at you, which I thought would be handy but turned out not to be. One tutorial in the book was actually very sad and didn't explain how to install JOGL. Anyways, find another book if you want to learn something good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent tutorial article but nothing more","review":"The material in this text really does not belong to a book, but should be a free web tutorial article. As a text, it s way smaller than a notebook, most of it pages are just taken by line of code, and most of it is code you have already read, as the examples are very similar to each other and the authors keeps printing over and over the same routines.There is also a lot of hands-waving and superficiality in the explanations, and the examples presented cover only the very very basics. Also, detailed JOGL installation instructions are not given, and this will probably leave the beginner stranded. Overall, it feels like the author has written a couple example programs of the kind you expect in a web tutorial, and then decided he could try to make some bucks out of that. My advice for you is not to spend any money on this booklet and my advice for the author is to make all of the book available on his website, where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"As someone who used to see 60 or 80 movies a year and now sees about 10 because they're so mediocre these days... \\"When Strangers Appear\\" really goes on my \\"Why did I even bother?\\" list. The story makes NO sense. The New Zealand-based filmmakers didn't bother to correct minor details -- the story is set in Oregon, yet they call a doctor's office a \\"surgery\\" and a parking lot a \\"car park.\\" The heroine made me absolutely crazy with her wandering from place to place rather than going to get some help! She runs a diner and a motel (apparently several miles apart) out in the middle of nowhere, and says she's had no customers in a while, yet she can afford to keep both of them open? Worst of all, the writer/director never explains who the bad guys are, why they're so uptight about that CD, or why they're willing to murder to get it back. I could go on and on ... suffice to say I really thought this was a serious waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could give this 0 stars","review":"This movie was a piece of crap! I've never seen a more poorly thought out movie. It had NOTHING good in it whatsoever.Glitches in the movie--Why was there only one sheriff?

People can talk while driving...DUH!On foot, Beth never would have escaped from those crooks.Also, why didn't they show us what was on the disk? After making us endure a terrible movie, they should have at least shown us what was on the disk.The movie had a poorly thought-out ending.The movie was gory. It's so revolting how those three guys were able to get away with killing a lot of people for so long.This movie was a waste of film.

The author has drawn her romantic pair as warm, funny and, well... just plain sweet. Jack, the hero, was a NICE hunk and Sophie was a beautiful woman (who didn't know she was lovely) coming into her own. I really thought it was a nice touch at the end of the book to have Sophie writing her parents with her recipe for happiness. If you want a really enjoyable read that will make you laugh and make you cry(and not because it is sad), don't overlook this book. It's well worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happily Ever After indeed!","review":"This is a delightful seafaring romp featuring a refreshingly non-wimpy heroine and a gruffy but good-natured hero. The relationship between the hero and heroine is well-done, with just the right blend of passion and laughter.Indeed, while Sophia's bungling around the \\"Miss Deed\\" may be a bit hard to swallow, she makes up for it with a healthy dose of spunkiness and fire. And Jack is an intelligent and kind man despite his bluster.When I finish this book with a big smile, why, yes, I'd call this a keeper. Jack and Sophia are indeed two of the funniest and well, perfect romantic leads I've ever read. It is easy to believe a happily ever after for them.One thing though: the cover depicts a nice garden scene. The closest thing to a garden in this book is the Yukatan forest.

Sounds simple enough but TRY to figure out how to view them in sequence and you end up with more questions than answers.The Matrix titles and the order they should be viewed is very confusing. If it's a trilogy, why is it listed as: The Ultimate Matrix Collection (The Matrix / Reloaded / Revolutions / Revisited / The Animatrix)?That's five (5) titles, not three(3)!. How is your average-non-Matrix-geek going to figure out which of these 5 titles are the 3 movies?I've read 6 reviews so far and none lists the movies clearly such as \\"The first movie is called...The 2nd movie is....titled...\\"A desire to watch a movie should not be squashed with frustration as it happened to me here & now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above-average","review":"The collection is quite complete, however, the first of the series is still the best movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"All of the Matrix in one collection","review":"I love seeing Animatrix cause it's a Japanese anime, it had nine short films with stories about how it all started in the beging. The first matrix movie is when Neo first became the One. The Matrix Reload was a disappointment the fighting was just terrible. I love The Matrix Revolution when those guys were in the machines fighting those big machines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved Every Single Movie","review":"A wonderful furturistic romp through the concept of Messianic deliverance (complete with a Cyber Judas).

Personally, I enjoy DVD \\"making-of\\" special featurettes and cast commentary. Since a majority of the discs included are just that, I would only recommend this boxed set for those who enjoy seeing the inner workings of film-making and it's special effects. However, even if you only liked 2 of the movies, this boxed set more than makes up for that with it's price of about $6 per disc.Everyone rips on the Matrix Trilogy as being a let down; The truth is that even Reloaded and Revolutions are better than 90% of the Science Fiction movies released in the past decade. Don't believe me? Look at such crapfests as Battlefield Earth, Jason X, Timeline, etc.Bottom line: If you're a fan of good science fiction movies and the intricacies therein, this boxed set is a steal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frankly...","review":"At this price, this is an automatic buy, regardless of how you feel about the sequels.

That really bugged me. I was able to find the set at a local best buy for $50. I'm not sure if it rang up wrong or what. The video and audio is amazing non the less and was totally worth it to see the first movie in high def. Animatrix is in SD... bs but oh well. Drops the set 2 stars for me since that was the only highlight besides the first movie in this over priced set. Also being forced to buy the last 2 movies was another 2 stars. They always find a way to push these down your throat. I'm gonna sale the other 2 on ebay and try to recoop some cash. Oh well defiantly disappointed with this whole mess. I hope an end draws near for this format war and movies won't be so tossed together and features will become standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst set of movies ever made","review":"The matrix trilogy is the most boring dumbest and overrated movies ever made.

Be careful buying form this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"is it worth $40 extra ?","review":"Most standard dvd players nowadays have a feature that lets you upscale a standard dvd to 1080p. So you can enjoy your old dvds in maximum resolution on a high definition television. You can find the standard dvd versions of these 3 movies, and buy them for about $40 grand total. So you would be paying an additional $40 to own this blue-ray set. It's NOT worth it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic blu-ray ONLY collection","review":"I love these movies and thought it'd be nice to treat myself to the blu-ray collection, seeing as my old box set of regular dvds had become hopelessly scattered and misplaced. I got this on sale for about [...] bucks during black friday week last year, and was quite pleased with that. The box itself looks great, all shiny and with holographic green matrix code all over it. The video quality is wonderful, and the sound is simply amazing (not to mention the hours of commentary and bonus features).My only problem with it is this JUST has blu-ray disks in it. Yes, I did order a blu-ray collection, I understand that. But how much are regular digital copies? A couple bucks? Just throw them in there. I can't take these over my friends houses, hell I can't even watch them in my room, only the tv in my living room has a blu-ray player hooked up to it. This would have been 5 stars if digital copies had been included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can We Say Obsessive Boys and Girls?","review":"I'm not a real big fan of the Matrix trilogy, but I will be the first to say, this is one impressive set! NOTE TO GEORGE LUCAS:This is the kind of set we were expecting for the \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy. What the hell happened? This set is a tribute to the trilogy. A complete study of the movies, warts and all. The action figure is a nice touch as the presentation. If you are a \\"Matrix\\" fan, sell your original sets, buy this one!

Needless to say I feel ripped off. Oh and to rub salt in the wound I could have got the cheaper version and downloaded Animatrix for free from Xbox Live Marketplace!

We can't.The only saving grace are the other extras, I suppose. That's why I give this set two stars instead of the one I gave to the first DVD releases.\\"Matrix Revisited\\", is it?

The sequels had the potential to be the greatest sci-fi trilogy in history, and they failed miserably.The Wachowski brothers planned the sequels from the begining? B.S., then why did the 2 sequels have absolutely nothing to do with the first movie and were completely about doing cool special effects.The best slap in the face to both movies is that neither were nominated for a single academy award.But hey, if you want a $60 set of 10 coasters, be my guest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why wake up?","review":"I thought the original Matrix was a brilliant movie.

This has to be the biggest rip off going right now. The two sequels are basically awful movies and should never be watched by anyone. This is hollywood dribble at its worst. The only bigger ripoff is the Ultimate Limted collection which is well over 100 dollars. They also went back and \\"remastered\\" the Matrix to make it look like the other two. No reason for this. Now it looks all washed out and grey like the last two. I seriously almost walked out of the theater near the end of Reloaded I was so dissapointed.The Matrix will stand the test of time. Reloaded and Revolutions are easily forgettable. Even die hard Matrix fans thought these two films were awful. Revolutions is so full of itself I almost felt like I was sitting through Sunday school or something.

There were moments when the movie had qualities of a Blu-ray, but would return back to the disappointment that it originally was.I put in another Blu-ray movie to see to see the difference in picture quality, and boy was their a difference. Try playing the Bee Movie right after you just watched the first couple of scenes of the Matrix, and you'll see the disparity of the two films. Seriously save your money, this is just another scheme to rip off the average household of its hard earned money.

The combination of acting, camera use, special effects, soundtrack and atmosphere is stunning and may not be matched over a trilogy of movies for years to come.

The beginning of the series is over 10 years old, and yet, it still stands as one of the best trilogies ever! Neo, Morphius, etc... You couldn't find a better cast! Look at the actors and actresses today.... The Matrix was a launching pad for a lot of careers to be noticed!! Great on you.

But what I picked up from these movies is a deep message. Later on I researched what influenced the Matrix series and found out it tied in with Gnosticism (ancient christianity), buddhism, hinduism, and other philosophies/religions.After you watch this movie check out the book The Secret History of the World by Laura Knight-Jadczyk. This book goes deeper into the rabbit hole with all the mythology, religion, and science to the ideas that inspired the Matrix.That is what I love about this series. Many people disliked part 2 and 3, but they stood true to the original influences."},{"rating":"2","title":"ok","review":"I was a little disappointed not so much because of the graphics not being up to par but because they did not fix the cg especially in reloaded. The movies are still as good as ever it is just that in reloaded you have a lot of outdated cg and it shows but I believe that it would do this with either hd or bluray. Part three is the best looking out of the three and has less cg or it is just more up to date and harder to follow. Over all I would probably not get this as a whole set if you already own it but if you do not it is worth the money if you are going to purchase it for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"See Them All","review":"If you have never seen The Matrix, this is as good as it gets. Both movies in one package. If you have seen them, all this is, is a good collector's addition.If you have somehow made it this far without ever having seen The Matrix, be warned: The Matrix is extreme, extremly imaginative, and a good cast. It is about a nightmare future, which is so frightening that some betray their freedom to escape it. The Matrix is absorbing, well acted, and worth the time.

Had an element of \\"Big Business\\" putting profit ahead of everyone's safety in a egregious manor... who would have thought... The scene when the bad guys find out one of the hostages is a VIP has the exact same script as other movies of the same caliber. My final thought; don't pay for it, wait and see it on your subscription channels! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie...don't waste your time.","review":"Bad plot. Bad acting. Stereotypical, one-dimensional characters. Cliche, trite, boring... Stupid idea, stupid to the core. I watched it for $2.99. I want my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good flick, Guy Pearce is funny","review":"Although it's not as good as the last Die Hard movie, this is, in my opinion, better than \\"Escape from New York\\". I really liked Guy Pearce. I found him to be a lot more amusing than Kurt Russell's character - Snake Plissken. Definitely more sardonic. The only issue people might have is the number of F-bombs in this UNRATED version of the film.Make no mistake, this is a \\"B-movie\\" filled with scary-violent secondary characters, a witty, sarcastic leading man, a hang-over written plot and not-so-great CGI, but it's still better than a lot of B grade space movies in recent years and even some A grade space movies.My \\"Minecraft\\" guru, slightly geeky, 14-year-old nephew said he liked it a lot, so definitely a winner with teen boys.In the end, it is a bit of a fun time out for your brain.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, it made me laugh","review":"I loved the characters in this movie, especially the crazy inmate and of course Guy Pierce. I do love me some Guy Pierce. I laughed through most of this movie, because it had a lot of witty banter. The action scenes were decent except for the beginning chase and the part where they were falling back to Earth. Those two parts were ridiculous and the graphics looked more like they belonged in a video game. Plus, the falling to Earth thing was very unrealistic. However, I would definitely watch this movie again and I'll probably end up buying it when the price goes down. I recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised Guy took this role","review":"This a a typical hollywood action/sci-fi film, nothing special. I'm surprised Guy Pierce took this role.

However if you are looking for an over the top, fun, action flick, then you will be pleased. I like to compare this movie with the 80's action flicks, such as the original Total Recall, or Escape from New York. If you enjoy movies for such as Escape from New York for the sheer fun factor, then you will most likely enjoy this movie.

Lockout is still a good yarn for a popcorn \\"let's not think much about this\\" viewing. Just leave rational thinking and logic out of any plot evaluation.On balance the film is well acted although the writers tried too hard to do a 'Bruce Willis in Space' main character. Fine action sequences (if a bit---errr---unbelievable).Overall the film is well lit and filmed, and overall offers an entertaining diversion from reality.Of note is that the \\"making of\\" additional material is interesting in terms of how to do a lot w/o a lot of money.

This is very reminiscent ofEscape from New York (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging), and I liked it for many of the same reasons.No plot spoilers from me: Set in a future where criminals are placed in cryogenic sleep and are warehoused in an orbiting prison. The story follows CIA agent \\"Snow\\", who has been falsely accused of murder but is given the chance to redeem himself by rescuing an important hostage from the prison. The plot is fairly straight forward, with a few twists, and has decent special effects, but this is mainly an action flick with a lot of snarky one liners. The actors are all well cast for their parts and there are actually a few memorable rolls.This goes into my lazy weekend movie list since it is one of those that can be rewatched and enjoyed anytime.Recommended!CFH"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, and full of one liners!!!","review":"Pretty good movie!

Fluidly directed by Luc Besson (TAKEN, FIFTH ELEMENT), the film's basically simplistic plot is inconsistent and filled with holes and unexplained information which I won't discuss here due to spoilers.Guy Pearce swaggers his way through his role as Snow, tossing off one-liners like dandruff, and is actually quite good.

So as long as they add the violence back in I will give it 5 stars out of 5. Guy Pierce Got buff for the film and his character is just like Snake P (Escape From L.A.) Meets John M. (Die Hard).

Disappointingly not so - Guy Pearce is just perfect in this role, and the writing of his character is excellent, but it does nothing to save this poor effort of a movie.This isn't really a 'leave your brain at the door' experience, it's just a ridiculous story with moment after moment that is just beyond implausible. Even accepting the silly premise, you still have things in most scenes that make you roll your eyes - the screenwriting uses the most basic devices and almost everything is a leap of faith which stretches way too far very early on. And then there's Maggie Grace, playing a helpless daughter that needs to be rescued... really?Honestly, not worth it, even if you love sci-fi and action and don't mind silly fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lockout - Ratings?","review":"I rented this film from my local kiosk and enjoyed it very much.Before I buy the Blu-ray \\"Unrated\\" version, I would like to know what the difference is between the \\"PG-13\\" and \\"Unrated\\" versions.IMDb lists the running time of the \\"PG-13\\" version as 95 minutes, the same as the unrated being sold here on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video Game Physics - Plus Amazon Fail on Rated/Unrated","review":"2 Things.First, the movie's ridiculous video game physics during the initial motorcycle chase pretty much ruined the whole movie for me. My disbelief in how sucky movie special effects can be in 2012 was not suspended.Second, I noticed after I rented it there was an unrated version. I really think I should be either 1) alerted to the fact there is another version of the same movie I'm about to rent and be given a choice, or 2) allowed to preconfigure my desire to see the most raunchy, censor-needing version of anything.

Look at the security they have earth, way beyond security in this movie but again the screen writers did a half the job require if they even did that. Hell, I'm not screen writer but I would have had you holding onto your set and wondering WHATS COMING NEXT? You have such a big playing field that should be full surprises and instead your boring people, I figured it was a love story right in the beginning But I get it, its a mystery, gee couldn't figure that one out with the guy dying and given-en him his lighter, the suitcase misdirection was really stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked, really sucked!","review":"This movie was really lousy. The stupid Hollywood one liners never stopped, I mean never stopped coming. The story was not bad, but the acting was. The one guy who played the psycho was the best.

I really enjoyed the book, yet it had potholes along the way. And it was also too unbelievable. I mean, what kind of people would send a girl to a detention camp for teens for wearing a red AIDS ribbon? I will admit this book had me reading nonstop, yet when i reached the end, I just got MAD. There is no ending; they leave. Never look back. Where are the characters going? And what about Toms other two friends,Silas and Avery, what will happen to them? This was a sad, dissapointing book with little truth whatsoever. Unless there is a sequel, I'll never understand this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written, interesting plot, but it does have holes.","review":"After, the twelth book written by Francine Prose, is basically an intelligent horror story. The book revolves around Tom, a high school student at Central High School. When several kids are shot at neighboring Pleasent Valley HS, Central turns into an almost fascist regime.The brilliant writing and creepy plot combine to make this a real page turner- but, unfortunatly, some elements of the plot border on being laughable. Parents being brainwashed from reading e-mails. A national, media-involved, apparently unmotivated conspiracy to send teenagers to death camps. The only thing that keeps this novel together is the quality of writing. Not only does it force you to keep a straight face when a girl is murdered for wearing a red ribbon- it makes it creepy.It's a perfect book up until halfway through. Until then, it almost seems like an allegory to Stalinist Russia or Nazi Germany. When the sense of reality is lost... so is the book.Buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was wonderful...","review":"Until the end. I read this book extremely quickly, and was terribly disappointed by the ending.

I give it 2 stars because all of it but the end was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"After","review":"After is a great book from beginning to end!Its about the effect a school shooting has on students at a school for example Collinbine. It shows how the rules get alot stricter and how the school has to get a new student councel.The kids also have to take random drug test, this causes some students to lose friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"suspenseful yet weak ending","review":"I thought this book was very suspenseful. I could not put it down. Through the entir ebook, I thought it was going to end with a bang. At that, I was disappointed. The book ended leaving me with an empty void. The end does not tie up any of the plot. Is there a sequel? I hope so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning: Aides Paranoia","review":"When I picked up this book I thought it'd be like most of the other school shooting books that have come out in the last couple of years; a little grotesque but with some meaning. But by the time Dr. Willner showed up I knew I had been quite a ways off. The book reminded made me think of my own school, though it is not anywhere nearly as bad in comparison, but what it could become. I read in suspense as Central High became more and more of a lost cause rather than the perfection \\"they\\" said \\"they\\" were aiming for.Though it's never discovered who \\"they\\" are, it's a scary thought to think that things like this have the slightest possibility of happening. At the finishing of the book I was quite paranoid myself, which proves to me that this book is truly worth the read if it can touch someone like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"an okay ride, but not well thought out","review":"The premise of this book - introducing the concept of an over-protective state becoming a police state to teenagers- is an interesting one. Teenagers in general are very isolationist, yet at the same time very aware of any inconveniences in their own lives. This book shows how those very traits are used against students to take over their lives.But the premise is not fully thought out. Without giving away spoilers, I can only say that I was very dissapointed in how the plot was resolved.There are some interesting observations through the book; some keys to the mindset of fascism. But overall, it's a thriller/horror with a weak foundation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Untitled","review":"I adored this book. It is very touching, and also very creepy. The relationships in this book are very deep. That's one of the reasons that the book was so wonderful. I would recommend this book for someone over 10. Almost anyone under 10 wouldn't understand it. A great book, I give it 4 and a half stars. It lost the half because of the ending. The ending didn't really end. There wasn't an ending. Ms. Prose better make a second book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Magnificant Book... The Best I Ever Read!!","review":"I loved this book. It was so intersesting and unpredictable. Also, I liked the characters... they played a good role. But, I would suggest making a 2 book(sequal)because the first book was so good but the ending ended in a way that you would think there is a second book.Also, even though Stephanie died, it still didn't say what happened to Sillas and Avery or what happened to Tom, his dad, his dad's girlfriend, Brian, Tom's girlfriends, and her mom. All it said was that they left and that was it. But over all the book was great. I thought it was well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is THIS?","review":"People say this book is 'scary', and 'it makes you think'. Face the facts, people. The only 'scary' thing about it is how little significance it has with real-life issues.'It makes you think'. Yeah, makes you think about what terrible writing this is. WHY does Ms. Prose INSIST on not letting you figure anything out?! It's as if she thinks we're stupid or something.This book deals only with the IMPOSSIBLE.Really, would a high school kid be killed because she wore an AIDS ribbon?!Quite frankly, I simply do not see the point. The end really stunk. I think Francine got bored with her own story and decided she should just END it.And what was UP with that evil freak psychologist guy?! What kind of a villain was that?! There was NO REASON for ANYTHING in this book. NOTHING was explained.Like how all the kids' parents turn into zombies and LET their kids be killed?! What was THAT all about?!I did NOT enjoy this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zero-Tolerance is a cop-out","review":"After is a novel about the extremes parents, teachers, schools and communities go to after an event like Columbine happens. For the children's safety, of course. And then it explores what happens when those measures go too far. Totally eery and chilling book. And as someone who escaped school just before the zero tolerance wave hit, but who is now trying to raise two very smart, willful, children in it, all I can say is - parents, we better start fighting back. Now.Zero tolerance is just an excuse for not thinking, and just a way of scapegoating kids when something totally inexplicable and horrible happens. But the kids aren't the problem, the system that failed them is.Teens will identify with this book and the feelings of always being watched and judged. Adults should read it and take its message to heart. We are not helping any children with our policies of fear and suspicion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Content matches title","review":"It seems a bit much to expect folks to lay out more cash for a new introduction and a few extra pages. But maybe Steve is right about people getting \\"Dumth\\". Amazon lists this book as \\"list $10.95, our price $15.16\\", and lists the authors name as \\"Steve Dumbth and 81 Ways to Make Americans smart Allen \\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Allen is not emotionally intelligent","review":"This book is for those who see themselves as highly intelligent and the rest of the population highly lacking. Steve Allen takes 40% of the book to tell Americans why they are stupid. The rest of the book outlines 101 ways to become \\"intelligent\\". Some of the advice is to listen to and watch news on radio and TV. Personally I would disagree with this advice. Another sample is to be neither negative or positive but both. I find that most people are either one or the other.My problem with the book is that he was mainly negative. He seemed arrogant, cruel, and insensitive with a bit of hate toward those who were less intelligent. He says he receives hate mail from mental cases. I can see why this book attracts those types of letters. His 101 pieces of advice are written as if he is the highly intelligent teacher to the lowly barely awake student (reader). I find this to be, using his term, dumbth. He appears not to be emotionally intelligent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberal Elitist Snob","review":"Although a little slow reading, Mr. Allen offers many good tips on how to improve your mind and your ability to reason. Unfortunately, some examples used to illustrate his rules were tarnished by his political bias. For instance, Mr. Allen refers to former president Ronald Reagan more than a dozen times, all of them negatively. These were unnecessary distractions from the theme of the book. He could have chosen other examples to explain his rules.It's too bad he has such a dislike for conservative potiticians like Mr. Reagan. If it weren't for President Reagan, Mr. Allen's grandchildren would probably be speaking russian.Overall, I was disappointed. His liberal political agenda and his snobbery got in the way of an otherwise useful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad service is not dumb","review":"I love Steve Allen, but this book (like most of his) is pretty superficial and deals less with intelligence than bad service he's had to deal with. Sure, I like the coffee coming when I'm at a restaurant, but a slow refill is not a sign of low intellect."},{"rating":"1","title":"lighten up Steve!","review":"I like Steve Allen and believed that perhaps through his comic view, he could suggest some fun and creative ways to be smarter and more efficient. Instead, his examples of dumbth seem more like an example of a bitter old man who hates repeating himself and prefers intellectual snobishness to human fallibilty. The book stinks. My advice to Steve.... Lighten up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"rechargable flashlight","review":"This is a pile of junk. The dealer tried to compensate for it but you cant make something good that is junk. It would work until the battery ran down and would never charge back up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of this deceptive product.","review":"I ordered 5 of these flashlights by recommendation from a friend. At first, I was so impressed about the long time they remain lit with a few squeezing strokes. I left one flashlight on more than 24 hours to be amazed that it still lit. I was little kind of doubt if they conceal some kind of batteries in there to maintain the lighting. Feeling uneasy, I decided to open one flashlight to investigate. Then there was the fish: they stack 2 coin-shaped batteries right behind the LEDs. After these batteries run out of juice (about 50 hours as I observed), the LEDs are on only as long as you squeeze it. This is really deceptive so beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twelve step program","review":"Bob Forrest's confessional tells it like it is. The former Thelonious Monster could have made something of himself back in the early 90s but, instead, succumbed to the allure of drugs and drink.

This is the best CD I've heard in a long time. Musicianship is excellent, and the lyrics are very heartfelt. I recommend this album to anyone that likes Thelonious, RHCP, John Frusciante, or any kind of music for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, where was that guy coming from??...","review":"Just read a prior review for this disk (was only here looking for info on the new disk, out 08May01) and was very surprised to see someone bagging on it. This album is epic. Very genuine, gritty but heartfelt stuff that get's you smack between the eyes. This sort of naked, brutal honesty from the scarred underbelly doesn't appeal to all, but I found it to be seriously rocking probably gets my vote for album of 2000, at least in the top five. OK, I'm biased, but I'm sure there's plenty of Britteny disks available for those who like things a little more fluffy. Musically & lyrically, think Chili Peppers, Jane's Addiction, Lou Reed, a touch of Waits, and of course, Thelonious Monster. out................KB"},{"rating":"2","title":"An album from the heart.","review":"This is a GREAT album.

This book puts you there! William Manchester has written a superb book that not only describes the life of General Douglas MacArthur, but also makes you feel the emotions of the ppl involved at the time. You actually feel that you are there watching MacArthur pacing back and forth pondering the Pearl Harbour Invasion and the subsequent defence of the Phillipines! This book feels more like a Novel in its gripping \\"can't put it down\\" nature. Great book, brilliantly researched, brilliantly executed. One Question: When will they make the Movie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Biography","review":"This book is a classic. Even the title page is brilliant. MacArthur is The American Caesar, imperious and outstanding, always posturing and yet commanding a fanatical following. A complex man, his brilliance is constantly dogged by his insecurities, his successes balanced by his failures and so on. truly the modern Prometheus!He completely misread the Japanese intentions to bomb the Philippines and the Chinese determination to hang on to North Korea. His bizarre and brazen behaviour towards the last days of his command points to a man losing his grip with reality. Perhaps, the strain of playing centrestage for so long had taken its toll.Definitely not pro-MacArthur, Manchester does paint a sympathetic portrait of this great man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Readable Biography of a Fascinating Subject","review":"AMERICAN CAESAR is a highly readable biography of a fascinating subject. Manchester has plenty of good material to examine from both the personal and professional aspects of MacArthur's life. MacArthur's genealogical background is also interesting since one of his ancestors is shared in common with both Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Winston Churchill.MacArthur is portrayed as a brilliant innovator as exemplified by his masterful manuever in jumping from Hollandia to Leyte in World War II and of course the Inchon landing during the Korean War. The author by necessity tells the story of the U.S. Army's role in the Pacific during World War II mostly from the army's point of view. In that respect AMERICAN CAESAR serves as a useful adjunct to Samuel Eliot Morrison's HISTORY OF UNITED STATES NAVAL OPERATIONS IN WORLD WAR II."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an eye-opener","review":"I have a great interest in WWII history. I thought I knew a lot about the war in the Pacific. Evidently myinformation came from Nimitz and Halsey psychophants. As far as his post-war role in Japan is concerned,his accomplishment have no equal anywhere in any age of history. Just think. If he had had the humility of a George Marshall, what a fnatastic domestic leader he could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dogmatic Worship","review":"This book begins with the dogmatic assertion that MacArthur was a genius, then through the first 14,000+ locations recites MacArthur's actions. When he does good, Manchester claims that he was a genius. when he does bad, Manchester claims that he was a genius. What prevented me from giving this a one star review was the fact that there is a lot of information here. A critical analysis of that information would have made this a very fine book. Manchester could only repeat his dogma. If you worship MacArthur as a god, you will probably love this book despite its ponderousness. If you are trying to evaluate MacArthur's leadership, you may find it useful but difficult.John BeyerleinLiz & Dick"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Greatest General","review":"A great biography and a wonderful read. MacArthur was absolutely right on the Korean situation. He said the loss of Korea was a preview to the loss of Indochina and Tibet. North and South Korea are still officially at war. Truman's vacillation and indecision made it impossible for MacArthur to do his job. History has borne out MacArthur's concerns. Indeed, there is no substitute for victory."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for all Filipinos and Asians","review":"I am a 27-year-old Filipino today, and I was only a two-year-old toddler when this book was published in 1978. But just a mere six days of reading this book in December 2003 provided more than enough chunks of knowledge about Philippine history during the Second World War than from what I learned about it in 16 long years of elementary and even college education.Manchester's historical masterpiece 'American Caesar' should be a must-read in all scholastic institutions in the Philippines, at least. Sadly, like most Filipinos my age, I only learned about the real importance of Gen. Douglas MacArthur after reading this valuable work of history. The Japanese and other Asians touched by the values that MacArthur imparted almost 60 years ago are perhaps luckier to have recognized the teachings of the great American general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally engaging book about an awesome American.","review":"This is the first book everyone should read when trying to learn about America's greatest general. Was Gen. MacArthur an egomaniac? Yes, name me a general who wasn't. But in America's 'brief' history, you will not find a more intelligent, and courageous officer than this man. During WWI, his personal bravery and daring led to seven Silver Stars. During WWII, he lost less men in the southwest Pacific in four years of fighting, than Gen. Eisenhower did at the Battle of the Bulge alone! During the Korean war, at seventy years of age, his offensive at Inchon was the height of audacity and planning. He wrote Japan's postwar constitution, he is also revered by many Japanese to this day.All in all, his career is enough to make one say, \\"Patton who?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A complete guide.","review":"I first checked this out at the library.

Simply written and packed with instructions, this is an ideal book for those who are new to the process and need clear directions. I've not cooked with dried foods before so I like that this book also contains recipes for each dried food. I appreciate that the recipes are not so elaborate that one would have to use a lot of other kitchen tools and could be done in an emergency setting with limited utensils.

The author gives proceeds to help fund Little League clinics where money is in short supply. I figure, good cause, what the heck. It was like finding a a hidden treasure at a yard sale. Got half way through it and loaned it to our high school varsity football coach, who also coaches 7 and 8 year olds. He was equally impressed. He says it has even influenced how he relates to his high school football players. He gave a 5 minute commercial at our coaches meeting. Every coach left with a copy. I think it will turn out to be one of the best investments our league has ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Admirable Amature effort (possibly non-english author)","review":"This book is a fine effort by an amature writer, i admire how he was so dedicated in completeing it. He doesn't seem to understand that he created carictitures though (he thinks his characters were realistic). Sometimes i feel embarassed for the writer (possibly uneducated?), but he has probably acheived his dream.There is little humor here, or insight, or plot or character development; however it is good to see that this man's dream has finally come to fruition. This is in no means a \\"real\\" book, but it is a fine grouping of many words. This shows that anybody can write a book, and get it published as long as it has considerable amount of content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond","review":"This book is my favorite book of all time...okay im only fourteen so that may not be saying much but i loved it.

This book is in spots witty and clever, though it sorely lacks emotional maturity. The players are two-dimensional caricatures, too often confused by the author with real characters. Mr. Cadre shows a persistent loathing of all his literary creations, without the singular ounce of caring that would make the reader engage them. We don't care about the cartoon people, but we are frequently asked to take them so seriously as to spoil the campy fun possible here.The especially brilliant bits of humor would be better served in a fully-developed story. Sadly, the sense that this is a smart kid's whining session made Ready, Okay unbearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Effort","review":"Might be an interesting combination of the great and inept, if only there was something great to recommend it. Adam Cadre's first effort is turgid and forced. The caricature style of writing is always in your face, like an annoying little child seeking attention. It demands the reader to recognize the cleverness behind the inside references (and ultimately the author). What really shines through behind the cultural smoke and mirrors, is a lack of intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche...","review":"This is a new author that needs to work a little on his originality.

I let it sit and tried it again the next day and it seemed to work... but there's no way I'm keeping it.

Well one week later the plastic came off by itself and within that one day of wearing the watch without the plastic sticker, the silver rim had some hair line scratches in one area.

One glance of the clock could give a lot of information. Such as time, weather, day of the month, temperature. The projection also rotates so you can place any where in the room and still able to read them the right way. And it's not bulky so it does not take too much space.

My wife and I primarily use the clock to be able to see the time while in bed at night, and we don't really use the alarm, weather, or other features except the atomic time synchronization. The projected display on both clocks is way too dim to see with any lights on in the room, but it is great for our needs. The display projection on the WT5442U is not as bright or clear as the Ohio Scientific, but it can be rotated and swiveled which the Ohio Scientific couldn't.

For the temperature and the time this clock is great...for the weather prediction it is not very good at all. It keeps telling me that it is going to rain, about 2 times a week...and I live in Las Vegas. That doesn't make any sense at all.The Dual Alarm is easy to program, but isn't very loud.Lastly, the only major complaint is that the projection display...well...stinks. If the room is COMPLETELY dark it is great, and there are three different displays to chose from. If there is even a LITTLE bit of light it really makes the display hard to see. A tv or even the light from a computer screen can almost obscure the display totally. That is not good. It is my only real complaint.As an alarm clock this is excellent, light, sturdy and compact...but the projection and weather prediction keeps this from being 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product","review":"This item would be ok if you had 5 foot high ceilings.

Save your money to get other brands of brushes just work as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Rock history...","review":"I was lucky enough to catch the reformed Pirates in the UK on this series of tours, and they were without a doubt one of the best power trios I have ever seen.Mick Green is one of the most respected and influential guitarists in the history of Rock, easily on a par with the mighty Keith Richards, and 'live' he was just something else.While ironically, he had never played on the original recording of Shakin' All Over (it was a session guy filling in for Caddy) he is THE guitarist you associate with the song, and when I saw them in Leeds, England, Mick's 'Shakin' power chords seemed to be an intriguing blend of jazz and metal.The atmosphere was electric when I saw them, and that comes across in this superb set, in which at every gig, they had the audience eating out of their hands.These boys are the real deal, and their very existence is a fine tribute to the memory of the awesome Johnny Kidd, who sadly died in a car crash in 1966.This is as good as it gets, folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Ever PAP","review":"I have to agree with many other reviewers. After 30 years of reading comics of all genres, this was the absolute worst.Plotlines that don't follow consecutively, characters of worth appearing and dying straight away or leaving for ridiculous reasons. Characters with swords and \\"ninja stars\\" defeating towering metal tripods with advanced weaponry? Nonsense!Awful in every sense of the word.

That said, my wife has had a love/hate relationship with the thing since we got it. Most of the love goes (went?) to the 900 MHz phone, which worked great until the warranty expired. Most of the hate goes to the clock radio, which is not intuitive to set, has an alarm that plays for 10 minutes and then shuts off (heavy sleepers will snooze through this easily), and is generally lacking in features. And as I mentioned, now that the one year warranty has expired, the handset is having frequent problems connecting to the base. So we're in the market for a new unit - but this one had so much potential..."},{"rating":"1","title":"GH3062 Leaves a lot to desire","review":"Even though it's one of few dual alarm clocks with cordless phone, the design is pretty weak.

For the price...it's a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Features versus Quality","review":"My experience with this product is similar to other reviews here. The beeping---which occurs at times for no obvious reason---is incredibly annoying. But my major complaint is that the rechargeable battery has never kept a charge for very long, which means the handset needs to be in the cradle charging all the time. I've gotten 3 good years out of Uniden Ni-MH batteries but the SW Bell Ni-MH proved unable to hold a charge after a few months. Worse, I'm having trouble finding a replacement battery. At around $12 for such batteries I wonder if the unit is \\"totaled.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"THE TRUTH","review":"I bought a medium size of Maxi View.

Ok a response to the bad reviews. If you lack understanding or hate poetry don't buy this book. Thats why these people wrote bad reviews they have no understanding and are unable to think about these thoughts for longer than it takes to read them. As for me I totally get this book.

I just pulled it off the shelf again recently. This is not the first time I have read it. This book is worth more than a once over. For each day's meditation, there is one word, followed by the Chinese character. There is a short poetic verse at the top, which is followed by the meditation of the Taoist principle of the day. Each time I read the meditation, I find a different perspective. Everything always comes out fresh and new. The messages help to keep me focussed and centered. The book is the prefect size for a purse, brief case, or bag. I carry mine around.

It has taught me new ways to deal with life's ups and downs.On a deeply subliminal level it has improved how I think and address situations.I have bought this book as a present for my dearest friends and family.

I only read 5 days (one passage a day) and just felt like it wasn't what I expected. Maybe if I had given it more time? But life is too short to force through something you are not enjoying.All I am saying was it wasn't right for me. For you, it may be a different story.I highly recommend the Tao of Pooh.

Sun posted a Java style guide that was essentially the equivalent, but free. Equivalent in terms of topics covered while there were some noticable difference such as variable naming.One of the redeming qualities of the book though is that it can serve as a coding standard thus saving one from tidious chore of deciding on your own standards.

The CD is subtitled \\"featuring Roy Rogers\\", so we can assume that some of the songs were recorded pre-1938, since Roy Rogers left the Pioneers in 1937. I don't think it's safe to assume that Roy participates in all of the songs and we don't know on which songs Roy sings nor when he sang them. For a historic CD, this is very, very poor--how much effort would it take to copy the recording info in the liner notes? Tumbling Tumbleweeds is definitely not the original 1934 version, because I have the original and this isn't it. The original can be heard on the Country Music Hall Of Fame series and is much better than this re-recording--slower, more stirring tempo. Also the recordings are clean and the liner notes are good."},{"rating":"2","title":"nostaligia time","review":"I agree with the other customer reviews: this is a treaure-trove of early Roy Rogers and Sons of the Pioneers. I usually complain about more modern versions with their slick and overly lush accompaniment. No such complaints here! \\"Sparse\\" is the word that comes to mind for this disc--basically a fiddle, a guitar or two, and a stand-up bass. The version of Tumbling Tumbleweeds is different from the other versions I have by this group. I disagree with the one reviewer about Along the Santa Fe Trail. I didn't find it that bad, but I am convinced that the fiddle player was on a different page from everyone else. Probably not the best \\"starter\\" disc for this sub-subgenre (I'd recommend the Country Music Hall of Fame disc), but it's a pretty good supplement. Recommended to all aficionados."},{"rating":"2","title":"Americana at it's best","review":"There are some really great tracks on this.

Most of the selections are classic Western songs I remember from way back. Roy Rogers, with his fine singing voice, adds a lot to the performances. The reason I bought the CD was to get \\"Blue Prairie.\\" In my opinion this is an outstanding performance of the song, far superior to other Sons of the Pioneers recordings of the same thing. It has an undercurrent of Depression-era bitterness and heartache that gives the song more meaning. The tempo and instrumentals are perfect. It's evocative and haunting. This version of Blue Prairie also has slightly different lyrics than other versions I've heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold Stop-YES","review":"In 2005 I saw this tea in a health food store, bought it and tried it when a cold was starting up.

Chasing Furies' song is incredible, as well a Rebecca St. James remix (THAT is the kid who sang \\"Side by Side\\"????)

Lots of electronic mixing effects on most songs. It works rather well. However, some songs just don't quite come across right (read: It Is Well With My Soul). The studio version of Delirious?' \\"Come Like You Promise\\" (previously only available in a live version) saves this CD from a lower rating -- it's absolutely wonderful! Other stand out tracks include \\"Never Gonna Let You Go\\", \\"Omega\\", \\"Hallelujah\\", and \\"Spirit\\". Overall, a good CD, and worth purchasing if you're looking for a different sounding praise CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a painter paint brush","review":"The build quality feels great when you hold this in you hand. That is until you start painting. Not good for cutting a strait line. While the brush is supposed to be soft, the bristles are actually pretty firm. The softness comes from the length of the bristles which cause the brush to \\"flip\\" if too much preasure is applied. Perhaps the biggest problem is the brush is too thin and contributes to the sense of having a \\"lack of control\\". I've had Purdy brushes in the past that I have loved (painted professionally for years) but the last two I've purchased have not worked for my skill level (cutting in straight lines without tape). I am going to try to cut the brush down a 1/4 inch to see if that helps. If you a looking for a good 3 inch brush for cutting lines I still use my old but reliable Benjemin Moore brush.

Doctor Souchon's relatives and friends and anyone who might have heard him play at a party in New Orleans might find this CD interesting. The misleading title: \\"Early New Orleans Minstrel Days\\" would lead one interested in music of the minstrel period (1835-1875) to expect music of that era to be included. None of these selections fulfils that requirement. Furthermore, Dr. Souchon introduces his numbers with the frequent comment that the listener would never have heard the song previously. After listening to the songs it is obvious why that is the case -- they should have been left buried in the archives. This is one of those CD's that will not be played a second time. It has no saving graces but for the friends of the singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the three girls on the cover?","review":"This is one of those books where the author couldn't care less about lesbians, but the publisher realizes that girls-loving-girls sells, so they put three nude women intertwined together on the cover despite the fact that there are very FEW lesbian scenes in this book! I CALL THAT FALSE ADVERTISING! I was very disappointed as a result! It's an illustrated book largely filled with drawings of guys with their genitalia hanging out. Not erotic or even interesting.

Add that to his wit and charm, as he chit chats with the audience in between, and musical talent and this video is just superb.There is also a tribute to Frank Sinatra. The DVD includes the upbeat version of \\"Could It Be Magic.\\" As beautiful as the slow melodic version of that song is, the upbeat version is too cool. I don't know which version I love best.The DVD is done in such a way that you feel like you have a front row seat.

It is not very good at dealing with lay Mormons, nor does it go into the semantics game one has to play when dealing with Mormons.It does a great job of dealing how Mormons do their missionary work, which is a ridged seven step program. This book details the first four visits. It also tells one how to deal with the selling points of Mormonism, which essentially is relying on emotion (aka \\"burning in the bosom\\") to accept Mormonism.I was recommended this book along side of \\"The Mormon Scrapbook\\" by Dan Thompson. Thompson's book is a better primer on Mormonism than Hutchinson's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author is not an expert","review":"After reading the product description, I was very interested in finding an objective expert outside of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Mormons.

Falsified information.","review":"Having been a Mormon missionary myself, who served in Costa Rica for 2 years, and having read this book, I can say that it is full of half-truths. The author of this book claims to have been a missionary, however, his book is full of half-truths and lies about the process and \\"motives.\\" The motive of the mission is to convert God's children to what we believe is His church. That's it. There may be some missionaries who aren't as great as others, but I have been there, and know what it's all about. This book is not a valuable source of the truth, and is only worth reading if you are explicitly looking for that kind of thing. I can give any possible readers one thing to consider as you read this book (if you read this book)... consider the author's motives as you read. Think about what the author is trying to spin as you read. You will see and feel the dishonesty as you read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judge, Jury, and Executioner","review":"This is far and away one of the best anti-Mormon books I've read. That said, it isn't all that good. Ms. Hutchinson simply does not seriously engage Latter-day Saint arguments. She presents a very weak and uninformed version of the Mormon position, and then beats her straw man to a pulp, proclaiming herself the victor. I can't see how that would be very satisfying, and I certainly can't see how it would be very helpful to those whose primary goal is to understand rather than to score cheap points. Again, there are far worse books on the market, but that isn't much of a recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author has no clue whatsoever","review":"Janis Hutchinson has no clue as to what a Mormon Missionaries motivations are.

Having served a mission for this Church (not \`church'), I recognize that her supposed \`psychological research' into the psyche of Mormon missionaries is based on her own frustrations and shortcomings. The bottom line is if anyone is to know exactly what the Mormon missionaries preach then they should seek them out and listen. Reading a book about the supposed secret teachings and meanings of a \`cult church' is ridiculous; go to the source of the information (missionaries) then ask the Supreme Source of Truth (God) if the doctrines these young men and women teach are true. An anti-Mormon book will not inform or clarify; such a book will only confuse, disorient and make a sensible, good Christian into a judgmental heathen."},{"rating":"1","title":"the mormon missionaries an inside look at their real message","review":"This author sounds informed but she is not; her calling mormons a cult has gone out of fashion long ago. I presume she has a phd or some sort of degree and she relishes using her advantage over lesser trained people. She does not like Mormons for what ever reason and it is evident in her book. She lacks tolerance for anybody that may disagree with her. Mormon Missionaries are usually young males between the age of 19 and 25, and they pay their own way for 2 years to help the world find its way. They preach tolerance and love, something this author lacks.If she were up to date she would know that many antimormons do call mormons a cult any longer, only those who are woefully ignorant still refer to mormons as a cult, this author demostrates her ignoanorance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting alternative swim fin","review":"I use a split-zip fin for freestyle and dolphin kick swimming...but...needed a fin for breaststroke, my natural stroke.

Wet them first and then slip your wet foot in, otherwise, they might split.

Apparently, the author is writing a sequel and I just can't wait to find out what happened to everyone. Good job, Nichelle Tramble and all the best with the new book. You have a new fan!

I'm not sure if this was really a mystery/thrilelr because Maceo's thoughts about life seemed just as important. I was more curious to see how he would find out who he was.

Maybe 75% have the master bedroom on the first floor, which seems to be the style but I really don't like. Most of these plans are just standard plans with one or two changes to make them a little nicer. Also, a few of the plans looked like they had been photocopied too many times and had blurry lines. A few of the plans were printed so small that you could not read the room dimensions. Overall, I was not satisfied with this book.

Plus, at the time, the reviews here were overwhelmingly positive (a mystery to me now).What I found inside turned out to be a pretty dangerous book, to someone like myself who had no previous Win32 API experience. Every single API function and programming practice is as old as the first version of WinCE. Specific (and crucial) PocketPC functionality such as the SIP, new human interface guidelines, hardware buttons, you name it - it's just not there.

In the course of my career I have read Stroustrup, Design Patterns, Algorithm books, you name it. I have never, ever, seen a book this awful. Dr. (!) Krell preaches about the \\"subtleties\\" of pocket pc interface design. Patronizes about the importance of being a user in order to understand UI's. He constantly refers back to his little, custom developed GUI framework whenever he discusses building UI's for CE, but doesn't make it clear when the function is in the Windows API or his little framework. He generalizes in a chapter about just what good software architecture means. His steps are laborious and often humourous (\\"Step 1.

To believe that you can distinguish the quality of a program by one or two one-hundredths of a point staggers the statistical imagination.It is also somewhat incongruous to find that otherwise exceptional undergraduate colleges and programs, e.g. Dartmouth College or Amherst, find little or no place in either the undergraduate majors or overall. This suggests that there is a strong bias toward published research rather than the quality of teaching.Mr. Gourman could provide a much more useful service if he would rethink the purpose of an undergraduate education and revise his ranking system accordingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Wary!","review":"Rankings are rarely all that accurate, but this book is the least accurate college ranking there is. \\"Doctor\\" Gorman must have some connection to the Univ. of Michigan, b/c on several lists it is ranked unrealistically and thus suspiciously high.

She made some more recordings with Harry James in 1952, that are quite good, but those songs are not included here. I'd rather hear them than the two \\"Alternate Takes\\" on this Cd. But those alternates are good, I guess, for filler material. Regarding other \\"Reviewers\\" comments please bear in mind that as a solo artist Kitty recorded for other record labels, and these labels are still competeing with each other today. That is why those songs are not on this disc, see? Nice to see the Teagarden records issued on CD, even though that band didn't do well commercially. When Kitty joined Harry James in 1944, she might have been the best band vocalist out there.

It's easy to use and lightweight, but beware, use it with five sheets, no more, else you'll end up messing the paper. The blades are easy to change and the magnet makes the process safe.

If there was a way to give a negative ratingthis book would rate one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HOPE THIS AUTHOR IS A BETTER MASTER THAN HE IS WRITER","review":"This book is definitely not worth the money. I was so excited to read it only to be completely let down. If you take all of his e-mail correspondence out, between him and online submissives, the book would be less than 20 pages...and it's a 573 page book!!! You would be more pleased with the book BREAKING THE GIRL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading other people's mail","review":"This book was a great disappointment. Mainly, when you read this book, you're reading the e-mail of some guy who talks the talk and for we all we ever know, that may be all he does. Yeah, he includes a few good pieces of fiction, but that's not worth buying the whole book for. If you enjoy reading other people's boring mail, by all means this book is for YOU!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Machine","review":"I saw this machine demonstrated on the Rachael Ray Show.. Then I typed it in and found it here. I bought it about a year ago. It is very good for your spin, the movement you make with the handels are like swimming and somewhat like rowing. You do need to buy the videos with it to learn how to use it. It has helped strengthen my legs from a hip replacement. I love it, I also bought more coils and a bar, and the golf, boxing and baseball with it. and two more videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad home gym.","review":"I have the 1500 version of this item, which is very similiar. I upgraded to the power coils and they work very nicely. I am a frequent exerciser and I feel that it does as good a job, if not better, than other machines. It does work all the muscle groups and provides a good warm up. Some assembly is required, so once you start don't stop until it is finished. I recommend getting the power coils and the wall charts."},{"rating":"2","title":"gyro trainer","review":"As far as an in home unit is concerned, as a PRACTICE unit for follow up Gyrotonic Cobra instruction this suits the purpose. If you have not had any Gyrotonic instruction I would not attempt to use this machine. A few practical adjustments for those who start out, adjusting spring strength, and perhaps replacing them with pilates springs.This is a wonderful way to stay conditioned between classes, perfect my form and come to class without relapsing. If one follows the video, they will think this is an aerobic workout and be clueless to the correct positioning and movement of arms, legs torso and accompanying breathing which can only be taught by a skilled instructor.Overall I am happy that I have a home unit priced so economically when you think that the Cobra or Tower weigh in at over $5,000 plus s/h!!!$200 is a bargain....and one word of note....if you don't have the patience to assemble this machine you probably don't have the perseverance to learn Gyro!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"Product is excellent quality.

If you are looking for an intellectual stab that falls along the lines of bell hooks, Cornell West then I suggest you read something else. Ward's facts about Native portrayals in mascots, movies and general exploitation are dead on, but his commentary regarding those facts is hard to stomach. His recycled prose is tiresome. He comes off as a whiner and of course defensive. When you read one of his books, you have read them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disks Dont Work","review":"I have a Sony Handycam & Panasonic DVD recorder and neither read or write these disks.

Bad enough that I never reached the end. The first two chapters offered as a trial are intriguing and enticed the purchase, but I was mad at having spent over 4 bucks when I only made it 2/3's though.I read the other bad review and agree, the actions of the Hero leave a lot to be desired. If he only wanted a convenient wife, there was no good reason they shouldn't have married right away. The conflict was unsuccessful and unconvincing. Every conversation between the characters revolved around how they wanted to be truthful, they both loved the little girl...this situation made the heroine a little too saccharine...but he can't go through the risk of another woman dying...over and over and over.Nothing redeemed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really stupid with a HORRIBLE hero","review":"I can't believe I was duped into thinking this was a good book. I've ALWAYS shied away from Jillian Hart books and now I know why. She's horrible.Back in the day, an unwed, pregnant woman was called a harlot and her child a bastard. She was ostracized in society and so was the child. I'm suppose to believe Jacob, the \\"hero\\" is a good guy? She tells him upfront that she's pregnant and he just does nothing. Yet sneaks kisses whenever possible and plays and toys with her emotions. Letting her stay in town walking around unmarried and pregnant and get dirty looks from everyone?He's NOT a good, honorable man. He would have married her if he was. She was honest about her condition, sincere, kind and really showed much affection for his daughter yet he just let her walk around, expanding stomach and no ring on her finger.Horrible man. It's a shame he lived because men like that aren't worth $0.15.Run FAR away from this book and anything Jillian Hart."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst recording ever","review":"I agree with everything that has been said about this specific Orfeon recording.

From being the tragic girl desperately running after a man. And then she ran barefooted in the rain after Colin Firth. Almost as if she couldn't simply tell him the truth, see him for what he was and love that and had to debase herself as she had worked so hard to erase from her habits. Thats when the film really was a let down for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slick","review":"This \\"take off\\" on the Jane Austen classic, Pride & Prejudice, is a disappointment, and the portrayal of immoral behavior is an insult to Jane Austen. If movies were kept \\"clean\\", our young people would not think that immoral behavior is \\"normal\\". The world would be a better place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"Ren��e Zellweger plays a thirty-something single woman who is involved with the wrong man while she keeps bumping into the right man.The film has some very funny moments that we've all been through, including having to wear a totally inappropriate dress, resembling something your great aunt may have either worn or made from the slip-covers for her couch, picked out by your mother.I saw this film only because there was nothing else to watch. I was very pleasantly surprised at what a sleeper this was.If you're looking for something different, try this film. You may find yourself laughing out loud - rare enough in these times of films being held out as comedies but are nothing more than a cover-up for toilet humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious, juicy Bridget fun","review":"I must confess, I am something of a fanatic when it comes to both classic and new British literature. So, naturally, I loved the book Bridget Jones's Diary. I also loved the movie. Renee Zellweger was just sexy enough to let me believe that Hugh Grant and Colin Firth would fall for her, but bumbling enough to still be pure Bridget. This movie is worth seeing, even if you haven't read the book (and if that is true- shame on you! Buy it immediately!) If you are familiar with Pride and Prejudice, then you know how this one is going to turn out. It is an adorable romantic comedy, and it doesn't hurt that every time Colin Firth is on the screen he makes me melt. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"I appreciate the great service and the fact I was able to purchase it. It had been difficult to locate this DVD. The product was in perfect condition and the movie is even better than I had remembered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridget's one of us!","review":"Most single women can relate to at least a page or two out of Bridget's diary. Who, at one time or another, hasn't battled weight gain, a craving for cigarettes or fallen head over heels for the \\"wrong\\" guy? Even though Bridget and Mr. Darcy set off sparks from the beginning, the fireworks tend to create friction rather than romance; however, there's little doubt the two of them will eventually get together. Like a good friend, we \\"hold Bridget's hand,\\" as she discovers what a scoundrel Daniel Cleaver really is. Along the way, we meet her loyal, if somewhat loopy friends; her endearingly eccentric parents; and of course, the dreamy Mr. Darcy. Gather the girls around and spend a Friday night with a great gal pal, Bridget Jones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Smashing\\"","review":"Based on the Jane Austen novel, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\", starring Renee Zellweger, Hugh Grant, and Colin Firth (all three favorites of mine!), provides smart, hilarious entertainment to teens, 20-somethings, 30-somethings, singletons, and smug-marrieds! At the start of the new year, Bridget (Zellweger) decides to turn her life around by quitting drinking, quitting smoking, and only dating men who she and her friends deem worthy. Of course, the man she falls for, Daniel Cleaver (Grant), is anything but. However, is Mark Darcy (Firth) possibly more than a snobbish prick?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic movie","review":"My wife will never tire of watching this film.

One to keep and watch again when you need cheering up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Relationships","review":"Shows the problems of having a relationship and wanting to be married in todays culture. We are a divided society with some condeming the need for marriage and others saying it is the only way to go. B.J's Diary does an excellent job exhibiting the mental, physical, and emotional trials of a woman who wants a permanent married relationship. Well acted, written and directed.Very funny and somewhat sad at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, I suppose, but....","review":"Since when is size 12 overweight??? I thought Bridget Jones was supposed to be, well, fat. They made such a huge hype about Renee Zellwegger stacking it on for this role, but if that is what Hollywood thinks is fat, then normal women have no chance at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm glad my life isn't that eventful!","review":"This is a hilairious movie about an ordinary woman with friends and family- maybe not love though.

Renee Zelwieger is amazing and totally deserved her Oscar nod! Colin Firth just ooozes restrained sexual appeal and Hugh Grant makes a very good \\"cad.\\" Love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly female!","review":"Any true Colin Firth fan will love this romantic comedy. Renee Zellweger is a spot-on Bridget and other casting also great. Colin is a dashing Mark Darcy and we were cheering for him throughout! Not just for women...men who saw this also found the film very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Comedy - Recommended","review":"There were a lot of empathetic women in the audience who obviously enjoyed it thoroughly. However some of them were audibly baffled by anglicisms such as \\"wanker\\" & \\"poof.\\"Renee Zellweger's performance is excellent and her accent, to this ex-patriated Englishman anyway, flawless - if a little too upmarket for the role. Hugh Grant seems happy to hand over his customary tongue-tied female-dominated Brit routine to Colin Firth. The amount of cigarette smoking and foul language in the film seems excessive - until you go to a pub or wine-bar in the UK and realise that film's portrayal is entirely true to form.Not a 100% chick-flick, more like 65%, but thoroughly good fun nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good RomCom","review":"This movie has a group of three talented actors, including Hugh Grant playing against type as a cad/villian. Renee Zellweger does a terrific job as Bridget, and Colin Firth does his usual brilliant work. Thoroughly enjoyable, and a sort of iconic romantic comedy. It,s the kind of movie that's entertaining enough for repeated viewings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I love the book and am not quite sure why the movie even bears the same title. The story and some of the characters have been changed completely. If you haven't read the book, the movie might be more enjoyable, but it's difficult to know."},{"rating":"1","title":"actually less than one star..........","review":"Absolutely terrible movie... Totally american humor set in a british scene. Very strange..

I did too. WIN"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did the book no justice","review":"This movie is based on the book in only the loosest of terms. Sure there were occasional lines i recognized from the book and some parts matched up with the events in Bridget's life, but the whole script of the movie was so meddled with, it failed to convey the diary successfully. Needless to say, in the conversion process from book to screen, lots of events were left out and the events that WERE included were distorted. The acting was mediocre by both Renee Zellweger and Hugh Grant and the supporting actors and actresses. The only saving grace was Colin Firth's acting, but even then, his character's nature was tampered with by the directors till he was totally unlike Mark Darcy in the book.I say skip the movie.Read the book and use your imagination. You'll be far better off with what you can come up with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from seller NorAm International Partners, Inc.","review":"If zero were an option for this transaction, it would not be low enough. The DVD packaging looks fine. The DVD itself, or the content burned on it, is another matter. The video looks at though someone played the movie and captured it on camera. The entire shot is 1/4 of the screen and it bumps around as if you're on a ferry ride. I've never seen a poorer DVD in my life and I have a huge collection. Stay away from this seller! You've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware if you've read the books!!!","review":"I was very excited to see the movie after reading both Bridget Jones books. When I saw the video, though, I was disappointed. I understand that it's a movie and that they couldn't keep all of the good stuff, but there was almost none of the good stuff. Sure some of the scenes they kept in there (like the \\"Tarts\\" party) were well done, but there were some even funnier scenes in the book! I think her friends were only in one or two scenes, and the same with her parents. I don't know. Maybe it's just me, but I'm glad I saw the movie for free and didn't go buy it first, like i had originally planned on doing. Don't get me wrong. I think the actors and crew did a wonderful job with what they were given, I just think that there could have been more done with the script. So, I guess what I'd like you to know is that you should rent the movie first before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Adaptation","review":"I cannot believe Helen Fielding wrote this screenplay!!!! Did she intentionally ruin her own book? Unbelievable (and that fake accent is horrendous!). I saw this in the theatres and was tremendously disappointed; I rented it thinking maybe I had been too harsh in my original assessment; however, I disliked it even more after a second viewing. The book's plot is completely ruined here and, while the book is a little shallow, it was a fluffy, enjoyable read. Not so this movie. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth should be ashamed of themselves for being in this piece of trash (and if I'm not mistaken, wasn't Hugh Grant made fun of in the book?). I can't believe how many people praise this flick. It's quite possibly the worst adaptation of a book to screen I have ever seen. A complete waste of time. Let's hope there's no sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"Oh boy, talk about being fooled by reviews and this will be my top pick.

I loved it soooooo much! I've read the first book and loved it to! I'm reading the v.g. sequal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best fight scene EVER!!!","review":"This may be more of a chick-flick, but I can't imagine any woman out there NOT liking this film and wanting to watch it again and again. The fight scene is worthy of awards. Why this scene didn't win best fight scene on the MTV video awards is beyond me. The fight takes place in the street and in a busy restuarant with \\"It's Raining Men\\" by Ginger Spice. It is a MUST SEE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am crazy about Colin Firth!","review":"I loved this movie...it has it all. Renee was wonderfully irreverent. She said what most women only think about life, men, etc.I had never seen Colin Firth until this film and I almost didn't realize how fetching he was until the end of the movie. Greatly underplayed..I want to see more!Hugh Grant was great as the villain-it really fit him. I watched the movie twice and now I have to buy it. It's a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, good actors, but does no justice to the book","review":"The film flows very well (you do not get bored for a second), script is smooth and tight and maintains nice rhytm. All the leading cast is exquisite (and Hugh Grant looks so much better in the role of a heartless two-timing bastard than in his usual application of an oh-so-cute puppy-eyed stammering British nancy-boy), the British home counties accent of the Texan Renee is accomplished and good jokes abound.However, the book on which it is based is so much more complex and intriguing. It is not the fault of this movie: only so much plot can be crammed into a limited time, and I should have known better than watch a film based on a book when I know already what's in the book.It will make a very pleasant evening watch, maybe one day you will rent it again, but I would think twice before adding it to my DVD collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly a Renter","review":"I was so excited for this movie to come out on DVD. I rushed to my local video store, and forced my husband to watch it with me that night. What a disappointment! I am a huge Renee Z. and Colin Firth fan, but was sorely let down by this movie. Bonus material was cute, but I will not be adding this DVD to my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvinile","review":"The 'plot' is weak and one dimensional so don't expect intrigue and sophistication. If you find sexual inuendo and bad language entertaining then you may enjoy this movie. I'm no prude and can cuss up a storm with the best (or worst) but I find the use of four letter words in a public display distastful. The sexy part was quite amusing; it was the language that made me squirm. The movie didn't need it and it would have been 10 times better without the anglo-saxon expletives."},{"rating":"1","title":"love the story, but hate the talk","review":"why they have to take a great movie like this and stick such nasty in it I will never understand.....makes me sick, I am giving it away...it has F this to much for me......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous Movie.","review":"Why would I care to watch a movie about a pudgy British Twit whining about her weight and her sexlife for two hours??? PURE TORTURE!! Another silly \\"Men Bad, Women Good\\" movie that fails to even come close to the quality of a Lifetime Movie-of-the-Week. One reviewer got it 100% correct: Women and Men view relationships in totally different ways; we stopped trying to find princess charming a long time ago, we can \\"hit it\\" and leave - women in general can't (Why women would want to mimick this canine behavior is beyond me). They also see movies differently, I can't think of any guy who could sit through this mushy mess without out laughing out loud or walking out in disgust, or both. What's worse, Hugh Grant tries to act in this film - BLECH!!Not even John Woo could've saved this dreck from stinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"brigette jones diary","review":"wonderful movie of the year, must see,funny and i love the story itself, renee zellweger is amazing.i highly recommend this movie, see it with friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of all the hype.","review":"Cannot believe the excellent reviews this movie got! I found it boring, stupid and absurd. Hugh Grant looks old and tired, the latter may have been after reading the script. He needs to fire his agent for choosing this movie, after having done some good roles in 'Four weddings and a funeral' and 'Nine months'. Zellweger is pathetic, so is Colin Firth. Overall, just a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money...","review":"Bridget Jone's Diary has to have been one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Renee Zellweger's performance was weak at best. The only time the film was the slightest bit funny was when Bridget was being made a fool of and when Hugh Grant was being a male showvenist, which isn't all that funny. Don't waste your time or money on this terrible film. The genre of the british love comedy has been done to death."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ..............","review":"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.............SORRY DID I MISS ANYTHING CAUSE THE FILM tiring I HATE THIS FILM!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HIDEOUS, DISTASTEFUL, AND LAME","review":"I wish there were a ranking BELOW 1 star. That was what my wife and I wanted to rank this movie. It was such an awful movie. It was quite simply the worst movie we ever watched.....actually couldn't stomach more than the first third.

What a waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a poor movie!","review":"Ren��e Zellweger is far to be an actress and despite all her efforts she can not hide a total lack of talent. She is never really credible. Although Hugh Grant only plays a small part, you can see that he weighs on the movie, creating an umbalance.Please do not fall in the marketing blabla that followed the release of this poor movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie to watch again and again","review":"I watched this movie in the theatre having not read the book at all but I was rolling the entire time. It's wonderful, sweet and funny. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are so easy on the eyes. I read the book and watched Pride and Prejudice shorty after seeing this in the theatre and now I'm hooked. This dvd can be put in on a rainy day and you'll laugh at the jokes many times. Renee is very lovable as Bridget. The special features were a bit disappointing but other than that I would recommend this dvd to anyone who loves lovable comedies."},{"rating":"2","title":"The hilarious truth about women","review":"This movie is so funny because it tells the truth about what women think about men, and other day to day activities that we go through. The thought process that Bridget Jones goes through when getting dressed for her date, every women will completely relate to it. This story is about an ordinary women trying to get past her self-esteem issues, and is trying to feel sexy, even on the days when she doesn't. Bridget Jones could be your best friend, or even you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie ever made about the troubles of a woman!!","review":"Where do I start?I loved this movie, I have watched it 10 times...I even baught the movie when It came out on video. It is a modern day retelling of the best Jane Austin book, Pride and Prejedice. It is truely a beautiful story about 30something woman, who has never had a break in love. Everytime she thinks it will work out in the love life or even in her family life... It always goes wrong. But at the end, it truelly shows how love and life can work out and how fate has a funny way of playing tricks on everyone of us. It is truelly heart warming, and if you are a single, overweight female over the age of 21, with romantic problems this movie will relate to you in ever level.I truelly believe this to be one of the best movies I have ever personally seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Bridget, Just as She is!","review":"I have to confess that the primary reason I saw this hilarious movie was because of the casting of Colin Firth in the modernized role of Mr. Darcy inspired by the Jane Austen classic, Pride & Prejudice to which he also played the mysteriously deep Mr. Darcy. Colin Firth was well casted as the charming gentleman and hero in this romantic comedy. Renee Zellweger was brilliant with her witty and fun characterization of Bridget Jones. I feared that as a native Texan, Renee would fail to accurately portray the tarty and tongue-tied English marm but Renee pulled the role off convincingly. Hugh Grant was perfectly cast in his role as the manipulatively charming Daniel Cleaver. I look forward to the sequel and recommend this comedy to anyone who enjoyed the classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly over-rated","review":"Obviously there's no accounting for taste. How and why so many people spoke well of this movie is very puzzling to me. The story is [bad], beginning with the fact that the story-teller first convinces us how empty Bridget's life is, then has someone fall in love with her without identifying why and which qualities in her he admired, or even exist.The story is thin, the acting weak. I don't understand why the British were upset that an American actress played the lead role..."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BOOK IS BETTER","review":"OK.. i was so desapointed when i saw the movie. some of the most important scenes were cut out and the ending is not like the book. the cast was amazing but if u read the book you wont enjoy the movie... AGH! So many lost scenes.. i i could rate this at negative numbers i would... i still think u should watch the movie though cuz the cast is amazing.."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Movie","review":"This is my absolute favorite movie in the world. Bridget is a woman for every one of us who have ever felt stupid, needed to lose 15 pounds, drank too much at one sitting, suffered through our parents' nuttiness or vowed to change ourselves in a year's time. Renee Zellweger does an absolute smashing British accent and is absolutely hilarious. Hugh Grant is hysterical if not maddening as Bridget's womanizing boss with whom she has a fling, and Colin Firth as Mark Darcy, the man Bridget is attracted to while at the same time vowing how much she hates him, is simply to swoon over. The language is a bit raw, but it adds to the hilarity. If you need a laugh or need a not-so-perfect fellow female to relate to, settle in with this film. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"barely Average","review":"having watched this film recently i was told that Zellweger was doing a British Accent&that alone got my attention.first of all just like Hugh Grant I Find Him&Her 3rd Tier Actors.neither too me can carry a film&this is living proof.this film has some ok moments but the cliche Songs that Pump up Zellweger makes this film another Average film at best.it just didn't really move me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sweet comedy.","review":"Anyone who fell in love with the book will want to check out the film version.

Phew. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of fluff","review":"I have read the book \\"Bridget Jones Diary\\" probably about ten times since the summer and loved it everytime. After watching the film I see they've killed the book. Despite having an excellent cast they have made the characters completely 2-dimensional. The script writers seem to have edited every bit of humour out of the book and have turned it into a cheesy romantic 'comedy' for the late twenties age group. My only advice for anyone who is interested in seeing this film is buy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this","review":"I love this movie! First of all I adore Hugh Grant, and his wit hits a homerun in this movie. But, I am a huger Zellweger and Firth fan as well.Who does not love the way Bridget seems to always mock, and humiliate herself, yet win people over in an instant. She's a true underdog, but a loveable character looking for love...and bullocks....trouble, and moritifying moments always seem to find her. I can watch this movie any day of the week and laugh. Plus, it has a great soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good movie, but can't compare to the book","review":"Renee Z. does a FAIRLY convincing job of portraying my favorite British heroine, however, that Texas accent still shines through now and then.

Even Colin Firth could'nt save this one for me! On its own I found it sadly lacking in just about everything I look for in a romantic comedy including romance and humor. If you are a true Pride and Prejudice fan, I recommend buying the BBC series and the 2005 movie version. Both are excellent. I would'nt waste my time again with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"It's the worse movie I ever seenIt's stupid and boring.The plot was awful and long ,there is no action and it's no funny too.The actor act very badly, and they seem stupid particularly Bridget Jones.If you find sexual innuendo and bad language entertaining then you may enjoy this movie.Absolutely terrible movie, so don't buy it!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie - not for guys.","review":"This movie is not for guys. I love movies and I was totally irritated by this movie. There wasn't one good thing I can write about this movie. I have always disliked the actress who plays the title character, but I wanted to see what all the buzz was about. Well, let me spare you some money- I would not see this movie if I get paid to do so. It was waste of time (I saw at on DVD). None of the DVD features impressed me.Movie Rating: -2* out of 10* (Worst movie in couple of years)DVD Rating: 3* out of 10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie Ever!","review":"This movie will make you laugh, any woman can find something to relate to with Bridget. She has made many a weekend great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pride and prejudice for real girls","review":"i recently saw the a&e adaptation of pride and prejudice and loved it. it made me realize how rare girls like liz bennett are, who are beautiful, smart, and virtuous. now we have p&p for real women. bridget jones is no liz bennett. she's not too smart, not too pretty, and virtuous??? well, whatever she's not, she is your typical woman of the 21st century. and what she lacks in bbv, she makes up for with a kind of open-hearted, scatterbrained charm. the story bears some resemblance to p&p, particularly the mark darcy character who is played by the same fellow who played fiztwilliam darcy, i mean colin firth, who by the way is still wearing the same long sideburns. it's lighthearted, improbable, sometimes sputters a bit, and is no p&p. but it's a good movie for a rental when you're tired of watching p&p for the 99th time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entirely enjoyable chick flick","review":"Bought this one for my wife for Christmas and must say that I really enjoyed it.

Not that there\`s anything terribly wrong with that, but with such praise I expected something better and more original. Well, actually I didn\`t, as this type of flick always follows the same routine. This british comedy is neither better nor worse than \\"Notting Hill\\" or \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\", managing to deliver a decent enough story with competent acting and a couple (not many, actually) funny moments (just funny, far from hilarious). Ren��e Zellweger is an ok actress, but I don\`t really see why so many claim she\`s so excellent. She\`s appropriate to the role, not terrific, and her character is nothing more than a \\"been there, done that\\" stereotype about the modern woman. Overall, this movie is an average and harmless comedy, watchable on a boring weekend afternoon and forgettable for the most part.A typical chick flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book!","review":"Renee Zellweger as Bridget Jones? With all of the fine British actresses who could have played this part they chose Renee Zellweger? She is not, by any stretch of the imagination, an acceptable Bridget Jones. It is a travesty- a scandal really. Love Hugh Grant, love Colin Firth, but this movie stinks...If you really want to experience the charm and the hilarity of Bridget Jones please read the book. This movie is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly Diary","review":"Ren��e Zellweger is cute, but pretty FAT here. My wife usually likes this kind of movie, but she also admitted it was pretty silly.

One of those rare cases in which the book falls short of the movie. The book: I just wanted Bridget to quit kvetching and obsessing about every single thing and get on with her life; it was too repetitive. The Movie: charming! A lot had to do with the actors: Renee Zellweger, Hugh Grant, and Colin Firth.It's hard to steal a movie from Grant, but Zellweger manages to do it by playing an inept misfit in society, always foot-in-mouth, off key, dressed wrong - and lusting after the wrong guy. Just in case you haven't see it or read other reviews, I won't mention who the wrong guy is.Order a pizza, pour a beer, kick off your shoes, and have a fun evening. It's not great cinema (and it sure wasn't great literature), but it's way fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute and funny","review":"Hug Grant in a diferent role here.

I watched it 3 times already, and I just got it last week. I'm in my early 40's, so I didn't know if I'd like it too good. But it was just the opposite! My husband liked it too. Renee is fantastic, and really a very talented actress. She was in every scene in the movie, and that's good!! .Go buy it, you'll love it. I promise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridget Rocks the World","review":"This was an incredibly engaging and terribly realistic perspective of a single girl's struggle with life in her 30s.

This is a classic tale of maybe not getting exactly what you want, but instead what you need. Colin Firth as always, delivers a dignified yet endearing performance. His characters haughty exterior gives way to a good and gentle soul.This movie was great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To Brigid - who we love just the way she is!","review":"Don't miss this movie. It actually is funnier to me each time I watch it. And I won't reveal that number as it's a tad embarrassing! Of course it's a chick flick and though the ending is quite predictable as are most chick flicks - the beginning to end content is ridiculously funny. You'll find yourself actually embarrassed for poor Brigid and maybe even relating to her tragedies - Is there a Brigid in you? Watch it and find out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie based on Real Life!","review":"I liked this movie so much! Everything was so realistic, not \\"hollywood\\" type. And it was funny, and a fast movie. Plus I love the british accents. Renee Zellweger did an excellent job, totally beleivable! Recommend seeing this with girlfriends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hysterically funny","review":"In Bridget Jones' Diary, Colin Firth plays essentially the same character he did in the BBC production of Pride and Prejudice- even with the same name. However, here he manages to create an entirely different character- modern, and marvelous to watch. Renee Zellweiger is hysterically funny as Bridget herself (having had to gain 30 pounds for the role), as she tries to sort out troubles with her love life, work life, and family life. I also enjoyed Hugh Grant as Daniel Cleaver, playing the bad boy for once.The movie, however, is absolutely nothing like the book, so diehard Bridget Jones fans, beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie!","review":"I absolutely loved this movie from start to breathtakingly sexy finish. Colin Firth is strong and very sexy. It's funny, sweet, sexy, witty, and intelligent. The fight scene between Hugh Grant and Colin Firth is hilarious! Picture two educated, proper Englishmen, duking it out wildly in the street, while retaining their ever-so-polite manners. The only criticism, is that Hollywood backed off of making Bridget even slightly overweight. She doesn't look anorexic, but she is definitely not the chunky Bridget Jones of the novel! The chemistry between Renee and Colin is great. I very RARELY actually buy movies, since there aren't many that I would actually want to watch over and over. This is definitely one to buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I wanted","review":"I love these movies and for some reason only had the second one at home.

Renee Zellweger did an great job playing Bridget & I really forgot that she was not British! Colin Firth & Hugh Grant are good in this movie as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too funny!","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. Although the screenplay is not as true to the book as I would like, the spirit is the same. Plus who else could play Mr. Darcy (any Mr. Darcy) better than Colin Firth? If you enjoy this movie, you will most likely enjoy A&E/BBC's adapatation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, also starring Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy. (Both screenplays were adapted by Andrew Davies). Super movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Movie!!","review":"This had to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.

AND you can crop photos right in the camera, e-mail them from the camera (if you plug it into a computer) and even get bigger memory cards. Mine came with a 128 mb card, and it holds about 60 photos when set to highest quality. Also came with a carrying case, a USB cord, and a battery charger. I've loved it since the first time I tried it, and couldn't pass up the deal of just $199 with a 1 year warranty! Best camera I've ever had.

The quality of the photos is certainly NOT 7 mega pixels in my own opinion. I told my 10 year old she could have this camera for her very own and went and bought myself a Sony 10.1 mega pixel Cybershot, and she comes and gets the Sony when she wants to take a picture or make videos. If you are seriously considering purchasing the Samsung, please by all means reconsider!!! You would love the Sony 10.1 mp Cybershot and the video quality is just as good as a camcorder!

Other parts, however, lapse into overstylized and musically tasteless excesses, especially on some of the solo parts. Plane Wreck at Los Gatos is well done. Fans of Judy Henske may want to get this disc given how little material she's recorded over the years (although most is now in print for the first time in decades). Overall, though, not worth the sum of its parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noble Experiment","review":"This group was hastily put together so Dave Guard could fulfill his contract with Capitol Records, and it shows. For one thing, Judy Henske's strident voice is an acquired taste which I must admit I never acquired.

I don't call it trivia, even though the title does, since, as the author notes, George Will said \\"Correct thinkers think that 'baseball trivia' is an oxymoron: nothing about baseball is trivial.\\" Laid out in paragraph form, instead of the usual question and answer form, it frees you from trying to think of answers that you'll never guess.

The Samaritan's plodding, meandering storyline with improbable/illogical plot points does not hold anything to the film noir of yesteryear. The only twist(spoiler alert) was incest and that was played for cheap effect. Do not pay 9.99 or even 13.50(if you live in NYC) to see this movie. I wonder if Sam might have dropped a bit from the 1% in having to do movies like this.

It takes a while to seal, and won't seal if it's not on high heat, so it's hard to make food you can burn, like rice. I think this is because it has safety features not found on old pressure cookers, but perhaps more expensive brands/models don't have this flaw. It's also hard to figure out how to use. The pressure valve label is confusing to some - the correct positioning is 180 opposite from what it appears. Only cooks at 8 psi and 12 psi, not 15 psi (250F), so it requires about 20% more cooking time (at 12 psi) than a 15 psi cooker. Didn't realize this when I bought it. For the $[...] I paid, it is OK.

For example, reading #45 says, \\"Every self-centered person is a self-disrupted person. Nothing happens to him-he does something to himself.\\" That is all you get from Bishop Sheen for that holy hour! The compiler then gives you a little verse from the book of Proverbs. No day's reading is more than a short paragraph. Bishop Sheen wrote such an abundance of material that someone could do a much better job of compiling 120 Holy Hour Readings from all his books.

After speaking with him (a very well educated person who attended liceo classico - Italian high school focusing on grammar, literature, history, and philosophy) and other Italians, I found that the stories in this book are for very advanced students who can already speak Italian.Many of the words in these old stories are no longer used in speaking today.

To me it is an intellectual exercise where 1 word is stretched to about 200 words. The author is very much anal (literal) focused and for some reason likes to write about rats. One story, which had nothing to do with anybody who was abused as a child, details how to kill a man by using a rat. Huh?If you're like me and want to understand the inner healing necessary to get beyond the past then I don't think this book is helpful. If you want to know the inner nuances of Oedipus and Orwell, or need to discuss Freud for some reason then there is some secondary value.I particularily did not like the fact that he took the book's name from an earlier child abuse book, which I thought was tremendously better written and more to the point.So, while I consider the time I spent reading this book as wasted and worse, I am glad I got it in the used bin for $5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the worst GBA game to date","review":"If its not the worst, it sure gives NFL Blitz and Mortal Kombat Advance a run for their money.

Passing, shooting, and running animations are so similar, its hard to know who even has the ball sometimes....yet somehow I built a 10-point lead in the first quarter.And the audio...Oh God, the audio.....Whoever had the brilliant idea of making the announcer say \\"Well received!\\" after 90% of passes should never be allowed near a video game's production again...EVER.Half-court shots and winning by 100 were more fun in Double Dribble for NES. This game is just annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I bought this game based partially on reviews that I read here.Describing NBA Jam 2002 as disappointing would be an understatement.

Really a big dissapointment, I would recomend you save your 30 dollars"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to NBA Jam?","review":"This game doesn't even compare to the old ones. There is no create a player and the peoples stats are all messed up.

The first time I fired it up I thought \\"This is awful.\\" I put it away in disgust. I've since tried to play (and like) the game 2 more times but I am in awe at how gawd-awful the graphics and more important the gameplay is. And like another reviewer mentioned I bought this game because of the positive reviews posted here on Amazon.com. Methinks there're people with a wicked sense of humor who enjoy the company of misery or it's one of the marketing folks from the makers of this putrid NBA Jam 2002 \\"port\\" or whatever you want to call it.

When I sent mine in I recieved a letter back stating that the card was placed in error and no unrated version of the film exists, just the R version that I had already purchased.

All he did was drink and waste away, and that's not attractive. And all Christy did was lie over and over, and that was most cruel.The endless love scenes are more repetitive than anything and all in all, not a book I enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable and entertaining read","review":"Courtesy of A Romance ReviewA Taste of Sin is the first book in Connie Mason's Sins Series following with A Breath of Scandal and A Touch So Wicked.

While Mason's previous works have all been good reads, I found the immaturity of this heroine very hard to stomach. Sinjun was also less well-developed than I would have liked. The secondary characters were much more interesting. This is not to say that I am sorry I read the book... Mason has real talent, and gave me some very good moments. I just wished there had been more of them. Could the romance writers out there please offer a few more characters like Anne...instead of these infantile females paired with men a decade older? Oh for another lead character like the one in Roberta Gellis' \\"A Woman's Estate\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My first disappointment from Connie Mason","review":"I am a huge fan of Connie Mason, having read most of her other novels. I was disappointed with this one, having to make myself finish it. A great story line, but little character development and an unbelievable love. The characters aren't likable and the female lead is downright stupid at times, constantly making dumb decisions and ignoring easy solutions. The hero of the story starts off extremely shallow and only partially redeems himself in my eyes. Their love isn't believable and far from convincing.While I still love Connie Mason for daring to go where other authors won't in her earlier novels, I can't recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":":0)","review":"A very good and entertaining read for me personally.

After playing ASB on PS2, I was totally dissapointed and felt let down on how a game could look so good, yet play so awful! Well, fear not my fellow game cubers. Baseball has arrived to the next generation of video gaming. This game not only looks great, but Acclaim has fixed MOST of the bugs that caused the PS2 version to be dissapointing. The reason I'm not giving this game a perfect 5, is because it has it's own little things that stand out from being perfect. Ex: Fielders will blend into the ballpark walls to catch a fly ball, pitchers do not have to be warmed up, and outfielders seem a bit too fast. They have fixed the pitchers speed to be more realistic, and the broken bat feature is a must to see. So lets all rejoice and welcome back ASB back to Nintendo and the gamecube!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Get This Game","review":"Do not get this game! The graphics are really bad. The crowd is paper thin yet the picture on it looks 3-D. Not what I would expect from a Gamecube. The controles are confusing. I don't understand the concept of hitting the ball, you get the little triangle shape on the ball and it moves when you have no chance of hitting it. The main screen print is almost so tiny I can barely read it. The sound is not that bad. Its basically the best thing about the game. Overall, the game royally sucks so don't get it!

The Rookie mode is way too easy, and the Veteran mode makes outfielding (because of the camera angles) impossible.

All I can say is WOW!! The N64 version rocked, and this new version is WAY BETTER. The graphics are the best I have ever seen in a video game. The players look REAL. The stadiums look REAL. The animation, the mascots, etc...all look real. The hitting has a new improved 3-D icon we are already familiar with, and the pitching now lets you choose up to 6 different pitches, while other pitchers only have 2 to choose from. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good graphics, but....","review":"I'll start off by saying that the graphics are really good for this game. But, there are major flaws. First, the hitting is darn near impossible. I'm in the middle of the season and I'm second to last in the ML in hitting. It's really hard to time the ball and predict where the ball is going to end up. But, the flip side is that the pitching is good. I'm leading the ML in that. It's not hard to get strikeouts and the strike zone for the most part is fair and you will get the pitch called if it even hits the corner of the plate. Autofielding is not bad expcept that when a ball is hit against the wall, the other outfielders end up fielding the ball instead of the outfielder where the ball was orginally hit and the runner will end up on third. I would have given it more stars, but the lack of hitting is really flawed and terrible in this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so realistic","review":"Not very realistic at all. If playing against the computer and you are ahead your players start to make errors on routine plays. At times some players won't even make a play on the ball. Even your relief pitchers leave the ball hanging over the plate when you are ahead. Also the commentary just plain stinks, it is very repititious which quickly becomes boreing. I suggest you wait for a different baseball game and rent this one until then."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Game Is sooo Bad!!","review":"THIS IS A HORRIBLE GAME.

Good construction, great quality of materials, and really nice leather in the band. It looks great and has a large face (for those of us over 40). The one gripe I have is that the design of the leather band's connection to the watch case does not allow the watch band to lay flat on my wrist. Maybe I have a larger, flatter wrist but this raises the watch off of my skin to the point that this watch fits better when it is sitting on the inside of my wrist - around the curve.This is NOT a fatal flaw, just an annoyance.

You will notice small things like the Hoth Soldiers running around and much more.(5/5)Challenge level-This is a tough game and will have you wanting to throw your GamCube out the window. After you get passed that though, what you have is an awesome game.(4/5)Sound-Maybe the best part of the game, the voices are amazing and the music really get you into it.Comments-The only gripes I have about this game is that it can be a little challanging.

So trying to take down an enemy is pretty difficult. Second the playable views in the game aren't very user friendly and tend to become very awkward at times. The third and probably the most disappointing aspect of this game is its lack of good game play. The missions become repetitive and boring after awhile. So if you looking for a good title for your Gamecube try NHL Hitz or Tony Hawk. DON'T buy this one rent it and save yourself the (money)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best!!","review":"There is no better star wars game on the planet than rogue leader. The graphics are almost exactly like the movies and the play is so much fun. I definitely recommend this game to all star wars fans and shooting games fans alike!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty game, but Xwing had better gameplay","review":"Granted, this game is pretty, but it just hasn't sucked me in the way the XWing did. This game is a shooter, and the controls aren't really that intuitive. You have very little control over your speed, and the missions haven't excited me either. The game's difficulty ramps up rather quickly.I preferred the old X-Wing style _simulator_ experience. I wish that LucasArts would produce another title in that series. With modern graphics technology, it would be beautiful as well as fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream Come True for Star Wars Phanatics","review":"This game is great!! It has so much replay value you'll fall in love with the missions. It is worth every dime of your money. There are so many hidden features that you can unlock it's unbelievable!

It has great graphic though and somewhat fun gameplay. but i dont like it that much.Other than that its a great game for star wars fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor game","review":"This game was one that was hyped for at least a year by the magazines. After playing previews, magazines still gave good hype. Finally played it....bad stuff!! Very slipshod game play, lack of control of fighter craft, vague mission. Almost impossible to get gold medals, short game hides behind gold medals and statistics, asking you to replay the game over and over to attain performance results improvements.What we have here is a substandard shooter, not up to even the old \\"defender\\" or gradius games. Great background graphics covering a very poorly thought out gameif you want a brilliant game, try \\"Metal Gear Solid2\\"...even has some shooting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron II","review":"Wow. This game is just awesome. Graphics, sound, gameplay, control. All just mesh together so well. It took a huge crew of top geniouses to create this game. I couldn't believe how great the explosions were, the music was, and the controls. You feel like you're in the game actually when you're playing it and that's what i call a perfect game. I can feel this game. The built-in rumble feature needs to be mentioned too. I didn't think this game would be as good as it was. I recommend you get it pronto."},{"rating":"2","title":"The second best reason to get a Game Cube","review":"At first I had no clue what I was doing but when I looked for help on a walkthrough I became hooked. The game looks just like a movie and the music and action is nonstop.At first I was reluctant to buy it because I thought the only thing you did was fly a plane and shoot other planes but when I read you can fight against imperial walkers I knew I had to use my [money] to buy this used game. It makes you appreciate the movies even more and it's fun to play again and again. You have to use a bit of strategy and the game makes you use your head a lot and I think thats why the game is so popular with critics and teenagers. The only game cube game better than this one is the much loved Super Smash Bros Melee. Both games are must haves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game, but all Star wars lack 1 thing","review":"This game is really fun, but i think everyone agrees with me when i say that Star Wars needs to make a multiplayer game. This game is sumwhat difficult, its extremely hard to get Gold medals but simple in getting bonus ships. The graphics in this game are terrific(thats why i developed the habit of shooting down tie fighters)and the imperial At-Ats die in a whole new way. If you do decide to get this game, be aware that in the Battle for Endor, ties will keep ramming you making it harder to fight the 2 Star Destroyers at the end of the level."},{"rating":"2","title":"blow em up masterpiece","review":"This games is filled with action and many surprises. In the game you are either luke,wedge or in one of the secret levels darth vader! The games has a stratigic style to it and a numerous amount of ships to be and unlock like slave 1 and the imperial shuttle. the games has great graphics and you wont get bored. you beat it in about3-7 months and after that can unlock the secrets, all in all the game is one to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over all good game","review":"This game is an overall good game.

I recomend buying it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rouge Leader for NGC","review":"This is a great game. Graphics and sound are great. Why I gave it four stars is because some parts of the game are really tough, specifically the Battle of Endor level (you try blowing up three star destroyers with an a-wing) and the last level.

If you love Star Wars, get this game. If you love space shooters, get this game. Graphically, you can't beat it. The enemy AI is excellent and the need to get to the next mission or get a better medal really pumps up the replay value.The only gripe I have is that it is based exactly on the 64 game engine; same menus, ship select hangar (you walk Luke or Wedge to his ship in this one), if you run out of lives it's back to the start menu, then to load game, the mission select, ship select and finally to the mission. Now with all new load times! Which really aren't that bad, but it's still annoying. Even one level is nearly same. It all makes the game feel played already.But it does haves TONS more action, nifty little surprises, and looks and sounds spectacular. Besides, it's Star Wars, what more reason do you need to get this game?"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you think what you saw at the store looked OK, just wait.","review":"6 StarsI played furiously for about an hour trying to complete thefirst level (just rented the game had no instructions.)I thought the first level was incredibly well depicted it puts you right into the final confrontation of the first star wars film.What came next blew me away.The second level in this game is the most beautiful, realistic star wars based space game I have ever experienced.This IS the LAUNCH Title to get.Forget PS2 or Xbox, Nintendo is VIDEO GAMES leading edge anything else is just a CD, DVD or PC impersonating as a video game machine.\\"Quality over Quantity\\" is Nintendo's motto and it definitively shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS TITLE IS GOING TO BE A # 1 HIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1","review":"O.K, let me say that this game is the best game I have ever played in my life.

Buy this now."},{"rating":"1","title":"All hype, no substance","review":"Like the new Star Wars movie, this game insults the Star Wars franchise with a sloppily put together production and buggy gameplay. The graphics is second-rate compared to top PS2 or Xbox games, and the action gets tedious after the first level. Basically I see very few redeeming values in this game and it's an insult to both Star Wars and the GC."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best GameCube Game!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"If you like rouge sqadren for n64 and Loved BATTLE for NABOO then youll love this game!!!you can even change veicals in the middle of a levle if your battrey power of your ship gets low. this IS the best, take it from some one whos been to e3 and played it!It got 11 awards!! the music it fully orcestrated and can be hooked up to a sterio.

ITS AWSOME!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Red leader standing by !","review":"Ever dream of challenging a Star Destroyer or TWO Star Destroyer or see what it feels like to be Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, or the mighty Wedge Antilles?, if you have then this is the game for you. It even covers famous levels from the trilogy such as Death Star, Hoth, Bespin, Endor Battle, and even DEATH STAR 2! The graphics are much more advanced than Rogue Squadron for N64 and every turret and building on the Death Star to the cockpit instrument panels of your ship has been highly detailed. It's amazing that how many enemies can be on screen at once. Rogue Leader features you playing as the rebels or even several Empire mission where you be Darth Vader in his personal TIE ADVANCED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rogue Leader","review":"i got this game on christmas when i got my gamecube and i must say that it is a good game with a few major flaws. the first thing is that most of the missions involve protecting some stupid transport from ties. the missions ger frustrating because the transport is always weaker than it should be.( shouldnt a 4 kilometer long ship take more than 20 hits to blow up? ) the other main problem is the tie interceptor thing. they always get behind you and then you are basically ..... the game is also very particular about getting medals. first of is the targeting computer, if you use it for 5 seconds your \\"efficiency\\" goes down 50 percent. besides those problems thegame is great. the graphics are very good and the copntrols are fine. if you were a fan of the original rogue squadron on pc or N64 you will not be dissapointed with this game. but prepare for some hard gameplay, which in turn will make the game more rewarding when you finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rouge Leader is really good","review":"Let me just start off by saying that Prisoners of Maw is hard as h**l. And I couldn't be happier! I remember wizzing through the original Rogue Squadron and then after finishing it saying \\"Thats it?\\" It was way too easy/short. If it had been longer, harder, or both it would have been much better.But enough of that, this isn't a Rouge Squadron review, its a Rouge Squadron 2 review! And Rouge Leader is exactly what i wish the old game had been. the controll play is excellent, its MUCH harder than the old one, the graphics are stunning, and its a much better developed plot, the original seemed to go nowhere fast, with each level having almost nothing to do with the prevoius one.In short, great game for a fantastic system, buy it, you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good game","review":"My first gamecube game. It's a great game with challenging levels and great sound and graphics.I would have given it five stars but for the simple fact that some levels are too hard and it's easy to just give up and lose interest.

The graphics are great you almost feel like your there because of the controlers sensetivity of when you get hit or boost your speed. It is a little hard o beat but it's still lots of fun. The only eason i didnt give it a 5 is becuase of how hard it is to beat the first level for god sakes!!!!And trust me if your gong to buy this game you need a memory card cause its gonna take you a while to beat it.

All truth to this incredibly amazing game! Ok, to level with you, while the game may seem 'short' the levels are chock full of objectives and stuff to do. The game also boasts 5 secret unlockable ships, as well as several other ships that may be played in certain levels. Along with the ships comes 5 secret levels, and other extras too. Obviously, the graphics are Buy this game, now. If you own Super Smash Bros Melee, this is definatly the next game to get!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Video Game for GameCube","review":"LucasArts and Nintendo outdid themselves. Great graphics, especially with the ships and in the cockpits. New stuff like a targeting computer (big help to enexperienced gamers), new ships (B-wing, Slave 1 when you unlock it). The sound is great, and there's little scenes from the upcoming DVD's of Star Wars! It'll keep you busy for a while, because it might take a while to get the gold medals. Not exactly like Rouge Squadron, so don't not buy it because of that. Best game I have for my GameCube!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Luke is back! Along with R2D2!","review":"The must have game for 2002! This is one of the launch titles for Gamecube and the graphics will blow you away! You fly X-wings, A-wings, B-wings, Snowspeeders, and BONUS Craft that you will obtain by completing certain goals. If you have all four Star Wars N64 games then you have to get this one. Even if you have Star Wars Starfighter for PS2 you should by a Gamecube just for this game! Their are 11 missions plus extra bonus missions. Long live the Alliance! You can even strafe snowtroopers in the Hoth level!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best games for Nintendo Gamecube!!!!!","review":"This game is almost fully enjoyable. I'm giving it 4 stars out of 5, I'm chipping off one for difficulty. Most of you will probably think this is an easy game... The game is mainly that you fly as Luke Skywalker in a vide variety of ships. I like it mainly because you get to blow up stuff. My favorite part is when you chase and blow up Tie fighters. Also, I think, there are elevel missions, or levels. It takes three blocks of memory from your memory card to save your progress. Overall, this is a very good game. Buy it!...

I answered, \\"Hey, nothing to loose.\\" So we played the level that he was on. Boy, I loved it!!! There was a lot of good graphics of snow on Hoth to the space where the star destroyer stays. The funnest level, I believe, is the Battle of Hoth. I liked to trip the AT-AT's and destroy the AT-ST's. I believe the hardest level is when I tried to rescue the ship from the Star Destroyer's tractor beam. But it is still fun! I would like to congratulate who made Lacutus Arts for creating such an exciting game.

The main problem for me is visibility: TIE fighters are tiny and almost impossible to see (especially in space battles), making taking them too much of a challenge. They added a targeting computer feature that helps a bit, but you lose points the longer you use the targeting computer.Overall, I found portions of this game to be fun, but they need to brighten up the graphics to make it more playable."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected...","review":"i rented this game with high expectations from the previews i read, but it did not turn out as what i expected it to be. the graphics are good but the gameplay is somewhat boring. all you do is sit in a spaceship and shoot things. i think it would be better with a two-player mode and levels where you are not in your spaceship. i can see why a lot of star wars fans would like this game (hmm...because it is a star wars game, maybe?) but if you are not sure you will like it then i reccomend you RENT IT FIRST."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"This is one of the best Lucas Arts games I'v played ever.

The best thing I can say is that the controls and gameplay are so intuitive, even an adult can pick up this game and play it well.

Every detail is correct; if you are a Star Wars fan, you will LOVE this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Star Fox games are much better.","review":"This game is so stupid.It took me 3 weeks just to get to the third level.The challenge is too hard for a normal person and the missions are very tedious.I miss straight forward action shooters where the only mission you have to do is shoot other space fighters and beat the boss.That may sound simplistic but done right like in Star Fox its awesome.This game is really dumb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game Great Price","review":"Now that this game has been out for a while, you can get it at great prices. It certainly is worth a try if you like shoot-em-up games with machines. I like the Star Wars arcade games and this gives the same feel and the graphics are really impressive -- not so much from the detail of static displays (which also are very good), but more so the amount of graphic information and the speed at which it is presented to you. This was one of the least likely games for us to keep when we purchased it, but now it has turned out to be one of the most likely to keep. Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rogue Leader is Incredible!","review":"For over a year now, people have been awaiting the release of Nintendo's new system, the GameCube. It's here, and along with it is one of the finest games ever created. Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron II is absolutely incredible. The graphics are superb (complete with high polygon counts) and it looks as if you're in the movie. Gameplay has been an issue to many people, but if you are a truly devoted video gamer you will never tire of it. First off, the levels are different and complex; second there is the metal system (gold, silver, etc.), which adds a high replay value. The best aspect of the game however is the sound. On one level (Battle of Endor) I had the music up high and when my friend walked in, he asked if I had the movie on somewhere. I told him it was a video game making the music and he was amazed. The sound is that good! So to sum it up: Rogue Leader is THE launch title to buy for GameCube. Go out and buy it.

My canon 20d didn't even see a flash attached [430ex and 580exII] My 5d was able to fire the flashes but only in manual mode. Both worked perfectly when mounted directly to the camera, and when I went out and bought the Canon product they worked with it. I'm not sure what camera it works with, but obviously not these. Also very flimsy build, I was scared it would break off when the 580, which is heavy, was mounted. E-mailed Adorama twice, asking for a working replacement, with no reply, finally sent it back. I did get a refund from the company but no reply ever to my inqueries.

It doesn't maintain function when you use a 580exII fully locked on the hot shoe. If you only slide the locking mechanism over halfway you can get the synch function but flash wasn't secure. My first shoot with this cord was a wedding. Halfway through the reception the hotshoe on the cord became loose from the bottom portion where it connects to a flash bracket. Bottom line if you are planning to use a 580exII save your money get canon or another brand. It worked okay with my 430ex but after the bracket connecter started to wobble that rendered it useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Quality Control","review":"Precision Design... well that's the brand name, but certainly not the motto used during manufacturing! The specifications state it's compatible with the Canon EOS camera and Speedlite flash units; however, there is too much gap (slop) between the Speedlite foot and the cord shoe. (The problem: when you slide the flash into the cord shoe and hold it with your hand it will work, but when you secure (lock) the flash foot to the cord shoe it separates the flash pins from the shoe contacts. I returned the first unit and a second one just arrived... and guess what, no worky... same problem! I have a Canon Rebel Xsi and a Speedlite 430EX II.

But he should have kept his John Dowland renditions in the shower stall where they belong. Why listen to fine music performed badly when there are plenty of good recordings of the same songs? Why, because this one's performed by Sting! Huzzah!Actually, the lute playing here is quite nice. But as soon as Sting opens his mouth, the spell is broken.

I think it's a refreshing change for Sting and the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"I like Sting for his short pop songs that he did over his career. But to tackle with one of the most difficult vocal genres in the historzy of music - lute songs, is a different matter!His voice sound awful, has none of the emotional means of expression that this music should have, and I am not even talking about the style and period in which these pieces were written...The music is divine. The performance horrid.I cannot believe that people would prefer this album of Dowland songs to a real singer, who put a lot of time and effort to train his/her voice and musicality so that they could bring out the beauty of the music.Sure, he will make the Dowland more popular, but is that what is important?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sting's versions here more authentic?","review":"I'm no musicologist, but perhaps this album brings up an interesting point.Consider for a moment, how quiet and intimate string instruments were from this time. The strong, operatic voices commonly employed today for this early music are more at home in large concert halls, not intimate gatherings. In most recordings of Dowland's music you can barely hear the lute because the voice is so powerful in comparison.I wonder if quieter, \\"pop\\" style voices like Sting's were the norm during this period. Perhaps, as instruments became louder, and the venues for hearing them larger, the more powerful-voiced operatic style developed and became the norm.It would be very odd if vocals did not change over hundreds of years, while instruments certainly did.Maybe Sting's versions here are more authentic than what is considered \\"authentic\\" today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"As we all know, the music of John Dowland is lovely. When played by Paul Odette or Julian Bream it is exquisite. However, this production is almost depressing. Sting's gravelly voice finally grated on me and I probably won't play this again. The lute performance is mediocre also. The best song is that which they use to promote the album. Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This disc makes you semper dolens - in a bad way.","review":"This is simply a disaster. The lutenist is OK. The so-called \\"singer\\" is flat, as someone else pointed out, and has no feeling at all for the artificial expressiveness of this music - nay, he has no voice to speak of in the first place. It may be the worst classical music CD of all time, if you exclude those which were quite amusing in their way. Now David Bowie doing \\"Flow my tears\\" might be quite fun - but this...Nada."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is \\"in-line\\" with the direction he is going but different for Sting","review":"I throughly enjoy Sting's work. He is head and shoulders above most artists in his line of music. When I first got this CD my wife and I sat down during a quiet moment and really just let it play. We were very pleased with it and it will become one of many that will get played on a Date Night (usually Friday nights for us).....The subject matter is different for him.

Sadly the evidence is all too clear - he has neither. Complete and utter rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"a shame","review":"Sting (of whom I think very well as a musician in his own terms) has given a step into the early baroque-lute-song reperoire of great composer John Dowland... Too bad for him. There are plenty of better choices (almost everyone that exists) for this music... I belive most of the people who will buy and listen this CD do not have any idea of how this music must be sung., and most of them must be fans of the singer... Well, good for them because they will have the opportunity to hear a great composer and some of the most touching music per voice and lute... but ror the rest of us... this cd is just a fiasco."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste-","review":"of a phenomenal lutenist. Sting cannot sustain a note at all, and does not do Dowland any justice. I'd kill for such an accompanist to sing Dowland, Morley, Campion, Byrd...Well, maybe this will turn those who do not know this repertoire (probably most Sting aficionados) onto others who do this music so beautifully- try the Consort of Musicke to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"for Sting fans only","review":"If you're one who enjoys the toneless rasp that is Sting's voice, you'll love this recording. For the rest of us, the miscast Sting spoils an otherwise praiseworthy performance of Dowland's excellent songs. Edin Karamazov on lute is masterly charm overshadowed, alas, by Sting. The recitation of Dowland's letters detracts from the music too and should have been in the liner notes, where the letters couldn't be so affected as they are on the audio tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Wow! Was this CD a surprise disappointment. Unless you love medieval England songs, avoid this CD like the plague. I have all of Stings CD's and love every one of them, but this one must have been purely for his amusement, because it is sure not a crowd pleaser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love Sting, and I guess I must have been expecting something else. I have to say I was a little disappointed in this effort. On the one hand, it is artistic and creative, and I think it's great not to focus always on commercial appeal, but this was so beyond what Sting has done in the past, it almost needed a disclaimer that it is a huge departure from previous releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"Sting is one of the most talented and genius musicians of our time. He took on quite a complex feat by doing this CD. But in all ways only Sting the \\"sage\\" that he is could pull this off.

Very beautiful but extremely different for Sting.Be preparred for the unexpected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Dowland, but Sting ruins it","review":"I love Sting's music, and I love anything to do with Elizabethan England. I thought that this CD would combine the best of both worlds and be something that would utterly enthrall me.Dowland's songs and music are wonderful and the lute is beautiful. However, they are completely ruined by Sting. These songs were meant to be sung by someone with a clear, powerful and melodious voice. Sting's voice is raspy and at times it sounds like he doesn't have enough lung capacity. You can hear his labored breathing at times.I actually felt pained listening to him sounding seemingly in pain. I was so disappointed by this CD. I'm wondering if his voice has really gotten that bad, or if it's always been this way and he's always found a way to hide it."},{"rating":"2","title":"He really feels the music and it shows in every score","review":"I have to admit I am a purist when it comes to classical music. A singer has not only to be very talented but also very well trained in order for me to enjoy a performance. It is different here. Today in the music store I listened to several of the songs that are featured on this CD performed by trained classical artists and none of them moved me nearly as much as Sting. While the classical performer is very much focused on \\"getting it right\\" from a technical standpoint Sting just feels it. The melancholy in his voice works perfectly in every single song.On another note: Whoever approved the booklet needs to be fired. It is full of typos that even include the song titles themselves. (Hey, maybe they catch it and the booklet becomes a rarity, so get it soon)This CD is going to be top of my collection for quite a while. Go get it today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep the lute and lose the vocals","review":"I've always loved madrigals and was excited about this CD. Sadly, Sting doesn't have a strong and clear enough voice to pull it off. Too many years of rock have damaged his vocal cords or something because he's too scratchy and doesn't have the technique needed to sing these beautiful songs. And someone needed to clean up the lute playing - too many squeaks thoughout the CD. Buy it if you're a collector of Sting's music. Stay away if you love madrigals."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh-my-god-this-is-awful","review":"Either Sting's voice is completely wrecked, or we just never noticed how poor it was when he was singing pop songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this CD a joke?","review":"What on earth was \\"Sting\\" thinking when he decided to pursue these classic songs of Dowland? How arrogant of him to think that his high status among the (low brow) world of pop somehow entitles him to pursue true music. Having listened for years to glorious renditions of Dowland songs from world-class counter tenors I wept tears of sadness listening to the symbol of the demise of culture that is this album.But, then again, perhaps it will encourage fans of Sting to pursue better recordings of Dowland songs. That can only be good thing, I suppose.Absolutely disturbing...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lute or Loot","review":"Please Sting leave the lute to those who can play it - Paul O'Dette or Nigel North to name two.

You can't even distinguish the words half the time, just a jumble of nice sounds from his pretty tenor - he doesn't possess the skills to carry it off. This music has to be interpreted by someone with an ability to express thoughts in heightened language...Sting, for all his merits, hasn't got that in his repertoire yet.It's an exercise in pretention, laughable at times. The letter reading is ridiculous. I love both Sting's voice and Dowland's song, but this CD is a failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music, great lute, horrrible singing :(","review":"If Sting didn't sing in this it would be a great album! The selections are wonderful, the lute playing is delightful, the singing is hideous. Absolutely terrible (thinks I!). I suppose I'm spoiled with sound of the Cambridge Singers and the King's College Choir.I can't help but wonder if Sting bothered to listen to any recordings of early music before making this album. When I got this album and before listening to it, I was pleasently surprised, thinking, gosh I didn't know Sting was well-versed in early music. Woe to me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"check out the King's Singers and the Cambridge Singers instead","review":"As a classically-trained singer who performed madrigals and renaissance music in high school and college, I have to give credit to Sting for bringing John Dowland to the attention of people who would normally not be familiar with him.After hearing Sting's versions of two of Dowland's greatest songs, \\"Come Again\\" and \\"Fine Knacks For Ladies,\\" my advice would be to seek out recordings by the King's Singers and the Cambridge Singers. Both groups are considered among the best at performing these and other works from the era of lute songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disaster","review":"As a fanatic fan of Sting (Rock, Jazz, almost anything he has done) and also Renaissance music I didn't believe my eyes when I saw this collection. What a fantastic idea - or so I thought. The result falls nothing short of a total disaster. Take \\"Come Again\\", one of the most beautiful Renaissance love songs - Sting's version sounds like a drunk socker fan is trying to sing it, plain horrible. If you like Sting, just forget about this CD. And if you want to explore Renaissance music I suggest you stick with the professionals. For my example \\"Come Again\\" go for Barbara Bonney's version. Unless your heart is made from stone you will melt away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better things","review":"Lute music, Elizabethan or Virginal music is so exquisite within its own parameters that any arrangements, improvements or modifications even by the great ones (Sting) may not come up as good as it sounds.the vocal altos and male sopranos that sang these melodies back in the 16th century lose their flavor when a Pop artist gets in there and changes or \\"improves\\" such compositions. In my opinion Sting should concentrate on what he does best.Imagine for a second if you please, american country music played by Japanese Koto performers. On the other hand you have Winton Marcellus that is TRAINED in classical music and renders perfect interpretations solo or with chamber or quartet musicians.Each category has its own value in itself. One must be trained in such matters before making new versions. If it aint brocken why fix it??I saw this 2 CD album at a local store priced at 25.00 I would not pay 12.00 for it.sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dowland lives","review":"Being an early music enthusiast, and a lover of Dowland's music, I was pleased to see that a contemporary artist would choose to delve into the past and make this type of a compilation. I was especially surprised by the interspersing of quotations between the pieces which seemed to draw the entire collection into focus. I would recommend it to all who love classical music, lute and/or Dowland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I was very interested in this CD as I have liked pretty much everything I have heard Sting do. This CD is not the case. As a vocal music teacher and accompanist for singers, I cannot listen to this without criticizing the breathyness and lack of stylistic attention. I think it is great that he has delved into this style and broadened his awareness of music history, but I myself, cannot listen to him singing it. I put this CD on in my car and my 10 year old son said \\"this is the worst CD I ever heard, take it off\\" I then put it on for my 13 year old daughter and her friend and they laughed and thought it sounded like someone trying too hard to pronounce the words.I do agree with some who say, if this CD brings some listeners to this style of music than that is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs from tyhe Labyrinth (Music by John Dowland ) Sting","review":"the disc is in the trash.

The music and text are soothing, though he whispers at various points in the album and it is a bit difficult to pick up on the words. The instrumentals are smooth, and any fan of Sting will be suitably impressed that he is just as good on the lute as he is on the electric guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it no stars i would","review":"Bought this CD without knowing that Sting turned into a minstrel.

This is very different from anything Sting has ever done and, in my opinion, he should never do it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"He should change his name to \\"Scat\\"","review":"This is simply embarrassing. Sting has recently taken to passing himself off as a classical musician, playing guitar and lute and singing. He can do none of these above the amateur student level. Only someone with an incredible lack of taste and a huge ego would attempt such a musical endeavor for anyone beyond his own edification. But then to place it on a disc and ask people to pay money for it just bursts the bounds of meretriciousness. He should have stuck to the same tired old reworkings of the one modal folk-new-age-trash song that he has based his solo career upon. And he should change his name to \\"Scat,\\" for this more closely identifies with the brown, odoriferous material on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roll Over John Dowland","review":"Sting does John Dowland. It's only too bad John Dowland isn't alive to do it back to Sting.I was hoping this CD would be good enough to at least turn on a new audience to John Dowland. Unfortunately, I fear this off-key misreading will have just the opposite effect. About the only bright spot in this undertaking is Edin Karamazov's lute playing. Save your money and go buy one of the many legitimate classical recordings of Dowland's works (Emma Kirby's \\"Honey from the Hive\\" on BIS is a recent good one..... )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably Poor","review":"This Sting character is one of the worst \\"singers\\" DG has ever recorded. I cannot imagine what they were thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"This plodding chamber music requires a lot of attention, and I gave it my full attention when I first listened to it. I wondered whether this was some famous story that Sting was telling; it sounded as if it was about a real person or based upon someone's letters, perhaps incorporating songs of its day. It gets tedious and repetitive, though, with the regular, labored strumming and the high chanting of the songs, interspersed with deep, almost-Goth recitations of what sound like ancient texts, so it is not appropriate dinner music, for example. It's not peaceful or relaxing. It's tiresome and requires the listener to participate in it fully every time. If you're looking for a romantic mental exercise rather than a musical interlude, buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kidding, right?","review":"You've got to be kidding me. The emperor has no clothes!

I like Sting as the frontman of the Police and in his solo albums. But he can't do this style of song justice - his voice is too coarse and (I hate to say it) flat for these songs. Buy them if you are a Sting fan, but if you really want to hear Elizabethan lute and voice, there are many interpretations that will please rather better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant departure for Sting","review":"Ok, so the first thing you have to understand is that this is not typical Sting. He is stepping out of the box, both musically and historically. Once you get past that and understand the music for what it is, you will appreciate that it is a good collection.

Bawer's book reveals the anti-intellectualism inherent to Fundamentalism and makes us listen very closely to their party jargon of intolerance, homophobia, scare tactics, and the often subtle stone throwing. Interestingly, those who champion biblical inerrancy are exposed as knowing shockingly little about the origins and depth of Christian scripture. Bawer's approach is sometimes emotional but never strays from rational and scrutinizing thought. Stealing Jesus reveals the urgent need to address the anti-intellectual tenets of fundamentalists and their political agendas. Maybe because they throw such large stones, boulders if you will, that most dismiss them. We ignore them at our peril. Bawer does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is to edit Display info in line 4","review":"Please simply edit my review submitted previously today with the proper email address below.

He is the one filled with hate not the christians he obviously despises. He wants to take the parts of the bible he agrees with, and discredits the parts that condemn his life style.

The Christian right wing can't even stop graphic sex education at their local schools. They are not a threat. Heck, Christians are not a serious worry. They are not a worry.Do not buy this book. It's obsolete. The author, Bruce Bawer, says it's obsolete. We can't ignore Islam. Why? All GLBT people will be eliminated by Islam.

(It isn't) If it IS the Word of God (It is) we should humble ourselves and read it with reverance. This book is part and parcel of today's pathetic attempts by liberals to define God down to their level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disguised Hatred in a book claiming to Promote Love","review":"Bawer's book, Stealing Jesus, is simplistic, self-serving, and self-contradictory. Allegedly lauding Christian love, his book is a hate-tract against the body of New Testament evidence in favor of a creedal emphasis. His starting point is the bogus absolute truth that being gay is good, from there he strings together distortions of both Gospel and Epistle records, and proceeds to selectively and unfairly bash Christian orthodoxy. United Church of Christ minister, Dr. John Gilmore, Cincinnati, OH"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"Bawer shows the reader the contrast between the real Jesus of love and tolerance and those who use the writings of his followers who were less tolerant and dogmatic.

More than an expose of fundamentalism in the USA, this book is a true affirmation of the importance of a universal love for God and for mankind (Christ based or otherwise) over any particular theology or doctrinal law. Nonetheless, it also affirms the importance of tradition in helping us to find a special time/place for experiencing the mystery and holiness of God. Mr. Bawer has given all of us who choose to listen a wake up call on the impact of fundamentalist beliefs on today's society and political climate while effectively conveying a message of unconditional love and a healthy respect for all religious beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book can change lives for the better.","review":"Others have remarked that this book has its weaknesses (in empirical research and tangential themes), but these small problems do not detract from the power of the book. For people who have grown up fundamentalist and are trying to escape and heal the psychological and spiritual damage caused by such an upbringing, this book is a combination history text, spiritual manual, and Gospel. I have already given copies to friends who are themselves trying to escape fundamentalism and they also have been impressed. I recommend this book strongly to any spiritual seeker."},{"rating":"1","title":"God=both merciful and just:Can the law and love not coexist?","review":"Although Bawer's prose is commendable, his content unfortunately, brings me back to the original question he was being asked - Are you a Christian?The basic precept of a Christian is that God is both just (He commands us to obey Him) and merciful (He loves us enough to make the provision by which we Can obey Him. Praise Jesus Christ our Lord).Bawer misses the concept that Christ did not come to abolish the Law, but to fulfill it. Hence, to divide Christians into the Church of Law and the Church of Love, is unfair and unknowing. True, individuals exhibit clear manifestations of black and white attitudes, as Bawer describes. But he also shows that he clearly is one of the individuals about which he writes, while a whole society of followers of Jesus Christ exist with the understanding that our God is both - 1)our Creator and law giver and 2)our provider and redeemer, forgiving and loving us as truly only God can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the mark","review":"Yes, the bottom line of the Gospel is love. But, one cannot pick and choose what part of the Gospel message to believe. If Jesus didn't die on that cross to pay the price for our sins, none of it means anything. It was hardly just a nice example of \\"selflessness.\\" Be careful of this book. It is full of false doctrine, written by someone who wants to interpret the Bible to justify his own lifestyle. Granted, Christianity is not something to be shoved down someone's throat. But it also is not the Gospel According to Bruce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Legalism is wrong, yes, but so is immorality.","review":"Although Bawer makes a strong case against fundamentalism, which is easy to agree with, given the similarities between the legalists of Jesus' time and Christian extremists, Bawer muddies the waters with his stray, gay agenda, which he does not and cannot substantiate based on scripture.It is true that legalists defy Grace by their condemnations and such; however, anyone who calls himself or herself a Christian and who is not fully submitted to the authority of Christ's Word and Spirit in their own lives is also denying Grace. (ROM 12:1-2)In other words, fundamentalists cannot prove their own righteousness by criticizing and judging gays anymore than gays can prove theirs by judging fundamentalists for their unrighteousness."},{"rating":"1","title":"A gross misrepresentation of Christian fundamentalists.","review":"The author generalizes all fundamentalists into one uneducated, unloving group, and does not base his beliefs on the entire Word of God, but rather on those Scriptures that he can remove from context to justify his distorted view of the Bible, the Biblical Christ, and of the true, living God that has been revealed in the Scriptures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bawer misses the mark","review":"A trusted minister friend of mine recommended this book as insightful reading material into the success of fundamentalist groups. Bawer's distinction between law and love is interesting and in my experience fairly accurate. However, his constant attacks on all religious groups except for Anglicans proved to be distracting. Perhaps his book should more aptly be entitled: Cafeteria Christians: How religious groups betray Jesus by perverting his words to fit theological constructs."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book led me to invent a new book rating system.","review":"What an irritating book.Between the whining and the contortionist-rationalising, the author has made three points, but it's only from sheer masochistic delight that I managed to keep reading it.I think I've written objections on all but 2 of the book's pages.

It took almost 4 years before I finally got the book. I want to say it was worth the wait...but it wasn't because I shouldn't have waited! What a fantastically written book! I've always been interested in pirates but have never come across a book that I thought would intrigue me. I had no preconception of what the story was about, only that it had very good reviews. Sometimes that's all I need, good reviews and recommendations. I was happily surprised that the main character was a girl! After the first chapter I was hooked. Well written and honestly I don't want to write a summary about this book because I'd rather people read it! Needless to say, I quickly purchased the entire series.

The story of this book is kind of crappy, and easily predicted. 5 star book? FAT CHANCE. Some of this book was a little innapropriate, and many of the people at my school agree. Some referances were a little adult, and some of the scenes were not very pretty to picture, no offence. The climax was, iffy, and I'm still not quite sure what is was anyway.

How very orthodox. I didn't especially like it, but then again maybe you will. They focus on her obsession with her bunk mate a little too much, instead of kicking pirate butt, which was what I expected from the summary. It was pretty predictable, but it gave you a little \\"haha\\" once or twice. The writing itself was ok, but as I am not learned in british slang from the 1680s, it was a little difficult to understand what the protagonist ment. It was a book I could put down and forget about until i stepped on it. I read it, and would suggest this book for girls. It may seem like a \\"boys\\" book from the cover, something like Stowaway, but a boy might not enjoy reading it. It was no Da Vinci code, and was about 8 levels down from the writing quality of Harry Potter, but if you really have nothing to do, check a book out from the library and keep this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Book That I Would Reccommend to Any Teen!","review":"I have read every single book in this series.

I was so taken with how she overcame the hardships in her life and that she had such a positive attitude. It was so great how she treated the people who came into her life with kindness and selflessness...of course with the exception of the guy who attacked her. Then she protected herself with a vengeance that was impressive. In her relationship with Jaimy, it was refreshing for her to decide \\"not to do that baby making thing\\". I know it was different times back then but I loved that there was a moral message in the book.One thing that attracts me to a book is the character developement. If I like the characters, I will come back for more and more of that character. If there were more Jacky Faber books, I would read them.I would recommend it to my teen age grand daughter or anybody. It was a great and fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloody Awesome!","review":"This is SUCH a good book.

If you are looking for a book about pirates then I recommend that you find a different book. But if you are looking for an adventure story about a girl who finds what she wants and gets it, then this is a story that you would probably like. It is about a girl named Mary Faber who dresses like a boy so that she can work on a ship. I mainly recomend this story for 12 and up because it might not be for children. (Mary gets a crush on her bunk mate, one of the sailors molests her, and there is some violence involved.)

The pacing is terrible and the supporting players (except George Hayes) are awful in their deliveries. Even Harry Carey (one of my favorites) delivers his lines unconvincingly. The script is muddled as well. The scenery is terrific and this would probably have been a good silent western, as you wouldn't actually hear the static delivery of the cast. The director must have been dozing. I've given my copy away. Luckily it has been my experience that, in buying dvds of movies I've not seen before, such disappointment is a rare occurence. I've given this film 2 stars for the scenery, a decent print, and George Hayes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible picture quality","review":"I wish I had waited to see reviews instead of pre-ordering the 3D Blu Ray version.

Andy Pyle was in the band 1986-1987 then from 1991-1994. I actually found this CD in an over stocked store along with Live in Geneva with another fine line-up headed by the perrenial Andy Powell.

I picked it up several months ago on a whim, and more or less unheard. I have not stopped playing it yet, and I can't really see that happening any time soon! It is a great document of the early 90's incarnation of this great band and sees a good combination of all time classics and a little more recent (as of then) tracks. There have been a great many live releases from Wishbone over the years. They are clearly under pressure to play standards like \\"The King Will Come\\", \\"Throw Down the Sword\\" etc every time they play, but regardless of the number of versions of those particular songs I have heard, the renditions on this album still sound fresh and exciting to my ear. This release sees the ever present Any Powell again teamed with Ted Turner and that sweet dual guitar sound is as good on this as it was on the original \\"Live Dates\\" back in the 70's.

After reading this book, notwithstanding Sinnott-Armstrong's arguments, it becomes difficult to be justified to believe in atheism. (Need I say Anthony Flew's \\"conversion\\"?) For this reason, atheists like one reviewer below (Richard Walter Widen) cannot but resort to ad hominem and other fallacies, attacking Craig's method of reading from a prepared text (which is irrelevant to his arguments' validity) rather than refuting his arguments per se. So if you would read this book, first get trained in critical and logical thinking. Then follow where the evidence leads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soap. great gift","review":"I gave this to my husband. He loves big cakes of soap with a spicy scent.

It is all narrative - there is next to no dialog and Hall covers the same issues/topics over and over again. I tried on numerous occasions to read this one, and after seeing all the reviews I may even try agin, but so far as the first quarter of the book goes I have to say I dont see the attraction - endless narration on the same topic and limited characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Gamecube rip off","review":"This game is just a re-release of the crazy taxi for sega dreamcast.

Look around, it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definite rental...","review":"I played Crazy Taxi for the first time on Dreamcast, and liked it, so I bought it on GameCube. Big mistake. The game is a 'one time' game, and only fun for a very short amount of time. It is worth renting, but not buying. There is no plot or story line, pretty much no point at all. All you do is pick guys up and get payed insane amounts of money. Who wants to play a cabbie video game!?!?!? Waste of [money]. Spend it on a real game like Metroid Prime or Super Smash Bros. Don't make the same mistake I did..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fun game that gets old too quickly","review":"Anyone who hasn't played this game should rent it, play it, return it, and be done with it.

It's just another cruddy Allcliam game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun game, but disappointing content","review":"I bought Crazy Taxi because I loved playing it in the arcade. I wasn't disappointed in the gameplay. This isn't my primary game, but fun to play every so often for a while.However, I'm really disappointed in the language for this game. Mine came with a well-deserved Teen rating. There was no need for that type of language in the game. This game would otherwise be perfectly suitable and fun for my kindergarten-aged son to play, but the language makes me want to throw the game away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the simpsons road rage","review":"This game is very repetitive and doesn't really have a main goal to reach. You drive around and pick up people over and over again and it gets old fast. Buy the simpsons road rage because it has all the characters you know and love and is also a great multiplayer game. Crazy taxi has too many techniques that you have to learn and which I didn't understand. I play a lot of video games and if I have trouble with it then there must be something wrong with it for me to not be able to do it at all. I think this game has no point so don't waste your money on it.

It is good for about 30 minutes... but then It just gets old! You don't do ANYTHING! Picking people up and droiping them off, even with all the crazyness of driving how you want gets real boring, real fast. My advice to anyone is not to spend [money] on this peace of [junk]!

You can't go wrong with this costume!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Educate and Amuse","review":"I read Mr Fenby's book on a plane ride from Rio to Hong Kong. It was the perfect antidote to spending hours on a plane. The first part of the book is a compendium of facts, views and background on Hong Kong particularly as they relate to the handover to China. So by the time I got to London I was an expert on the fascinating topic. I then started on the diary section where Jonathan picks out news items and events during his last year in Hong Kong. Now I was an expert on the \\"Handover\\" I could laugh at all his wonderful one-liners. (Such as his final sentence on a piece describing some particularly errant behaviour by the authorities in Hong Kong: \\"One country, three systems\\"). He also contrasts, with devastating effect, the ideological flag waving for the \\"love of motherland\\" with almost daily reports of corruption in China. A wonderful book that will educate and amuse in equal doses."},{"rating":"2","title":"crkt self sharpening pocket knife","review":"For the price it is an OK knife.1.

Written by George's cousin, Joseph Noah, the book not only contains details about his early life, but George's personal diary entries from his war years. There is even an \\"appendix for modelers\\". This 1974 book is out of print and copies are extremely hard to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool but can find it cheaper elsewhere","review":"Lowes and Home Depot both have this for about half of what Amazon wants for it. It's a great tool, though, small enough for trim work. My wife likes to redecorate a lot so I have used a lot of different painting tools. The Shur-line painting pads work really well. They are easier to use than a roller and don't leave brush marks like a brush, although a roller will usually give you a more even finish. My wife loves these things for all the small spaces and touch ups. My only complaint is the pad, which is replaceable, will slip off if you push too hard, but it's really easy to use when you get used to it. The pads just slip on and, if you don't want to throw it away, usually will wash out very easily. They are actually pretty durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!!","review":"This book starts out giving a clear picture on some things but soon falters, leaving the reader confused. My professor is using this textbook and I don't understand a great deal of what I'm learning.

I have owned it for around 6 months and I still can't help but grin everytime I see the picture quality when I play a dvd. I have this hooked up to a Bose 321 system and it works great. Decent priced, high quality picture and sound. I couldn't be happier. The gave this tv 4 stars only because I wish the controls were a little more user friendly. You have to burough down pretty deep into the menu to get to some commonly used features. A customized quick start kind of menu would have been nice. All in all, I love this tv, and I suggest anyone willing to pay a bit more for quality but without breaking the bank do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice TV","review":"I bought this TV way back in Dec 05 and 9 months on it still working great.When I first got the TV out of the box the picture wasnt very good,but after playing around the picture control for a while I finaly got the TV looking great(Well great for me any way) HD of course looks the best on this TV and yeah DVD's look great too.Right now I have a Blu-Ray player and a HD DVD player hooked to it and the picture is awsome,cant wait to check out Superman Returns in High Def!Make sure if you get a Blu-Ray player or a HD DVD player to set the player to 1080i for best picture.My only gripe with the TV as I do have one dead pixel on the screen,but you have to be looking for it to see it.Well anyway this is a very nice TV and I give it 2 thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The TV is a great deal","review":"Just got this TV and I think it is a great value for what you pay. I think all in all, it is one of the best 32\\" LCD sets out on the market today.Things to keep in mind, it is widescreen, so it looks a little stretched with a regular cable imput. Have had to change the mode and it makes the viewing area smaller, but clearer.The remote is a little clunky/ugly in my opinion, but it works fine.I think overall this TV is a good deal and you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Samsung LCD TV LN-R328W - more a PC monitor than TV","review":"I was impressed by picture quality on that TV and by great integration capabilities (input ports). I had it for 2 months and I started to notice dark spots on the LCD panel. I made about 20 calls to attempt fixing it under warranty just to hear them blame it on me or shipping for the physical damage. I used to be a big fan of Samsung but their products just need to be more reliable - I also had trouble with a Samsung washer not so long ago. Also pay attention to low quality of plastics used - the TV is very shaky on the provided stand - I would recommend a wall mount. Sound quality is so bad I would call this model a monitor. In fact it does look like a big PC monitor and not like a TV set. Nice speaker set is a must even for occasional music listeners as me.My rating is 2 just because it has picture quality I loved so much. Otherwise it is a worst buy I've ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Samsung LN-R328W HDMI port failure","review":"I have purchased 2 LN-R328W units at the same time and had both wall mounted by the seller, Best Buy. At approximately 16 months BOTH units developed the same problem. The HDMI ports failed, apparently becoming loose inside the unit, thereby making a good HDMI connection impossible. Since the units were more than twelve months old, after many calls, Samsung decided to do nothing to help with the problem other than suggest I pay for the repairs. They do not recognize this as a design defect. This is a fair warning on two points: 1) After 12 months, you may receive NO HELP from Samsung. If you want your product to function and be supported longer, you may want to consider another brand; 2) At least based on my experience, this model seems to have a propensity to have HDMI port failures. (See other such reports on Internet sites)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great picture, malfunctioning sound.","review":"The picture on this TV was excellent even on non-HDTV channels. However, after two days of use, the sound went out and came back multiple times. It appears that the speakers were excessively sensitive to humidity in the room. I eventually returned the TV because of this. This may be a single defective item, but it deterred me from exchanging it for another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent bike trips - with attention to safety","review":"Howard's routes are excellent - he always finds the most scenic routes through towns, managing to avoid the larger busier roads in most cases. He pays close attention to safety details - ie: when you take his trips, you won't come across a stop sign at the bottom of a steep hill unless he specifically mentions it.I have done several of the rides, and highly recommend this book or any of the others he has done.Brad Charbonneau"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry, but I have to disagree","review":"While the other reviewers appear to be very satisfied with this book, I have to disagree. I have now tried three different rides in this book throughout MA, and EVERY one of them had significant errors or unclear directions at various points along the route. I would only suggest buying this book as a guide of where to bike, but NOT to use it routes.When I tried one of the rides recently, the directions indicated the rider to \\"bear left\\" at a non-existed merge, while the map showed a hard right. The correct path to follow turned out to be a hard left (greater than 90 degree turn). There was another error on the same route."},{"rating":"1","title":"very low quality in the product I got","review":"the product I ordered had more than 20 pages gone.

The signal is quality is quite good.One of the nice things about the CTA FM Transmitter is that the frequency is set by dip switches. The transmitted frequency does not vary once the switches are set. This is different from FM transmitters that use dials to select the frequency. I have found that dial based FM transmitters vary their transmitted frequency as the device is bumped around. This translates into poor reception. I have also had problems with frequencies changing on some push button FM transmitters, as they reset to a default frequency on power up, or a button is pushed inadvertantly. I usually set the frequency on the CTA FM Transmitter once for the vehicle I am using and never change it again.The only problem I have had with this unit is that the text around the dip switches is so small that I have to put glasses on to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"works better than others ive tried","review":"ive got both the universal version and the ipod version of the belkin tunecast II, they are the same except the color. i got the cta unit about 3 months ago, it has better range indoors than the tunecast, also better clarity.doesnt work that well in a car(have yet to find one that does),the 2 aaa batteries last about 15 hours of continuous play, rechargeable nimh batteries run about 6-8 hours.if you want to listen to your mp3 player indoors, this is alot less expensive than belkin,has better range,and costs alot less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money.","review":"Cheap and nasty with slide around instructions ( cheap stick on paper instr. ) Could not get it to work at all even playing with the units equaliser type adjusters.

I have been fan of the band since they first formed. Obviously there has been a departure from the more folk music sound of the past, however, the newer sound is great. It's just that this particular CD is repetitive. I felt as if the band was simply honoring a contract obligation."},{"rating":"1","title":"EBTG - Since When Are Gay Clubgoers Your Only Audience?","review":"I have long been a fan of Tracey Thorne's silky tones, and it was fun to have \\"Missing\\" turned into a techno hit, but does that warrant an entire CD of monotonous techno music? I like to preen and dance as much as the next person, but I also enjoy solid albums that I can listen to from beginning to end with a glass of wine and a great conversation. EBTG was one of the few artist duos that could provide that kind of quality. Well, if this brings them greater notoriety (read: more money), kudos to them, but I am one disappointed fan who misses the stuff that doesn't sound like a mirrorball should be turning in my living room."},{"rating":"1","title":"repetitive and boring","review":"in comparison to EBTG's previous albums of this genre (Walking Wounded) this CD is blaaah. It has repetitive dance beats and is no fun to listen to unless you're at a rave. The vocals are drown out by the drum machines, etc. which really was a let down. Overall, an average put out by EBTG. I wish I would've spend the extra $4 and gotten something else new. ( I picked it up used) If you like techno, club-ish kind of music, go for Massive Attack, or maybe Fatboy Slim, or EBTG's previous releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss the old EBTG!","review":"Oh how sad for me, a die hard EBTG fan to see the direction they are taking. Some of my best memories are of EBTG concerts in small venues - when I could hear their incredible vocals and their music was captivating.

I love the movie Hitch and the scene where Eva Mendes and Will Smith are in a ultra cool lounge; a song was playing in the background called \\"Five Fanthoms\\" by this group. It would always play in my head after seeing the scene... I looked for the song on the soundtrack to no avail but after doing a little research I found EverythingButTheGirl was responsible for the awesome song. This CD is pleasantly good and a great one to play for lounging or chillin' out with friends, etc! Highly recommend! Don't pass this one...

I usually don't listen to this type of music but that album is so outstanding in every way instrumentation, vocals, production, lyrics...you name it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable pop album that has its own original flair","review":"TEMPERAMENTAL is the first album that I have bought from Everything But The Girl. I heard their track \\"Temperamental\\" on Deep Dish's RENAISSANCE: IBIZA mix and fell head over heels for Tracey Thorn's impassioned vocals, so I rushed out and bought the album.I was quite satisfied. Tracey Thorn's voice never falters over the entire hour of the CD. The drum beats are engaging (especially on \\"Hatfield 1980\\" and \\"Low Tide of the Night\\"). This disc has a classy sexiness to it that is lacking from so much of modern dance music. The lyrics are original and heartfelt, and present a wonderful contrast to the filler in the bulk of mainstream music.Other reviewers of the album have lamented EBTG's move into dance music, but for those of us who wouldn't have been drawn to their former jazzy style, TEMPERAMENTAL offers a chance to see what EBTG is all about. Now I can work my way backwards in their repertoire and like what I hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointing direction for EBTG.","review":"It's a shame Tracey Thorn's lovely voice is wasted on these synth laden, drum machine heavy, disco arrangements. It's like using Monet to draw up industrial blueprints. I listen and try to imagine what the last two albums would sound like with real instruments, no samples and no hip-hop beat. Guess we'll have to wait for \\"Acoustic II.\\" In the meantime, turn up your bass and get stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, KIND OF BLASE...WATERDOWN VERSION OF PAST SONGS.","review":"First this CD is okay, not horrible, just okay. The best song on the CD is the title cut \\"Temperamental\\"....How \\"Five Fathoms\\" topped the club play on billboard I will never know....Otherwise this CD is just a waterdown version of \\"Walking Wounded\\", \\"Missing\\", etc....I say, EBTG go back to your roots....remember \\"Driving\\"?....I am tired of Tracey's vocals being washed out by synthesizers and dance beats...Just because they had the biggest hit of their careers with the No. 2 Hot 100 chart topper \\"Missing\\", someone at their label tells them to keep coming out with dance mish mash......A disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Example of A Successful Crossover!","review":"I first purchased the album without ever sampling a track, I just decided to buy it because I really enjoy EBTG's previous cds. At first I didn't like the album and found myself skipping over numerous tracks, (there aren't many--only 10) and decided to put it on a shelf and try and listen to it at a later time. About four months later, I decided to give it another try, and after listening to the whole album from start to finish and looking over at some of the lyrics, I have to say that it's one of the best album that I have heard in years. You just have to give it time. Here's another example of a band making a very successful crossover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Walking-Wounded-Progressive","review":"This album is a direct continuation of the duo's former album, Walking Wounded. The comparison to the latter is inevitable - this album is a shrine for electronica - house pulse beats and techno buss n' drum rhythms. However, I truly find Temperamental to be much more alienated and gloomy than Walking Wounded. See it this way - Walking wounded analogues to a beginning of a party when everyone is still hesitant and need lighter music in order to \\"absorb the atmosphere\\", while \\"Temperamental\\" fits better to the late hours of the night when everyone is vigorous and energetic. I think that this album lacks a bit of human touch and Tracy's vocals only come in second after the music. I would recommend to buy both \\"Walking Wounded\\" and \\"Temperamental\\" and to play them one after the other for the complete experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissapointment.","review":"Being that I am but a casual fan of this duet, I thought that buying this album would be a good idea. I was wrong, and I was out 13 bucks. This entire disc suffers from a malaise that I just couldn't appreciate, or get over. I usually enjoy trance, and all things considered drone. However this album seems uninspired, asleep, and unimaginative. Fast forwarding through the tracks will bare no fruit for you either. It would probably be best to steer clear of the CD all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"this one is a let down","review":"I don't know why ebtg has bothered to put track separations on this disk. It all sounds the same, like something a teenager would record himself with a drum machine. Generally good lyrics, though.This cd is far from the best work they've done."},{"rating":"1","title":"EVERYTHING BUT THE ......MUSIC!","review":"EBTG have proven to the public that they have sold out...ever since they found a niche with \\"Missing\\", everything else has come out like a copy of this song...Case in point- \\"Walking Wounded\\", \\"Wrong\\" and now \\"Five Fathoms\\".....This CD is dance beat hell....I never thought a dance album could put me to sleep like this one.EBTG go back to your roots - say 8 to 10 albums ago.....I miss Traceys voice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"Think about this: a rather dull but likeable three-minute pop song. Unmemorable lyrics, repetative melody, but a charming voice and some neat instrumentals. Now, extend that dull song to six-minutes, strip away the instrumentation, slap on a repetitive beat and try your best to drain the life out of those oh-so-nice vocals: that's \\"Temperamental\\". The music is same-old EBTG, but with a lot more pretense. I suppose if you just want to dance this album will suit you fine. But if you like strong melodies, and mayhaps some intelligent lyrics to accompany the music - pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Temperamental","review":"This is nothing like all their previous work. It is awful! They are one of my favorite groups, but this album is just the pits!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"As much as I love the duo, this album just isn't very good. The only plus on this CD is the track \\"Lullaby of Clubland\\", which is a smooth and hip listen. Otherwise, I long for the old time stuff!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Temperamental Sound","review":"Everything But The Girl is what we say \\"You've come a long way, baby.With more than a 20-year-old career the group,has shown as an utterly fresh face in this new album \\"Temperamental\\".Their songs mind sound something like the Walking Wounded or even Missing,but the definetivly have their own characteristics that make them stand out on themselves.Best songs in the CD are \\"Five Fathoms\\",an uptempo adult-pop tune,\\"Low Tide Of The Night\\",a song perfect for listening to when returning late at night,tired from work,\\"Hatfield 1980\\",a really cool mixture of opo,dance and trip-hop and,of course, \\"Temperamental\\".Temperamental,is one of the best albumw of EBTG since 1986's\\"Baby The Stars...\\"and after the massively successful \\"Amplified Heart!\\"A MUST HAVE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish dance music","review":"Everything but the Girl's transformation into a trip hop duo has been the best move of their career. Walking Wounded was one of the best albums that came out in 1996. And 1999's Temperamental covers a similar territory as Walking Wounded but is slightly more club oriented. And in my opinion, it is even more consistent than its predecesor. The album's openning song, \\"five fathoms\\" is as infectious as club music ever gets. You will no doubt be singing the tune for weeks. The title track is as close to top 40 dance music as Everything But the Girl will ever get. While \\"Low tide of the Night\\" and \\"Downhill racer\\" are both mellow, seductive tunes. Long story short, if you enjoyed Amplified Heart and Walking Wounded, you will love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"House/dance music doesn't get much better","review":"Ok I am a confessed EBTG devotee; this album has a well balanced thumping up-rhythm that gets the toes tapping and the blood flowing without losing any of the lyrical beauty inherent to EBTG creations. Despite the rumours-yes CDs can wear out and my old copy of this one is proof!"},{"rating":"2","title":"poetry and motion","review":"Whether you're in love, feeling lonely or a bit sad, this album will heighten all of your senses. Tracey and Ben's haunting melodies and beautiful melancholic poetry (Tracey sings ,in the future of the future,for example,\\"You say 'think of the old days, we could have them back again.' Well I've thought about the old days and they'd go bad like they did then\\") with a house mix very much aimed at clubland, make this one of the best albums to come out of the UK in the 90s. I wasn't sure when I first listened to this CD if the mix really worked, but after 4 or 5 plays it has rapidly become one of my all time favourites and it follows me from lounge to car to computer, for I hate to be without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"something's missing but...","review":"Something is missing on the new EBTG album, but it is still beautiful music. They are far and away my favorite band. And \\"Amplified Heart\\" is my all time favorite CD (for the record, \\"Walking Wounded\\" is also pretty darn awesome). I think their new sound is great -- change is a good thing -- but I miss the sadness and longing that is expressed more poignantly in their acoustic sound. Yeah, there are some sad songs and songs of longing on this CD, but none compare to \\"Single\\" (on \\"Walking Wounded\\")and nothing comes even close to \\"Two Star\\" (off \\"Amplified Heart\\"). It's great that EBTG is getting the critical acclaim they have always deserved. Tracy's voice and their lyrics ARE unbelievable. But I miss their simpler songs, songs that expressed soooo much in such an understated way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the EBTG I used to know","review":"A far cry from Language of Life and Amplified Heart, I feel they've really gone downhill bringing back the disco beat. The EBTG I used to know had beautiful ballads that made you think about life. This and Walking Wounded was a huge disappointment for me. If you like disco, that drumbeat that bang bang bangs, then this is for you... i personally think they're headed for disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect House Album","review":"Tempermental, by the acclaimed dance duo Everything But The Girl is a classic. It joins Walking Wounded as a perfect house album. It's smooth textures and emotional sentiments are guaranteed to win anti-dance fans over. It thumps, beeps, scratches, and shimmers in all the right places and Tracey Thorn's vocals are instruments themselves. If you're looking for the best in laid back, chilled out electronic music that won't leave you reaching for the excedrin, please look into Tempermental."},{"rating":"2","title":"stop whining","review":"will all you people please stop whining about EBTG not being acoustic anymore...their dance music rocks so much more...this album is great...from the opening five fathoms...to temperamental...to the ending future of the future...keep bringing them on tracey and ben..love it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"techno disappointment","review":"\\"Amplified Heart\\" this is not. Tracy's wonderful voice is lost in the constant pounding of electronic drum disco beat. It sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tempermental is one of the best new releases of 1999","review":"The combination of deep house rhythms and modern pop melodies make Tempermental one of the year's best. This is one of a select few albums that bridge the gap between pop music and true dance culture. Tracy's voice is so incredibly complex and facinating on this record. Lyrically, there is still the dark, searching despair that is EBTG. When Tracy sings \\"I walk the city late at night\\" you can really see her doing just that... wandering down a half empty london back street, dodging rain puddles and avoiding eye contact with the strangers all around. Few albums, or songs, have the ability to paint those kind of images with the music. Buy this record!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work by ben and tracey...","review":"A bit darker than Walking Wounded, this is the album you jam to after a night out. Good chill out music and after hours parties. Tracey's voice consistently sends chills up the spine of anyone who breathes the breath she breathes.Some strong tracks: Temperamental (Very catchy and danceable; lyrics are great...)Hatfield 1980. If you are familiar with tracks off of walking wounded, in the same vein as flipside. Spoken word, intriquing lyrics.Downhill Racer. Great song, great melody.No Difference. Amazing.I definitely recommend this album!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No soul....","review":"This was my favorite group before they started this borish trend towards techno crappola. I've been listening to EBTG for a decade and think this is a waste of one of the top vocal talents ever. Tracey is a song bird being drowned by adolescent drum beats and synthesizers. Ben is still a wonderful lyricist but the music does not allow the words to enter one's soul. Thats it... this recording has no soul!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I had listen to the reviews and saved my money.","review":"I absolutely love this group, and I loved \\"Missing\\" -- playing it over and over. Little did I know that when I was hoping for more of the same in this album...that I was better off still playing \\"Missing\\" over and over and over and over. Enough dance beats to get even a fan annoyed. I miss her voice too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD","review":"I've been waiting a long while for EBTG to release the follow up to Walking Wounded. I wasn't let down. Come to think of it, I have realized that almost every gourmet coffee bar in NYC now plays this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Ecstasy!","review":"EBTG has done it again. I like music that makes me see things in a different perspective, even things I see every day. Their danceable, groovy, tragically hip sound makes you want to grab a martini and put on something black. Just to share something....I live in a downtown apartment and am lucky enough to have terrific views of Seattle's massive skyline and the Space Needle - the night I bought the CD I lit all my candles and sat in front of the window with a Beck's just staring at the sea of lights, thinking about how grateful I am for everything I enjoy in life. The only other artists able to do that for me have been the PetShopBoys. I recommend this CD to anyone who truly listens to the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a word: Fabulous","review":"This is the first cd I have ever bought by \\"Everything But the Girl\\". The rhythms are sensational and Tracey Thorn's voice is melodic whether she's singing a ballad or a dance beat. And Ben Watt is a genius. I highly recommend this CD, especially if you commute and want to arrive at the office feeling really good about life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time is what you need to like this album","review":"you know, i have to admit that when i heard this cd, i thought i was horrible! The sound was funky, nothing like their early stuff and not a lot like \\"Walking Wounded\\". But when my job was playing some of the songs, they grew on me. And that is how i learned to love this album. This album is a depressing album, but with dance motion twist. There is a little rougher edge to the drum'n'bass songs. They combine their hip-hop beats perfectly to a jazzy-sax sound. And their lyrics are depressing but the music is great to bump with. Trust me, this album takes time to like and it will grow on you. It did with me and it's one of my favorites now."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it more and more every I listen to it","review":"I couldn't wait for Everything But The Girl to put out a new CD. I heard Five Fathoms at a store, and wasn't that impressed. I bought the album and listened to it several times. I thought that most of the songs were pretty good, but nothing compared to Walking Wounded. Although, the more I listened to it the more I liked it. It just seemed that the songs grew on me more and more. Every song on the CD is excellent (with the exception of Compression, which has no vocals). This is now one of my favorite CD's, and the only reason for four stars is because I am comparing it to Walking Wounded. Almost nothing can compare to that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot better than I expected","review":"What's wrong with synths and beats? It seems like you people that dislike this album dislike dance and \\"techno\\"...not the album. All EBTG has done is made use of new technology. There isn't anything wrong with that. Btw, none of these songs would be classified as techno, maybe one or two house tracks and a drum n bass track...but the rest wouldn't really be that dancey. The songs are great...catchy. Tracy Thorne's voice melds so well into the songs...especially in \\"Lullaby of Clubland.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is An Essential Need!","review":"Aside from Todd Terry's breakthrough remix of Everything But The Girl's \\"Missing\\" (which ended up becoming a huge dance hit back in 94) I owned and knew nothing else about EBTG. It wasn't until I got my hands on this AMAZING ALBUM that I truly understood the hype of Tempermental. I always knew that I'd enjoy this if I bought it but was unprepared for just how much. I've had it for about a month now and I already consider it to be one of my all-time favorite albums. I just love how the soulful longing of Tracy Thorn's brooding vocals (which sometimes remind me of Sade) blend in with such accordance to the club and trip-hop mixings of beat provider Ben Watt, who also handles the bass, guitar, keyboards and scratching. Even Deep Dish contributes to the more techno sounding \\"The Future Of The Future (Stay Gold)\\". So without further ado, I recommend this album as a quintessential need in everyone's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sneaky Dance Pop","review":"I've liked ETBG since Amplified Heart, but found this album a little bland on first listen. But it sneaks up on you like subtle spices. What sounds conventional at first reveals beautiful lyrical touches and interesting overtones. Less insistent on faddish drum 'n' bass than Walking Wounded, this album approaches dance music on its own terms. I recommend listening to it as background music for awhile ... pretty soon the Future of the Future or Hatfield 80 will start buzzing in your head. And pick up Ben Watt's fascinating memoir \\"patient\\" - essential reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a stupid piece of plastic, but...","review":"Works as advertised. Adds protection to lens, also reduces sun glare. It also looks cool. It's a lot larger in real life, however fits in reverse on my 70-300MM IS for easy storage. It's an expensive piece of plastic, but amazon had the best price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed with this hood","review":"I bought this canon hood, which cost me 40 dollars, and it is loose and lets light in the back. It shakes on the lens as I carry it around. Even though it does what it is intended to do, of all the Canon hoods I have this is the biggest rip off for the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but expensive!","review":"Nice lens hood but, expensive!Thin light plastic with a flock interior which is superior to flat black paint but, at $55 its very expensive.Also, makes a long lens even longer as will any hood on the 70-300mm lens.Another point to make is I don't often use the hood as I don't notice any difference with or without the hood. I have only used the 70-300mm lens a couple of times and saw no flares in the pictures without the hood. Nice flare control built into the lens!Conclusion: Probably a better hood than those cheap ones. Fits the lens perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"expensive lens hood","review":"This lens hood is a good product for which it is intended. It should cost half as much as it does, it was $40.00 and to me that is way over priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expensive but worth it!","review":"Unfortunately I ordered the wrong size in this item but it really is a must have for all lenses. They are pretty expensive for being made of plastic but they get rid of the \\"haze\\" that was a huge problem in my pictures so definitely worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lens Hood","review":"This is a great product. It is easy to install and remove. The coating inside the hood is excellent for preventing the flare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon Lens Hood for the Rebel XT","review":"Canon ET-65B Lens Hood for EF 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 IS and DO IS USM LensesSeems a little pricey until you see it up close and personel. The secure attachment and the finish ensure that it is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's the hood missing from your lens box...","review":"4 stars because it's $40 for a piece of plastic that should have been included with both of its intended lenses.Shame on your cheap ways, Canon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pros and Cons","review":"Pros:- Reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light.- Helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches.- Somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall. Better to break the hood than the front element.- Makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps keep others from carelessly walking in front of you.Cons:- Will increase lens movement in windy situations, kind of like a sail on a boat.- Takes up more room in your bag, even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens.- People take more notice of you, will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good design, bad materials","review":"I was deeply dissapointed in this lens hood. Given that the cost is about 10% of the cost of the lens for which it was intended (the 70-300 IS in this case) I expected it to be of stiff durable polycarbonate.-Positives-fulfills the basic function of a lens hood- prevents flare, etc.The bayonet locking system is excellent, much easier to deal with than scew-on type lens hoods.that's about it.-Negatives-The polycarbonate is so thin I half expect it to be translucent.The hood must be gripped by the base to remove it, as grippng the thin end of the hood may break it; or at least it feels like it may break it.Its very long. Especially on the 70-300 which is already a long lens, this makes a fully extended zoom about a foot long. That's pretty conspicuous.It's very overpriced vs. generic lenses ($50 vs. $5-10 for rubber or metal).I traded it in and went with a kalt rubber lens hood. 2 stars for the great bayonet design, but the rest of it is weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"lens hood","review":"It's a lens hood, what can you say -- but I do like that you can put it on the lens backward, so when you don't want to use it you don't need a place in your bag for it, and it also fits in the bag with the hood on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost 5 stars","review":"I received this 2 days after I ordered it and was amazed to get it so quickly in December. The clock is accurate so far and loud enough to wake anyone but not overly loud. It is simple to use except for the sliding tabs on both ends. They are hard to slide back and forth, difficult enough to break a finger nail, and its very narrow. I used manicure pusher to move them, a flat head screw driver could do it also I guess. It's about 4 inches long and very portable. If it wasn't for those ridiculous sliding levers, this would be a 5 star purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful during power outage","review":"We recently spent almost two weeks without electricity - had never used this before, but it certainly came in handy during the emergency. It isn't lit continuously, so the battery lasts a long time -but if you touch the large button you get light for a moment . The display is large enough that I could read it without my glasses, and the snooze button does work - I used it as a timer for my eye drops.It seems well made, and the case is sleek and compact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"This travel clock is small and reliable.

After opening and closing the clock a few times the ribbon cable that drives the display will crack which causes segments of the digits fail.

Portions of the digits simply stopped displaying. Do not waste your money on this clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead on Arrival--Bad Display","review":"The clock arrived with its \\"second time zone\\" LCD elements non-functioning and a cross-wiring of its time/date controls, making it impossibe to set the date.

Bulova--another classic brand gone bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"No quality control","review":"Loved the size, look and layout of this alarm when I received it. Too bad it didn't work!! Some of the spaces on the digital screen would not light up. Back it went. Thank you Amazon for making the return easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of junk","review":"This item is the worst piece of junk I have bought in a long time. I bought it for the alarm which would not work from the very start and additionally some of the numbers would only display as half (or less) characters which made them unreadable.

I refuse to invest anything more in this item by paying to have it shipped back to the company for repairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product!","review":"After returning 3 different clocks, I chose to keep this one.

I'm a BTS fan and have every BTS album. When people ask which is my favorite, I always reply: the one in my CD player now (which could be any). This album lacks the ingenuity of albums past and falls short of my expectations.

The songs stay in their little circle and never break out into more adventuresome rock. This band has never managed to capture their exciting live routine on disc (barring the live disc of course), and it's about time they did. You In Reverse is disappointing overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have been listening to BTS since 1998, have all their albums (most have been bought with much anticipation only to prove to let down) and have seen their shows multiple times. I have to say that everything post-Keep It Like A Secret has been a let down. Perfect from Now On is amazing in its range, layers, change of tempo, melody, musicianship, lyrics, etc... and this new album is lame in comparison. There is no question why Goin Against Your Mind was pre-released... it is the only song on the album that has any kind of substance to it. It hurts to say that, but it's quite true. Like most every act out there, success has brought about latent half-assedness. Don't buy into the media hype!I could say that this will be the last BTS album that I buy but I think it is safe to say it will be the last anyone will buy (with new material)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Built to Spill still going strong","review":"I have to say that I was a little skeptical that Built to Spill still had \\"it\\" before buying this album, given the 5 year layoff and the disappointment I had felt after buying their last album (Ancient Melodies...). However, I was very happily suprised to find that Doug and Co. have gone and put together a very solid album. Not their best work, but the songs are very tight.The quintessential aspects that originally drew me to BTS are stamped all over this album: guitar jamming, great muscianship, and their unique quirkiness. The album as a whole flows from song to song seamlessly and it keeps getting better with each listen. I could highlight favorites, but what's the point with BTS? Everyone has their own favorites.Get this album. You should definitely enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland, Unorganized","review":"I made a too-light decision to use this text for an informal logic part of an Introduction to Philosophy class. I thought, \\"Aren't all informal logic texts basically the same?\\" I hope that they aren't, because then they would all be like this one. There is no coherent organizational scheme. There are chapters with titles like \\"Incorrect Inference\\" -- which is to say, fallacies, which is the alleged topic of the entire book, and hence can hardly be set aside from the rest of the book. The lists of bad uses and fallacies are run together more or less at random. Some of the examples of fallacies aren't examples of fallacies, but the sort of thing that looks sort of like a fallacy but isn't. The examples are, in almost every case, wooden and unbelievable. And the writing is bland and dull. I regret the choice of text and can fairly strongly recommend that others avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring boo full of cliches","review":"This book is horrible. I learned nothing.

Everything comes in the package except for the batteries. We have the remote sensor mounted on our porch. The weather unit is in our living room (about 10 feet from the outdoor sensor). I had considered getting just a temp gauge but what I like about this is: outside temp, outside humidity, inside temp and inside humidity. It also includes a simple forecast section that basically displays an up arrow for improving weather and down arrow for worsting weather. So far fairly accurate. I am interested to find out how the batteries work outside in winter with very cold NH temperatures. That as yet to be determined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived Damaged","review":"In another review I lamented that this weather station is not for apartment dwellers since the remote sensor cannot fit in a window like other sensors.

The nanocube is great. If you use it correctly, you only syphon about 25% of the water out weekly for water changes...and if its done this way, this tank is awesome. It has three chambers in the back for filter media, heater, it has decent lighting...its all in one. A good tank if the owner knows aquariums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent mini-reef but not for new folks...","review":"Nano Cube, like the Cube Master and other similar all-in-one small environments are generally a good and inexpensive solution for a mini-reef/marine/fresh habitat. With that being said, there is one issue that potential buyers should consider before buying these types of tanks:The size and configuration allow a water quality problem to worsen very quickly.For the sake of what you'll be putting in the tank, please know ahead of time how to cycle a tank, have a reverse osmosis filter or access to RO water, and don't neglect learning to use the requisite test kit which you should have purchased for twice weekly, if not daily, monitoring. If you have any questions, there is a thriving mini-reef/fresh cube community which is a great place to get tips, learn from others mistakes, and look through the various modifications made to these systems by hobbiest's which lead to amazing results (i.e. converting filtration, herb habitats, etc)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful little tank for a freshwater planted aquarium","review":"Pros:- Beautiful curved glass.- Build quality and fitting is excellent. The fit and finish is wonderful.- Lots and lots of water circulation. Some people believe that the water circulation in the Nano-Cube Deluxe is fine for reefs but overkill for freshwater planted tanks. I disagree. It's a great tank for Cherry Shrimp...They love to play in the currents. For more sedate fish, just provide a big piece of driftwood or rock to break up the water flow in the tank.- Quiet pump and fans.Cons:- The \\"Moon Light\\" LEDs are dim to the point of uselessness.- The hood could stand to have a few more utility holes for additional CO2 or decorative bubble wall hoses.- Having a glass bottom is an unnecessary possible point-of-failure.- Terse, insufficient documentation for beginners. Most of your questions will be answered by other Nano-Cube owners on the web.Overall:A nice integrated system."},{"rating":"1","title":"More difficult than you think","review":"I have plenty of experience with freshwater and when I decided to make the jump to saltwater, this seemed like an ideal practice aquarium, I was wrong. First off it is very unwieldy and water just doesn't really like to go inside it or once there, come out. The filter is strong (when it actually works at all) for a tank that size and so is the lighting. I have had it for 4 months and I still can't put any fish in it because of the massive algae infestation that I had to get under control due to the excessivly strong lighting. 2 months later with the help of a lot of snails and hermit crabs the algae is now gone, but the filter has just died on me and is going to be a nightmare to replace. I'm sure that it will work great if I can get it to work properly, but I am really starting to wish that I just went with a traditional aquarium setup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Hassle","review":"I bought this tank from our local aquarium store when I decided to switch from my bettas to something a little more high maintenence. Despite my reservations about its weight (even empty), the tank seemed great at first -- built in filter, built in heater and light, great design.Then came time to do a full water change.When this batch of fish dies, I will be throwing this tank in the trash. It is too unwieldy to work with it at all. After siphoning the majority of the water from the tank, I tried to tip the tank to get the last of the water and to start scooping out the rocks. Not only was it hard to find a place to grip, the tank itself was almost too heavy to move, let alone tip and maneuver.My recommendation is to just by a normal tank and all the accessories.

The Malibu, California resident has worked with many of genre's greatest professionals. Her previous CD's I reviewed were highly recommended with Hilton receiving plenty of airplay. Her latest CD, \\"My Favorite Things\\" continues the formula she develops, mixing American standards to her original compositions and having musician extraordinaires such as Saxophonist, Eric Marienthal. Hilton does wonders on classics such as Jobim's, \\"Desafinado\\" The Gershwin brothers', \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me\\" and Paul Desmond's, \\"Take Five\\". Her latest original compositions are very good. \\"Seduction/remix\\" is clearly the best track on this CD with its soulful beats and nice sax playing. It's hard for me so say it, but there were a few misses on this CD. I wasn't sure about the track, \\"Midnight Sky\\". It seemed to out of place in the track selection.

I started with the original issue of this CD and had to get the Capital Nashville rerelease with it's two additional songs (including \\"I Breathe In, I Breathe Out\\"). The tempo of the music is perfect - kickin' country-rockers, and heart-tugging ballads. All of his radio-released singles are a great showing of what the entire disc contains. \\"The Safe Side\\" is one track definitely worth purchasing the entire collection for.

Overall, the appearance is superb and it looks very sharp as a \\"sport\\" watch and everyday watch; I am getting used to its smaller size and as long as I can tell the time without having to use my reading glasses, it was a good purchase and I would buy another Skagen product again from Amazon.F/Los Angeles"},{"rating":"2","title":"SKAGEN WATCH","review":"I HAD PREVIOUS PURCHASED A SKAGEN WATCH FOR MYSELF.

I thought I would not like the dial as I'm not always a fan of Mother of Pearl but I love it. The pinks and greens are subtle in most lights but in sunlight and florescent it shines more. Whats more, the dial is thin, maybe the about the thickness of of three nickels on top of one another but the base of the watch is the size of a dime and the dial is the size (diameter) of a nickel, so it tapers as it goes up making it even more light and thin feeling.

It certainly gave me pause in looking at my own life.All in all, it was an enjoyable read. I thought that the first chapter was absolutely hysterical.

It's not that they were of poor quality; rather, they were simply awkward to use, without any clear benefits. The problem for me was that I was unable to keep my arms stable as I swam with them. My arms moved either left or right (instead of down and back) during the strokes. After several fits and starts, I have decided to give up on using them, and plan to sell them soon. One additional point: I advise you to check with your pool to be sure that they allow such devices to be used in a public swimming area. Rules aside, it seems obvious to me that an accidental swipe with these against another swimmer's arms or legs could cause injury."},{"rating":"1","title":"They sent me 2 left-hand paddles","review":"They sent me the correct size. But they sent me two paddles for the left hand, so unless I've gone through life with a wrong understanding of basic physiology, I think these are useless to me. Don't have time to contact Amazon, ship the item back, wait for a new pair -- after all, online ordering is supposed to circumvent adding stress to your life -- so I've opted to just drive down to my local SportsAuthority and buy another pair. So yes, I can contact Amazon and see what the problem was, but it makes me wonder WHY DID SOMEONE OPEN THE PACKAGE in the first place?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Advise Against","review":"It is a good product but very over priced and your buying a brand. The challenge is they don't stand behind the brand. The straps will break (chlorine on rubber). They, unlike Tyr and other paddle companies don't support or sell replacement straps so you are stuck buying another set of paddles. Advise against."},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't get these again.","review":"The strap on my pair of this broke within 6 months of regular swimming. I called speedo, they do not sell the strap separately, so I have to get a whole new pair. It wore out quickly as well. I liked using them but I'm going to get another kind because I really don't feel like having to go through the hassle and expense of buying new hand fins frequently. It's also needlessly wasteful. They make replacement goggle straps, why not replacement hand straps?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great training tool!","review":"I love these paddles for several reasons. 1. the contour makes them easier to use and more comfortable. 2. the size options. I am a small woman and other paddles were too difficult to use because they came in one size and seemed to be sized for men. 3. they help build strength in addition to guiding your stroke. If I use these for a couple of hundred yards, the rest of my swim is so much better in terms of proper technique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great training aid","review":"I would definitely recommend this swim paddles to anyone who is learning swimming or trying to improve their stroke. The material is sturdy and the contour design makes it very comfortable to wear. It's a great training aid to improve freestyle stroke.

The war is the American War of Independence, and the drummer is a great physical comedian. This is a fun example of what can still be done today with the silent form of comedy. A great achievement at blending silent comedy with the color film form.Evidence of a Keaton and Laurel influence can be seen. I liked the way that the comedy storyline is interwoven with a dramatic war story. The choice of music is excellent and the period costumes and warfare are well translated to the small screen. There is no way to place this film correctly, it's a comedy but also a drama. It shows battle scenes that could be right out of D. W. Griffith or comedy scenes that could be right out of Keaton.

Expect guest appearances from R.L, Outlawz, K-Ci and JoJo, SKG and more. Disc 1 starts off with 'Ballad Of A Dead Soulja' which is an excellent song. Songs to look out for are: \\"Lil Homies\\", \\"Letter 2 My Unborn\\", \\"Breathin\\", \\"Until The End Of Time\\", \\"When Thugz Cry\\" and \\"Thug N U Thug N Me\\".Although not as good as 'All Eyez On Me', this 2 disc piece is great.

Two, the albums (pre-death) were what he wanted. He spent a hell of alot of time on them... AND THEY WERE ALL FINISHED. he didn't use demos.

This is just not for the die hards this cd is for anyone that enjoys music. Doesnt matter what type of music that you enjoy, anyone would like this cd in my opinion.

I am a big 2Pac fan and I wouldn't expect a poor album like this from him, or from anyone else, for that matter. All of the songs are about ghetto struggles, about his (fake) death, or about his dead homies. There are no party songs like \\"I Get Around\\" (which still isn't a lot compared to today's Nelly with \\"Ride Wit Me\\")and there aren't any of those good old joints that diss Bad Boy Records and Pac's enemies, like in \\"Hit 'Em Up\\". There's nothing on this album like \\"Picture Me Rollin'\\", \\"All About U\\", or any of the other old or new favorites. This is a truly dissapointing album.

The emphatic all out track demostrates the various levels this artist is able to reach, while still maintaining the entertainment value.

Rap enthusiasts, but not particularly huge Pac fans, would probably give this album a 4 star rating. It's from 2Pac's Makaveli period (the last period of his life, immediatly proceeding his release from jail via a bail payed-up by Death Row Records, and is a notably angry period of his life), but is actually surprisingly emotional, at times. Until the End of Time (the track/single) may leave some of 'Pac's hardest fan's slightly misty-eyed. Some other particularly notable tracks are All Out, Ballad of a Dead Soulja, and Words 2 My First Born, but the whole album is hot. My only disappointments are the presence of some many re-mixes of songs already on the album (in other words, quite a few songs appear twice on the record, just 2 slightly different version).

Letter 2 My Unborn is truly amazing in particular...the Liberian Girl sample fits well with the song and Shakur's lyrics. Some of the tracks should have been untouched such as When Thugz Cry and Words 2 My First Born b/c I have heard the OG from the Makaveli bootlegs and those beats fit well with the tracks.

No, I wouldn't even dream of buying it. Basically, to sum it up, anything set that places work by Bessie Smith and Louis Armstrong next to the \\"work\\" of Will Smith or Mariah Carrey is an abomination that must be scorned at all costs. By placing art beside garbage, the attempt is to elevate the garbage, but the result is that it defames the art. The existence of this set insults me. I could just see the vapid Sony Music suits pieceing together this monstrosity--- This set, in a word, disgusts me. By placing the sublime beside the profane, Sony has insulted serious music fans everywhere. At best, this could serve as a thesis about the Kamikaze-decline of popular music over the years.

Nancy Wilson takes her turn singing covers from the 60s and 70s. But unlike those pop divas, Wilson creates much noise without much feeling. She wails loudy on numerous selections as she attempts to emote love lost. It's clear halfway through this disc that Wilson is more comfortable with her jazz influenced roots than getting down doing Spinning Wheel. She does offer a nice take on Sunny, but it's one good selection out of 20. Even her Dusty Springfield covers, make you pine for the real thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classics","review":"This is well over 2 hours of classic broadway.

Personally the book was horribly written and if you ask me if he really cared for his wife and children and might I add, he didn't, he should have never went on those affairs. I can say I met alot of men in my life and alot of them acted very immature, but in Gary Rohr's case its more like he is having a identity crisis and more so living his life then than now. Its almost as if he just really didn't love his wife and simply just settled with, should I say second best. All and all I recommend to anyone that comes across this book, don't waste your time, you would be better off reading a children's book, like \\"Harry Potter\\", at least you could say that, its worth reading, so if I had a choice to rate the book I would give it a negative 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leslie","review":"The book centered on a lying, cheating husband, that was constantly unfaithful to his devoted wife. He did not have the courage to tell her about the other woman, he so secretly had a passion for all those years. Since this was based on a true story, I can't imagine how his wife would feel, especially living under the same roof with this man. I feel sorry for her and wish her well in the future. The details about his sex life and secret meetings with Leslie were astonishing cosidering the fact, he was still living wih his wife. Debbie in the book would be better off getting rid of this jerk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"I was so excited when ordering these. They sounded so great and had high hopes. They were completely dashed when they arrived. These are disgusting. My husband who will eat almost anything, would not touch them after only one bite.

We gave the case to a food kitchen (poor them)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer clear","review":"The best advice I can give is to try before you buy. Get a small package from a grocery store so you won't have an entire case of something that's hard to palate.The concept sounded awesome - a crunchy snack made from just plain cheese and spices. The execution, however, is lacking.These are DRY. Perhaps it's the lack of moisture, or maybe it's the salt - but these make you thirsty fast. There is not much barbeque flavor to them - and it seems a bit off from standard BBQ.Now I'm just hoping to find one of my friends or family members to take 11 more packages off my hands so they don't have to be thrown out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"While this book stands on its own a fine, inticrately-plotted mystery story, what really grabbed me was all the time Margaret Millar took in creating all of its characters. It was pure joy to read about each one, and how their individual characters fit into the story, each one rendered with great detail and humorous background. Millar's biting sense of humor is not to be outdone anywhere. I laughed out loud several times while reading this, as Millar could obviously be quite playful with her characters while telling a serious story. A mystery in the hands of an expert storyteller.

But it is nothing more than a rip-off from the 'INTERNET MOVIE DATABASE', without a doubt the best and most comprehensive movie site on internet. All Givens did was rewriting facts and fun things found from the Internet Movie Database, and put it in a book.

Falls apart quickly, and not worth finishing. It is pedantic, silly, even fails as a fable. Not even the descriptions of London provide any redeemable moments. The characters are cartoonish, the plot (such as it is) thoroughly stupid. This book is an embarrassment"},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment.....","review":"After the brilliance of Borderliners, Smilla's Sense of Snow, and The History of Danish Dreams, this novel was a genuine shock. None of the incisive social commentary or fascinating characterization which made me a Peter Hoeg fan were present in this novel. I found the story strained, inconsistent, and frankly, amateurish.I really suspect that this novel is an earlier effort, previously unpublished (for good reason). The fact that the royalties from the novel are being used to support the \\"Lolwe\\" Foundation established by the author may account more for it's publication than any literary merit it might possess. (Don't get me wrong, I eagerly await Mr. Hoeg's next effort .. I only hope it will be more like the earlier novels than this one..)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Intelligent, but distant","review":"I came away from this book with a distinct sense of apathy. It is certainly beautifuly written, elegant, in fact, but it is like a statue...it can be beautiful and very cold at the same time. The ideas about human/animal interaction in the novel were excellent and the characters were intresting, but the experiences presented were by no means fulfilling or emotional. Read it only if you want to feel distant from what you are reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A spectacular failure","review":"I picked this book up on a whim and kept with it because I wanted to see if somehow Hoeg could save an incredibly improbable story by the end. He did not, nor did he even come near. Throughout the book I never came close to suspending my disbelief, which in turn meant that I viewed the story as a very odd curiousity rather than a novel. My hat is off to Hoeg for being unafraid of trying to pull off a plot line that, if he had succeeded, would have demonstrated an amazing writing ability. Alas, he did not, and though his prose is highly skilled, one is left at the end feeling quite unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Strangest Story Ever Told...","review":"I have to say this was by far weirdest book I've ever read...I have to agree with some on here who say it's satirical and fable-like--it very much reminded me of a fairy tale--a woman in love with an ape, when really we're surrounded by apes who are highly refined and intelligent and we're all living in a farce of a society...? I can't say that it was poorly written--the author obviously can spin a tale from nearly nothing. I'm only giving it 2 stars because I really just didn't like the story and although it wasn't predictable it also wasn't very interesting. At one point I felt like I was reading a really bad soap opera...almost like when One Life to Live had the underground city of Eterna...of topic...anyway honestly if you're looking for a good book and you have limited time--put this one down and find something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"touching somewhere deep inside","review":"this book does indeed touch somewhere deep inside. the novel is not interested in realitiy, in the stiching together of plot. Hoeg presents us with a story that moves between paralells and allows us to dream and purge at the same time. he allows humour and eroticism to take the place of plot and story. i like madeline and her test tube and samson and the dog. they all represent some deep flaw in our humanness. this book provoked and moved. and turned me on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time & money","review":"I have been taking this product for a little over a month. 3 times a day is not worth it.

Period.","review":"I ordered this product a while ago; I took about 2 months of it and never saw results. I was willing to be patient but started thinking about how this product works. Breast tissue is quite simple - it's made up of fat, milk ducts, and some muscle tissue. Unless this product swells the milk ducts (which would cause unwanted lactation) it increases cellular reproduction. Keep in mind this product is not FDA approved or approved by any reliable source. By unnaturally increasing cellular reproduction you risk the productions of mutated cells a.k.a. cancer cells. I'm not sure about the rest of you ladies but breast cancer is problematic enough - I don't need breast enhancement pills to increase my risks. Maybe it's a stretch but just remember this product has not been proven safe; and according to the bottle, you need to take relatively large amounts to see results. For me, it just wasn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"all the positve reviews are fake","review":"Look at the other reviews with 4 or 5 stars. Look at the dates.

I was hoping to go from a small B to a solid C and I am in my fourth month and have seen an improvement in my breasts. They havnt necessarily gotten bigger, but they have filled out. I gave the product four stars because of the fact I havnt gone up a cup size yet. They have made me firmer and fuller so overall, I am happy with the results. Hopefully a few more months will give the results I am looking for.A note on the change the pills had on my periods... I used to get such bad cramps that I'd be bed ridden for a day each month. Even doctor-prescribed pain killers didnt help with my cramps. Since taking the breast success, I barely have cramps at all. It is rare now that I feel so awful from cramps. Some months, I dont feel ANY cramping! if anything, I'll continue to take the pills just to help with cramping."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"this product is effective for anyone who wants to enhance. people who take prescription meds may not get results because the herbal content will be blocked. the pills work for me because i dont take any meds or constant over the counter meds. the pills helped me increase by a whole cup size."},{"rating":"1","title":"more info please","review":"I won't buy any supplement w/out first seeing a complete list of ingredients and hopefully a more developed Product Description, of which this product offers neither.

The worst moment has to be 'Sleep Now In The Fire', where a man with a whiny voice sings the words in one note and strums his guitar like he was born yesterday.To those people who are in any way interested, listen to the clips and take it no further, cos this is robbery.

I enjoyed this read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thurman surpasses Nietzsche & Jung in perspectives","review":"This book took my mind-set and framed it in a much broader paradigm. A Weltanschauung of apercus ranging from quantum physics to a proliferation of \\"Buddhaverses\\" inside our own minds and pervading the external world. A must read for all thoughtful people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Message is we should all be Democrats and be saved.","review":"Thurman tries to cover too much theoretical ground and then concludes that he is a Libertarian-not even close to that. His message for success sounds like it was taken from the Democratic party convention platform and this was some unusual great insight. FDR lives. Welfare will save us. Very dissapointing book. Not worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Building a Bridge from America to Tibet","review":"Robert Thurman, being the first Westerner to be ordained as a Tibetan monk, has precedent to speak about eastern philosophy like no other American. That said, when I was looking for a connection between eastern philosophy and the world that I live in, Thurman seemed like the best ambassador. This book is largely a history lesson of the last 2,000 years of buddhist philosophy and its stark contrast to its materialistic counterpart lifestyle (capitolism). You're likely to read a lot of hugely profound things in this book, and learn a lot about the history of buddhism from Asoka to Shakyamuni. What I liked best about this book was Thurmans ability to deftly jump from practical contemporary literature to illuminating thousands of years of tradition. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Road to Enlightenment","review":"Travelling inward is not an easy task. The road to understanding spirituality and its \\"modern\\" application has sparked a mass of simplistic, superficial books and the creation of the \\"Religion and Spirituality\\" genre. Robert Thurman's Inner Revolution challenges us and the confines of the society we live in today by recounting Tibetan Buddhism and its practice and by giving us insight into Tibetan Buddhist history and development, allows us to reach a deeeper understanding of our own spirituality.Cheers to his thoughts and many blessings to the greater being that has allowed this westerner to come into the light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob Thurman hits points that cause deep reflection","review":"Bob Thurman is such a treasure in the literature of modern Buddhism that we shall probably wait until he's gone before we take notice. 'Revolution' speaks of his 'Cold' revolution theories and how little we realize about what we can actually attain as Buddhists, Americans ...people. The indexed entries at the rear of the book are so thought provoking they require an intensive solitude to digest them and find how applicable each one is in our own lives. More wonderful work from a truly understanding buddhist scholar of our time. The audio lectures that coincide with the book are a great supplement and ease the retention of the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gary - Bi-Focal Sunglasses","review":"Functional but NOT fashionable.

It's an excellent book. This one is mostly bad, punctuated with some good tips. The newer edition may be better as it includes some new thoughts and ideas. But theyre not in this edition. And this is the one youre considering. I have 2 problems with this edition: It's mostly quotes of other writer's stuff, AND Cheney's own writing never quite grabs your attention.

But Cheney can be excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful","review":"This version of THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ pleases children of all ages.

Michelle Trachtenberg (Dorothy), Phyllis Diller (Wicked Witch of the West), Rene Auberjonois (Scarecrow), Nester Serrano (Tin Man) and Robert Guillaume (Lion) and the rest of the cast are perfect in the characterizations. This is the closet version to L. Frank Baum's book you are likely to find anywhere. This album is fully acted with no narration (like a lot of OZ audiobooks). You will enjoy this version many, many times just as the 1939 film."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Great Physique Photographers","review":"Fred Kovert was one of the best early physique photographers from the 40's and 50's. Little is known of him today or appreciated. This book of nude young men shows his unique ability to show off his models with beautiful lighting set against studio objects. His attention to detail shows great sophistication. The photos are so clear and full of life. Its a shame he faced so much opposition from the authorities and so many raids on his work. In the end he committed suicide in 1950, his mental health was affected so much.A beautiful book from a great photographer. It would be nice if there was more of his work to see and be published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original Sun Recordings","review":"This is 2 albums on one cd.

Working with his wife Diane, he has watered down his music to the point of sounding like Yanni. The first song of this disc, \\"New Day\\" is the only keeper of the bunch. I can hear Arkenstone repeating phrases from his old music. This is a real disappointment considering he was once one of my favorite artists in this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arkenstone at His Best","review":"I'm a big fan of David Arkenstone, and have several of his CD's. My favorites are \\"Music Inspired by Middle Earth\\", and \\"Atlantis, A Symphonic Journey\\", but I enjoy all 8 in my library. (For reasons I can't really pinpoint, the one I like the least is \\"Echoes of Egypt\\" with Diane Arkenstone.) Santa sent me \\"Sketches from An American Journey\\" after he saw it on my wishlist. I live in the West and have driven through it extensively over the years, and this music evokes in particular that magnificent part of the country. I think he's a very talented musician and \\"Sketches from An American Journey\\" is everything I've come to expect from David Arkenstone at his best. If you're a fan, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"I find Sketches From an American Journey to be an enjoyable album. While perhaps not David's greatest work, the album's tracks are quite listenable and reflect his distinctive style and creativity. The music is full, the orchestrations intricate, and the tracks fully produced. This album has a bit less of the adventurish spirit of David's earlier works, and is a bit \\"quieter\\" at times, but it is definitely a mature work what rises above some of his recent soundtrack-like, background atmosphere efforts. While I've been somewhat disappointed by a few of David's recent CDs, I would easily recommend this album to fans as a fine new addition to their Arkenstone library."},{"rating":"2","title":"An album worth buying!!!!","review":"I just recently bought this album about 3 weeks ago and was really excited to listen to it.

Reason Being is because it makes me want to get up and do celtic dances. This album is great!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"On Composing Music","review":"This book is full of small exercises for getting the beginnner to start composing. Covers most of the techniques a composer will want to know without giving you a headache. However, the scope of the book doesn't cover where and how to use some of the techniques. Though not methodical toward composing mature pieces, overall the book is highly educational for those with a background of half a year of college piano or theory class. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful approach","review":"I found this book a wonderful text. I was afraid that it was going to start to simply, and it did.

Selena doesn't want to be a hero, though - just a normal person. But can she escape fate? This was a disappointing book from the Nightmare Room series. The story just wasn't very interesting.

I swear to you, this device does not work. I bought this to help me monitor the cycling of my newest tank and I knew my tank had high ammonia just from looking at the tank and the little disk in the middle of this test was white (lighter than the yellow \\"safe\\" color). I poured tons of food into the tank hoping to get ammonia to rise...I then poured pure ammonia into the tank and this test DID NOT CHANGE AT ALL.

In both tanks, it continually reported safe water conditions. One tank was new and the water had to go through its cycle process. When I tested the tanks using a chemistry test, the new tank was dangerously high and the established tank readings were just a little high. At the time of these tests these alert products were reporting safe water conditions.I have also tested my water with other ammonia test strips as well as liquid chemical tests.

Normally I dont work this way and it lulled me into a false sense of security that my tank had cycled faster than normal when the ammonia alert never indicated any ammonia in my tank and I went on to purchase a few more fish - a few more days and no ammonia - great - a few more fish and then disaster strick - the fish started acting as though they had ammonia poisening. I took my water to have it tested. 6.0 mg/L and NOTHING showed on this alert - it was still yellow.If you value your fish (and your sanity) just test your water and dont take short cuts.This product does not work - I only lost 3 fish - but that was 3 fish too many and Im sure they would have preferred that I had tested the water and not relied on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap SH**","review":"DOES.

I, panicked, kept constantly changing 25% of the water and after a few days of this with no change in the reading I decided to bring out my strips and use those. Sure enough my water quality wasn't lacking and is just fine. So I wouldn't trust this product.

These toys are not styled after Disney's version of Winnie the Pooh, but of the original illustrations by Earnest Shepard in the classic books. It's good that finally someone thought of sticking to the original and not to Disney's perspective. The only thing I am not happy about is that they didn't make an Owl, rabbit, kanga or roo.

This vacuum requires no bags and I could not believe that I had filled up the entire unit after the first time I used it. Our Golden Retriever is a little beauty but sheds like crazy. This vacuum really picks it up and is easy to clean and store. I also like the different attachments that allow me to vacuum in tight areas, different than my previous vacuum. The only downside so far is that it is not as quiet as it was advertised. There is a \\"hush\\" button that really does not make a big difference compared to the normal cycle.

In addition to these very serious difficulties, the hose attachment does not stay secured in it's \\"place\\" which means you constantly have to stoop and replace it.

I can even smell the difference in the air (less dusty after vacuuming). For me, the cord isnt long enough, but that may be because I live in a ranch house. I agree with the others about cleaning out the canister, it can get very messy! I try to empy the most of it in the garbage can and then take it outside to tap it out the rest of the way. I havent tried to clean the filter yet. They say you can rinse it out and let it dry...we'll see.

The hose comes off repeatedly to the point where I finally taped it to the vacuum.

My configuration only has a 3-wire setup and without the neutral wire, the timer won't work.

They all work great, installation was simple. I am an electrician so installation might be a little more of a challenge for your average homeowner. These units REQUIRE A NEUTRAL so check before you order to make sure the neutral is in the box. The units are quite large so they are a tight fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, even with CFL","review":"I highly recommend this product. We have them in the bathroom (shower light), pantry, closets and bedrooms. Anyplace people have a habit of not turning off the lights. Works great, even with CFL (no flicker). Saves hot water in the shower by letting them know, \\"you've been in there long enough.\\" Saves electricty by turning off lights that always seem to be on. Easy to install, no problems here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works exactly as described","review":"I already had a 5-10-15-30 minute version of this timer and the 60 minutes one works just as well. It helps keep the bathroom ventilated without worrying about leaving the fan on all day long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of New Age/Ethno-Music in Present Time","review":",Karma\` is a valuable example of soundtrack-music without a clip. Perfect mind-music! Wonderful, magnificent melodies combined with pure sounds of nature and ethnic vocals like african-choir. A thrilling musical adventure from africa to asia. This music lives!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Karma","review":"As a Mars Laser fan I did not like one thing about \\"Karma\\". I am fond of \\"Escape\\" and \\"Sapphire Dreams\\" and this is totally unlike either of those.There was nothing melodic about this disc other than band four\\"enchanted\\". I found the rest of the album to be unsettling,disquieting and non-harmonious. The album is supposed to be an interpretation of one's own karma and I would hate to think that this is representative of my karma.The album uses synthesizer,percussion and chant and is characteristic of Africa and other distant cultures. Since Mars Laser is considered a visionary producer and conceptionalist, this album is actually an exceptional representation of his greatly diverse talent. Even tho I did not like it,I am sure there are others who will disagree with me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Dog ROCKS!","review":"I picked up my first copy of Modern Dog recently and I LOVE it! The style, the photos, even the ads are all exceptional. I have never bought a dog magazine before because, in my opinion, they have not been very appealing to me. BUt Modern Dog has that edge to it - very cool and very well written. Thank \\"DOG\\" somebody finally published something that is just perfect for me and my dog. I highly recommend that you check out this magazine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the small dog owner!","review":"Modern Dog magazine is especially perfect for those who own small dogs and/or live in urban areas. The magazine is well-written, full of timely articles, and includes ads from unique merchants. I have a Lab and two Boston Terriers so I feel that I am included in their target audience; however, this magazine does include something for everyone who has a dog and wants the best for it, even if it isn't a smaller dog. I like how edgy the magazine is and this is why I think it's more tailored for urban dwellers."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this magazine!","review":"This magazine is the perfect blend of information and fun. Even the ads are enjoyable to read. From the recipes for cooking for your dog to the featured rescue dogs, who are groomed and pampered before their photo shoot, the whole magazine is a good read for dog lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"emmitts granny","review":"Book is so-so. It doesn't tell you the dogs breed. Photography good. Most celebrities chosen somewhat anonymous to me.Many, many Labs. If you're in love with that breed you'll enjoy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"just fine","review":"it's a battery. it was cheap and it arrived quickly. i put it in my car remote and it works. what else more can i say?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't remember this one","review":"I should have written this review sooner. I can't remember when or why I bought the battery. But, I can't remember having a problem with it, so I guess it worked as expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"died in a matter of weeks","review":"I used this battery in my scale and it died in a matter of weeks. The prior battery lasted for a year. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died within a month","review":"This initially worked, but died within the month (used in a bathroom scale). The original battery had lasted 4 years. Assuming batteries bought from this supplier, or through Amazon in general, are probably older and inventory is not checked for quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"These batteries Do Not Work!","review":"These batteries did not work for me. I do believe that they must have been sitting around for some years because they had very little charge to them. Not one worked for more then a few minutes. I had to purchase from another place and they (at the other place) had the expiration date clearly marked on them. They also worked without a hitch. When a battery doesn't work on a product such as 3D glasses, it's more then unfortunate. It's mis-leading and can become fretful. I was concerned that a 150.00 pair of 3D glasses were defective. No battery should be sold without a clearly marked expiration date and without it being tested if they've been left to sit around so long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not last more than a 15 days.","review":"It arrived fast, but the battery did not last as long as it should. It was waste of my time and money"},{"rating":"2","title":"works like a charm","review":"no complaints, cheapest individual packaged battery of this kind I could find, besides maybe the energizer ones. I'd recommend this battery for certain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Computer motherboard battery inexpensive, easy to install","review":"Battery was very reasonably priced and easy to install.

A month later, the tester didn;t work. I checked the battery with my voltmeter. 1.76 volts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal","review":"Got this through Amazon. Original packaging as if I got it at the local store. Great price! Works as expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Delivery!!","review":"The battery came within 2 days so I was really happy about that. I just needed it for my body fat measurement scale because the other battery was dying. Not much to say about it, it's a battery and it's working. I'll update if I notice that it dies any faster than the previous battery, but for now I'm happy with my purchase, the price and the super quick delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely not \\"New\\"","review":"I was recommended this book by several people, and due to the low cost and having an Amazon Prime Membership, I figured it would be worth purchasing. Received the book in 1 day (sweet, right?), and overall the book seems OK. However, the book is obviously not in \\"new\\" condition, having minor scrapes, bruises, and scratches all over the cover. Material inside the book seems good, however I was hoping for something a bit more graduate-level, and this is definitely and undergraduate level textbook.Overall, great book, and an OK buy. This is what happens when you get a Prime Membership and decide to buy everything from Amazon, not always the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a 2004 Price guide?","review":"How can a book published in 2002 be a 2004 price guide. Give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"Unlike the rest of you, I wanted the shiny copper look that is pictured. I cannot believe they could send something so totally different in color. They are brown with no semblance of copper color that I can see, definitely bronze. But I have to ask myself why? It seems so many of the things I order anymore are not as pictured. I can't use them and yet, it isn't worth sending them back. So in closing let me say, if you are hoping for the gorgeous shiny copper color pictured, forget it. That is not what you are going to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"doen't run on newer systems","review":"Wish I had been made aware that this game would not work on my newer computer.
